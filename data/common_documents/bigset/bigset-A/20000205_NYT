COCKPIT TAPES REVEAL LOUD BANGS BEFORE ALASKA CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   With ALASKA-CRASH-TIMES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ About a minute before Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 plunged into the Pacific Ocean last Monday with the loss
of all 88 people aboard, the cockpit voice recorder picked up the
sound of a loud noise, after which the plane appeared to go out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   The noise was one of two heard on the twin-engine MD-83 jet
during its last dozen or so minutes of flight, the National
Transportation Safety Board disclosed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators refused to speculate on what the sounds might have
been, but one aviation expert cautioned it does not necessarily
indicate that a catastrophic event occurred, though he said it is a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were battling a jammed stabilizer, a condition that
was causing the plane to pitch sharply nose-down. The stabilizer is
the wing-like structure on top of the MD-83 tail that is trimmed in
flight to keep the plane's nose from pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
   A retired airline pilot who has flown a similar McDonnell
Douglas plane told the Post-Intelligencer the two bangs were most
likely an engine compressor stall. This can occur on a commercial
jetliner when the air flow through a jet engine is disrupted,
usually because the plane is making extreme maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be consistent with what was happening on the
Alaska Airlines plane during its last 12 minutes of flight, when
the pilots reported serious control problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a compressor stall, it will sound like the whole
tail blew off,'' said Dan Gellert of Sequim, Wash., a retired
Eastern Airlines pilot. ``Everybody on the plane would hear a
compressor stall.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83's engines are mounted on the rear fuselage, rather
than on the wing, which would make a compressor stall sound much
louder in the plane's cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The latest details about what is on the recorder tape were
announced here by NTSB member John Hammerschmidt, who has held
daily press briefings on the crash.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the cockpit voice recorder tape, Hammerschmidt
said, the pilots were discussing the stabilizer problem with Alaska
maintenance personnel in Seattle and then in Los Angeles, where the
plane had been diverted for an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 minutes before the end of the recording, the plane
experienced an apparent loss of vertical control, meaning the plane
was essentially falling out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said the crew recovered control in about 90
seconds, after which a flight attendant told the pilots she had
heard a loud noise from the rear of the jet. The crew told her they
had also heard the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt would not say if the attendant had entered the
cockpit or spoke to the crew over the intercom.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder also captured the sound of a second loud noise just
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slightly more than one minute before the end of the recording,
a loud noise can be heard on the recording and the airplane appears
to go out of control,'' Hammerschmidt said. ``No stall warning was
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   An alarm sounds in the cockpit if the wings lose lift, or stall.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt refused to speculate on the meaning of the
recorder data. Nor would he comment on the sequence of the events
in relationship with other information disclosed by investigators
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was on its way from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to
Seattle, with a scheduled stop in San Francisco. Fifty of the
passengers killed in the crash were from Seattle, including the
three flight attendants. It was commanded by Capt. Ted Thompson,
53. The first officer was William Tansky, 57. Thompson and Tansky
were veteran pilots with several thousand hours flying the
MD-80-series jet.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators previously said the last routine transmission with
Flight 261 was at 3:55 p.m. Monday, when air traffic control
cleared the plane to continue flying at 31,000 feet to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, at 4:10 p.m., the crew gave the first
report of a problem _ they radioed they were having difficulty
controlling the plane and had descended through 26,000 feet. A few
seconds later they said they were at 23,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said the plane disappeared from radar at 4:21
p.m, or about 12 minutes after the plane suddenly dropped nearly a
mile from its assigned cruising altitude.
</P>
<P>
   At about that time, the voice recorder indicates a loss of
vertical control. Recovering from it took more than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had previously said that about a minute after
their first report of a problem, the crew reported some success in
stabilizing the plane and were going to troubleshoot the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said they had several questions about the
sequence of events around the time of the first loud noise reported
by the flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   From Hammerschmidt's description, it is not clear if the loud
noise occurred before or after the crew lost control, only that it
was reported by the attendant after the crew regained control. It's
possible, experts said, the attendant would not have been able to
get to the flight deck or even talk over the intercom if the plane
was falling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   If the noise triggered the loss of control, that suggests
something much worse than a compressor stall, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case, the loud bang most likely means some piece of
structure, perhaps the stabilizer, hitting another piece of
structure,'' said Chuck Eastlake, an aeronautical engineering
professor at Embry-Riddle University in Florida who teaches
aircraft stability and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of many possibilities. The pieces of structure are
mostly hollow aluminum. So when they bang around they make a lot of
noise, even on little airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the plane's flight data recorder, which monitors
engines and other systems, will likely tell investigators if the
bangs were the result of an engine compressor stall or something
much worse.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis did not begin until Friday, and the safety board
is not expected to announce any findings until Monday at the
board's headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Additional clues will come from examination of the wreckage,
especially the cockpit and the tail section. But nothing will be
raised until the Navy completes mapping of the debris field,
Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of the tail and the stabilizer have been spotted in the
debris field, which is mostly confined to an area on the ocean
floor about the size of a football field, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The small wreckage area is consistent with witness accounts that
the plane went nearly straight into the water.

<HEADLINE>
SENATE'S BANKRUPTCY BILL FULL OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, EXPERTS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stan Lentz, who has spent 20 years in the trenches of bankruptcy
law, was little impressed this week with the U.S. Senate's sweeping
proposal to revamp the nation's huge bankruptcy system.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was ready to spit. ``That's incredible,'' said Lentz
of Overland Park. ``It's just pure stupidity. What are they
thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Lentz isn't alone. Attorneys, judges and bankruptcy trustees in
Kansas City and around the country called the Senate bill a flawed
measure riddled with unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   They said if the bill became law it would add more costs,
require more work and create more inequities for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the flaws veterans cite are a new favored status given to
the auto finance industry, less protection for child-support
payments and the elimination of Kansas' liberal homestead law.
</P>
<P>
   And the credit card lobby, which pushed the hardest for changes,
may have gained little _ or even lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which must be reconciled with related House
legislation in a conference committee, passed the Senate 83-14.
Afterward, U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who
co-sponsored the bill, said the bill closed ``the loopholes that
let big spenders walk away from debts'' and updated the code ``to
achieve a healthier balance between consumers and creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yingling, executive director of government relations for
the American Bankers Association, said it ``would repair the flawed
bankruptcy system by requiring wealthier debtors to repay what they
can afford while preserving the bankruptcy safety net for others.''
</P>
<P>
   But bankruptcy veterans don't see the 330-page bill that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly crazy,'' said Joel Pelofsky, the U.S. bankruptcy
trustee in Kansas City, ``because it doesn't do what it set out to
do.''  &LR; brk:Auto loan advantage
</P>
<P>
   Consider the new provision favoring the auto industry. Currently
when a debtor files for bankruptcy, the trustee reduces the value
of a debtor's car to its probable resale value, usually much less
than the debtor's purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new bill, the trustee would be required to value the
car at its original loan value. Depending on the car, the
difference could be $10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bank or car loan company is a secured creditor,
because the debtor's loan is secured by the vehicle. Under
bankruptcy law, secured creditors get higher priority than credit
card and medical debts, which are not secured by any collateral.
</P>
<P>
   And because the new bankruptcy bill allows the car loan to eat
up a larger share of the debtor's estate, there is less money
available to share among the unsecured creditors, including the
credit card companies that pushed to tighten the laws so they would
salvage more money out of a bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Child support
</P>
<P>
   Women and children also may fare worse under this bill, even
though senators lauded it for giving child-support claims the
highest priority in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that child-support claims now rate a higher
priority than the fees paid to the bankruptcy trustee. Trustees
make most of their income by taking a commission off any assets
they recover and sell to pay off creditors. The way the current law
is written, trustees not only don't have any incentive to recover
money to pay child-support claims, they also can't get reimbursed
for their expenses in hunting for them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new bill, the trustee ``would be forced to work for
nothing,'' said Robert Berger, an Overland Park bankruptcy
attorney. ``If he can't compensate himself, then he can't
administer the estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The twist in the bill may have been unintended, said G. Ray
Warner, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas
City Law School, but it reflects a hodgepodge of measures thrown
together quickly to ``obtain the maximum recovery for creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating a cruel world for the poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Reutter, a researcher at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign and editor of the Bankruptcy Law Letter, also said
he had found flaws in the bill that forced women and children to
``compete with the credit industry'' to collect from deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Shrinking homestead
</P>
<P>
   Another twist in the law would do away with the unlimited Kansas
homestead exemption, which has protected residences and farms of
debtors in bankruptcy since Kansas became a state.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Kansans have a 100 percent exemption for city
residences on one acre of land or less and for family farms on 160
acres or less. Under the new bill, the maximum exemption would be
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   This could affect Kansas farms that have been passed down from
one family member to another and for elderly residents in the
Johnson County area whose homes have appreciated in value above
$100,000. Should they suffer severe setbacks, they could lose their
farms and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys also say that many entrepreneurs who have started a
business have been advised to move to Johnson County because many
of their assets can be protected in their house. The change in the
bankruptcy law could also end that.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed elimination of the exemption prompted Sen. Sam
Brownback, a Kansas Republican, to vote against the bill after
supporting it for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I believe we should prevent fraud and abuse of our
bankruptcy system, pre-empting state homestead laws and imposing a
one-size-fits-all approach is not the answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Missouri may gain nothing. Its homestead exemption
now is $8,000. But that would apparently not increase, because the
wording of the provision only creates a ceiling _ it doesn't raise
state homesteads that are already less than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Higher costs
</P>
<P>
   Trying to decipher the new provisions is going to add weighty
costs to the system, the bankruptcy veterans say. There will be new
requirements for the filing of back tax schedules, more disclosure
statements and more administration by judges and trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of filing and administering a bankruptcy are sure to
increase, said Rick Fink, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee in Kansas
City. And those costs could push some people from less-severe
repayment proceedings, under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code,
into a full-scale Chapter 7 proceeding, the very thing the new bill
is meant to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hildebrand, legislative chairman of the National
Association of Chapter 13 Trustees, said his organization had
estimated that under the new bill, 21 percent of the people now in
Chapter 13 would end up in Chapter 7.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure. Bankruptcy attorneys don't plan to suffer.
They see the proposed law as a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's misguided,'' Lentz said. ``It will create
roadblocks and barriers. But we will be creative. We will find the
best way to represent our clients and protect their money.''

NURSING HOME OPERATOR'S BANKRUPTCY POINTS UP INDUSTRY'S FRAGILITY 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES and JULIUS A. KARASH  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing of another nationwide nursing home
operator this week points up the increasing fragility of an
industry reeling from Medicare cuts, loads of debt and heightened
Justice Department scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated Health Services Inc., which sought Chapter 11
protection in Delaware on Wednesday operates five facilities in the
Kansas City area with a total of 586 beds, or about 5 percent of
all the beds in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the seventh big provider to seek bankruptcy
protection in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles resident David Schafer said he was disturbed when
his lawyer called Friday and informed him of the Integrated Health
Services bankruptcy. His mother, 84-year-old Alma Schafer, has
lived in Alpine North nursing home in Riverside since last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what this means,'' Schafer said, noting he was
happy with the care his mother had received. ``I would have
appreciated some notification from them if this was in the works.''
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said it had been hard to find the right nursing home for
his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a difficult process to find the right facility,'' he
said. ``The idea of having to go through this again is something
that will be another emotional roller coaster to go through, not to
mention the wear and tear and psychological strain it puts on my
mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Levin, Integrated Health Services' executive vice
president, said Friday that all of the company's nursing homes
would remain open and the bankruptcy would not lead to employee
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The residents and employees should see no change as a result
of the recent filing,'' Levin said. ``At each facility, the
administrator is taking action to notify and reassure affected
parties, including residents, family members and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides its locations in the Kansas City area, Integrated Health
Services runs nursing homes in St. Louis and Tarkio, Mo., as well
as the Kansas cities Wichita, Topeka, Hutchinson, Great Bend and
Ellinwood.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated Health Services, based in Sparks, Md., attributed its
problems to Medicare cuts resulting from the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, which shifted Medicare reimbursements from a system based on
operating costs to one based on fixed fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation hurts the sickest, most vulnerable Medicare
beneficiaries _ those needing the most intensive skilled nursing
care,'' Charles Roadman, president and chief executive of the
American Health Care Association in Washington, said in a release.
``...this crisis has reached epidemic proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who meet its guidelines, Medicare pays 100 percent of
skilled nursing care or skilled rehabilitation for the first 20
days of a resident's stay in a skilled nursing home. Medicare pays
part of those costs for the next 80 days, but does not pay for
long-term placements. Those costs are borne by the residents,
third-party private payers or Medicaid, which covers indigent
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Division of Aging and the Kansas Department of
Health and Environment were informed of the filing by Integrated
Health Services, which plans to continue operating under Chapter 11
while it restructures its debts. The company has obtained up to
$300 million in financing from Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated Health Services joins national operators Vencor Inc.,
Sun Healthcare Group Inc., Mariner Post-Acute Network Inc., Lenox
Health Care Inc., Frontier Group Inc. and NewCare Health Corp. in
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Published estimates put nursing home assets in Chapter 11 at $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 1,651 skilled nursing facilities, accounting for
175,000 patients annually, are in bankruptcy, according to the
American Health Care Association. That accounts for nearly 10
percent of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most operators incurred substantial debts as they went on
nursing home buying sprees, banking on easy money from Medicare. A
recent report by the General Accounting Office noted industry
losses ``may reflect a combination of inflated purchase prices''
and lower expectations for the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past several years, these companies went on an
aggressive acquisition binge, partially to maximize their Medicare
reimbursements from ancillary medical services,'' said Michael
Flanagan, a lawyer who represents the Tutera Group, a Kansas
City-based manager of 50 nursing homes in 10 states. ``But they did
it without regard for whether the prices made any sense for the
nursing homes as stand-alone operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bankrupt companies depended on Medicare for the
rehabilitation services they provided to short-term residents, who
typically spent a couple of weeks in a nursing home following a
hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ``cut too deep,'' said John
Kiefhaber, executive vice president of the Kansas Health Care
Association, which represents 200 for-profit and nonprofit nursing
home and assisted care facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cap rehabilitation services, people run out of that
benefit too quickly and their rehab isn't finished yet. So they
have to go back to the hospital and you've accomplished the
opposite of what you wanted to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the American Health Care Association urged Congress to
restore $7 billion of more than $15 billion that was cut from
Medicare as part of the 1997 balanced budget deal. Congress
responded with the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, which will
restore about $2.7 billion for skilled nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   But the act came ``too late for the companies that were heavy
into rehab,'' Kiefhaber said.

<P>
   Dan Rexroth, vice president of health services for John Knox
Village, a long-term care community in Lee's Summit, said the funds
restored by Congress represent a ``small adjustment. It certainly
won't make up for the cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Schworer, chief executive officer of Foxwood Springs Living
Center in Raymore, said Foxwood opted out of the Medicare program
at the end of 1998 because it could no longer operate skilled
nursing beds on the money it got from Medicare. Other long-term
care centers, such as John Knox Village, have shifted costs to
residents, who pay out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just declining Medicare reimbursements that have
eaten into operators' profits. The General Accounting Office report
said that additional factors _ including high capital costs,
reduced demand for nursing home support services such as
rehabilitation and substantial one-time expenses and write-offs _
had contributed to the strain on nursing home finances.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Enterprises Inc., the largest U.S. nursing home chain,
said in November that its third-quarter earnings fell 63 percent
amid declining Medicare revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But falling earnings aren't the industry's only problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced Thursday that Beverly, which
has nursing homes in Kansas and Missouri, had agreed to pay $175
million _ the biggest settlement ever in a nursing home case _ and
relinquish 10 of its nursing homes for defrauding Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Vencor, too, was investigated for its Medicare billing
practices. The company last year agreed to a $90 million repayment
plan, which will extend through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   And NewCare's chairman and president face Medicaid fraud charges
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The two have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent bankruptcies, the financial woes of the
national operators may not be a bad development, as inefficient
operators are weeded out and companies get their operating expenses
in line with reduced reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts said the corrections were overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong facilities that can operate with lower Medicare
payments and still provide a high quality of care will continue to
survive,'' said Matt Hickam of the Office of the State Long-Term
Ombudsman, which advocates for Kansas nursing home residents.
``What you're seeing is a culling of the herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that wasn't intended...when Congress passed the
Balanced Budget Act, but maybe things will work out for the best.''

   (Phoenix) - A jury has slapped a nearly $1 million civil
judgment against Maricopa County and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, concluding
that inadequate security at the Tent City jail led to a beating
that left an inmate brain-damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors determined that inmate Jeremy Flanders was partly to
blame in the May 10, 1996, attack but laid the majority of the
blame (71 percent) on a jail system that was understaffed and
unable to protect its inmate population. The county stands to pay
Flanders $948,000.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment Thursday, fol lowing a trial before Superior Court
Judge Jeffrey Cates, is another blow to Arpaio's depart ment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the sheriff played down an embarrassing revelation
that two top aides had their credit cards suspended for unau
thorized purchases. One of them, Dave Hendershott, came under fire
after he retired to collect a $51,000 pension, then promptly
rejoined the department as a civilian earning his old salary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a civil jury awarded $8.25 million to the family of
Scott Norberg, who died during a struggle with detention officers.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Arpaio said Friday that the jury was flat wrong on the
Flanders case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by the tents, and I'm going to put up more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions at the Tent City jail were a cornerstone of Flanders'
case. His lawyer, Joel Robbins, argued that taking away ciga
rettes, coffee and air-condition ing, coupled with lax security,
created a ``pressure cooker.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanders, 24, serving a one-year sentence for burglary, was
jumped by five other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Another inmate called for help but got no response from guards.
He carried Flanders more than 100 yards to the main office. &QL;

FORMER CIA DIRECTOR RETAINS SECURITY CLEARANCE AT PENTAGON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the former director of central
intelligence, John Deutch, had his security clearances revoked by
the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence
Agency, he has kept his security clearance at the Pentagon, a
senior Defense Department official said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The clearance is a limited one, the official said, what he
called an ``industrial clearance,'' which allows Deutch to work on
specific Defense Department contracts for Raytheon, the SAIC Corp.
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Deutch
teaches. The official said the clearance did not give Deutch access
to a wide range of intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
Pentagon had no basis to revoke this limited clearance.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Defense Department had not received the CIA report,
which was the basis of that agency's revoking Deutch's clearance.
The Pentagon had requested the report some time ago, he said, but
he did not know exactly when.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Deutch has kept his industrial security clearance
at the Defense Department was first reported by The Washington Post
on its Web site Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch worked at the Pentagon from 1993 to 1995, first as under
secretary of defense for acquisitions and technology and then as
deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 post there. In May 1995, he
was confirmed as director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   After failing in his desire to become secretary of defense,
Deutch stepped down as head of the CIA in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch managed to keep CIA computers at his home after he was
hired as a consultant to the agency. In a visit to Deutch's home in
December 1996, CIA security officials discovered classified
documents on the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a subsequent investigation, Deutch's security
clearances were revoked by his successor at the agency, George
Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a reciprocal arrangement with the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Deutch also lost his security clearance there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that the CIA's
inspector general found that senior agency officials had not been
aggressive in their investigation of Deutch's security lapses, with
one result being that an independent prosecutor was not appointed
to investigate the matter.

GREENE KICKS OFF OLYMPIC YEAR WITH A SWIFT 60 METERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They introduced the sprinters as if they were
prizefighters, with spotlights and a haughty, pugilistic walk to
the starting line. And as usual, it was Maurice Greene, the world's
fastest man, who delivered a knockout punch in the 60 meters.
</P>
<P>
   With a superb start and a searing finish, Greene set a Millrose
Games record by winning the event in 6.45 seconds Friday night at
Madison Square Garden, edging his training partner Jon Drummond.
The time, run on a new Mondo track, was not close to Greene's world
indoor record of 6.39 seconds, set two years ago. But it was an
encouraging start to a long season that is expected to culminate
with gold-medal possibilities at the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season I started at 6.46 and I broke the world record,''
Greene said, referring to the 100-meter outdoor record that he set
at 9.79 seconds. His previous Millrose record was 6.46. ``This year
I started at 6.45. We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early, Greene said, to get excited about the Olympics,
which do not take place until September. But if his legs are not
yet in top form, his confidence is. Long gone is the callow,
emerging sprinter whose promise in 1996 was sidelined by an injury
that prevented him from qualifying for the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stronger than '96, my technique is a lot better than '96,
and mentally, I believe I am unstoppable,'' said Greene, who lost
only once indoors and outdoors last season. ``If I do what I should
do in my races, I believe I can win each and every one of them. My
biggest competition is myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Possessing one of the best starts in sprinting, Drummond
challenged Greene the entire race and took second in 6.50 seconds,
overcoming a headache that had bothered him for three days. Brian
Lewis was third in 6.57. Back in fifth, trying to shake the
cobwebs, was another training partner of Greene's, Ato Boldon of
Trinidad, who won bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics at 100
and 200 meters, but who is slowly working his way back from a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rusty,'' said Boldon, who ran 6.68. ``I'm just not used
to running at that speed. I hadn't done it in eight months. But I
understand it's a long process. February has little to do with
September and October.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 800 meters, Johnny Gray, 39, who is seeking to make
his fifth Olympic team, led from the start Friday night and won in
1 minute 49.88 seconds for his fourth Millrose title. A week ago in
Fairfax, Va., Gray came from behind to win, but Friday night he
went back to his customary style, running from the front.
</P>
<P>
   Joetta Clark Diggs, 37, made her Millrose farewell in dramatic
fashion, winning the women's 800 for the seventh time, in 2:04.79.
Toni Hodgkinson of New Zealand threatened with a fierce close at
the tape, but could not overtake Clark Diggs and settled for second
in 2:04.84. Hazel Clark, Joetta's sister, took third in 2:04.92.
This was the 22nd Millrose appearance for Clark Diggs, who first
competed in the meet at age 14. She is retiring after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to go out winning this one,'' Clark Diggs said. ``I
was getting tired. I'm not as fit as I'd like to be, but I wanted
to win this. I got my start here; then to have this victory here
was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila, the world champion in the women's pole vault,
which will make its Olympic debut in Sydney, won Friday night with
a vault of 14 feet 6 inches. She attempted 14-10, a half-inch
higher than her indoor American record, but meet officials
inscrutably held a Hall of Fame ceremony in the middle of the
infield and it appeared to interfere with her rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to jump at least as high as last week, but you
can't break the American record every weekend,'' Dragila said,
referring to her vault of 14-9{. ``I was still under the bar at the
hips. I have to be stronger. Technically, I have to bring it
through, but I feel real good. I'm getting faster all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs, twice a silver medalist at the world
championships at 1,500 meters, had no one to challenge her in the
mile, but, running alone, she pushed herself to a victory in
4:24.04, the fastest women's mile at the Millrose Games in the last
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wanamaker Mile, Mark Carroll continued a long Irish
tradition at Millrose by taking first place in 3:58.19. He broke
away in the final quarter-mile to win over his countryman James
Nolan, who finished second in 4:00.06. Laban Rotich of Kenya took
third in 4:01.93. &QL;

DEFENSE LAWYERS IN CAPITAL CASES OFTEN LACK RESOURCES AND
COMPETENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS clarification in 2nd graf;   ADDS 18th graf with example of
representation) 
 (bl) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As Illinois examines what went wrong with a justice
system that sent 13 innocent men to death row, one common thread
has already emerged: poorly financed, often incompetent defense
lawyers who failed to uncover and present key evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes go far beyond the 13. In one case, a defense lawyer
failed to prepare any strategy for his client at the death penalty
hearing the day after the conviction, saying he had been hoping
that the jury would opt for manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer rambled so incoherently during a death
penalty trial that a state Supreme Court justice wrote that the
proceeding ``would border on the comical if only it were
make-believe.''
</P>
<P>
   A third lawyer simply failed to attend some critical hearings,
arrived late at others and neglected to call witnesses who had
volunteered to testify about a defendant's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal defense for death row inmates has simply been
inadequate,'' said Elisabeth Semel, who heads an American Bar
Association project that focuses on legal representation for people
facing the death penalty. Other legal experts add that the
situation in Illinois is mirrored in many other states.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that opponents of the death penalty
criticize the legal system for failing to provide adequate
defenses. But in Illinois, the same criticism is now being offered
by some supporters of executions, many of whom now back Gov. George
Ryan's decision this week to place a moratorium on implementation
of the death penalty until a panel can study it.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a moderate Republican who supports the death
penalty, announced the moratorium after new evidence cleared 13 men
who had been convicted and sent to death row since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the governor's decision, Mayor Richard M. Daley of
Chicago, who prosecuted some of the death penalty cases as Cook
County state's attorney in the 1980s, said the defense lawyers in
some of those cases were sometimes incompetent and lacked the money
to conduct their own thorough investigations and compete against
the police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the cases involved questions of poor defense work.
Some also resulted in accusations of overly aggressive police
officials and prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But just as striking is the fact that in three cases, college
students working on class projects at Northwestern University were
able to find evidence that had escaped the attention of defense
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   While a proper defense in a death penalty case takes months of
research and costs $250,000 or more, Semel said, defendants in
these cases are often represented by lawyers who are paid a few
thousand dollars, or less, and spend only two days on a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the actual trial, judges conduct separate
hearings in each case to determine whether a defendant should be
executed, which adds to the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford good legal help, the families of defendants
often settle, in desperation, for any lawyer who will take a case,
regardless of reputation. The results are not surprising. A Chicago
Tribune examination of death penalty cases found that 33 defendants
sentenced to die were represented by a lawyer who had been
disbarred or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of these inmates, in some cases, depends on volunteers
unearthing evidence, or just plain luck.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who failed to prepare a strategy for the death
penalty hearing for his client had never handled a death penalty
case. The lawyer, Richard G. Younge, 75, said he was unaware that
the hearing would come only a day after the conviction. A state
judge voided the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Washington, the lawyer who missed some hearings and arrived
late to others, had taken the case of Bernon Howrey, of Kankakee,
for a flat $8,000 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The closing argument of George Pease, a defense lawyer in the
case of a suburban Chicago man sen- tenced to death, was described
by a federal judge as ``a rambling, inco- herent discourse.'' The
defendant was ultimately resentenced to 60 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   While a spotlight has been cast on the Illinois system, some
legal experts contend that many of the same problems of woeful
representation exist in many states.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts have emerged from around the nation of defense lawyers
who slept through trials, or came to court drunk. Courts have
assigned death penalty cases to lawyers who have never tried a
criminal case, like tax lawyers. And for many of the decent,
hardworking lawyers who take death penalty cases, the money paid by
poor families is generally so paltry that paying for a thorough
investigation is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get these families who go shopping for a lawyer with, say,
$10,000, which seems like all the money in the world to them,''
said Lawrence Marshall, a law professor who heads the Center on
Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University. ``A good lawyer
will tell them it can't possibly be done for that money. So they
keep looking, until they find someone who will take the case. It's
usually a down-on-the-luck lawyer who figures the case is probably
going to plead anyway, so it's a quick $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many of these lawyers have never tried a death penalty
case, which tend to be complicated. And they do not have the money
to do some of the basic legwork needed.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Simon, a former Illinois supreme court justice and
longtime foe of the death penalty, said he believed the poor legal
representation for defendants made the death penalty unjust.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois court in 1982 once denied an appeal to the death
penalty on the grounds of incompetent legal representation _ only
to turn to a case weeks later on the disbarment of the very same
lawyer, Archie Weston, who had represented the condemned man,
Dennis Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was accused of looting an estate,'' said Simon. ``We asked
him why he had missed a disciplinary hearing. He said at the time
he was so stressed out he couldn't think straight.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the period he was talking about matched the
time he was representing the death row defendant. A new trial was
ordered, which resulted in another conviction. This is one of the
13 cases cited by Ryan in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, DNA evidence proved Williams was innocent of two
murder charges. He was freed in 1996 after spending 18 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The wrongful conviction cost Cook County, which administered the
trials, nearly $13 million in damages to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have recently cited the accounts of such mistakes and
poor legal representation in calling for changes to federal
execution law. Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said it seemed
obvious that mistakes caught in Illinois were occurring in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illinois was just honest enough to admit it,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   But while concerns have grown over poor legal representation and
mistaken convictions, laws in recent years have nonetheless cut
legal aid for defendants who cannot afford their own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress eliminated spending for the 20 Death Penalty
Resource Centers, which existed to help mount the appeals of death
row inmates, who are almost always poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, there has been little effort to improve legal help
for poor defendants, even though 20 wrongful convictions resulted
in inmates being sent to death row _ the most in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Florida recently enacted a so-called fast-track
system that shortens times for appeals for inmates sentenced to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people charged with serious crimes have been entitled to
legal assistance since the U.S. Supreme Court's Gideon vs.
Wainwright decision in 1963. But that aid varies sharply among the
states. Alabama pays $30 an hour to lawyers for out-of-court work
while representing poor defendants. New York, which is regarded as
having one of the best systems for the poor, pays $125 an hour,
still far less than a good lawyer in private practice would charge.
New York also has a Capital Defender Unit, which specializes in
cases that are eligible for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Even prosecutors acknowledge that defense lawyers typically
start at a disadvantage when they go up against experienced
prosecutors. Richard Devine, the state's attorney in Cook County,
noted that his office has 300 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time someone is trying a capital case, they have had a
lot of experience,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   Semel used a boxing analogy to describe the disparity in
resources and experience between prosecutors and defense lawyers in
most death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a match between Mike Tyson and Martin Short,'' she
said, ``and the referee _ the judge _ is on Tyson's payroll.''

THEY'RE READY TO RACE AT WINTERNATIONALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Officially, eliminations for the 40th
Winternationals aren't until Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there isn't any racing go on. Just ask Gary
Scelzi and Jerry Toliver, who both qualified on their respective
poles Friday during second-round qualifying at the Fairplex.
</P>
<P>
   Both Scelzi and Toliver were paired against defending series
champions Tony Schumacher and John Force, and that made all the
difference in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little extra special doing that right next to Tony
Schumacher,'' said Scelzi, who is No. 1 in Top Fuel following a
4.656-second pass at 316.60 mph. ``The old champ (Scelzi) and the
new champ. If anybody says we weren't racing, they are lying. We
were racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out good for me because I was on the winning end
(beating Schumacher's 4.680). Everytime you pull up to the starting
line, and there's some like (Joe) Amato, Schumacher, Kenny
Bernstein...We're racing. I don't care what anybody says. When the
big guys pull next to each other, it's bragging rights. And it
works on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dixon, who won this event in 1998, is second after two
rounds, running a 4.657 at 311.92 mph with Doug Kalitta third at
4.664. Schumacher, who was raised in Canoga Park is fifth. Whittier
resident Robert Reehl is 14th at 5.852 and former San Dimas High
School cheerleader Rhonda Hartman 15th at 4.993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited,'' Dixon said. ``(Crew chief Dick) LaHaie
told me he was just going to tickle it to run a (4.69 or 4.70), so
to see a .65 on the scoreboard was a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Toliver, who also admitted to doing a lithe racing against
nine-time champion Force, took No. 1 in Funny Car with a smooth
4.916 at 310.05 mph. Dean Skuza is second at 4.927 while Force
dropped to third after failing to improve on Thursday's run of
4.958.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was racing John Force,'' said Toliver, who hopes to compete
for the championship in 2000. ``I don't care if it's qualifying or
whatever. John pumps me up. I love to race John. You can't take
anything away from John. This may be our year. Who knows? John's a
true champion, but we have a true champion in our camp - (crew
chief) Dale Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``So right now we're No. 1 qualifier. We have two passes (today)
and see what it brings us. But if (Friday) was any indication,
we're looking real good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Toliver thinks the Pomona Raceway track may be able to hold
a little more horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're at the limit of performance,'' he said.
''There's a lot more left in that race car. There's low (4.80s) in
that car, maybe a 4.70.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's performance also gave Toliver a step on what he hopes
will be the road to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going for No. 1,'' Toliver said. ''We beat (Force) at
the end of last year. We have a whole new team and this year we're
very confident. I'm not trying to be cocky. I'm telling the truth.
That's what we're doing, and so is John. So may the best man, team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Yates, who won back-to-back titles in 1996 and '97, leads
Pro Stock.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, who hasn't qualified on the pole since August, 1998,
raced to a Winternationals event-record 6.878 at 199.58 mph. 1999
Winternationals champion Jeg Coughlin is second at 6.883. Troy
Coughlin, who was No. 1 on Thursday, is fourth at 6.895.
</P>
<P>
   ''The track was surprisingly good,'' Yates said. ''Anytime we
get some cloud cover, it's tremendous. A 6.87? That's a pretty fast
pass for us.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new car ran real good, and I think as long as we get the
same conditions with the cloud cover, you're going to see faster
times (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Johnson, winner of the past two Pro Stock championships,
is a disappointing 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johns, who won the NHRA Finals at this track in November,
leads in Pro Stock Truck.
</P>
<P>
   Johns, who is part of a two-truck team with rookie Rob
Slavinski, qualified with a 7.527 at a track-record 178.99 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Panella, 1999 Pro Stock Truck champion, is a disappointing
11th after failing to improve on Thursday's run of 7.611.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a little bit of a problem (early in the run), but it
was OK,'' Johns said. ''My crew chief (Tommy Lee) makes the truck
easy to drive.''

BLACK BOX REVEALS TWO LOUD NOISES

<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. - Moments before Alaska Airlines Flight 261
crashed, the crew heard two loud sounds from the tail section,
officials said, raising the possibility that something beyond the
stabilizer trim went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the crew had lost control of the plane for
about 90 seconds and then, shortly after recovering control, a
flight attendant is heard on the cockpit voice recorder telling the
pilots she heard a loud noise from the rear of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than a minute after the second loud sound, the
jetliner lost radio contact and dove nose-first into the ocean some
nine miles off Point Mugu, according to a preliminary analysis of
the cockpit voice recorder released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As National Transportation Safety Board investigators worked to
reconstruct the last minutes of Flight 261, families and friends of
the 88 crew members and passengers prepared for a final, private
memorial Saturday at Pepperdine University in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a group of American Indians conducted a ``cleansing
ceremony'' on Point Mugu, and a public memorial held at St.
Anthony's Catholic Church in Oxnard drew 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to those in the church, Oxnard fire Chaplain Dan Green
praised the local community.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have helped families that you have never met, or probably
never will meet, tenderly and compassionately. You took a hold of
their belongings and possessions,'' Green said. ``You have even
held in your hands the remains of their loved ones. I have watched
and I have been touched.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this tragedy so close to our shores, it is our
family by the providence of geography,'' St. Anthony's pastor
George Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings released Friday hinted at the terrifying events
before the plane flipped over and corkscrewed into water more than
700 feet deep. Investigators continue to pore over two hours and 45
minutes of recordings, but released summaries Friday of the crew's
last moments inside the cabin of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 12 minutes before the end of the recording, there was an
apparent loss of vertical control,'' said John Hammerschmidt, a
NTSB investigator.
</P>
<P>
   He said the crew then recovered control of the plane within 90
seconds. ``After the recovery, a flight attendant advised the crew
that she heard a loud noise coming from the rear of the plane. The
crew acknowledged that they heard it too.''
</P>
<P>
   A second loud noise was heard on the cockpit recorder, after
which the plane appears to go out of control, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No stall warning was heard during this event,'' he said. ``We
will not try to interpret any of this information at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said the flight voice recorder detailed
conversations between the doomed flight crew and maintenance
workers in Seattle regarding the plane's stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is now focused on examining that stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy vessels continue mapping the wreckage. Hammerschmidt
described the underwater debris field as the size of a football
field.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tail structure was broken into multiple pieces
between three feet and six feet. The largest piece seen thus far
was a section of fuselage that is five windows long - about 10 feet
long. A front section of the horizontal stabilizer measuring about
five feet also was spotted in the debris field.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said workers will continue to look for debris and
bodies using side-scan sonar equipment. He said investigators have
expanded their search perimeter a mile beyond the debris field.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators continued to interview air traffic controllers at
Palmdale and Los Angeles International airports. NTSB officials
have interviewed a witness who was 16 miles from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen American Indians gathered near Point Mugu on
Friday for a ceremony in honor of victims including Morris
Thompson, a prominent American Indian leader in Alaska who died in
the crash. They burned sage to cleanse spirits and recited tribal
chants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the memorial, Al Bautista of Oxnard said he came
``to pay tribute to the 88 people whose souls went down into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the services tonight will help heal the hurting
that we have been feeling since Monday.''

LAKERS HOPING FOR MOMENTUM
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five days and two games remain before the All-Star
break and the Los Angeles Lakers will certainly head into the
symbolic halfway point with one of the NBA's best records, despite
their recent struggles. But records aside, coach Phil Jackson is
counting on regaining some semblance of momentum before the
four-day intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to get back on a winning track. Obviously we'd
like to finish this up with wins,'' he said. ``I told the guys
they've done a great job of trying to get me out of the All-Star
Game, but now that I have to go to the All-Star Game (as coach of
the West), I'd hate to be in second place in the West when I got
there. Fortunately, we got some help (Thursday) night by New York
(which beat Portland), and so we have an opportunity to at least
finish out tied for first place in the Western Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Trail Blazers entered play Friday tied atop the
division and atop the NBA. The Lakers finish out the pre-break
schedule with home games against Denver and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about energy, playing with a great deal of
energy and playing with more enthusiasm, just love of the game, and
realize that's one of the things that carries you as a basketball
club,'' Jackson said. ``We're just trying to get some of that back,
so that we get the rebounding and defensive end of our game back.
You know the offense may always come and go, and shooting is really
what's kicked us in the butt (recently), but the defense can hold
us in there and that's what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But heading into the break as the top seed in the West isn't
necessarily what Jackson had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wanted to be somewhere in fourth or fifth (in the
West) and have a good run at the end of the year, be strong coming
on,'' he said. ``I hate to be the favorite. I like to be the
underdog. And I think there's so much more that we can do as a
basketball team. I don't want them to be complacent with what
they've accomplished this first half of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   New digs: After months of delays, the Lakers expect to move into
their new offices and practice facility next weekend, and Jackson
is looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I like to do is I like to build a community
and try and get these guys to kind of come out of their shells,''
he said. ``A big city like L.A., it's tough to do with all the
different places and different spaces, and for us to have a home as
a team, just to practice in and to work out in will be great. It'll
help us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmasked man: For the first time since breaking his nose Jan.
12, Robert Horry played without his protective mask Friday.

RUMORS BOOST SEAGRAM STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY  MARLA MATZER ROSE 
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - The studio that brought you such horror classics
as ``Dracula'' and ``The Mummy'' has become the land of the undead
rumor. And investors are buying into it.
</P>
<P>
   Longstanding speculation that Universal Studios and its theme
park operations will be sold by the Seagram Co. has heated up in
the past month, driving Seagram stock up more than 30 percent since
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Seagram, the Montreal-based firm that made its fortune
in liquor, or Universal are commenting. Possible suitors are
denying interest. Sources say no deal is pending.
</P>
<P>
   But all this hasn't stopped analysts and investors from playing
a Wall Street version of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorite guessing game on the Street these days seems to be
identifying what the next big media merger will be, with Seagram
looking to many like a prime target. The latest buzz has Seagram
putting Universal's filmed entertainment and recreation divisions
on the block for between $5 billion and $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a slight downgrading by one investment firm put much of
a damper on Seagram stock. Toronto-based CIBC bumped Seagram down
from ``strong buy'' to ``buy'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram shares fell about 6 percent - but remained not far from
their 52- week high of $65.
</P>
<P>
   What does Seagram have to say about this? Not much. ``We don't
comment on rumors and speculation. We don't comment on the movement
of our stock,'' said Anita Larsen, a New York-based spokeswoman for
Seagram. Universal representatives in Los Angeles similarly had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   And people connected with the studio, who did not want to be
identified, deny rumors of a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not happening, period,'' said one source, who pointed out
that Seagram CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr. told investors in November that
he didn't plan to sell Universal.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that in the business world, denials are often
quickly followed by deals.
</P>
<P>
   These Universal whisperings are nothing new. Rumors that
Bronfman would sell his money-losing studio have been floated since
at least early 1998, when Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc. bought
Universal's U.S. television operations for $1.3 billion and a 45
percent stake in USA.
</P>
<P>
   Diller has been the most frequently named suitor for Universal.
Like Bronfman, he has continued to claim he has no intentions in
that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep denying this every hour of the day,'' Diller
said testily Thursday, in a conference call to discuss USA's yearly
results. Other possible bidders for Universal that have been
bandied about include DreamWorks SKG. Director Steven Spielberg's
studio already has a relationship with Universal, and could benefit
from a coupling with another media company. Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. is reportedly a suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman supporters stress that Seagram's stock in USA is now
worth more than $8 billion, more than Seagram paid Japanese
conglomerate Matshushita for 80 percent of Universal in 1995.
Seagram now controls more than 90 percent of the studio.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies, though, that Universal hasn't proved a great
investment so far for Seagram. The company sold stock in the blue
chip DuPont Corp. to pay for the Universal purchase; the DuPont
stock soared to be worth billions more than Seagram sold it for,
while Universal's fortunes sagged.
</P>
<P>
   This past year did see a significant turnaround in Universal's
box office fortunes. The company ranked a close third behind
Disney/Buena Vista and Warner Bros. in the Hollywood Reporter's
annual ``studio scorecard.''
</P>
<P>
   Though films like ``EdTV'' and ``Mystery Men'' were
disappointments, the studio scored big with smashes such as ``The
Mummy'' and ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than this to get Universal's movie division
into the black: analysts expect Universal to still lose money this
fiscal year, which ends June 30, though far less than the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman himself warned investors in late 1999 that it would be
at least several more quarters before the filmed entertainment
division was expected to make money.
</P>
<P>
   The current sale-watch is surely heightened by the recent wave
of media mega-deals, particularly America Online Inc.'s
announcement a month ago that it would purchase Time Warner Inc.
Investors immediately started looking for the next likely candidate
for a sale, zeroing in on Universal and a few other companies, such
as the NBC network.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has run toward Seagram selling its recreation
division, which includes Universal Studios Hollywood and Florida,
along with the film unit. The parks' attractions are closely tied
to films in Universal's library, such as ``Psycho'' and ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman is less likely to shed the music division anytime soon,
though: it has been profitable - with such hit acts as Shania Twain
and Limp Bizkit - and has been the market share leader since its
acquisition of PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman also has a personal passion for music. Under the
pseudonym Junior Miles, he's penned songs for such stars as Celine
Dion.
</P>
<P>
   If Seagram were to keep music, that unit would make a natural
partner for an Internet firm a la the Time Warner-AOL deal. Music
has emerged as the most immediately exploitable entertainment
commodity on the Internet.

 CALIFORNIA DELEGATES PONDER BUSH'S NO-SHOW  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ With just a month left before the March 7
California primary, delegates to the state Republican convention in
Burlingame this weekend had a single question: Where's George?
</P>
<P>
   That's Texas Governor George W. Bush, the frontrunner in the GOP
presidential primary and a no-show again for the twice-yearly
gathering of Republican faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the campaign that makes that decision,'' state GOP
Chairman John McGraw said Friday. ``I would have liked to see
everyone here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, showed up at the
convention Friday and pumped his brother's campaign in a dinnertime
speech. But because he had to catch an early flight, he was on
stage for the 18-minute talk and out the door before many of the
guests even had a chance to finish their salads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't make many friends last fall when he snubbed the GOP
gathering in Anaheim to attend the Ryder Cup golf tournament. This
time, he was at home in Austin resting after weeks on the road in
Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was campaigning in Michigan today and then returning home
to Austin to wash his clothes, repack his bags and go out on the
road again Monday,'' said Margita Thompson, Bush's state chairman.
``I don't think anyone has shown the commitment to California Gov.
Bush has.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona Sen. John McCain's surprisingly strong victory in
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary lit a fire under his supporters in
California. McCain's appearance at a convention luncheon Saturday
is sold out and his backers are expecting a big crowd for a
pre-lunch rally.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Pruitt of Los Altos is an ardent McCain supporter and was
trying to drum up enthusiasm from other delegates as the convention
got under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are talking about him now,'' Pruitt said. ``I
think the same thing is going to happen here as is happening in
South Carolina. He's going to win there, and then shoot up in the
polls here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt said Bush's absence is telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what he thinks about California,'' he said. ``I think
Bush is still coasting a little. Now people realize he isn't the
only one who is electable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's absence didn't damper the enthusiasm of his supporters,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Brown, president of the San Francisco Young Republicans
and a Bush supporter, said there are plenty of people representing
him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not going dampen our enthusiasm,'' she said. ``I
know lots of people are talking about McCain, but New Hampshire is
the size of San Jose. It just doesn't say a lot about what will
happen here in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's absence especially concerns Republicans who saw the last
two GOP presidential campaigns abandon California and take their
efforts elsewhere, leaving state Republican campaigns scrambling
for support.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to happen, Thompson promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has been in California on 11 different days in
18 different cities since last June and raised $2.2 million for all
candidates in California,'' she said. ``He definitely hasn't
written off the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the dinner last night, Jeb Bush said his brother's
campaign would work hard to reach out to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do it the old-fashioned way, through hard work
and old fashioned values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush also emphasized the importance of conservative beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother is a true-blue conservative,'' he told an audience
who reacted with polite applause. ``We should not shy away from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the Clinton adminstration for its insular
focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother can turn a big and caring heart on to all of the
neighborhoods to solve problems,'' the Florida governor said.
`That's what my brother calls a compassion conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention resumes Saturday and concludes Sunday.

GOV. DAVIS PULLED IN RECORD $13 MILLION IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
 IN 1999
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Shattering his GOP predecessor's record, Gov. Gray
Davis vacuumed up more than $13.2 million in campaign contributions
last year.
<P>
   In campaign reports at the Secretary of State's office, the
Democratic governor reported receiving at least $1 million from
organized labor, which has long been an ally of Davis' party.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor also reported receiving more than $1.9 million
from utilities, timber companies, agricultural interests,
developers, oil companies and insurers, which are traditionally
generous GOP contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a governor who is governing in the center as he promised
he would, and some of the non-traditional Democratic givers are
pretty astonished by that,'' said Garry South, Davis' chief
campaign adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis' Herculean fund-raising has been criticized by
watchdog groups that note the governor won't have to run for
re-election until 2002. They say Davis' collections create an
appearance that hefty contributors may get special treatment from
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three years from his re-election race. The pretense that
this is for an election collapses,'' said Jim Knox, executive
director of California Cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for buying influence in the here and now,'' Knox said.
``Money that's given now is given to gain access and influence.
It's just that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis denies any link between contributions and actions of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Davis told The Chronicle's editorial board that
``everybody, when you are governor, wants to give you money.''
Charges that the money leads to favoritism were ``chickensh_''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor received at least $664,263 from utilities and
telecommunications firms, including $135,000 from Pacific Telesis,
$115,000 from General Telephone and $85,000 from Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The governor appoints the five-members of the Public Utilities
Commission who regulate the state's utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also received at least $177,000 from gambling interests
led by Santa Anita racetrack at $95,000.
</P>
<P>
   There were no contributions from Indian tribes who conduct
gambling operations on their lands. Davis inked a deal last year
that allows them to expand their casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Developers gave nearly $300,000 to Davis, including more than
$230,000 from the California Building Industry Association and AKT
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Timber companies gave at least $125,000. Oil companies, led by
ARCO at $96,500, contributed at least $151,000.
</P>
<P>
   At least $470,000 came from lawyers or law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies _ led by Fireman's Fund at $174,000 _ gave
at least $504,000. Health care providers contributed some $264,000.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs sponsored a Los Angeles fund-raiser for Davis in July. The
event raised at least $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Davis was criticized when he called key state
legislators and asked them to slow down the progress of bills
increasing state regulation of health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the legislative session, Davis signed more than
a dozen bills increasing regulation of those same providers.
</P>
<P>
   The largest individual contributor to Davis last year was Jerry
Perenchio, the billionaire owner of Univision, the nation's largest
Spanish language television network. He gave Davis $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest individual contributor was David J. Shimmon,
a president of a US Filter subsidiary. He gave $200,000.

<P>
   Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky said Friday that he has had
conversations about becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky acknowledged he has been formally approached to join a
group of investors, which includes Hollywood producer and Phoenix
Suns partner Barry Kemp, that is negotiating to buy the NHL team
from owner Richard Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Phoenix-based Ellman Cos., the developer of a
planned Coyotes arena complex in Scottsdale, confirmed Friday that
it has formed an alliance with Kemp to try to purchase the team.
Under the agreement, Kemp and a group of investors would be the
majority owners, and Ellman would hold 17 percent of the team,
which would play at a new Scottsdale arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellman's objective is for the transaction to be concluded as
quickly as possible to ensure that the Coyotes remain in the
Valley,'' said a statement issued Friday by Ellman.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who was offered a lucrative free-agent contract by the
Phoenix Coyotes four seasons ago, said Friday night that nothing is
imminent and that a number of other NHL clubs also have tried to
lure him into becoming a major investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to a fair number of teams, and all of the teams
that I have talked to have been very cordial and extremely nice to
me,'' Gretzky told ``The Arizona Republic.'' ``We've never really
got down to the real specifics with many of them, other than the
fact there's been kind of an open door. &QL; 
`Not the right time'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty honest and blunt with all the teams, that at this
point and time in my life, I don't think it's a right fit. But I
appreciated the opportunity to have lunch with them or talk to
them. They couldn't have been nicer to me, but at this point and
time, it's not the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the negotiations, however, say that there's
more to Gretzky's interest than he is letting on publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp is a former executive director of the Phoenix Chamber of
Commerce. He now owns a television and movie production corporation
called Bungalow 78 Productions, which has produced long-running
television hits such as ``Taxi,'' ``Coach'' and ``Newhart,'' as
well as feature films such as ``Romy and Michelle's High School
Reunion'' and ``Patch Adams.'' He owns 6 percent of the Suns and is
involved both in limited and general partnership groups with the
team. He also owns the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, an entertainment group headed by Kemp offered to
buy the Coyotes for $80 million to $100 million and keep the team
at America West Arena if Scottsdale voters rejected Los Arcos as a
site.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Burke turned down Kemp's offer.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Burke said he is looking to sell the team because he
said he can't absorb the financial hits he will take because of
delays in a new arena at Scottsdale's Los Arcos Mall. &QL; 
Scottsdale voters in November approved the publicly backed project,
which is to include an 18,000-seat arena, movie theaters, shops and
restaurants at Scottsdale and McDowell roads. Ellman announced
Friday that it will submit zoning applications to Scottsdale on
Monday for the arena.
</P>
<P>
   He said he cannot afford to keep the team if the delayed Los
Arcos complex is not completed for the 2001 season. He is operating
at a loss at downtown's America West Arena, which is configured
with a substantial number of limited-view seats for hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman officials, who have remained silent about negotiations,
issued a statement late Friday, possibly in response to statements
made by Burke to the ``Business Journal'' that there were no
potential buyers for the team and that there is no legally binding
document that ensures the team will move to Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's been some confusion in recent days regarding
the status of the team, and this is intended to clarify where the
Ellman Companies is coming from and also clarify Mr. Kemp's role in
the process,'' said Bob Kaufman, senior vice president for the
Ellman Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp spokeswoman Lynn McCluggage said, ``The (Ellman) statement
is accurate. We are not making any comment until something has been
finalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman declined to say who is included in Kemp's investor
group, but said, ``The people who are involved in the process are
very formidable people, well-respected people.'' &QL; 
Though acknowledging he has had discussions with potential
investors trying to buy the Coyotes from Burke, Gretzky hedged when
asked if he has met privately with Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' Gretzky said, smiling and winking an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, the NHL's all-time leading scorer with 894 goals and
2,857 points, has said he'd like to spend at least a year, maybe
two, away from the game after retiring last season. But he added
that he finds the idea of running a professional sports franchise
particularly exciting.
</P>
<P>
   His good friend, fellow Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux, purchased
the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins this summer, rescuing the team from
Bankruptcy Court. And another close friend, Michael Jordan,
recently took over the front office for the NBA's Washington
Wizards. &QL; 
``I was with (Jordan) last week (during the Super Bowl) and I saw
all the headaches he had,'' Gretzky said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Gretzky recently launched mvp.com, an online sporting
goods company, with retired Super Bowl MVP John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I know best is hockey,'' Gretzky said. ``Maybe
one day down the road, eventually somehow, someway, I'll be back
involved in the game of hockey. But at this point and time, I'm
loving being Wayne Gretzky and doing what I'm doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said to Mr. Bettman (NHL Commissioner Gary Bett man) last
night, anything they want me to do or ask me to do to help the
game, I would. But at this point and time, I don't want a full-time
commitment.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-ASSESS (Vienna, Austria) _ A news analysis: Why did the
European Union swing its big gun of isolation threat on Austria
when it hadn't on Italy when neo-Fascists entered government there
in 1994, and when it has its usual day-to-day relations with
dictatorships from Cuba to Libya to Iraq? By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
1,400 words.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COMMUNAL-APARTMENTS (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ By the
Russian logic of Tanya Konyenko, there is a good reason why she
must leave her apartment, trudge five flights downstairs and walk
to the local banya, all simply to take a bath. Her apartment
doesn't have hot water, but that is not why. Actually, her
apartment doesn't have a bathtub. But that is not why, either. The
reason is that if her apartment had a bathtub, then she would have
to share it with two 20-ish men, a 17-year-old girl and her
18-year-old brother, their 40-year old mother, a 64-year-old woman,
her 65-year-old husband, a 70-year-old babushka, her 72-year-old
husband, and finally, with her own husband, Yura. It is the very
essence of that most Soviet of Russian institutions, the communal
flat. In Tanya and Yura's apartment, what people share would make
Jerry Springer blush. By Michael Wines. 1,800 words.

   TULSA-RACE-RIOT (Tulsa, Okla.) _ Nearly 80 years after this city
erupted in what many historians regard as the nation's bloodiest
race riot, a state commission recommends reparations be made to the
aged black survivors who watched as their friends and relatives
were shot, burned alive or tied to cars and dragged to death. The
preliminary findings of the Tulsa Race Riot Commission are expected
to provoke a contentious debate in the Oklahoma Legislature, which
convenes Monday. By Jim Yardley. 1,300 words.

</P>
<P>
   ILL-DEATH-CASES (Chicago) _ As Illinois examines what went wrong
with a justice system that sent 13 innocent men to death row, one
common thread has already emerged: poorly financed, often
incompetent defense lawyers who failed to uncover and present key
evidence. In one case, a defense lawyer failed to prepare any
strategy for his client at the death penalty hearing the day after
the conviction. Another defense lawyer rambled so incoherently
during a death penalty trial that a state supreme court justice
wrote it ``would border on the comical if only it were
make-believe.'' By Dirk Johnson. 1,200 words.

<P>
   BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Austin, Texas) _ The day after Gov. George W.
Bush's defeat in the New Hampshire primary, he arrived in South
Carolina with a broad smile and a robust arsenal of optimistic
metaphors. ``There's bumps in the road,'' Bush said at a news
conference in Greenville, S.C., on Wednesday. But, he added, what
lay ahead was ``a long, smooth highway.'' Neither his voice nor his
words reflected the heap of trouble he was in. That held true when
the Texas governor later chatted with reporters and saw fit to
mention that while he wanted the presidency, he was both grounded
and rounded enough to move on with his life if he did not get it.

Warner-Lambert Co., a union that would create America's largest
drug maker, people close to the company said Friday. A deal could
be announced as soon as Monday. By Melody Petersen and Laura M.

</P>
<P>
   KIMCHI (Hoengsong-gun, South Korea) _ Ever since Japan colonized
the Korean peninsula during the first half of the 20th century,
Koreans have harbored an underlying resentment toward the Japanese.
But the latest incarnation of that resentment is not an uproar over
newly disclosed wartime atrocities by Japan's military or a fresh
instance of discrimination against ethnic Koreans living in Japan.
It is, instead, a growing anger over what some Koreans view as
Japan's attempt to co-opt their national dish: a garlicky, peppery,
overwhelmingly pungent pickled cabbage called kimchi. By Calvin
Sims.

EDITORIAL: THE DIFFICULT CASE OF JOHN ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 5:
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker's comments in Sports Illustrated in December were
ignorant, offensive and worthy of the condemnation that his
teammates, the public and now the commissioner of baseball have
heaped upon them. Rocker, a relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves
who had earlier won notoriety by berating Mets fans during the
National League Championship Series last October, broadened his
target to include foreigners, gays and others. He also called one
of his black teammates ``a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, was right to condemn
Rocker for remarks that, he said, had ``offended practically every
element of society'' and dishonored Major League Baseball, the
Atlanta Braves and Rocker himself. Selig was also right to order
counseling and therapy for a troubled young man whose capacity for
erratic behavior seems to have been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's condemnation sends a message that there are certain
forms of behavior that organized baseball simply cannot tolerate.
More broadly, it sends a message to professional sports in general,
including basketball and football, which are being embarrassed on
what seems like a daily basis by out-of-control athletes off the
field. The message, in simplest terms, is that because athletes
receive great visibility in American society, they and their
employers carry special obligations to make sure they behave
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   While we applaud organized baseball for trying to come to grips
with an escalating problem, we are troubled by its decision to go
the additional step of fining Rocker for a mistake that involved
offensive speech rather than physical misconduct or violations of
the law. Rocker was assessed $20,000 and suspended from spring
training and the first month of the season. This diminishes the
principle that the best response to hateful speech is constructive
speech and public condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this principle is sorely tested by people like
Rocker, just as it is by extremist politicians and others who share
his cramped and bigoted views. But it is a vital principle
nonetheless. Both the Braves and baseball were right to make an
official response, but condemnation and counseling would have
seemed sufficient in this case.

EDITORIAL: MILITARY RUMBLINGS IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's passage from army-backed dictatorship to freely
elected civilian government over the past two years, though
accompanied by terrible economic hardships, is one of Asia's great
political success stories. But that achievement is now threatened
by a tense confrontation between President Abdurrahman Wahid and
Indonesia's most powerful military figure, Gen. Wiranto. For
democracy to survive in the world's fourth-largest country, Wahid
must prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's accession to power last fall marked a clear change at
the top of the country's political structure. But at lower levels,
much power remained in military hands. Wahid has tried, gingerly,
to ease the army out of politics and subject it to civilian
authority and justice.
</P>
<P>
   The current crisis was triggered when a government human rights
commission this week found Wiranto responsible for much of the
killing and destruction carried out by pro-Indonesian militias on
East Timor last year. The commission recommended his criminal
indictment. Wahid appropriately asked the general to resign
immediately as minister for security affairs. Wahid also said that
Wiranto would be tried, but promised to pardon the general if he is
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiranto has refused to resign. Wahid, who is traveling in
Europe, returns to Indonesia on Feb. 13. Meanwhile there are
mounting fears that some of Wiranto's military supporters may be
plotting a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Any military move against the elected government would have
devastating consequences. Washington has already said that
Indonesia would find itself internationally isolated. Foreign
investors would withdraw their funds. Most important, Indonesia's
people would strongly resist any return to military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has warned restive officers that the civilian authorities
are now in charge and urged them to be careful. Washington and
other democratic governments must do everything in their power to
discourage Indonesian military officers from challenging Wahid's
authority. His continued constitutional rule offers Indonesia its
best hope for a peaceful and prosperous future.

CELTICS RALLY PAST NETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a shame. The Nets still haven't learned. It's one thing to
lose a game in which you blow a 17-point lead. It's even more
distressing when you don't understand how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the visitors from the New Jersey swamps lose to the
Celtics Friday night? The visitors say Tony Battie. They, of
course, are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the 16,540 FleetCenter fans could tell you that the Nets
lost because they have no mastery of details. They were certainly
singed by the volcano masquerading as Battie, but this game went
beyond his performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have a win to talk about this morning, thanks to
their bench. The unit, known as the Bomb Squad, gave the team
nothing in the first half. But the Bombers were responsible for the
team's 100-95 comeback win over the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely what you would call a team win,'' Antoine
Walker said. ``Nobody really played a great game. There wasn't a
`star.' But we all did something to help.''
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't walk through the Celtics' jubilant locker room
without bumping into someone who assisted in pulling this game out
of the Loss Receptacle. The team was bad in the first half and
awful in the third quarter. Walker was booed. Paul Pierce missed a
dunk. Rick Pitino pulled the starters in the third quarter and had
to think about a comeback (82-65 late in the third) with Calbert
Cheaney, Walter McCarty, Dana Barros, Doug Overton, and Battie on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Pitino was so excited by the win that he said he felt
like he was back at Providence College.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third, the Celtics had already reduced the
deficit to 12 (82-70).
</P>
<P>
   Of course there was Battie, who played 16 energized minutes in
the second half and finished with 14 points and five rebounds. He
had 9 of those points in the fourth quarter. His most definitive
hoop came with four minutes left. Pierce had missed a free throw
that would have tied the game at 88. Battie retrieved the miss and
dunked it over a flat-footed Jamie Feick.
</P>
<P>
   Details, details. Coaches always tell you to put a body on the
player beside you. Feick didn't. His mistake helped the Celtics go
ahead, 89-88.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Adrian Griffin. If Griffin played baseball, he
would be a run-saving center fielder. It was Griffin's layup with
1:32 left that put the Celtics up, 94-92. And, 14 seconds later, it
was on his watch that Scott Burrell made a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to make up for that play,'' Griffin said of
The Save. ``Burrell beat me at the other end, so I wanted to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   With his team trailing by 1 point, Griffin did a couple things.
First, he caught Kendall Gill sleepwalking. With just over a minute
to play, the ball was headed out of bounds. It was going to be off
the Celtics. Gill casually put his body between the ball and
Griffin. Details, details. Gill didn't put his sculpted body on
Griffin, so the man known as ``Old School Adrian'' ran around Gill,
chased down the ball and threw it off Gill out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   That play gave the Celtics another possession. Griffin still
wasn't done. After a Walker miss, Old School got the rebound. The
ball wound up in the hands of Kenny Anderson, who made a 12-footer
for the lead with 47.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you can see that what the Celtics say is true. It was a
team win. By now, you should also understand why the talented Nets
are 17-29. Keith Van Horn actually said, ``We got outhustled by one
guy: Tony Battie.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. They were outhustled by 11 men (Pervis Ellison did not
play). Things got so bad for the Nets that when the game needed to
be won, the ball was not in the hands of Stephon Marbury or Kerry
Kittles or Van Horn. The man who wound up with the ball was
7-footer Jim McIlvaine. There they were a few feet from the hoop,
McIlvaine and 6-6 Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce blocked McIlvaine's shot and held on to the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey coaching staff screamed for something, but got
nothing. Marbury (20 points, 11 assists) was forced to foul
Anderson and he made two free throws for a 98-95 lead.
</P>
<P>
   We have told you that this was a night for details. So with 17.1
seconds left and the Nets needing a 3 to tie, it should surprise no
one that the deed was nearly botched. Twice. Before they could run
their final play, the Nets had to call two timeouts because they
were on the verge of getting five-second violations. They could not
throw the ball in successfully.
</P>
<P>
   All you had to do was glance at coach Don Casey and you could
see how annoyed he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team works hard,'' he said, ``but it is so fragile that
it just splinters.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ball finally got in, the plan was to run Burrell off a
pick and set him up for a 3. The screen came, but it wasn't a very
good one. Neither was the shot, which was challenged by Battie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Battie was the key,'' Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   The poor Nets. They still don't get it.

PRADA PUTS END TO SKID TO FORCE DECIDING RACE
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATED with 8th race) 
 (rk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ A day after a humbling defeat that
pushed it to the verge of elimination, Italy's Prada Challenge
rebounded to beat America One Saturday and set up a decisive ninth
and final race in the challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
   With the Louis Vuitton series now tied at 4-4, the winner of
Sunday's race will take on Team New Zealand for the America's Cup,
which is scheduled to begin Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   It has been one of the closest matchups in the history of the
America's Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said Paul Cayard, the America One
skipper, who had won three races in a row after falling behind by
3-1. ``I think everyone on our team is a little bummed that we
didn't end this business.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's seventh race, the Italian afterguard of Francesco de
Angelis, the skipper, and Torben Grael, the tactician, had started
tentatively and then collapsed. Not Saturday. Prada held the upper
hand in the cat-and-mouse pre-start maneuvers, forcing Cayard away
from the left-hand side he had said he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, de Angelis elbowed Cayard out and started to the left
with a two-second lead and America One positioned a hair behind and
to windward. Unlike the starts of the previous two races, where the
boats split almost immediately, both skippers patiently held on to
starboard tack, each in search of the answer to the same, crucial
question: Who was faster in the moderate 12- to 14-knot
southwesterly breeze?
</P>
<P>
   The teasing wind shifted slightly to the left, then the right,
negating either crew's meager gains. After about six minutes, Prada
had nosed ahead by a boat length. But America One, holding the
inside slot, held a slim tactical advantage as the boats continued
to the corner of the course.
</P>
<P>
   There, Cayard blinked first and made the day's first mistake.
Believing he was on the lay line _ meaning he could sail to the
mark on one tack _ he went for it. Prada followed immediately, but
now the Italians were in control. When the wind swung right and
headed them on their approach to the mark, the Americans needed two
tacks to the Italians' one.
</P>
<P>
   Prada rounded 20 seconds in the lead. But Cayard was not out of
it. Prada rounded the mark and performed a bearaway spinnaker set,
a hoist mimicked by the San Franciscans. But Cayard called for a
jibe and split away from the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   It set up his second critical error, one from which he would not
recover. Prada and America One converged. Cayard cut inside, with
the Americans now obliged to stay clear of the Italians under the
right-of-way rules. Already, the U.S. boat had drawn two fouls for
its failure to do so. Now, de Angelis had Cayard directly in his
sights. He luffed hard _ that is, he boldly pushed his bow into the
wind _ and Cayard followed.
</P>
<P>
   But not quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rolling them, and they luffed us,'' Cayard said. ``We
didn't hit them, but we were to windward, so we were the keep-clear
boat. The umpires must have felt like we got too close.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires waved the checkered penalty flag, meaning America
One would need to spin a 270-degree turn at some point to exonerate
itself for the blunder. After a shaky spinnaker drop, the San
Francisco boat rounded the bottom mark 19 seconds astern.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard went into attack mode, initiating a tacking duel back up
the second windward mark. In previous races, Prada's Grael had
stuck with the match-racing textbook, but he wouldn't Saturday.
Matching America One, he slowly, steadily extended his lead, which
was a solid 30 seconds at the course's halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   As the breeze began to die, so too did America One's hopes.
Cayard continued to press hard, but the penalty looming over him
put a severe shortage on his options. With the wind down to 10
knots at the start of the final leg, America One was only 16
seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's crew set a gennaker, rather than a conventional
spinnaker, to boost its speed. Running out of race course, he
needed to pass Prada and lure his opponents into a foul. But the
Italians, cool and calm for the first time in nearly a week, were
having none of it. Denying Cayard any semblance of a passing lane,
they held to win by 37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 200 races in the Louis Vuitton series, the
Italian victory sets up a winner-take-all match. Cayard was
philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into today, there were two races and the odds were we'd
each win one,'' he said. ``So, what happened today is probably good
for us. Tomorrow is going to be a tight, close race and, hopefully,
we're going to win.''

TEXAS MAKES PUSH TO UPGRADE BASKETBALL FACILITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ If there is one credo to which Texas men's basketball
coach Rick Barnes subscribes, it is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever stop trying to get better, you're going to get
worse. Because your competition is going to keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   To that he adds: ``I never believed in keeping up with the
Joneses. I've always believed in keeping ahead. You set the
standard. And that's what the University of Texas is about. The
question we have to answer is, Are we doing all we can to be at the
very top?''
</P>
<P>
   Though change is on the horizon, the immediate answer to Barnes'
question as it concerns basketball is ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of overall athletic facilities, few universities are
equal to the University of Texas at Austin after a recent $93
million capital improvement project. Improvements included a
renovation of Royal-Memorial Stadium and the adjoining
Moncrief-Neuhaus Football Complex, adding football practice fields
and building impressive new homes for the track, soccer and
softball programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other than office relocation and remodeling in Belmont Hall,
however, little was spent on basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Pending some administrative shuffling, however, attention might
turn to the one area where two of the university's major athletic
programs _ men's and women's basketball _ trail the high-dollar
pace set by competitors in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   UT president Larry Faulkner is expected to grant approval to
place the Frank Erwin Center under athletic-department domain. If
that happens, UT is looking toward refurbishing the Longhorns'
23-year-old home and building a dual practice facility on the
elevated lot south of the Super Drum _ as the 16,175-seat Erwin
Center was dubbed when it opened in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any conversation right now is just that,'' athletic director
DeLoss Dodds said. ``But we are looking at some things. We have a
great place to play that needs some fixing and changing. And we do
need a practice facility.''
</P>
<P>
   When Faulkner endorses the Erwin Center's move from the control
of the business department, that could signal the first step toward
capital improvements. UT regents have approved feasibility studies.
For the time being, Texas is being outpaced by Texas Tech, Texas
A&AMP;M, Oklahoma State and Oklahoma in major spending on facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, right now, that is true,'' Dodds said.
</P>
<P>
   Tech is playing its first season in the $62 million United
Spirit Arena. A&AMP;M is in the second year inside $37 million Reed
Arena. Oklahoma State is in the midst of construction of a $54
million athletic center that includes a remake and expansion of
storied Gallagher-Iba Arena. Grand opening is scheduled Dec. 1,
2001. The Oklahoma board of regents approved Wednesday a $16.3
million refurbishing and expansion of the Lloyd Noble Center, due
for completion by the start of the 2001-2002 season. At Baylor, the
arrival of new men's basketball coach Dave Bliss has spurred a
$500,000 project, already begun, to improve the Ferrell Center _ a
project already begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to recruit against the best schools in the country
there is no question that recruits make comparisons,'' Barnes said.
``You can't be naive enough to think they don't compare facilities.
They go into locker rooms, they look at the pictures on the wall,
they look at all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's coach and director of athletics Jody Conradt joins
Barnes in pushing for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all anxiously awaiting the president's decision
concerning the Erwin Center,'' Conradt said. ``If we do move ahead
on this project, my No. 1 wish and concern is the building of a
basketball practice facility. We need a `home' for Texas
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Both staffs constantly juggle practice times and sites dependent
on the Erwin Center's availability. Dressing rooms are out of date.
Money-making luxury suites and a new club level are also on the
wish list, as is some kind of a plan to bring the seating closer to
the court and get students more involved. Many believe that Texas'
crowd is the least influential of any of the top programs in the
Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reconfigure the arena itself and bring our fans
that much closer to the action in order to create a greater
home-court advantage,'' Conradt said. ``There is also a need to
update our facilities and add amenities for our fans and for our
student-athletes. Most definitely there is a need to upgrade our
team lounge and locker room areas so that these match what our
competition is doing.''

LIFE SEEMS LIKE ALL WORK, NO PLAY FOR STARS' MODANO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Mike Modano says if his contract were up at the end of
this season he probably wouldn't sign with the Stars, or any other
NHL team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I would say I wouldn't sign on anywhere. I'll play
the remainder of the years out and see what happens, but I doubt
it,'' said Modano, 29, who is signed with the Stars through the
2004 season. ``It's like anything. You just have a change of heart,
a change of attitude. When your job is not fun and you are not
enjoying going to the rink, you really have to think about what you
are doing and what your future holds.''
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't make clear the kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde season
Modano's having, nothing will.
</P>
<P>
   A season that began with talk of scoring 100 points and winning
another Stanley Cup quickly turned into an exercise in frustration
with more dips than a John Rocker popularity poll.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 53 games of the season, Modano has been removed
from a game on a stretcher, talked about retiring, suffered two
concussions, became a spokesman for less violence in the NHL,
struggled to score, been named captain, battled a hand injury left
over from the Cup run, agonized as the Stars lost, watched key
teammates get hurt, had an hourlong sitdown with Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock, and, oh, yeah, been selected an NHL All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   He grimaced when he first heard he had been selected. Not that
he didn't want to go. He said he didn't deserve to be going. He
wasn't, in his opinion, playing well enough to be among those in
Toronto this weekend for the 50th NHL All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you get picked, you'd like to think the way
you played the first half is the reason why,'' Modano said. ``You
definitely want to be playing some good hockey, which I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he has played since being selected, though, makes one
wonder what he's worried about. He has 10 points and a plus-four
rating in eight games since coming back from his second concussion.
</P>
<P>
   He has done so while playing on a line with two guys _ Brenden
Morrow and Blake Sloan _ who weren't in the NHL this time last
year. He's done this despite opponents focusing their primary
checking lines on him while Joe Nieuwendyk has been sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   He looks like the do-as-I'm-doing player he was in the Stanley
Cup Finals against Buffalo. He played such a grab-the-torch-and-go
game in Thursday's 2-0 victory in Phoenix, scoring a goal to help
pull the Stars into a tie in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   He has a team-leading 22 goals and 23 assists, which doesn't
seem like a lot compared with the Jaromir Jagrs and Pavel Bures of
the world and their race to 50 goals.
</P>
<P>
   But as Stars winger Mike Keane aptly noted: ``I think it's real
difficult to have a career numbers year around this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' defensive style doesn't lend itself to those kinds of
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minutes-of-hell style is a hard way to play, the demands
are excessive especially on Modano. He's expected to be their
leading scorer and shut down the other team's top player night
after night.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Hitchcock said when asked if that's Modano's duty.
``What I want him to do is be the best player every shift during
the hockey game, which is even higher. That's a hell of a load for
a guy to carry every day. But he's a guy capable of carrying that
load.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock went on to cite Colorado's Peter Forsberg as an
example of a player who does that.
</P>
<P>
   Only Modano isn't Forsberg. He can't be the physical force
Forsberg is. It isn't him.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, Mo's not a very confrontational guy,'' explained Grant
Marshall, a Stars winger and Modano's good friend. ``He's a quiet
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the kind of guy who's never ready for Anaheim's Ruslan
Salei.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second game of the season and Modano already had two
goals. He had been skating hard when Salei nudged him from behind,
sending Modano crashing head first into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think when you see it that there is no way he didn't break
his neck,'' Stars center Brian Skrudland said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano had to be removed from the ice on a stretcher, but he he
walked away with a broken nose, ligament damage in his neck and a
mild concussion. Forgetting proved to be a little harder for the
always-emotional Modano.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, he said he would retire if the
close-call injuries kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Mike for a long time,'' Stars play-by-play
announcer Ralph Strangis said. ``He takes things very personally
and deeply. He's puts out an image of a guy that doesn't care or a
`Life of Riley' guy. Like if he get booed, he feels it.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, of course, has heard the criticism that comes with
failing to live up to expectations. The idea has always been that
as Modano goes, the team goes. So the Stars' early-season struggles
became linked with his own.
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Modano will be the first to say he hasn't
had his best season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get off to a great start. If October goes
well, I think that sets the tone for the rest of the year,'' Modano
said. ``Well, October was OK, not great. And in November and
December, it got even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Hitchcock sat a frustrated Modano down on Jan. 13
in Vancouver, British Colubia.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock didn't challenge him, but simply told Modano he needed
to start enjoying the journey. Hitchcock said the expectations
Modano had for himself and this season would take care of
themselves if he enjoyed the daily 60-minute battles of which a
season is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in the now is very important if you want to have
success. It's the only way because the big picture changes. It
changed after two games for him,'' Hitchcock said. ``Suddenly, he
was looking to get back healthy. Then, suddenly, his plus-minus has
gone for rot. All of the sudden the team isn't winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things that, if you get overwhelmed by that,
it's not any fun when you get to the end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Modano having fun?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bits and pieces that are fun,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   He loves the players, the feeling he gets when they're all on a
plane together cracking jokes or hunkered down in the dressing room
between the second and third periods of a tight game. These are the
things that he says he'd miss if he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   He still thinks, though, that he could. ``Right now, I wouldn't
have a problem with that,'' Modano said. ``But we'll see what
happens in three to four years. Four years is a long time.''

MAGIC JOHNSON SAYS MAVS MAKING A MISTAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Future Hall of Famer Magic Johnson said
preferential treatment the Mavericks have outlined for Dennis
Rodman is a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what everybody says, it's going to affect them,
because everybody is still a human being, everybody is an
athlete,'' Johnson said at halftime of last night's game between
Utah and the Los Angeles Lakers. ``They should have no special
deals and no special concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kareem \RAbdul-Jabbar\S had the same timeline as the rest of
the players. I had the same timeline as the other players. So when
you as the leader are there on time, and you're doing the same wind
sprints and everything like everybody else, it makes everybody else
do it. When you don't do it, it drags everybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who signed a contract with the Mavericks on Thursday,
doesn't have to attend the team's shootarounds. He also can ride
the stationary bicycle instead of practicing, and he doesn't have
to be at the games until 25 minutes after the rest of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the Mavericks, who have won eight of their past 11
games, are flirting with a ticking time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say 12 o'clock, they're all looking to say everybody's
got to be here at 12 o'clock,'' Johnson said. ``Now when one player
gets to be here at 1 instead of 12, I don't care what nobody says,
that affects guys.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Mavericks players endorsed the Rodman Rules. But
Johnson believes that's a farce.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else are they going to say?'' Johnson said. ``If they
don't say it, they're going to have problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't go against what the owner wants, or what everybody
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, part-owner and vice president of the Lakers, emphasized
that he's a big Rodman fan. He also said Rodman's penchant for
partying could also have an adverse effect on the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't party all night and then try to come out here and
play in the NBA any more,'' Johnson said. ``He's not of age any
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to understand he's an older guy. And he's
thirtysomething and these power forwards are twentysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Rodman, 38, has a chance to help the Mavericks,
under one condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gives up the partying, the nightlife and concentrate on
his game, he could possibly do some things. If he don't, it's not
going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Dennis Rodman. I'm the biggest Dennis Rodman fan out
there. But where do you help Dallas out? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman played 23 games for the Lakers last season before they
waived him after too many distractions. Johnson said he knew early
on that the relationship wasn't going to work.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that if the Mavericks were smart, they would nip
those special treatments for Rodman in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he can help Dallas, and the only way, is by coming in
and being a leader,'' Johnson said. ``Being a leader on defense,
being a leader on the offensive boards and following the rules like
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to let him be like everybody else.''
\Nsubheds:Smith waived The Mavericks officially parted with
19-year-old rookie Leon Smith, placing the 6-foot-10 rookie forward
on waivers yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith clears the 48-hour waiver period he becomes a free
agent. Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National
Basketball Players Association, said at least four teams _

AIRPORT EXPANSION SCHEDULE SCRAPPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
BURBANK, Calif. - The city of Burbank abandoned expansion talks
with Burbank Airport on Friday, saying it's a waste of time and
money to continue because of Federal Aviation Administration
opposition.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The city had hoped to make a final decision on whether to
approve a proposed airport expansion deal by the end of April. But
on Friday, the whole schedule was scrapped. City officials say they
will not resume talks until they get definitive answers about the
proposal from the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA says they want you to come up with a local solution,
and you work your ass off to get one, then the FAA says it's not
good enough, but won't tell you why,'' Burbank Mayor Stacey Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank officials said the whole deal might have to be killed if
the FAA raises certain objections. They are most concerned that the
FAA will force them to drop a plan to close the terminal from 11
p.m to 7 a.m. because of intense airline opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city's proposal to continue a ban on eastern
takeoffs may also be in jeopardy because of opposition from
powerful Los Angeles politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing letter to airport officials, Murphy said it was
irresponsible of FAA Chief Jane Garvey to state in a November
letter that parts of the deal were illegal without explaining why.
She accused Garvey of caving in to pressure from the airlines to
kill the proposed expansion agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said it's a waste of taxpayer money to continue work on
the development agreement until the FAA has informed the city
whether the deal is viable. Murphy asked that the FAA make its
position clear by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Barker, a spokesman for the FAA, said Garvey was not
available for comment Friday. However, he released a statement from
the FAA regarding Burbank's decision. The statement did not respond
to Murphy's allegations that the FAA has intentionally hindered
local agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since receiving the framework agreement from the city and the
airport authority, we have spent many many hours in discussions
with both parties on all parts of the framework. Those discussions
included identifying specific areas of concern and doing exactly
what the mayor asked - discussing how those concerns could be
mitigated,'' the FAA statement reads.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank city and airport officials have spent the last six
months attempting to craft a development agreement for the
airport's proposed new terminal. In August, the city and the
airport took the first steps toward a deal by reaching a framework
agreement on expansion. That treaty was a major step, as the city
had spent four years and millions of dollars on a legal war to
fight unlimited airport growth.
</P>
<P>
   Public hearings on the development agreement were to begin in
coming weeks, with the Burbank City Council set to make a final
decision by the end of April. City Manager Robert ``Bud'' Ovrom
said all such schedules have been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to work blind on this any more,'' Ovrom said.
``If there's blood on anyone's hands, it's Jane Garvey's.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport Authority President Carl Meseck said he agrees with
Murphy that local leaders need to press Garvey for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share in that frustration,'' Meseck said. ``We are asking
her to give us some direction. (Murphy's letter) will probably help
to bring things to a quicker conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Meseck said he hopes the airport project does not get stalled
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a terminal located too close to the runways, and
that problem has to be solved,'' Meseck said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are most concerned that the FAA might eventually
rule that closing the terminal between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. violates
federal law. Although flights would still be able to land at night,
the closure would provide a disincentive to airlines to fly in the
middle of the night. City officials have said that the whole deal
will die if the closure is knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have come out strongly against the terminal closure
idea, dubbing it a ``de facto curfew'' and saying it would set a
precedent other airports nationwide might try to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey urged local leaders in fall 1998 to come up with a local
solution to their dispute. Ovrom said that since then, he suspects
the airlines have been pressuring her to kill the terminal closure
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened with this Jane Garvey Jekyll and
Hyde thing,'' Ovrom said. ``It would appear she turned on us
because of pressure from the airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Pasadena, who represents Burbank and
Glendale, supports the ban on eastern takeoffs. He said Garvey may
be trying to appease the Democratic congressmen who represent the
Los Angeles communities west of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA reversed itself on its call for a local solution just
as the Democratic congressmen have increased pressure to lift the
ban on eastern takeoffs,'' Rogan said. ``Back in my days as a
judge, we'd call that circumstantial evidence.

SHARP SQUAD OR BIG FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By now, you might have gotten the impression the
marquee is wrong when it says there are two pro basketball teams in
the Staples Center this season.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not the setup for a Clippers joke.
</P>
<P>
   It must seem there are three pro basketball teams playing home
games in the downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers. Also the Lakers of the 16-game winning streak. And
the Lakers of the six-losses-in-nine-games slump that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that the Lakers' ``A'' squad that took Utah apart Friday
night, holding the Jazz to 21 points in the first half of a 113-67
victory in front of a sellout crowd of 18,997?
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the Lakers' ``B'' team took the evening off,
watching the game from one of the Staples Center's luxury suites,
hidden away from public view.
</P>
<P>
   But actually there is only one set of gold and purple uniforms
hanging in that locker room. The very, very good Lakers and the
very, very bad Lakers are one and the same team.
</P>
<P>
   What they are, also, is the best living example of the adage
that a team is never as good as it looks when it's winning or as
bad as it looks when it's losing in the course of a long season.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking back to a month ago, to the night the Lakers
knocked off a double-digit Charlotte Hornets lead in the fourth
quarter to run their early-season winning streak to 13 games.
People were getting carried with the Lakers back then, talking
about their chances for a 33-game winning streak and a 70-win
season.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody with a schedule in his pocket knew harder times lay
ahead. The Lakers had been playing the softest part of their
calendar. Starting with that Charlotte game, they'd play 11 of
their next 14 games against teams with better-than-.500 records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will lose a game,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said then.
``And then we'll see what we're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   That 14-game stretch ran out Friday night. The Lakers went 8-6
and took a half-step down in the standings, backing into a
first-place tie with the Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA's
Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   What's important to remember is that they are the same
collection of strengths and weaknesses they were a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Lakers were at their peak, on the weekend when
they wiped out big leads by Charlotte and the Seattle SuperSonics,
their shortcomings already were being written about.
</P>
<P>
   About how Shaquille O'Neal couldn't possibly keep playing 45
minutes a game. And, sure enough, signs of fatigue have been
showing up in the form of single-digit rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   About how the power-forward position continued to be a worry.
And, right on cue, Robert Horry went into a funk and A.C. Green
practically disappeared, Green failing to shoot a free throw since
Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   About how the point guards weren't going to scare anybody. And,
as if we'd planned it, opposing guards began to drive right past
them, and Fisher slipped back a shooting slump.
</P>
<P>
   About the danger of relying on three scorers _ O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant and Glen Rice _ for two-thirds of the team's points. And,
don't say you weren't warned, when Rice got lost in the triangle
offense, there was no reliable scorer to pick up his slack.
</P>
<P>
   About how Rice's season's-end free agency might create and
increasing distraction as the Feb. 24 trading deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
   And about how it was inevitable that the rest of the league
would begin to figure the Lakers out. Which it did, confronting
them with defenses for which they hadn't learned the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule played a trick on the Lakers. It gave them the
chance to win the 16 in a row at the precise time when the league
thought they'd be struggling to absorb new head coach Phil
Jackson's offense. Then it lowered the boom, threw different and
tougher defenses at them, knocking them back into that learning
phase just when they might have thought they'd got it all figured
out.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson mused Friday night about not wanting his players ``to be
complacent about what we accomplished in the first half of the
season.'' There probably was no danger of that as they carried a
two-game losing streak into the Utah game.
</P>
<P>
   It was amusing to graph the Lakers' rising concern as their six
losses in nine games piled up.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, 111-102. ``Must be the Sports Illustrated jinx or
something,'' O'Neal said, shrugging off the Lakers' first defeat in
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, 82-82, Gary Payton scoring 36 on them, including the
game-winning 3-pointer. ``Everybody had a piece of (the blame),''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, 95-91. ``We ran out of gas,'' Jackson said, sounding
puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, 105-101 in double overtime. Jackson: ``I don't think we
played as smart as we could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, 89-83, the Lakers' first loss to a sub-.500 team in
more than two months. Jackson: ``An embarrassing performance.''
</P>
<P>
   And San Antonio, 105-81 on Tuesday, knocking the Lakers
temporarily out of first place. Rick Fox: ``We didn't respond in
any sort of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the euphoria of 16 in a row had masked the Lakers'
weaknesses, the despair of 3-6 covered up the good news in this
latest 14-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In what was supposed to be the hardest part of the schedule, the
Lakers went 6-5 against teams that would make the playoffs if they
began today, including 3-2 on the road. If that's as hard as it
gets, they'll be one formidable team in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   One team, not two.

LAKERS ROLL TO BIG VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A powerhouse mired in an inexplicable rut found
the answer to all its problems Friday night: play another
powerhouse mired in a deeper, more miserable rut.
</P>
<P>
   If there was something seriously wrong with the Los Angeles
Lakers _ and it was a fair assessment after they lost six of nine
games _ you couldn't find it at Staples Center this night. Or maybe
the Utah Jazz is really as bad as its own losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup of Western Conference rivals ended in a 113-67
Lakers rout, matching their biggest margin of victory ever against
the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' most lopsided win of the season wiped out all memory
of their recent woes _ specifically the season-worst 24-point loss
at San Antonio three days earlier _ and extending the Jazz's.
</P>
<P>
   Utah lost its sixth straight, Utah's longest losing streak since
the 1982-83 season. The Lakers, who had lost two in a row, again
avoided their first three-game losing streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also won the season series, 3-1, for just the second
time in the last 13 years. More importantly, they kept pace with
the Portland Trail Blazers and remain tied for the best record in
the NBA at 34-11.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal earned an early rest, finishing with 25 points
on 8-of-11 shooting, six rebounds and five blocks in 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The rout had panacea-like effects. It all but wiped clean the
slate for Glen Rice, whose week began with a pair of single-digit
scoring games and bitterness over being benched at San Antonio.
Rice hit a trio of 3-pointers and made 11 of 14 shots from the foul
line to score 20 points in 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant (13 points, nine assists), Ron Harper (11 points)
and Rick Fox (12 points) also finished in double figures. Utah got
no such production from its aging stars. Karl Malone missed his
first five shots of the game and bowed out with 14 points in 18
minutes. Greg Ostertag (10 points) was the only other Jazz player
to score in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a positively stunning 56-21 lead by halftime,
though it's debatable who should take credit for the outlandish
point differential _ Shaq and Co. or Utah coach Jerry Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jazz fell to a 20-point deficit in the first quarter,
Sloan apparently gave up. He pulled Karl Malone, Jeff Stockton and
Jeff Hornacek before the quarter was even over and played the rest
of the half with his second and third units _ playing punchless
combinations of Greg Ostertag, Armen Gilliam and Adam Keefe and
rookies Scott Padgett and Quincy Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   All it got the Jazz was a deeper hole. Utah scored just seven
points in the second quarter _ the second-worst quarter by a Lakers
opponent this season. Utah's 21-point half was the second-worst in
franchise history, and the Jazz shot just 21.1 percent (8 for 38).
</P>
<P>
   With an early double-digit lead, Jackson limited O'Neal to 16
minutes in the half, but he led the Lakers with 12 points and four
blocks. Bryant and Ron Harper added 11 each, as the Lakers shot
51.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The last couple weeks have been less than glorious for either
the Lakers or the Jazz _ the Utah hasn't won since its
double-overtime victory over the Lakers on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just took a lot of energy out of them when we had a
double-overtime game,'' Jackson quipped. ``We both have just
staggered around the ring. ... We just overextended them a little
bit, and they had that game the next night that they lost to
Vancouver, it kind of snowballs in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at this time of year, sometimes it's hard for anybody to
play well. Some teams get hot at this time of year that have no
reason to, and other teams have a reason to be hot and have good
players, but just can't get it together. There's things that are
weighing them down. I think that's happened to Utah. They have an
injury to Hornacek, he's not playing as well as he can, he's
hobbling around. And the load covered by Stockton and Malone must
seem to be really big at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So although they were playing perhaps as good as anybody in
the league up until last week, suddenly fortunes change quickly in
this league, and that's one of the things about this league _
there's nobody really dominant in this league. Anybody's
susceptible to it.''

   ``We're not going to work blind on this any more,'' Ovrom said.
``If there's blood on anyone's hands, it's Jane Garvey's.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport Authority President Carl Meseck said he agrees with
Murphy that local leaders need to press Garvey for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share in that frustration,'' Meseck said. ``We are asking
her to give us some direction. (Murphy's letter) will probably help
to bring things to a quicker conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Meseck said he hopes the airport project does not get stalled
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a terminal located too close to the runways, and
that problem has to be solved,'' Meseck said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are most concerned that the FAA might eventually
rule that closing the terminal between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. violates
federal law. Although flights would still be able to land at night,
the closure would provide a disincentive to airlines to fly in the
middle of the night. City officials have said that the whole deal
will die if the closure is knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have come out strongly against the terminal closure
idea, dubbing it a ``de facto curfew'' and saying it would set a
precedent other airports nationwide might try to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey urged local leaders in fall 1998 to come up with a local
solution to their dispute. Ovrom said that since then, he suspects
the airlines have been pressuring her to kill the terminal closure
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened with this Jane Garvey Jekyll and
Hyde thing,'' Ovrom said. ``It would appear she turned on us
because of pressure from the airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Pasadena, who represents Burbank and
Glendale, supports the ban on eastern takeoffs. He said Garvey may
be trying to appease the Democratic congressmen who represent the
Los Angeles communities west of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA reversed itself on its call for a local solution just
as the Democratic congressmen have increased pressure to lift the
ban on eastern takeoffs,'' Rogan said. ``Back in my days as a
judge, we'd call that circumstantial evidence.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A powerhouse mired in an inexplicable rut found
the answer to all its problems Friday night: play another
powerhouse mired in a deeper, more miserable rut.
</P>
<P>
   If there was something seriously wrong with the Los Angeles
Lakers _ and it was a fair assessment after they lost six of nine
games _ you couldn't find it at Staples Center this night. Or
perhaps the Utah Jazz is really as bad as its losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup of Western Conference rivals ended in a 113-67
Lakers rout that rewrote the record books and revised the two
teams' emotional states.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, it was a slump-busting boost. For the Jazz, a
deeper case of the blues and a six-game losing streak that stands
as the franchise's worst since 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more like it,'' said a satisfied coach Phil Jackson, as
the Lakers answered their worst defeat of the season _ a 24-point
loss at San Antonio _ with their most lopsided victory of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, which hasn't won since beating the Lakers in a
double-overtime game Jan. 24, clearly wasn't at its peak, playing
the second night of a back-to-back. But it was still an impressive
rebound by the Lakers, who again avoided their first three-game
losing streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more like a team, (the way) we like to see them play,
and played with the energy for the game we want,'' Jackson said.
``I think the combination of our energy and Utah being a little bit
worn out produced this kind of game. No one likes to see this kind
of game or be part of it. But yet we had to be glad for our energy
and the way we played.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory matched the the Lakers' biggest ever in
the all-time series with the Jazz, while Utah set a record for
fewest points by a Lakers opponent since the advent of the shot
clock.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a 21-point lead in the first quarter, and the
Jazz never challenged, withering under a rejuvenated Laker defense.
</P>
<P>
   Utah scored just seven points in the second quarter _ the
second-worst period by a Lakers opponent this season _ and just 21
in the first half, the second-worst in Jazz history and two off the
NBA record that the Lakers held the Clippers to earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played an enthusiastic game tonight,'' said Ron Harper, who
had three steals to go with 11 points. ``That was a very good
defensive (effort). I think that's the best we played in a long,
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal led the early assault and finished with 25
points on 8-of-11 shooting, six rebounds and five blocks in 28
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much did what we had to do, and we came out with a
lot of nergy,'' O'Neal said. ``We kind of needed this game. We knew
that they were struggling just like we were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers kept pace with the Portland Trail Blazers and remain
tied for the best record in the NBA at 34-11.
</P>
<P>
   The rout had panacea-like effects. It all but wiped clean the
slate for Glen Rice, whose week began with a pair of single-digit
scoring games and bitterness over being benched at San Antonio.
Rice hit a trio of 3-pointers and made 11 of 14 shots from the foul
line to score 20 points in 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Utah got no such production from its aging stars. Karl Malone
missed his first five shots of the game and bowed out with 14
points in 18 minutes. After the Jazz fell to a 20-point deficit in
the first quarter, Utah coach Jerry Sloan appeared to give up. He
pulled 30-somethings Malone, John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek before
the quarter was even over and played the rest of the half with his
reserves. Stockton finished with two points.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers didn't get an accurate gauge of their improvement,
but did get a sorely needed big win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, yeah,'' Fox said. ``This isn't actually a true
test of whether or not we've learned from our mistakes, but tonight
we came out and we decided not to let it get to that. It was all
defense, to tell you the truth, and we fed off of it.''

USC VOLLEYBALL TEAM STUNS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Suddenly, Pauley Pavilion became the Rose Bowl.
The World Cup became the Kilgour Cup. USC men's volleyball players
ran around the court Friday, throwing off their jerseys and
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the party was USC sophomore outside hitter
Brook Billings, doing his best Brandi Chastain impression.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-ranked Trojans had just ended a 13-match, eight-year
losing streak to UCLA with a 13-15, 15-10, 6-15, 15-6, 15-11
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation victory over the previously
undefeated and No. 1-ranked Bruins before 2,287 fans.
</P>
<P>
   USC (7-1, 5-0) also had just won the Kilgour Cup, a one-match
event honoring a former UCLA great, for the first time in eight
tries.
</P>
<P>
   Billings had done his part with a match-high 33 kills. Now, he
was running around looking like he wanted someone to drape a
world-championship medal around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like soccer when you score a goal,'' Billings said. ``But
I'm not a chick, and I'm not wearing a sports bra.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, USC understandably felt elation. The Trojans hadn't
beaten the Bruins (9-1, 3-1) since something called the UCLA
Classic in 1991. Nor had they won in Pauley since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   To beat the Bruins at home, one often needs a big effort from a
big player, and Billings, at 6-foot-5, fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game started, I looked at the ground, thinking
every ball I hit, I had to concentrate on hitting it down,''
Billings said.
</P>
<P>
   He did enough of that in the rally-score fifth game, getting two
kills to put the Trojans ahead 2-1, then later putting down his
33rd kill to bring his team to match point.
</P>
<P>
   Senior setter Donald Suxho finished the match with a kill, one
of his seven to go with 84 assists. Junior outside hitter Eli
Fairfield had 19 kills, sophomore middle blocker Beau Rawi had 16
kills and Harvard-Westlake of North Hollywood graduate Trevor
Julian, a junior outside hitter, had 15 kills.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were mindful of this being the third streak the
school has ended against UCLA this year, following victories by the
football and men's basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we lose, we get nervous that when we play them
again, we're going to lose,'' said Suxho, his bare chest also
exposed. ``We finally beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA got 21 kills from senior opposite hitter Evan Thatcher, 17
kills from senior middle blocker Seth Burnham and 14 kills from
junior outside hitter Mark Williams. Senior setter Brandon
Taliaferro had 71 assists.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Pat Powers said his team had not yet peaked,
especially with various nagging injuries preventing the full team
from practicing together this week. But he liked the way his team
fought back down two games to one.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA stormed out to a 7-0 lead in the third game and built it to
12-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth game, things were just the opposite, USC leading
9-1 and coasting into the fifth game with the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew them out in the game three. They blew us out in game
four,'' UCLA coach Al Scates said. ``They hit more (jump serves) in
game five, so we got in a hole and couldn't get out.''

PAYTON, BAKER SHINE AS SONICS STOP SUNS TO END SKID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With the national TV spotlight on KeyArena Friday
night, Gary Payton and Vin Baker led the Sonics out from the
shadows of a two-game home losing streak to beat the Phoenix Suns,
94-86, and take a 2-1 advantage over their Pacific Division rivals
with just one game left between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we wanted to bounce back after the Chicago
loss,'' Baker declared, referring to Seattle's listless loss
Wednesday to the Bulls on the same floor. ``We're still working on
our consistency, as far as holding on and keeping leads, but we had
a great effort tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   This one never got away from the Sonics from the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   The nationally televised game seemed to spark the inconsistent
Sonics, who knew going in that it was a key divisional contest with
a couple of ongoing story lines this season. Sonics coach Paul
Westphal gained his second consecutive win over his old club, while
guard Payton maintained bragging rights over his longtime friendly
foe, Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent All-Star performance,'' Westphal said, a
slight reference to the fact that Kidd was voted in as the starter
at point guard for the West team while Payton was named as a
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who had just 12 points in the loss to the Bulls, scored
23 against Kidd and had a career-high 13 rebounds to lead the
Sonics before 15,739 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The two Oakland natives always seem to elevate their play when
going head to head, but Friday night belonged to Payton, who led
the Sonics in scoring, rebounds and assists (7).
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, who had been averaging 18.5 points and 14 assists in the
previous two games against the Sonics, struggled to find his shot
all night long as the Sonics grabbed an early advantage they never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you start the game the way they did ... you get a
little low on gas, and that might have been the turning point,'' a
disgruntled Kidd said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics ran off to a 18-4 first-quarter lead built largely on
the inside and outside game of Payton and Baker, who had 22 points
for the night. Baker started the scoring run with a jump shot,
followed by back-to-back 3-pointers from Payton. Ruben Patterson
also provided a lift on the baseline, taking the ball to the hoop
on three straight drives that netted six points.
</P>
<P>
   While Kidd and the Suns started out cold, Phoenix stayed close
with the hard inside work of forward Rodney Rogers, who had eight
points in the first quarter and 11 for the half. But a
show-stopping dunk by Patterson off an alley-oop feed from Brent
Barry and solid free throw shooting put the Sonics up 33-21 at the
end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were able to maintain their lead throughout the
second quarter thanks to the 3-point shooting of Barry, who hit
back-to-back treys following a high-flying jam in which he was
fouled to complete another 3-point play in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Barry also helped the cause by working hard to take
sharpshooting guard Rex Chapman off his game by making Chapman
scramble to play defense. On one of the 3-pointers, Barry left
Chapman on his backside on the baseline as the Sonic guard drilled
the jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics also proved they could solve their first-half
rebounding woes, a statistic that was key to the loss against the
Bulls. Friday night, the home team maintained a 45-44 board
advantage over the Suns for the game, even though they allowed
eight offensive rebounds and several second-chance baskets in the
Suns' first-quarter run.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd had just four points and three assists in the first half
and finished with just eight points, going scoreless in the crucial
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're making them, it's going to be a good game, and if
you're not, it's gonna be a long night,'' Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   With Barry on the bench after picking up his fourth foul and the
Sonics missing four shots in a row, the Suns closed to within 69-66
at the end of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns then tied the game midway through the final period on
two technical foul shots awarded to Rogers when Chuck Person
hammered him on an uncontested move to the hoop. But the Sonics
came right back when backup center Jelani McCoy jammed home a feed
from Payton, and then canned a leaping hook on the next series,
picking up a foul shot to complete a 3-point turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any player wants to go out there an be a major part of the
game,'' McCoy said. ``There are a lot of talented people in this
league, and it's all about getting you opportunity, being in the
right place at the right time. Tonight it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   A bank shot by Patterson and two free throws by Baker put the
Sonics back in control with a six-point bulge. A jumper by Baker
and two free throws by Payton finally put an end to the Suns'
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Gary had another fantastic game and I thought that
Vin was almost at the level he was against Utah,'' Westphal said,
referring to Baker's 33-point effort in Seattle's 106-96 win in
Salt Lake on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, likewise, was struck by the job Payton did against Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the fans here don't take that for granted,'' Barry said
of his backcourt mate. ``Gary is a true superstar in our league,
he's a tremendous teammate to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the game, the two teams were separated by just 1{
games in the division, with a rematch Sunday the last in regular
season between the two division foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the performances we needed, and this was a very big win
for us,'' Westphal said.

AREA OFFICIALS QUESTIONING TIMING OF GRADE-POLICY CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STAR-TELEGRAM STAFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some school district administrators in the Fort Worth-Dallas
area have questioned the timing of the Grapevine-Colleyville school
board's decision earlier this week that changed the district's
grading system.
</P>
<P>
   The board approved an emergency measure Monday night,
eliminating the letter grade D from the district's grading system.
The change immediately elevated the grade-point average of
Grapevine linebacker Cody Spencer, improving his chances of
becoming eligible to receive an NCAA athletic scholarship two days
before national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer has been recruited by several Division I schools,
including TCU, North Texas, and Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right in midstream was a surprise,'' Fort Worth school
district athletic director Paul Galvan said. ``It kind of looks
like the reason to do this was to help an athlete. The question is,
had it been brought up before? Had it, and was nothing done? If it
had, then why are we doing it now?''
</P>
<P>
   Burleson Superintendent Jeff Turner also questioned the timing.
``I understand the situation \Rin Grapevine\S and feel like they
acted appropriately,'' he said. ``Most districts consider 70 a
passing grade of C. The timing was unfortunate in that the
athletics issue was called into question.''
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine-Colleyville Superintendent Jim Thompson said the board
acted as quickly as it could once it found out that the
Grapevine-Colleyville school district was reporting any grade in
the 70-74 range as a D for NCAA eligibility purposes. Most area
school districts, including Fort Worth, would have reported the
grades in question for Spencer as a C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They \Rboard members\S wanted to go ahead and correct it as
soon as possible so that it didn't penalize any of our students,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, letter grades are used only for purposes of reporting
to the NCAA and not for the official processing of grades by school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA uses a point system to convert letter grades. For
example, a grade of A would equal 4 to 5 points based on the
difficulty of the subject. The system is used to determine if a
student athlete has met the required number of points to be
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   A grade of C is worth 2 points, and a D is worth 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change elevated Spencer's grade-point average to
2.375 for NCAA purposes. By having a higher GPA, his SAT score
requirement was lowered to 870. Spencer's mother, Juli, confirmed
last night that her son had scored high enough on the SAT to
qualify for a scholarship. However she would not say what the score
was. She also said Spencer talked to TCU coaches yesterday but has
not signed a letter of intent and will continue to talk to coaches
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's father, Wes Culver, said his son had D's in three of
13 core courses that count toward eligibility. Culver said Texas
Tech was interested in offering Spencer a scholarship until the
school found out his grades in the low 70s were being reported as
D's.
</P>
<P>
   The Keller school district made a change similar to the
Grapevine-Colleyville school district last month, with little
fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what message \Rthe change in policy\S sends,''
Brewer athletic director Ben Davis said. ``Regardless of what they
are trying to do, it makes it look bad for a lot of people. We are
not in their shoes, but I'm sure they are not doing this for one
person. I would like to think people have enough integrity not to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis suggested that perhaps the state should provide a
universal grading scale for all schools to report to the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   One state that does this is Florida, which also produces
hundreds of Division I football recruits each year. According to a
spokesman for the Dade County public school system, a D is awarded
for a grade of 70-76, although there is a bill pending in the
Florida legislature that would change that range to a C.
</P>
<P>
   Denton, Grand Prairie, Kennedale, Hurst-Euless-Bedford and
Northwest, are among the few area districts that report a grade
between 70 and 74 as a D.
</P>
<P>
   Denton athletic director Ken Purcell said perhaps the burden
should be on the NCAA to make a uniform letter-grade policy. In the
meantime, Purcell said the events of this week have raised his
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids have been doing OK, their GPA has been fine, and it
hasn't been a factor so far,'' Purcell said. ``It's probably a plus
this has come up, and I think it will prompt me to send a memo to
our superintendent. The main thing here is that it doesn't put our
kids at a disadvantage when they're vying for scholarships with
colleges.'' \Ntagtop:Staff writers Blane Bachelor, Carlos Mendez,

TIMING OF RULING ON GRADE CHANGE MERITS A `D'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As with any other ninth-grader, Juli and Wes Culver were not
pleased when their son, Cody Spencer, began bringing home C's and
D's.
</P>
<P>
   They fussed. They grounded him. They said all the things that
all the parents say to all of the kids who don't bring home good
grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his freshman and sophomore years, I don't think he realized
the importance of making A's and B's,'' Juli Culver said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, though, Cody Spencer now realizes. The next time
that the family telephone rings, it could be another reporter or
radio show host. The next minivan that pulls up in the driveway
could be one of those TV tabloid shows.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that awful Texas, they will say. They'll do anything down
there for the sake of football.
</P>
<P>
   And who are we to argue after Monday night?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, what the Grapevine-Colleyville school board did
Monday was dreadful. On the surface, it sent a witless message _
that, as long as a star football player is involved, rules can be
adjusted, and grades are not to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 5-0 with one abstention, just two days before high
school players around the nation are allowed to begin signing
letters of intent to play football, the women and men who guide the
Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District, in one opportune
swoop, wiped out the grade of D. Under the emergency measure,
scores of 70-79 now count as a C.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason that they approved the measure Monday, in
particular, was Cody Spencer, star senior linebacker and sometime
not-so-serious student.
</P>
<P>
   By having three D's in his core curriculum courses legislated
into C's, Spencer was handed a much better shot at being eligible
to receive a NCAA Division I football scholarship. The
grade-designation change elevated Spencer's 2.1 average to 2.375,
which means that he needs a score of at least 870 on the SAT to
qualify for a grant-in-aid.
</P>
<P>
   His latest SAT score _ Spencer has taken the tests three times _
arrived in the mail yesterday at their Colleyville home, and Juli
Culver confirmed that her son did score at least 870.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't want to give the exact score. After everything that's
been written and said this week, Culver was trying to protect her
son's last shred of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cody is not a pampered athlete, Culver argued. During the summer
he gets a job, just like any other high school student would. Last
year he drove a truck for a landscaping company. Mom was a school
teacher.Dad owns a business, selling wholesale electronic supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a wealthy family, by any means,'' Juli Culver said.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's choice of colleges seems to center on TCU, Texas Tech
and North Texas. Because he wasn't able to qualify for a Division I
grant-in-aid sooner, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound linebacker did not
sign Wednesday. Spencer, with his D's erased and his latest SAT in
the books, now gets to wait for the next scholarship spot to open.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapevine-Colleyville school district's timing couldn't have
been better _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Culvers contend that their plea was a simple one. They had
accompanied Cody on a recent recruiting visit to Texas Tech. An
athletic department assistant there informed them that Spencer had
not yet qualified, according to NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA leaves it up to the high schools to decide what C's and
D's are. Grapevine-Colleyville school district, the Culvers soon
learned, was one of the few remaining area districts that still
used the grade of D.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the Culvers were told, there was a GCISD
committee that was studying the issue. At that point, Wes Culver
took his plea before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Wes and Juli Culver are right. If neighboring schools in Keller,
Southlake and North Richland Hills aren't giving students grades of
D, why should Grapevine? It penalizes, most conspicuously, athletes
who are competing for college grants-in-aid.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not fair.
</P>
<P>
   Let me suggest, though, that perhaps Grapevine is the one who
was doing it right, and all the others are wrong. Why do public
schools always seem to stoop to the lowest common denominator? Why
must standards always be lowered to protect the under-achievers?
</P>
<P>
   Why can't the bar be set proud and high?
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches always told Cody that all he had to do was pass,''
Juli Culver said.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches, then, are just as unprofessional as the school
board was Monday night. The board's timing was either arrogant or
awkward. If a minicam from ``60 Minutes'' shows up, guys, be sure
to speak up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm tempted to feel for Cody Spencer in all this. His
parents contend that they didn't create a scene. Cody did nothing,
except go to class _ and cringe.
</P>
<P>
   On his last report card, mom proudly reported, Cody earned all
B's, except for a 79 in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He's no hero. But he's also not the Texas poster boy for
academic ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's really changed,'' Juli Culver said. ``No academic
programs have been dumbed down here.''
</P>
<P>
   She is correct. But no positive messages were sent, either. To
the rest of the world, another athlete got his way.
</P>
<P>
   That's not entirely accurate, but thanks to the school board's
mindless timing, who are we to argue?

 &HT;    SCHOOL CHILDREN FED CHICKEN FROM DISEASED POULTRY

<P>
   BOAZ, Alabama _ School children in 31 states are being fed
chicken nuggets made in part from diseased poultry, according to
several federal food safety inspectors at two Alabama processing
plants where the food is prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors say the chicken nuggets will not hurt anyone because
humans do not get poultry diseases, but they argue the food is not
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skin's got sores and bruises and things on it,'' explained
Ellen Dingler, a federal food safety inspector at a Gold Kist
poultry processing plant here. ``They mix that with the meat and
it's called 'binder.' So I won't eat a chicken nugget or a pressed
patty or anything because of that. Because that skin is mixed in
with it and it's got sores.''
</P>
<P>
   Other inspectors described chickens with tumors or coated with
pus moving unhindered down the processing line where they are
eventually turned into chicken nuggets or other processed chicken
products.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Gold Kist headquarters in Atlanta did not respond
to repeated requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   John McCutcheon, who oversees the U.S. Agriculture Department's
food safety inspectors, said the government does not want diseased
poultry going to consumers. But he acknowledged his agency approves
a plant's product even though half the carcasses may have sores,
scabs or some kinds of infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the questions is, 'Are birds with sores and scabs being
passed and getting the mark of inspection', the answer is yes,''
McCutcheon said. But he said that even with ``100 percent
inspection'' diseased birds would still slip through.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCutcheon faulted any inspectors who see
diseased poultry and do not condemn it. ``When you know a carcass
has a condition on it that shouldn't go into commerce,'' McCutcheon
said, ``we expect our inspectors to act immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors see this as the government being deceptive. ``The
agency is speaking out of both sides of their mouth,'' complained
one inspector. ``They are saying the regulations are still in place
and (diseased poultry) ought to be thrown away. But if it does go
to the consumer it will not hurt you. Just cook it properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors blame the conditions at the two plants on a
four-month-old experimental federal food surveillance program that
effectively turns over poultry inspection to the company. Under the
old system still used at most plants, inspectors who monitor the
slaughter operation are expected to look at every carcass and can
order the company to correct problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Inspectors) are frustrated over what they are seeing (in the
new inspection program).'' said Stan Painter, president of Local
2357 of the National Joint Council of Food Inspectors that
represents government inspectors at the plants. Painter is himself
an inspector. ``They are frustrated over what is going on and they
are frustrated that they cannot do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the inspectors, truckloads of live chickens first
go to the Gold Kist plant in Boaz which uses the traditional
poultry inspection program. If diseased birds begin turning up,
inspectors can slow the production line to make more thorough
checks.
</P>
<P>
   When the line slows in Boaz, inspectors say birds are trucked to
Gold Kist's Guntersville plant 15 miles away. There the plant is
operating under the experimental inspection program begun last
October that gives the company responsibility for examining their
own product. In Guntersville the company regulates the line speed
and culls out diseased birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minute of the day, diseased product is going down the
line (in Guntersville),'' Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Guntersville inspectors said that the amount of diseased
product leaving the plant has increased by 50 per cent because of
the experimental program. One inspector estimated that about 18,000
carcasses out of approximately 185,000 with diseases, scabs or
sores are shipped from Guntersville every day. Painter said that,
based on inspections he has seen, he estimates 20 to 30 percent of
the product leaving the plant is diseased.
</P>
<P>
   However, inspectors acknowledged this was only an educated
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Even inspectors who say they support the experimental inspection
program are dismayed by what they are seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no control,'' said one inspector who asked not to be
named. While he agrees with the goal of making the company take
greater responsibility for producing safe products, he said,
``Action needs to be taken if stuff fails. But we can't make them
(the company) take any action.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon said it is important to give the company an
opportunity to correct production problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to them to decide what they want to do as a corrective
action. We don't want to enter into and interfere with their system
`` McCutcheon said. The inspector is only supposed to observe what
action the company takes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the chickens are slaughtered, cleaned and boxed at
Guntersville, they are returned to the Boaz plant where they are
cut up and turned into chicken nuggets. The federal government's
Agriculture Commodities Program then buys the nuggets and gives
them away to schools around the country. Federal records also show
chicken being purchased directly from Guntersville for the school
lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   Meat industry spokesmen say inspectors are speaking out because
they fear losing their jobs as companies begin monitoring
themselves. But Felicia Nestor, a lawyer with the Government
Accountability Project (GAP) in Washington, a consumer group that
protects whistle blowers, claims the government has already pledged
to switch inspectors to new jobs rather than fire them.
</P>
<P>
   She also said it is ``very unusual'' for inspectors like the
ones in Alabama to speak out because she said the Agriculture
Department has a history of punishing whistle blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Painter agreed that the government tries to silence inspectors,
saying ``If you speak out, they will get you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials say inspectors can talk to the
press as long as they make clear they are speaking as private
citizens and not in their official capacity.
</P>
<P>
   All the inspectors were clearly uncomfortable talking to a
reporter. Some asked not to be named for fear of retaliation and
others repeatedly emphasized they were speaking as private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   An inspector in the Guntersville plant, who did not want his
name used, said he estimates that about half of the birds coming
into the plant are diseased.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run `em just like all the others. They are just processed
out. Gold Kist has a. . .problem. They have a lot of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Smalley, a chicken grower in the Guntersville area and a
member of the Gold Kist board of directors, denied the company had
a problem with diseased birds. But other local growers, as well as
inspectors, said flocks in the area, which are the primary source
of chickens at the plants, have been ravaged by various infections.
</P>
<P>
   George Timmerman, a local grower, said that suddenly two years
ago various diseases began decimating his and other flocks in the
area. One farmer said the number of chickens dying from disease in
one of his flocks jumped from around 50 to 2300 out of a total of
about 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Government inspectors like Dingler and Diane Franklin, who also
works in the Boaz plant, said that over the last few years the
number of diseased birds reaching the plant has escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past couple of weeks it's been 90 percent,'' Dingler said.
``It's been really terrible. This is the worst that I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors said birds usually have either Airsacculitis, a
pneumonia-like infection, or Inflammatory Process, which is similar
to an infected cut. In both cases pockets of pus form in various
parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Airsacculitis) is an infection and pus can cover virtually
the entire cavity and in the severe stages it can be like a
jelly,'' Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon said he was unaware of a high incidence of disease
among birds coming into the plants. In fact, he said Guntersville
was chosen to test the new inspection program because they
slaughter young birds that are generally healthy. He said testing
the inspection program in plants that slaughter young, healthy
animals was a way of safeguarding the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Guntersville plant, inspectors say the new inspection
rules do not allow them to pick up a carcass and inspect it as it
moves along the line. Instead, company employees called ``sorters''
look for infected birds. But two times every shift, inspectors
said, they sample 10 carcasses as they come off the line. In this
instance, inspectors are allowed to actually pick up a carcass and
examine it for sores, scabs and infections.
</P>
<P>
   Painter said he kept track of these so-called ``10-bird''
examinations by inspectors for a three week period last October and
found 62 instances where inspectors detected everything ranging
from sores to infections.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a diseased bird is found, inspectors say little is
likely to happen. New government regulations permit the company to
find defective birds and still not flunk the ``10 bird check.'' The
experimental inspection system regulations say, for example, that
an inspector can find sores on 52 percent of the birds and the
company's product will still pass inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company fails the inspection, inspectors say nothing
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the plant and they say, 'OK.' Its up to them whether
they want to do another test. It doesn't do anything. We record it
on a sheet of paper and stick it in the drawer. Under the new
program we don't write them a non-compliance report like we used
to,'' a Guntersville inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   While they say more diseased carcasses are getting through the
Guntersville plant, inspectors said Gold Kist is condemning more
birds under the new inspection system than inspectors ever did when
they were in charge. Inspectors say this is because Gold Kist runs
its processing line at a much higher speed.
</P>
<P>
   After a chicken is slaughtered, the carcass is placed on a
conveyor belt. As the belt moves through the plant, different
machines remove feathers, guts, and wash the carcass. If defective
birds are found, they are removed from the line and sent to
reprocessing where workers cut away infected areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boaz plant the government will not permit this line to
run faster than 91 birds per minute. But in Guntersville, the
company sets the speed. Inspectors say the line typically runs at
105 birds per minute but has gone as high as 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are throwing away more birds than we did before because
they are running faster,'' said a Guntersville inspector. ``They
are throwing them away because at the speed they are going, their
salvaging and reprocessing lines overfill.''
</P>
<P>
   Painter said, ``The plants are condemning a lot of product. More
so than we were because they want those lines to run faster and
faster and faster.''

   In the Boaz plant the government will not permit this line to
run faster than 91 birds per minute. But in Guntersville, the
company sets the speed. Inspectors say the line typically runs at
105 birds per minute but has gone as high as 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are throwing away more birds than we did before because
they are running faster,'' said a Guntersville inspector. ``They
are throwing them away because at the speed they are going, their

   Painter said, ``The plants are condemning a lot of product. More
so than we were because they want those lines to run faster and

COWBOYS EXPECT TO FINALIZE STAFF

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys are expected to have their plans for
reshaping the coaching staff finalized by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones doesn't expect to lose any more defensive
assistants, and that would include two-year linebackers coach
George Edwards, who reportedly had received an offer to be
assistant head coach/offensive coordinator at the University of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from defensive line coach Jim Bates, who took a promotion
to move to Miami as the Dolphins' defensive coordinator, ``I don't
see us losing any more defensive coaches,'' Jones said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   This also would mean that Clancy Pendergast, the Cowboys'
promising young defensive assistant/quality control, will not be
joining Bates in Miami, as had been speculated.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive staff is a different story. The Cowboys plan
personnel changes to accommodate a change in philosophy under new
offensive coordinator Jack Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers coach Dwain Painter did not have his contract
renewed, and quarterbacks coach Buddy Geis and offensive assistant
Tommie Robinson also are not expected to return, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends coach Les Miles apparently will return because no
tight ends coach has been interviewed. Said Jones: ``Les Miles has
done a really fine job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two former NFL standout wide receivers were interviewed this
week for the the receivers position:
</P>
<P>
   Wes Chandler, who coached at the high school level, and most
recently, served as head coach of the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe.
As an NFL player, he thrived under San Diego's ``Air'' Coryell
offense, which is the genesis for the offenses used by Norv Turner
and Ernie Zampese, as well as Mike Martz of the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Jackson, a 16-year standout NFL wide receiver who ranks
10th on the NFL's all-time receiving list with 10,372 yards mostly
with the Los Angeles Rams, Philadelphia Eagles and New England
Patriots. He spent the past three seasons as receivers coach for
the New Orleans Saints. He had been an NFL assistant since 1985 at
New England.
</P>
<P>
   A strong possibility remains that Zampese, who worked with
Reilly last season in New England will join the Cowboys in a
consultant's role, sources said. He worked for Jones from 1994-97,
helping the '95 Cowboys win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Ken Zampese, who spent last season in Green Bay as an
offensive assistant, also interviewed with the Cowboys this week.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Jason Garrett remains a candidate for
quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've visited, and we'll visit some more,'' Jones said.
``Right now, Jason Garrett is a possibility at quarterbacks \R
coach\S.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Defensive tackle Leon Lett underwent
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee yesterday to remove
``relatively minor'' meniscus cartilage damage, according a club
official.

TIGER WOODS TO SKIP FORT WORTH STOP ON PGA TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, the world's top-ranked golfer and owner of a
five-event winning streak on the PGA Tour, will not be competing at
the 2000 MasterCard Colonial because he will be defending a
tournament title on the European Tour during Colonial week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open announced yesterday that
Woods has committed to defend his title at the May 18-21 event in
Hamburg, Germany. Spanish star Sergio Garcia also has committed to
compete in the European Tour's version of the Tournament Players
Championship. The event offers the highest purse of any European
Tour event other than the major championships (nearly $2.7 million
U.S. dollars), and Woods, for a second consecutive year, will
receive a six-figure appearance fee.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who finished the first round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
Pro-Am at 4-under-par 68 and trails co-leaders David Duval, Vijay
Singh and Notah Begay by two, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The playing dates of the European Tour event are identical to
those of the Colonial, meaning Woods will skip Fort Worth's annual
tournament for a third consecutive year. Phil Thomas, Colonial
tournament chairman, said club officials are disappointed the
tour's top gate attraction will not be competing in Fort Worth, but
they concur with his decision to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to lose him, but a defending champion needs to go and
defend his title. That's part of it. I expected this, and we
understand it,'' Thomas said. ``Obviously, we'd love to have him.
And I think we will have him again some time. But I don't know when
that time will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Commitments are not binding, but Woods apparently gave
permission to tournament officials to issue yesterday's news
release announcing his plans to compete in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the German tournament's news release, officials said
``further first-class stars'' from the PGA Tour are expected to
compete but did not name anyone but Woods and Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, five high-profile PGA Tour participants _ Woods,
Nick Price, Mark O'Meara, Ernie Els and Jesper Parnevik _ accepted
six-figure appearance fees to compete in the German event rather
than play at Colonial. The PGA Tour prohibits paying appearance
fees to players.
</P>
<P>
   To compete in Europe, players must receive a conflicting-event
waiver from the PGA Tour. After the five high-profile players opted
to skip the 1999 Colonial, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem termed
the situation ``a blip on the \Rradar\S screen generated by big
appearance money'' and vowed to monitor releases more carefully in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an isolated incident,'' Finchem said at the
time. ``If things get too bad \Rin the future\S, we won't grant
releases beyond a certain number.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said yesterday that tournament officials were unaware of
PGA Tour participants other than Woods and Garcia with plans to
compete in Germany during Colonial week. He downplayed concerns
about the reference to ``further first-class stars'' from the PGA
Tour expected by German officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're expected at Colonial, too,'' Thomas said. ``We could
put out a release saying the same thing. I don't foresee a large
movement of players \Rto the European event\S. I think we'll have
an excellent field.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has not announced plans for competing at the GTE Byron
Nelson Classic, May 11-14 in Irving. Last year, Woods competed at
the Nelson before flying to Germany to play in the Deutsche
Bank-SAP Open. Nelson officials said they are optimistic Woods will
return to their event in May.

IVAN RODRIGUEZ WILL BE LATE FOR CAMP, WITH RANGERS' PERMISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez has mapped out
the first step to repeating his MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   He will be late for spring training again _ but this time, he
has permission.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said yesterday he plans to report to spring training
Feb. 25 with the other position players, rather than Feb. 19 with
pitchers and catchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple of personal things to do in Miami and a
couple of appearances in Puerto Rico with the MVP trophy,'' said
Rodriguez, who has split his off-season between Puerto Rico and a
new home in Miami Beach, Fla. ``But I've been working out, so it's
not going to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez created a stir last year when he showed up for spring
training in Port Charlotte, Fla., a week late. The Rangers weren't
happy when he didn't ask for permission.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez didn't make the same mistake this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called and asked,'' general manager Doug Melvin said. ``We
didn't see it as a problem as long as he's there with the position
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's out of shape. I'd be worried if he was
sitting around all winter, getting fat and resting on his MVP
laurels. But he works out and he's in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who received his MVP award from Hall of Famer Frank
Robinson at the Rangers' mid-winter banquet last night, said he has
been working out regularly through the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 7:30 in the morning, I'm already on the track,'' Rodriguez
said. ``I usually work out two or three hours. I tell you one
thing, I feel stronger this year than I did last year.'' Last year,
Rodriguez hit .332 with 35 home runs, 116 runs and 113 runs batted
in.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's biggest adjustment this year may be getting used to
playing without close friend Juan Gonzalez, who was traded to
Detroit in November. The two were teammates the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard not seeing Juan in the locker room,''
Rodriguez said. ``We were together all the time. But baseball is
like that. He's going to be fine where he is. I hope he signs that
contract that Detroit is offering him.'' Briefly Center fielder
Ruben Mateo and first baseman Mike Simms are expected to be in camp
early with the pitchers and catchers. Both are coming off injuries
and are allowed to report early. The Rangers have signed outfielder
Scarborough Green to a minor-league contract with an invitation to
major-league camp. Green hit .308 in 18 games with the Rangers last
year and .248 in 104 games with Triple-A Oklahoma. The Rangers are
expecting 53 players in spring training. They have the maximum 40
players on their major-league roster and have invited 13 players
with minor-league contracts to camp. They have invited two
nonroster pitchers, R.A. Dickey and Matt Miller, their fewest in 20
years.

   The Evanescence of Inevitability
</P>
<P>
   Surprise! Sen. John McCain's 19-point victory in New Hampshire
last week rudely knocked the crown of inevitability off Gov. George
W. Bush's head.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributions to McCain started pouring so fast it was
as if someone had turned on a tap: $1 million in under two days.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly insurgency, that politically musky word, was in the
air. McCain's crisp message of integrity and campaign reform,
combined with his war record, attracted independent voters in
droves. They could also help him in South Carolina, where
Democrats, with no primary of their own, can vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain boasts that he's the first Republican presidential
candidate since Ronald Reagan who appeals to Democrats, and he is
also counting on support from South Carolina's 400,000 veterans, as
well as endorsements from the popular Reps. Lindsey O. Graham and
Mark Sanford on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has exhibited more strength with party fat cats
than with voters. His message is fuzzy and McCain has exploited
doubts about whether Bush has the gravitas to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, independents won't be able to vote in most other key
primaries, so McCain faces the challenge of prying core Republican
voters away from Bush in upcoming contests. History is against him;
no insurgent has won either party's nomination in almost a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has endorsements from the party's establishment and
from Republican governors like former Gov. David Beasley of South
Carolina and Michigan's John Engler. On the Democratic side, Vice
President Al Gore's narrow New Hampshire win means he faces
protracted, expensive, multi-state combat with former Sen. Bill
Bradley. Like Bush, Gore enjoys solid backing from his party's
establishment, as well as from the Democratic base, which will be
crucial in big, early primary states like New York, Michigan and
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race, too, is getting meaner. Bradley's attacks
on Gore's honesty helped sway late-deciding voters in New
Hampshire. New questions arose about Gore's past statements on
abortion. But the Democrats don't go mano-a-mano again until the
all-important March 7 primaries.

   Primary Gazing in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Americans weren't the only ones watching the New Hampshire
primary closely. The Russian leadership, it turns out, was focusing
on it just as closely as the State Department tracks the vagaries
of Russian electoral politics these days.
</P>
<P>
   The results were only a few hours old when Russia's acting
president, Vladimir Putin, greeted Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in his Kremlin office Wednesday morning to talk about arms
control, Chechnya and other items on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Then came some political shop talk.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who is reported to have had a 15-year career in the KGB,
noted Sen. John McCain's victory in New Hampshire and, according to
accounts afterwards, appeared to be contemplating what a McCain
presidency would mean for Russia. From Moscow's point of view, it
seems, McCain is a military man who sends a signal of a return to
the past. His top foreign policy advisers, after all, include
Jeanne Kirkpatrick, the U.N. delegate under Ronald Reagan when he
labeled the Soviet Union the ``evil empire,'' and Zbigniew
Brzezinski, another hard-liner against the Soviets as Jimmy
Carter's national security adviser. (More recently, Brzezinski has
urged a strong Western stand against the Russian campaign to subdue
Chechnya.) One participant described Putin's assessments of the
primary as ``astute'' and presented in an affable manner.

   Good News Continues For the Booming Economy
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economic expansion became the longest on record at 107
months, surpassing the 1960s boom. As if to emphasize the point,
unemployment dropped again, to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology played a key role in the long run of prosperity by
making businesses more efficient and workers more productive.
President Clinton said his predecessors deserved some credit, but
added that his efforts to eliminate the federal budget deficit had
been critical.
</P>
<P>
   No one got more praise than Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, who was confirmed by the Senate for a fourth term.
All the good news, though, was too much for the Fed, which pushed
interest rates up by a quarter of a point to keep the economy from
overheating.

   Pact on Puerto Rico Base
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico agreed to let the Navy resume limited training on
the island of Vieques as part of a deal that includes up to $90
million in aid if residents of Vieques vote next year to allow
exercises with live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The residents will be asked to choose between telling the Navy
to leave in three years or allowing it to stay and conduct
live-fire training. Last April, President Clinton ordered a
moratorium on all training on Vieques following the death of a
Puerto Rican civilian guard in a bombing accident.

   $183 Billion Wireless Deal
</P>
<P>
   In a huge wireless communications merger, Vodafone AirTouch of
Britain agreed to acquire Mannesmann of Germany. The deal was
remarkable not just for its size _ at $183 billion, it's the
largest ever, surpassing even the recent $165 billion AOL-Time
Warner deal _ but as proof that hard-nosed takeover tactics have
migrated far beyond Wall Street. It also shows vividly the
cross-border thinking that has taken hold in corporate Europe.

   Illinois Halts Executions
</P>
<P>
   In a decision hailed by opponents of the death penalty, Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois ordered a halt to all executions in the
state, the first such moratorium in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a moderate Republican, said that since 1977 Illinois had
sentenced 13 men to death for crimes they did not commit, calling
it a ``shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting
them on death row.'' Nationwide, 85 people have been released from
death row since 1973 after being exonerated by new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   88 Killed in Airline Crash
</P>
<P>
   For Alaska Airlines, the crash of Flight 261 into the Pacific
Ocean near Los Angeles was a family tragedy: more than a third of
the 88 people aboard, all of whom died, had some connection to the
airline itself.
</P>
<P>
   The search for floating wreckage was grimly familiar, but even
as mourners built memorials in the sand, investigators quickly
recovered the flight voice and data recorders.
</P>
<P>
   These could help explain why the plane spiraled upside down
after the flight crew reported trouble with its rear stabilizer and
struggled in vain to keep the MD-83 aircraft aloft.

   The results were only a few hours old when Russia's acting
president, Vladimir Putin, greeted Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in his Kremlin office Wednesday morning to talk about arms
control, Chechnya and other items on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Then came some political shop talk.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who is reported to have had a 15-year career in the KGB,
noted Sen. John McCain's victory in New Hampshire and, according to
accounts afterwards, appeared to be contemplating what a McCain
presidency would mean for Russia. From Moscow's point of view, it
seems, McCain is a military man who sends a signal of a return to
the past. His top foreign policy advisers, after all, include
Jeanne Kirkpatrick, the U.N. delegate under Ronald Reagan when he
labeled the Soviet Union the ``evil empire,'' and Zbigniew
Brzezinski, another hard-liner against the Soviets as Jimmy
Carter's national security adviser. (More recently, Brzezinski has
urged a strong Western stand against the Russian campaign to subdue
Chechnya.) One participant described Putin's assessments of the
primary as ``astute'' and presented in an affable manner.

   Good News Continues For the Booming Economy
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economic expansion became the longest on record at 107
months, surpassing the 1960s boom. As if to emphasize the point,
unemployment dropped again, to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology played a key role in the long run of prosperity by
making businesses more efficient and workers more productive.
President Clinton said his predecessors deserved some credit, but
added that his efforts to eliminate the federal budget deficit had
been critical.
</P>
<P>
   No one got more praise than Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, who was confirmed by the Senate for a fourth term.
All the good news, though, was too much for the Fed, which pushed
interest rates up by a quarter of a point to keep the economy from
overheating.

   Pact on Puerto Rico Base
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico agreed to let the Navy resume limited training on
the island of Vieques as part of a deal that includes up to $90
million in aid if residents of Vieques vote next year to allow
exercises with live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The residents will be asked to choose between telling the Navy
to leave in three years or allowing it to stay and conduct
live-fire training. Last April, President Clinton ordered a
moratorium on all training on Vieques following the death of a
Puerto Rican civilian guard in a bombing accident.

   $183 Billion Wireless Deal
</P>
<P>
   In a huge wireless communications merger, Vodafone AirTouch of
Britain agreed to acquire Mannesmann of Germany. The deal was
remarkable not just for its size _ at $183 billion, it's the
largest ever, surpassing even the recent $165 billion AOL-Time
Warner deal _ but as proof that hard-nosed takeover tactics have
migrated far beyond Wall Street. It also shows vividly the
cross-border thinking that has taken hold in corporate Europe.

   Illinois Halts Executions
</P>
<P>
   In a decision hailed by opponents of the death penalty, Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois ordered a halt to all executions in the
state, the first such moratorium in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a moderate Republican, said that since 1977 Illinois had
sentenced 13 men to death for crimes they did not commit, calling
it a ``shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting
them on death row.'' Nationwide, 85 people have been released from
death row since 1973 after being exonerated by new evidence.

   88 Killed in Airline Crash
</P>
<P>
   For Alaska Airlines, the crash of Flight 261 into the Pacific
Ocean near Los Angeles was a family tragedy: more than a third of
the 88 people aboard, all of whom died, had some connection to the
airline itself.
</P>
<P>
   The search for floating wreckage was grimly familiar, but even
as mourners built memorials in the sand, investigators quickly
recovered the flight voice and data recorders.
</P>
<P>
   These could help explain why the plane spiraled upside down
after the flight crew reported trouble with its rear stabilizer and
struggled in vain to keep the MD-83 aircraft aloft.

   Diallo Jury Is Chosen

   A jury of four blacks and eight whites was chosen to decide the

volley of 41 bullets as he stood, unarmed, in the lobby of his
Bronx apartment building a year ago.

   The trial had been moved to Albany after defense lawyers argued

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ So here I am in Darty, a huge discount appliance store,
trying to buy a dishwasher. So far, it's going really well. I am
just another customer _ more important, just another French
customer _ and the saleswoman is eager to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happens. I am talking about installation and I need to
say that my clothes dryer is in the way. Only I stumble. I can't
remember the name for a dryer. Did I ever know it? We never had one
when I was growing up here as a child.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, I try ``a machine that dries clothes.'' Nope,
that's not it. I see it on the woman's face. That look of
suspicion. It's all over. The fact that she got me to buy a more
expensive model makes no difference. I'm a foreigner. I'm not one
of them. Her tone changes. She is suddenly brusque. I place my
order and leave, defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, I did get my dishwasher. But that's not the point. The
thing about the French is that you're either one of them or you're
not, and they don't like being fooled. And for me, who as a child
used to make merciless fun of the way my American father spoke
French, being taken as an insider is a point of pride. No matter
that I have not lived here in 35 years. Being found out as less
than French in these small daily encounters is humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of moving here last fall, helpful American
expatriates were giving us tips and offering us books on how to
survive in France. Some of the practical information was about
which bilingual schools were good. But much of the advice was about
psychological survival: How to understand the French and not have
your feelings hurt when they treat you rudely because you are a
foreigner. Which phrases you might use to get a smile when you are
trying to buy a croissant. Why you would be considered a lout if
you brought a bottle of wine to the dinner party that you were
unlikely to get invited to anyway because the French take such a
long time to make friends. Whom you should kiss on both cheeks and
at what times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   I found all this very amusing. My mother is French. French was
my first language. I have relatives in Nice. I do not find the
French so mysterious. But we moved back to America when I was 8
years old and there are lots of gaps in my knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I know I can't play on the grass in the Luxembourg Gardens
_ that hasn't changed. And I know you have to pay for both the
beach chair and the umbrella and maybe even the mattress by the
pool. But I stood dumbfounded the first time I went into a
supermarket and realized that I needed to pay a 10 franc deposit to
push a  &UR; chariot &LR;  up and down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I almost envy the American with a thick accent. It is
clear who he is. Instead, I lead an odd life of constantly being
discovered as a fake or treated like a moron. Perhaps this is worse
in Paris, where there is the usual big-city impatience. But you
find it all over. Who is this idiot who obviously speaks French but
has asked me for a booklet for her subway pass, when everyone knows
it's called a case? What is the matter with this middle-aged woman
that she would come into a curtain store to ask for curtain hooks,
when everyone knows they are sold at the Prisunic five-and-dime?
Isn't she far too old to be just discovering that fitted sheets for
twin beds come in three different sizes here?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stuff written in those how-to-survive-France books
seems pretty ludicrous. If you believe it all, you would never want
to meet a French person, let alone gain acceptance. One guide says
the French never use bathrooms outside their homes and you
shouldn't ask to use their bathroom when you visit them.
</P>
<P>
   That's ridiculous. Who are all those people who are always in
the restaurant bathrooms when I want to use them? The French half
of me can't help but be partly offended. What would my aunt say to
such nonsense?
</P>
<P>
   Here is another one: the French don't waste smiles. Americans
walk down the street smiling, willy-nilly. But not the French. They
must have a reason, something must amuse them before they grin. I
test this one day. Smiles all over the place. Although there may be
some truth to it because I tried a smile on one of the guards in my
office building, and now he practically falls off his chair trying
to greet me every time I come in.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to agree that the French are not wild about
strangers. Some of the books point out that the French have been
invaded more times than anyone can count. Tourism is surely a form
of invasion, too. How many times have I sat with my relatives in
Nice watching some American tourist complaining that the French
version of a grilled cheese sandwich, a croque monsieur, isn't
toasted on the bottom. Or asking for cold milk with coffee,
something incomprehensible to the French.
</P>
<P>
   How we have laughed. Let them go back to their bologna
sandwiches, or better yet those chalky things they call
marshmallows, we have joked. Nowadays, however, I am often on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's not the basic exchanges but the follow-up
questions that are my demise. I wanted my hair cut and highlighted,
for example, and called for an appointment. No problem, until the
receptionist asked me what kind of highlights. I caved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm American and I don't understand what you just said,'' I
said. The aggravation on the other side of the line was total.
``Never mind,'' she snapped. ``Just come in.''
</P>
<P>
   I know there is a whole part of France that I can not have just
yet because I don't know how things are done here. The butcher
shops, for instance. I don't even know what half the stuff hanging
from the ceiling is. I just know I'm headed for humiliation if I go
in there. So I don't, not yet. But I remember visiting my
grandmother when I was a teen-ager and how she would insist that I
go grocery shopping with her. Mr. Laiolo, the butcher, had known
the family for years. He would play his part. Oh, she is so big, he
would say. She is so beautiful. And my grandmother, who had been
widowed for years by then, would beam.
</P>
<P>
   It is nice when I am not discovered. When I'm taken for French,
I have all sorts of kindnesses to recount. The car rental agent who
gave me a big car at a discount and wished me ``bon courage''
because she knew I was going to a furniture discount store
notorious for crowds and long lines. The saleswoman who would not
sell me shoes with a slight flaw in them, even though I had not
noticed it. And the many waiters who have tried to deter me from
what they considered terrible choices.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the French even seem to sympathize with the burden of
dual nationality. After hearing me translate what my two daughters
wanted for lunch, one waiter smiled down at us and tsked over the
situation. ``Ah,'' he said. ``I see, a French mother with two
American children.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are catching on fast, though. The other day, they
insisted that I speak French to them as we walked down the street
so nobody would know they did not entirely belong here.

<P>
   It is nice when I am not discovered. When I'm taken for French,
I have all sorts of kindnesses to recount. The car rental agent who
gave me a big car at a discount and wished me ``bon courage''
because she knew I was going to a furniture discount store
notorious for crowds and long lines. The saleswoman who would not
sell me shoes with a slight flaw in them, even though I had not
noticed it. And the many waiters who have tried to deter me from
what they considered terrible choices.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the French even seem to sympathize with the burden of
dual nationality. After hearing me translate what my two daughters
wanted for lunch, one waiter smiled down at us and tsked over the
situation. ``Ah,'' he said. ``I see, a French mother with two
American children.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are catching on fast, though. The other day, they
insisted that I speak French to them as we walked down the street
so nobody would know they did not entirely belong here.

<P>
   Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA says there is so much nuclear black market activity in
the former Soviet Union that the agency cannot rule out the
possibility that Iran has acquired enough fissile material for a
nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   _ Satellite photographs show that in the past year Iraq has
rebuilt the Al Taji missile complex north of Baghdad and many other
military sites damaged by U.S. air strikes in late 1998. Officials
admit, however, that they don't know whether Iraq has reconstituted
its chemical and biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clinton administration acknowledges that aid money to
Russia's civilian germ research may have been secretly diverted to
Biopreparat, a shadowy organization that once directed the Soviet
Union's germ warfare program.
</P>
<P>
   These developments, worrisome enough by themselves, have led
experts to a larger and still more troubling concern that U.S.
intelligence services may be incapable of monitoring the
proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear expertise and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony on Capitol Hill last week by George J. Tenet, the
director of central intelligence, was hardly reassuring. Now, more
than ever before, he glumly warned members of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, ``we risk substantial surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   While the CIA and U.S. law enforcement officials have thwarted
plots by terrorist groups against U.S. targets in the past, Tenet
bluntly told the senators, ``I must be frank in saying that this
has only succeeded in buying time against an increasingly dangerous
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie H. Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations
and a former journalist and senior government official, agreed with
Tenet, noting that terrorists and rogue states were making it
harder for anyone to monitor them. ``People now commercially
encrypt sensitive communication and don't talk over cell phones,''
he said. Countries bury telephone lines and rely less on microwave
transmissions. ``A lot of what NSA used to get simply isn't
gettable now,'' Gelb said, referring to the National Security
Administration. ``And we don't know how to reacquire it.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread of so-called dual-use technology _ guidance and
control equipment, electronic test equipment and speciality
materials _ all of which can be used for legitimate and
illegitimate purposes, has also complicated matters. For example,
there is ``substantial overlap,'' says Tenet, between what is
needed to make a vaccine and a biological warfare agent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another area of concern is that the pool of skilled weapons
technicians is larger than ever, administration officials say. The
end of the Soviet germ warfare program alone left tens of thousands
of former employees in desperate financial straits, and tracking
their whereabouts is difficult, intelligence officials say. Iran,
for one, continues to recruit such talent with some success, U.S.
and Russian government officials agree.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, the director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution and a former member of the Bush
administration, adds that proliferators are extremely ``tough
targets.'' Iraq's unconventional weapons programs, he said, ``were
in every sense of the word hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering information in countries with which the United States
lacks formal relations is also challenging. ``We have very few
people going in and out who can tell us things,'' Haass says. He
adds that American intelligence is now paying for ``years of
underinvesting in `humint,' '' _ intelligence collected by people
rather than by satellites or monitoring devices.
</P>
<P>
   Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA analyst and writer, says, ``The
CIA's clandestine service, a highly bureaucratic, sclerotic
institution that still remains most at home on the diplomatic
cocktail circuit overseas, is structurally, culturally, and
linguistically ill-prepared to undertake the long-term,
unconventional work needed to place an agent inside a critical
weapons facility.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the agency came to depend on ``walk-ins'' who
freely come to the agency. But exceptional walk-ins _ ``the sources
of our finest espionage'' _ are rare, Gerecht said, ``which is why
our human intelligence on hostile weapons-of-mass-destruction
programs has always been, and probably will remain, poor if not
nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also blame the agency for withholding information
it does have. When two government agencies made grants between 1995
and 1997 that benefited Biopreparat, the Russian joint stock
company that the United States fears may still be tied to covert
Russian germ research, officials responsible for the grants said
they had not known that Biopreparat was under a cloud. But the CIA
had known about that entity ever since the defection of a key
Russian scientist in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, too, has helped to reduce America's intelligence
effectiveness. Over the past two years it cut nearly by half
funding for Russian scientists, whom the administration says have
provided invaluable insights into the Soviet Union's germ warfare
programs and the current status of those once involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Clinton administration blameless. Senior officials,
citing their need for better information to assess whether Iraq is
reconstituting its unconventional weapons programs, in January
supported a new inspection program created by the U.N. Security
Council. But Daniel Byman, a policy analyst at the Rand Corp.,
writes in the latest issue of the journal ``Foreign Affairs'' that
the United Nations' system is so enfeebled that it will probably do
more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors themselves will most likely be an inexperienced
group, deprived of Security Council backing and a strong director,
Byman wrote. As such, the inspection agency will in all probability
find ``only what Saddam wanted them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein could then claim Iraq is certifiably free of
weapons of mass destruction, which could ultimately cause sanctions
against his country to be lifted. At that point he could easily
import whatever he needed to rebuild his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's acceptance of the impotent inspection
regime, meanwhile, is a timely reminder that the United States
usually comes to depend most upon the nighttime world of spies and
spying only after failing to pursue effective policies in broad
daylight.

<P>
   Just as 130 nations were meeting in Montreal recently to forge
the first global treaty regulating genetically modified crops,
Frito-Lay Inc. was telling its farmers in the United States not to
grow genetically engineered corn for use in Doritos chips and other
snacks. The problem, the company said, was not a risk to health
from the corn but a risk that consumers wouldn't want it.
</P>
<P>
   These two events reflect the unease with which genetically
engineered foods have been received. Science has reached what might
be the takeoff stage for a new green revolution. But it may instead
go the way of nuclear power _ a once-promising technology largely
rejected by society.
</P>
<P>
   The potential benefits of genetic engineering are huge. The use
of cotton with a gene allowing it to make its own pesticide has
already led to a reduction in the amount of chemical pesticides
being sprayed in fields. Bio-engineered plants might soon be used
to produce plastics and other substances now made using diminishing
supplies of petroleum in dangerous, polluting petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, biotechnology could also make food healthier _
think tomatoes with cancer-fighting substances and cooking oils
lower in fats. And for the developing world it could offer the
promise of increased food output and of vaccines incorporated into
bananas rather than syringes, making them cheaper and easier to
deliver. Swiss researchers have already used genetic engineering to
develop a strain of rice with vitamin A, a lack of which now causes
millions of cases of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no evidence that any of the genetically
engineered foods now on the market have harmed anyone, or have much
of an impact on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But such engineering seems to conjure up images of mad
scientists playing God. Opponents have been quick to use the label
``Frankenfoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of biotechnology argue that mankind has long been
manipulating genes through conventional plant and animal breeding.
If anything, they say, genetic engineering is more precise because
it introduces just one or two known genes into a plant. With
conventional breeding, thousands of unknown genes are transferred
in order to get the one with the desired trait.
</P>
<P>
   But cross-breeding works only between plants or animals of the
same or closely related species. Genetic engineering allows species
barriers to be crossed in a new way _ to put bacterial genes in
corn or fish genes in tomatoes. Even biotechnology supporters
concede that genetic tinkering can have unanticipated results. It
is possible that unexpected toxins or allergens can be introduced
into crops through genetic engineering, though the Food and Drug
Administration insists all modified crops are now screened for
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   There is more evidence to support the possibility of negative
effects on the environment. A plant with a gene to fight off
insects might spread that gene through pollination, creating, say,
weeds that can no longer be controlled. Genetically improved fish
might drive native species to extinction. And a study has shown
that genetically altered corn plants can harm monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly worrisome is that because biological
systems reproduce, such genetic pollution cannot be cleaned up like
a chemical spill or recalled like a defective automobile. Once the
gene is out of the bottle, so to speak, it cannot be put back in.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where opposition to genetically modified foods has
been strongest, other factors are also at play. There have been
food scares unconnected with genetic engineering, such as mad cow
disease and dioxin-contaminated chickens, which have contributed to
unease. It is also true that consumers do not yet see the benefits
of genetic modification. The products now out, such as
insect-resistant corn and Roundup Ready soybeans, which are
impervious to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, are meant to help
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while the developing world could benefit greatly from
a vitamin-A rice or plants that can tolerate drought, the current
products are seen as aimed mainly at wealthy farmers in developed
countries. ``Roundup Ready _ that doesn't solve any problems except
for the shareholders of Monsanto,'' said Dr. Ossama El-Tayeb, a
delegate from Egypt at the Montreal treaty talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives at bio-engineered seed companies say their
mistake was to regard the farmer and not the consumer as the
customer. With no apparent benefit, it is easy to shun even a
minuscule risk, just to be safe. That puts the industry in a
position of having to prove absolute safety, which is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, some food and beverage companies like Frito-Lay,
Seagram and Gerber are forgoing genetically modified crops so as
not to scare off consumers. So what started as protests from a tiny
group of activists has become a trend that is forcing farmers and
grain processors to segregate non-modified from modified grains.
This could ease the way toward labeling foods containing
genetically modified organisms, something the food industry fears
would be tantamount to a skull and crossbones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is very early days in the bio-engineering era, and
genetically altered foods may well succeed. After all, society
accepts drugs made by putting human genes in hamster cells, even
though this crosses species barriers as much as agricultural
biotechnology does. The analogy is not perfect; drugs are targeted
to particular people who are willing to bear the risks, and indeed
may have no choice. Food, on the other hand, is sold to the whole
populations, which have alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, drugs are tested in advance for safety and efficacy
more thoroughly than food is. Nonetheless, it seems clear that the
way to acceptance of genetically engineered foods lies through the
creation of regulations that the public trusts and the delivery of
benefits the consumer sees and tastes.

   There's a foreign object in the ring!
</P>
<P>
   Just days after its Super Bowl-winning coach (Dick Vermeil)
retired and its second player in two months (Ray Lewis) was
arrested on murder charges, the National Football League now has to
grapple with this: The renegade World Wrestling Federation is
starting its own football circuit next February.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the barbarous, spandexed, testosterone-pickled theater of
professional wrestling is invading the barbarous, spandexed,
testosterone-pickled theater of professional football. The WWF
gleefully unveiled its plans for the XFL _ the X stands for
``xciting,'' ``xplosive'' and ``xtreme,'' naturally _ at a New York
press conference with onlookers grudgingly nodding that this thing
could actually work.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the WWF knows more about lowest common denominators
than Euclid.
</P>
<P>
   Having built its billion-dollar programming and merchandising
empire on sating fans' basest desires with cartoonish villains and
blood-soaked steel-cage matches, the WWF hopes to apply similar
rawness to the XFL.
</P>
<P>
   Outcomes will not be scripted, but looser rules will allow a
return to the finest traditions of ``smash-mouth football,'' as the
pugnacious WWF mastermind Vince McMahon called it. Meanwhile,
microphones and cameras will pummel fans into sensorial ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Fair catches will be discouraged so more runners get creamed on
punt returns. No in-the-grasp rule will protect ``lilly-white
quarterbacks,'' McMahon vowed. He didn't specify just what felony a
player will have to commit to get called for a personal foul,
merely saying, ``This will not be a league for pantywaists or
sissies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras inside helmets will let viewers experience huddles and
play-calling up close, and perhaps enjoy the vicarious pleasure of
being run over by a huge person wearing armor. Microphones will
deliver coaches' sideline diatribes live.
</P>
<P>
   At least one WWF fan is looking forward to the XFL: Bob
Kuberski, a 6-foot-4, 300-pound Philadelphian who happens to play
defensive tackle for the NFL's New England Patriots. ``I think it's
a good idea,'' Kuberski said. ``Go out there, cut it loose, see
what kind of interesting twists they can put on the game. It'll be
real physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about whether the WWF can run a legitimate football
league only widened McMahon's Cheshire-cat grin. ``May I never be
thought of as legit,'' he sighed. ``Anything but that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether hyped-up opponents will be encouraged to stage screaming
matches outside locker rooms remains to be seen. But asked later
whom he meant with his ``sissies'' remark, McMahon barked, ``I
think I'm looking at one now.''
</P>
<P>
   You go, Vince!

   In late December, a small Silicon Valley law firm, tired of
losing lawyers to Internet start-ups, raised salaries for its
associates by a remarkable 40 percent. Within a few weeks, larger
firms in the Bay Area _ including some with offices in New York _
matched the raises. By last week, many prestigious New York firms
felt compelled to follow suit and pay first-year lawyers as much as
$140,000 a year before bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Stoking the fire was a group of chat boards on Yahoo!
(www.clubs.yahoo.com) known as Greedy Associates where lawyers
compare salary data. The boards include Unhappy Rich Associates
(dubbed ``A place to talk about golden handcuffs . . .''), Greedy
Kansas City (``Midwesterners love money as much as anyone'') and
Greedy New York Associates (``The greediest of all'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The associate grapevine is extraordinary,'' said Tower C. Snow
Jr., chairman of San Francisco-based Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison,
who said that ``without question'' the Greedy Associates sites have
played a role in the speed of the recent raises.
</P>
<P>
   The chat boards also give associates, disguised by nicknames
like Lady Greediva, a place to gripe about firms that pay new
lawyers only $100,000 a year and a forum to engage in often vulgar
banter _ none of it, of course, during billing hours.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from recent postings follow.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In late January, before the pay increases
became widespread, one exchange upbraided a New York firm that
planned to give raises only to its Bay Area offices. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A few associates have in fact given notice, and many more are
complaining in the most vivid of terms . . . A very significant
portion of the lumpenassociates (numbering several dozen) are
preparing, in concert, to demand a matching raise at that meeting .
. . There has even been talk of a work stoppage. . .
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, I think most of NYC associates should have a sympathy
work stoppage with them (it works for French truckers, after all) _
it is outrageous. . . . It is clear that the only solution to
restore order is a rapid apology and matching-or-better raise.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Not surprisingly, the general feeling is
that the New York firms had no excuse not to match. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Do we demand that all NY firms pay up to the ((Silicon Valley))
standard? Do we cut the NY firms with ((per-partner profits)) lower
than $500,000 a little bit of a break? I would note, in passing,
that Burger King doesn't pay its flippers any less just because it
is less profitable than McDonalds.
</P>
<P>
   I like my job _ no, really _ but that lake house and the new
Yukon that I could have right now are constant temptations.
</P>
<P>
   My 2 cents (all I can afford, as my firm has yet to raise): . .
. I don't expect firms pulling in less than 750k to be able to take
the monstrous cuts to partner profits (or rather, I don't expect
them to choose to).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Firms in other cities _ including Los
Angeles and Washington _ had yet to take action last week, and
lawyers there were none too happy. Even some New Yorkers started to
wonder how good they had it. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   If BIGLAW DC does not react with major raises, I guarantee you
that BIGLAW DC will face a brain drain. Come BIGLAW DC!!!!!!!! SHOW
ME THE MONEY OR I'LL SHOW MYSELF THE DOOR!!! Do any BIGLAW DC
partners really think that we associates (or at least 99 percent of
us) went to big firms for any other reason but the money?
</P>
<P>
   there is no point in being a dc attorney anymore.
</P>
<P>
   jobs, money, and prestige are all elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for anyone too old to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone else think that all these raises being announced by
NY firms are wishy-washy? . . . Telling me that you will pay me a
bonus is no good. I want to know what it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Top law students, like myself, in the Northeast are looking
Westward. NYC, DC and Boston firms are too cheap for our blood. We
feel bad for the East Coast recruiters that will be sitting in
empty rooms come next fall.
</P>

 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ While they have yet to appear in one of those pop-psych
quizzes that offer instant analyses of your home life, here are two
questions to see if your family problems have gone from domestic
dispute to full-blown dysfunction:
</P>
<P>
   Has Fidel Castro ever rallied thousands of people to denounce
you as a kidnapper while your nephew went on network television to
say he'd like to come to your hometown and break some necks?
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever enlisted a member of Congress to bestow honorary
citizenship on your nephew's son, saying he would be better off
with you than with his father in Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes to either question, chances are you and your
relatives suffer from a peculiar form of dysfunction that has
befallen the Gonzalez family of Cuba and Miami. And not just them.
</P>
<P>
   This syndrome involves a breakdown in an extended family that
includes all of Cuba and about half of Miami, not to mention much
of the political establishments in Washington and Havana. In fact,
it has come to mirror all the bitter political divisions and
dysfunction of the last four decades in the last confrontation of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are familiar: Since November, the Gonzalez clans of
Miami, Florida and Cardenas, Cuba, have been waging a loud custody
battle over Elian Gonzalez and whether he should stay in Miami or
be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father has said he would like to come to Miami with a rifle,
as well as ``break the necks'' of his relatives' political allies.
The relatives have crowed that Elian was ``more on this side than
on that side'' after his recent, brief meeting with his two
grandmothers, who returned to Cuba without him. Both sides mutter
about each other's failings, tossing out epithets ranging from
``criminal'' to ``Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   But how different is that from the potshots traded over the
years between Miami's exiles, Cuba's Communists, their supporters
on both sides and, for that matter, between the various bickering
camps within the Cuban exile community? The unraveling of Elian's
family ties is just the latest example of a bigger but just as
tortured relationship between the exile community and Cuba, and
between Washington and Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the emotions seen in the custody fight anything new. As
in family matters, denunciation rather than reconciliation is often
the goal in most exchanges between the Castro regime and its sworn
enemies in Miami. Castro has always manipulated such animosities
for political advantage. And with the political power that southern
Florida exerts, the tit-for-tat response of the Cuban exiles spills
over into American policy. Often reason loses out.
</P>
<P>
   Take one example: Several years ago, Cuba shot down exile planes
that had invaded its airspace while searching for rafters. The
Clinton administration, which had wanted to lower tensions, found
itself instead tightening America's trade embargo, which Castro
uses as an excuse for his excesses. The reason: the most vocal
Cubans here support the embargo as a weapon against Castro, even
though the people harmed most, it seems, are their own relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity filters down into areas that would be apolitical
anywhere else. A few weeks ago, the organizers of the Latin Grammy
Awards bolted to California after their plans to stage the event in
South Florida fell through because of worries that the presence of
some wrinkled musicians from Cuba might spark protests. In past
years, exhibitions featuring Cuban artists have prompted bomb
threats from people intent on keeping America safe from offending
oils.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the issue at hand, the response is the same:
Name-calling replaces conversation. Fear that the other side may
get satisfaction blocks any chance to solve a problem. Each side
digs in its heels and hurls verbal thunderbolts. Communist!
Imperialist! Traitor!
</P>
<P>
   These vitriolic accusations have a ring very familiar to anyone
who has been listening in on the Gonzalez case. Or, for that
matter, to what happens every day in Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the family's laundry is aired in family cases,'' said
Bernard Perlmutter, the director of the Children and Youth Law
Clinic at the University of Miami. ``We have grandparents and
uncles who stand before the judge and they whine and they accuse
and they complain and they defend. The kinds of families that come
before family court judges are families that have broken down and
are almost irremediably dysfunctional. That's what we see playing
out on the world stage in Elian's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in more obscure custody cases, relatives often resort to
lawsuits or outright abduction. They try to sway the child with
gifts, or sour him on the other parent with whispered, disparaging
remarks. In a way, the child becomes a bystander in these fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When adults fight with each other, they tend to forget how to
insulate the child from it and maintain a relationship with the
child while fighting,'' said Albert J. Solnit, the former director
of the Yale Child Study Center. ``In custody conflicts you often
see people fighting about getting even with each other and using
the child as the pawn.''
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, all this seems to have happened, and on an epic
scale.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The demand that the boy be allowed to stay in Miami ``strikes to
the heart of what this community is about, that exile is a good
thing,'' said Lisandro Perez, the director of the Cuban Research
Institute at Florida International University. ``The early Russians
who were exiled by the Bolsheviks saw exile as the worst that could
happen. Cubans do not see it that way. They almost demand the
people become exiles.''
</P>
<P>
   But those demands have been met with equally loud, if more
orchestrated, responses in Havana, where the government has seized
the case to revive flagging revolutionary sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Even neighbors in Elian's hometown, while feeling for the
family, speak of the custody case as a showdown between capitalists
and Communists. ``The world knows that if a country is powerful
economically it is because it has been exploiting underdeveloped
countries,'' said Agustin Serrano. ``If those poor countries try to
protest and claim what is theirs, must they succumb? Must they die?
That is the case of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian _ remember him? Solnit said the longer Elian is away from
his father, the more attached he will become to his Miami
relatives, making it all the more difficult to resume a normal
relationship with him. ``No country is perfect,'' Solnit said. ``I
prefer to live here. But I don't know if that makes much sense to a
child whose main country is really his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   That is pretty much the case the Clinton administration and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service have argued as a basis for
returning Elian to Cuba. But even they are part of a larger
struggle, and with the courts, Congress and Castro all involved, a
meeting of minds seems unlikely for now. Perhaps, Perlmutter
suggested, it is time for a third party to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way of working out family problems is to rely on
alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or
referring the family to counseling,'' he said. ``But I don't know
how you are going to psychoanalyze the Cuban family in this case
and mediate 40 years of enmity and anger that is so deep rooted.''

 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ While they have yet to appear in one of those pop-psych
quizzes that offer instant analyses of your home life, here are two
questions to see if your family problems have gone from domestic
dispute to full-blown dysfunction:
</P>
<P>
   Has Fidel Castro ever rallied thousands of people to denounce
you as a kidnapper while your nephew went on network television to
say he'd like to come to your hometown and break some necks?
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever enlisted a member of Congress to bestow honorary
citizenship on your nephew's son, saying he would be better off
with you than with his father in Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes to either question, chances are you and your
relatives suffer from a peculiar form of dysfunction that has
befallen the Gonzalez family of Cuba and Miami. And not just them.
</P>
<P>
   This syndrome involves a breakdown in an extended family that
includes all of Cuba and about half of Miami, not to mention much
of the political establishments in Washington and Havana. In fact,
it has come to mirror all the bitter political divisions and
dysfunction of the last four decades in the last confrontation of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are familiar: Since November, the Gonzalez clans of
Miami, Florida and Cardenas, Cuba, have been waging a loud custody
battle over Elian Gonzalez and whether he should stay in Miami or
be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father has said he would like to come to Miami with a rifle,
as well as ``break the necks'' of his relatives' political allies.
The relatives have crowed that Elian was ``more on this side than
on that side'' after his recent, brief meeting with his two
grandmothers, who returned to Cuba without him. Both sides mutter
about each other's failings, tossing out epithets ranging from
``criminal'' to ``Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   But how different is that from the potshots traded over the
years between Miami's exiles, Cuba's Communists, their supporters
on both sides and, for that matter, between the various bickering
camps within the Cuban exile community? The unraveling of Elian's
family ties is just the latest example of a bigger but just as
tortured relationship between the exile community and Cuba, and
between Washington and Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the emotions seen in the custody fight anything new. As
in family matters, denunciation rather than reconciliation is often
the goal in most exchanges between the Castro regime and its sworn
enemies in Miami. Castro has always manipulated such animosities
for political advantage. And with the political power that southern
Florida exerts, the tit-for-tat response of the Cuban exiles spills
over into American policy. Often reason loses out.
</P>
<P>
   Take one example: Several years ago, Cuba shot down exile planes
that had invaded its airspace while searching for rafters. The
Clinton administration, which had wanted to lower tensions, found
itself instead tightening America's trade embargo, which Castro
uses as an excuse for his excesses. The reason: the most vocal
Cubans here support the embargo as a weapon against Castro, even
though the people harmed most, it seems, are their own relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity filters down into areas that would be apolitical
anywhere else. A few weeks ago, the organizers of the Latin Grammy
Awards bolted to California after their plans to stage the event in
South Florida fell through because of worries that the presence of
some wrinkled musicians from Cuba might spark protests. In past
years, exhibitions featuring Cuban artists have prompted bomb
threats from people intent on keeping America safe from offending
oils.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the issue at hand, the response is the same:
Name-calling replaces conversation. Fear that the other side may
get satisfaction blocks any chance to solve a problem. Each side
digs in its heels and hurls verbal thunderbolts. Communist!
Imperialist! Traitor!
</P>
<P>
   These vitriolic accusations have a ring very familiar to anyone
who has been listening in on the Gonzalez case. Or, for that
matter, to what happens every day in Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the family's laundry is aired in family cases,'' said
Bernard Perlmutter, the director of the Children and Youth Law
Clinic at the University of Miami. ``We have grandparents and
uncles who stand before the judge and they whine and they accuse
and they complain and they defend. The kinds of families that come
before family court judges are families that have broken down and
are almost irremediably dysfunctional. That's what we see playing
out on the world stage in Elian's case.''
</P>
<P>

lawsuits or outright abduction. They try to sway the child with
gifts, or sour him on the other parent with whispered, disparaging
remarks. In a way, the child becomes a bystander in these fights.

   ``When adults fight with each other, they tend to forget how to
insulate the child from it and maintain a relationship with the
child while fighting,'' said Albert J. Solnit, the former director
of the Yale Child Study Center. ``In custody conflicts you often
see people fighting about getting even with each other and using
the child as the pawn.''
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, all this seems to have happened, and on an epic
scale.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An obstetrician here lost his license last week for
carving his initials into the belly of a patient after he delivered
her first child.
</P>
<P>
   The incident and the actions taken afterward have raised ethical
questions about the responsibilities of American hospitals and
legal ones about when doctors should face criminal prosecution, and
not just malpractice suits.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Allan Zarkin cut his initials into Dr. Liana Gedz,
after her Caesarean section at Beth Israel Medical Center last
September, he set off an institutional chain of events: Beth Israel
promptly forced Zarkin, 61, to resign and reported him to the state
Health Department weeks later, citing ``grossly inappropriate
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But the language raised no red flags with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department began an investigation, suspending Zarkin
three months later. During that time, the doctor worked as medical
director at a Queens abortion and prenatal clinic where witnesses
said he botched several procedures. Beth Israel officials also met
with him to discuss setting up a nurse-midwives program at the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding its investigation last week, the state Health
Department fined Beth Israel and the abortion clinic for many
medical missteps, including not properly monitoring Zarkin.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Zarkin's lawyers say he has a brain impairment
similar to Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars of biomedical ethics are suggesting that Beth
Israel should have called the police after the incident, saying it
could be construed as assault and battery. Such medical violations,
experts say, fall into the gray area between negligent malpractice
and criminality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor walked outside of whatever protection the medical
arena could provide him and put himself in the common arena where
he could be held to criminal charges,'' said Rosemarie Tong, a
professor of health care ethics at the University of North
Carolina-Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several medical practitioners have been
criminally prosecuted, including dentists who have raped female
patients. Colorado prosecutors indicted three nurses for negligent
homicide after they wrongfully administered medicine to an infant
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last 50 years, most medical injury cases have gone
to court as civil malpractice suits rather than criminal or
intentionally wrongful injury cases. In part, malpractice suits
tend to be more lucrative than the others; plaintiffs collect money
from malpractice insurance. Courts also have tended to decide that
when doctors erred, it was without malice.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, a traditionally conservative group, often shun
interference from judicial and other governmental agencies, fearing
that it would destroy trust between doctors, patients and
hospitals. They also want to maintain patient confidentiality as
well as their own autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make a mockery of the whole medical practice, the
fact that we are now asking the police to get involved in the
practice of medicine,'' said Dr. Enayat Hakim Elahi, chief of
women's health services at Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, biomedical ethicists have been looking at the
accountability of medical institutions in recent years, arguing
that hospitals should take more responsibility for their employees
in an era when institutions, not individuals, mediate health care.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital has a moral obligation, not just a legal one, to act
in the best interests of society, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Zarkin case, Beth Israel should have done more than just
suspend the doctor and inform health care authorities, said Larry
Churchill, a professor of social medicine at the University of
North Carolina School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose this fellow was to be delivering children in the next
several days,'' he said. ``You would think, `Oh my goodness, here's
a physician who could injure more patients.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Beth Israel officials said that the
hospital follows standard protocol when patients have been victims
of a crime, encouraging them to press charges. But ``if the patient
is unwilling to proceed,'' they say, ``we will not contact the
police over their objection, unless we believe that there is
imminent danger to the patient or others.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gedz did not press criminal charges, she and her
husband filed a $5.5 million lawsuit in November that named Beth
Israel, Zarkin and his former practice as defendants. Last week,
Gedz testified before a grand jury called by the Manhattan district
attorney's office, which recently launched a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liana Gedz's position on the criminal prosecution is that it's
a giant waste of taxpayers' money,'' said her lawyer, Robert
Sullivan. ``As outraged as she is about what Zarkin did, it just
doesn't make sense. He's lost his license to practice medicine,
he's in his 60s and he's certainly not a danger to the community,
as long as he's not in an operating room with a scalpel.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ When Japan's largest newspaper recently refused
advertising from two of the country's most popular weekly
magazines, citing their sexually explicit content, it put Mizuho
Fukushima in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   As a leading feminist here, she found the magazines' big
displays of women posing nude or engaging in sex acts deeply
troubling. But as a member of parliament, she found the coverage of
current events by these same weeklies indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should take the initiative in eliminating the nudity
from these magazines,'' Fukushima said. ``But I must buy them
because they always carry stories on subjects that I need to know
about, subjects that the newspapers don't cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Fukushima's statement was a stinging indictment of Japan's huge
daily press, and one shared by growing numbers of readers in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Media critics here say that Japan, virtually alone among
advanced industrialized democracies, combines a lack of aggressive,
independent-spirited daily newspapers with a lack of commercially
successful weekly newsmagazines in the vein of Time, Newsweek, The
Economist or Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's daily newspapers boast the highest circulation figures
in the world. In the 19th century they were an instrument of
nation-building and patriotism, and critics say they have evolved
in the postwar period into increasingly complacent entities that
routinely leave a large host of taboo subjects _ from the imperial
family to corruption in sumo _ untouched. Most other matters,
meanwhile, are reported in uncritical, gazette-like snippets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers here don't write lies, but they avoid dealing with
uncomfortable truths,'' said Tatsuya Iwase, author of ``The Reason
Newspapers are not Interesting,'' a 1999 book. ``Japan has the
hardware of the Western press, but there is no software. The inside
is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Iwase said Japanese newspapers have little more than a formulaic
recognition of the freedom of speech and ``disregard the readers'
right to know.'' The public, he said, would eagerly welcome a new
newspaper that carried feistier reporting and better analysis, but
the system, from the government to the advertising powers, would do
everything to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   The textbook case illustrating the reluctance of Japan's
newspapers to dig up controversial or embarrassing stories dates to
the 1970s, when a reporter for Mainichi Shimbun produced a major
scoop about the United States' compensation to residents for
damages by the U.S. military in Okinawa. Rather than being
rewarded, the reporter was accused of having had an affair with a
source and was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's racy weeklies regularly plunge into this void with
gusto, revealing scandals in government and delving into many other
subjects that the dailies deem too controversial. Recently there
have been articles asserting that the government kept the victim of
a recent nuclear accident alive just long enough to get a new
nuclear safety bill passed. Other reports have detailed heavy,
behind-the-scenes pressures to produce an heir that were placed on
the crown prince's wife prior to her recent miscarriage, and
scandals within the finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We present articles that the newspapers should write, but
don't touch,'' said Tetsu Suzuki, editor in chief of Shukan Gendai,
which claims a weekly circulation of 930,000.
</P>
<P>
   But what news these magazines carry is buried among nude photos,
obscene comics, serialized fiction and titillating reports. For
many readers, the result is that no matter how serious an article
is _ and a good number are based on hard fact _ it is usually taken
with a large grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   So the weeklies seem to serve more as pressure valves for
burdensome matters in a society that shuns open disputes and
confrontational debate, than they do as journalistic crusaders for
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Hall, a historian and author of ``Cartels of the Mind,'' a
powerful recent critique of Japan's intellectual closed-mindedness,
likened the role to the Japanese salaryman's ritual of drinking
after work with superiors. Once drunk, all manner of truths may be
safely spoken _ and are sure to be forgotten, or at least played
down, the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   Even seen in this light, Japan's pulp weeklies are somewhat less
than meet the eye. ``The taboos for newspapers involve anything to
do with power: the government, the parliament, justice,'' said
Yasunari Okadome, publisher and editor of Uwasa no Shinso, a
crusading monthly that refuses major corporate advertising. ``These
matters go to the weeklies. But the weeklies cannot be totally free
either, because they are afraid of Dentsu, and of the tax
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a growing body of press criticism says Japan's
mainstream dailies suffer from their cosseted relationships with
the government and other powerful institutions, while the fat,
glossy-covered weeklies pull some of their punches out of fear of
Japan's huge and omnipresent advertising agency, Dentsu, an
integral part of a deeply conservative establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Okadome and others say, Japanese journalism is
weakened by tax codes and other legal favors that inhibit
competition among newspapers and help keep them tame. But the most
important factor, many say, is the institution of the kisha clubs _
press clubs paid for by government agencies and private industries
for the mainstream reporters that cover them.
</P>
<P>
   These are typically the places of work of the reporters, who
often simply wait for news to be handed out to them and compare
notes before writing. Hall likened them to cartels: ``They keep out
the weeklies, they keep out the foreign press and they tamp down
embarrassing matters on behalf of their sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Japanese newspapers admit that the kisha clubs pose
problems, but argue that critics who focus on them miss the point.
Culture, they say, more than anything else, divides Western
journalism from its Japanese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Japan lacks the adversarial, fiercely independent spirit that is
the ideal in Western journalism, according to Yoshibumi Wakamiya, a
deputy managing editor at the daily Asahi Shimbun, who declared
himself unsatisfied with his country's journalism but aware that
another country's style cannot be easily transplanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japanese society, it is difficult to hold healthy
debates,'' he said. ``The person you are debating will feel their
personality is under attack, and will hold a grudge. That is
Japanese society, and we have to get information from our
politicians. If you ask sharp questions, you may end up being
isolated, even from other journalists.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ When Japan's largest newspaper recently refused
advertising from two of the country's most popular weekly
magazines, citing their sexually explicit content, it put Mizuho
Fukushima in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   As a leading feminist here, she found the magazines' big
displays of women posing nude or engaging in sex acts deeply
troubling. But as a member of parliament, she found the coverage of
current events by these same weeklies indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should take the initiative in eliminating the nudity
from these magazines,'' Fukushima said. ``But I must buy them
because they always carry stories on subjects that I need to know
about, subjects that the newspapers don't cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Fukushima's statement was a stinging indictment of Japan's huge
daily press, and one shared by growing numbers of readers in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Media critics here say that Japan, virtually alone among
advanced industrialized democracies, combines a lack of aggressive,
independent-spirited daily newspapers with a lack of commercially
successful weekly newsmagazines in the vein of Time, Newsweek, The
Economist or Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's daily newspapers boast the highest circulation figures
in the world. In the 19th century they were an instrument of
nation-building and patriotism, and critics say they have evolved
in the postwar period into increasingly complacent entities that
routinely leave a large host of taboo subjects _ from the imperial
family to corruption in sumo _ untouched. Most other matters,
meanwhile, are reported in uncritical, gazette-like snippets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers here don't write lies, but they avoid dealing with
uncomfortable truths,'' said Tatsuya Iwase, author of ``The Reason
Newspapers are not Interesting,'' a 1999 book. ``Japan has the
hardware of the Western press, but there is no software. The inside
is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Iwase said Japanese newspapers have little more than a formulaic
recognition of the freedom of speech and ``disregard the readers'
right to know.'' The public, he said, would eagerly welcome a new
newspaper that carried feistier reporting and better analysis, but
the system, from the government to the advertising powers, would do
everything to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   The textbook case illustrating the reluctance of Japan's
newspapers to dig up controversial or embarrassing stories dates to
the 1970s, when a reporter for Mainichi Shimbun produced a major
scoop about the United States' compensation to residents for
damages by the U.S. military in Okinawa. Rather than being
rewarded, the reporter was accused of having had an affair with a
source and was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's racy weeklies regularly plunge into this void with
gusto, revealing scandals in government and delving into many other
subjects that the dailies deem too controversial. Recently there
have been articles asserting that the government kept the victim of
a recent nuclear accident alive just long enough to get a new
nuclear safety bill passed. Other reports have detailed heavy,
behind-the-scenes pressures to produce an heir that were placed on
the crown prince's wife prior to her recent miscarriage, and
scandals within the finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We present articles that the newspapers should write, but
don't touch,'' said Tetsu Suzuki, editor in chief of Shukan Gendai,
which claims a weekly circulation of 930,000.
</P>
<P>
   But what news these magazines carry is buried among nude photos,
obscene comics, serialized fiction and titillating reports. For
many readers, the result is that no matter how serious an article
is _ and a good number are based on hard fact _ it is usually taken
with a large grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   So the weeklies seem to serve more as pressure valves for
burdensome matters in a society that shuns open disputes and
confrontational debate, than they do as journalistic crusaders for
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Hall, a historian and author of ``Cartels of the Mind,'' a
powerful recent critique of Japan's intellectual closed-mindedness,
likened the role to the Japanese salaryman's ritual of drinking
after work with superiors. Once drunk, all manner of truths may be
safely spoken _ and are sure to be forgotten, or at least played

   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from his victory rally in New Hampshire, Vice
President Al Gore boarded Air Force Two around midnight Tuesday and
headed for New York City, and on to Washington and Ohio, winding up
in Los Angeles for a town hall meeting that ended at 1:20 a.m.
Later that morning, Gore mingled with voters in Venice, Calif.,
flew to Olympia, Wash., for a labor event and returned home to
Washington around 4:30 a.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, also departed New
Hampshire after midnight Tuesday for a similarly punishing schedule
that took him to New York, San Francisco and Hartford, Conn., over
the same period. It was so grueling and the plane to the West Coast
grew so chilly that the normally placid Bradley roamed the aisles
cursing about another cold dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats may have been on adrenaline highs after the
New Hampshire primary, but their frantic _ and virtually sleepless
_ transcontinental hopscotch was driven by genuine political
imperatives: all the states they visited _ and 11 more _ have
Democratic contests March 7, a single day of voting so colossal
that candidates are calling it Titanic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many electoral powerhouses held so many
contests simultaneously. Rather than a traditional primary season,
voters are now faced with what is, in essence, a campaign that
resembles a general election. And as much as critics call it a rush
to judgment, Titanic Tuesday may turn out to be not so bad for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   More voters may have more influence over who gets the Democratic
and Republican nominations than they have had in many years.
Roughly one third of the delegates to the parties' nominating
conventions will be picked, meaning that more than one third of
eligible voters will get to participate. And the compressed
calendar could resemble a European-style election: a compact but
intense primary season where many voters pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true because, for now at least, there are
unexpectedly competitive one-on-one contests in both parties, with
Gore vying with Bradley, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with Sen.
John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must project messages that appeal to a broad national
audience, losing the flexibility of tailoring appeals to regional
or ideological interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dabbling in every region of the country,'' said Rhodes
Cook, a political analyst who has examined the 2000 calendar
closely. ``It's a national sampler, so candidates have to show
strength in every part of the country. It makes this year a fairer
test than in '92 or '96, when it was New Hampshire, Ohio, South
Carolina and then a block of states in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because the run up to March 7 will be the closest the
United States has come to a national primary, there will be less
incentive for candidates to try to pander to particular states or
regions. When the Democratic race turned south in 1992, for
example, Paul Tsongas ridiculed Bill Clinton as a ``pander bear''
for, among other things, his narrow appeals to the elderly in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When candidates do appeal to narrow audiences, the new national
dynamic could beam that message much farther afield. When Bush
pounded a conservative message in a speech at Bob Jones University
in South Carolina last week, Bradley roundly criticized him for
appearing at the Southern Christian bastion, which lost its
tax-exempt status in the 1970s because it prohibited interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   While critics of the big primary day argue that each state on
that day will be competing for attention from the candidates _ and
smaller states like Maine, Maryland and Vermont might be neglected
_ it is also true that the sheer number of contests could stir up
even greater national interest and a bigger voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a tremendous amount of attention and focus for a
short amount of time,'' said Carter Eskew, one of Gore's top
strategists, ``and that might draw people into the process. It's a
critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Glantz, Bradley's campaign manager, said it was a struggle
trying to figure out where her candidate should spend his time.
After campaigning 49 days in New Hampshire, for instance, he now
has 30 more days to make his pitch in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many places you'd like to go and there are a
limited number of days,'' Glantz said. ``But you look to do things
to spark a national interest.''

<P>
   On the Republican side, the dynamics are not quite as oriented
to a national campaign because there is an important primary in
South Carolina on Feb. 19, and a pair of crucial contests three
days later in Michigan and Arizona. But Bush has, for months,
painstakingly assembled organizations in many states that vote
March 7. And McCain is hoping that the shower of national attention
he is enjoying from his landslide upset in New Hampshire will allow
him to overcome Bush's towering organizational advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For all the allure of more states participating, many prominent
Democrats and Republicans are horrified about the glut of
primaries. They argue that the sprawling nature of the contests
will put so much pressure on candidates to be in so many places at
once that their campaigns will amount to little more than 30-second
television commercials and cameo drop-ins at airport tarmacs.
</P>
<P>
   As Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party,
put it, ``You've taken down your Christmas tree and people want you
to decide who they should vote for president. It's bad for
presidential candidates and campaigns. It's bad for the body
politic. I unsuccessfully tried to do something about it as
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the crush of early primaries was purely
accidental: several states moved up their contests in a play for
more influence. But this time, the public may be served. The voters
of Iowa and New Hampshire played their usual role of inspecting the
candidates up close, helping winnow the field and pressing upon the
candidates the need to be responsive and listen to voters. Now that
the candidates have been introduced to the public and bloodied a
bit it is time for a far broader electorate to have its say.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, does not
see the merits. ``It's the antithesis of what happens in New
Hampshire,'' Wilson said. ``It becomes this television
extravaganza. It is exhausting for the participants, the candidates
and the public, and can produce results that were not seen by the
framers of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Wilson sees the barrage of talking heads on television
as negative, their messages may reach more voters. Even before they
left Manchester late Tuesday night, Gore and Bradley sat for round
after round of interviews with local television stations in states
that have contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the campaigns are already plotting how best to
compete. The big question, obviously, is how they divide their
precious days _ a subject about which the campaigns are cagey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere between a closely guarded secret and a
no-brainer,'' Eskew said. ``Obviously, we're going to spend time in
New York, Ohio, California and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, McCain's aides are trying to settle on an East
Coast-West Coast shuffle. ``There are ways to make the time zone
work for you,'' said Mike Murphy, a strategist for McCain. ``You
start on the East Coast. You move with the time zone to California,
then you red-eye back to the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tarmac-to-tarmac campaign, there is one constituency, at
least, that can't grouse about being neglected: voters who cool
their heels in the frequent flyer lounges.

   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from his victory rally in New Hampshire, Vice
President Al Gore boarded Air Force Two around midnight Tuesday and
headed for New York City, and on to Washington and Ohio, winding up
in Los Angeles for a town hall meeting that ended at 1:20 a.m.
Later that morning, Gore mingled with voters in Venice, Calif.,
flew to Olympia, Wash., for a labor event and returned home to
Washington around 4:30 a.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, also departed New
Hampshire after midnight Tuesday for a similarly punishing schedule
that took him to New York, San Francisco and Hartford, Conn., over
the same period. It was so grueling and the plane to the West Coast
grew so chilly that the normally placid Bradley roamed the aisles
cursing about another cold dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats may have been on adrenaline highs after the
New Hampshire primary, but their frantic _ and virtually sleepless
_ transcontinental hopscotch was driven by genuine political
imperatives: all the states they visited _ and 11 more _ have
Democratic contests March 7, a single day of voting so colossal
that candidates are calling it Titanic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many electoral powerhouses held so many
contests simultaneously. Rather than a traditional primary season,
voters are now faced with what is, in essence, a campaign that
resembles a general election. And as much as critics call it a rush
to judgment, Titanic Tuesday may turn out to be not so bad for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   More voters may have more influence over who gets the Democratic
and Republican nominations than they have had in many years.
Roughly one third of the delegates to the parties' nominating
conventions will be picked, meaning that more than one third of
eligible voters will get to participate. And the compressed
calendar could resemble a European-style election: a compact but
intense primary season where many voters pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true because, for now at least, there are
unexpectedly competitive one-on-one contests in both parties, with
Gore vying with Bradley, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with Sen.
John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must project messages that appeal to a broad national
audience, losing the flexibility of tailoring appeals to regional
or ideological interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dabbling in every region of the country,'' said Rhodes
Cook, a political analyst who has examined the 2000 calendar
closely. ``It's a national sampler, so candidates have to show
strength in every part of the country. It makes this year a fairer
test than in '92 or '96, when it was New Hampshire, Ohio, South
Carolina and then a block of states in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because the run up to March 7 will be the closest the
United States has come to a national primary, there will be less
incentive for candidates to try to pander to particular states or
regions. When the Democratic race turned south in 1992, for
example, Paul Tsongas ridiculed Bill Clinton as a ``pander bear''
for, among other things, his narrow appeals to the elderly in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When candidates do appeal to narrow audiences, the new national
dynamic could beam that message much farther afield. When Bush
pounded a conservative message in a speech at Bob Jones University
in South Carolina last week, Bradley roundly criticized him for
appearing at the Southern Christian bastion, which lost its
tax-exempt status in the 1970s because it prohibited interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   While critics of the big primary day argue that each state on
that day will be competing for attention from the candidates _ and
smaller states like Maine, Maryland and Vermont might be neglected
_ it is also true that the sheer number of contests could stir up
even greater national interest and a bigger voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a tremendous amount of attention and focus for a
short amount of time,'' said Carter Eskew, one of Gore's top
strategists, ``and that might draw people into the process. It's a
critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Glantz, Bradley's campaign manager, said it was a struggle
trying to figure out where her candidate should spend his time.
After campaigning 49 days in New Hampshire, for instance, he now
has 30 more days to make his pitch in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many places you'd like to go and there are a
limited number of days,'' Glantz said. ``But you look to do things
to spark a national interest.''

<P>
   On the Republican side, the dynamics are not quite as oriented
to a national campaign because there is an important primary in
South Carolina on Feb. 19, and a pair of crucial contests three
days later in Michigan and Arizona. But Bush has, for months,
painstakingly assembled organizations in many states that vote
March 7. And McCain is hoping that the shower of national attention
he is enjoying from his landslide upset in New Hampshire will allow
him to overcome Bush's towering organizational advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For all the allure of more states participating, many prominent
Democrats and Republicans are horrified about the glut of
primaries. They argue that the sprawling nature of the contests
will put so much pressure on candidates to be in so many places at
once that their campaigns will amount to little more than 30-second
television commercials and cameo drop-ins at airport tarmacs.
</P>
<P>
   As Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party,
put it, ``You've taken down your Christmas tree and people want you
to decide who they should vote for president. It's bad for
presidential candidates and campaigns. It's bad for the body
politic. I unsuccessfully tried to do something about it as
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the crush of early primaries was purely
accidental: several states moved up their contests in a play for
more influence. But this time, the public may be served. The voters
of Iowa and New Hampshire played their usual role of inspecting the
candidates up close, helping winnow the field and pressing upon the
candidates the need to be responsive and listen to voters. Now that
the candidates have been introduced to the public and bloodied a
bit it is time for a far broader electorate to have its say.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, does not
see the merits. ``It's the antithesis of what happens in New
Hampshire,'' Wilson said. ``It becomes this television
extravaganza. It is exhausting for the participants, the candidates
and the public, and can produce results that were not seen by the
framers of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Wilson sees the barrage of talking heads on television
as negative, their messages may reach more voters. Even before they
left Manchester late Tuesday night, Gore and Bradley sat for round
after round of interviews with local television stations in states
that have contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the campaigns are already plotting how best to
compete. The big question, obviously, is how they divide their
precious days _ a subject about which the campaigns are cagey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere between a closely guarded secret and a
no-brainer,'' Eskew said. ``Obviously, we're going to spend time in
New York, Ohio, California and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, McCain's aides are trying to settle on an East
Coast-West Coast shuffle. ``There are ways to make the time zone
work for you,'' said Mike Murphy, a strategist for McCain. ``You
start on the East Coast. You move with the time zone to California,
then you red-eye back to the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tarmac-to-tarmac campaign, there is one constituency, at

   VIENNA, Austria _ In the basement of the History Museum of this
wistful city, the head of the Turkish grand vizier, Kara Mustapha,
is preserved. The public is no longer allowed to see this Austrian
trophy, a souvenir of the last Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683. But
this severed head says much about European identity, Austrian
history and the vagaries of nationalism, the issues beneath the
rightist Joerg Haider's explosive intrusion on the politics of the
old continent.
</P>
<P>
   In the European psyche, Vienna is dense with symbolism. Behind
the waltzes-as-Muzak and the cozy cafes lies a darker reality on
which Haider has played. That reality includes Christian Vienna's
long rearguard action against the Turkish ``infidel,'' enthusiastic
Austrian support for Hitler and the historical distortion that long
portrayed Austria as the ``first victim of Nazi aggression.'' All
of this makes Europe uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   For the dawn of the new century finds Europe in a crusading
mood. The last hundred years saw a collective European suicide that
handed control of the world to the United States. Behind much of
the European slaughter lay various permutations of nationalist or
racist ideologies on which the postwar European Union has struggled
to turn the page, only to discover in the Balkans that old ghosts
do not die so easily.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just as European integration was going into overdrive
with the introduction of the euro, and the last war of Yugoslavia's
unraveling seems to have been fought, along comes slick, slim,
slippery Haider with his intermittently revisionist view of Hitler,
his distaste for immigrants, his anti-political-correctness and his
Austria-first fulminations to suggest that history does not
necessarily move in one direction. For him, the Turkish infidel is
back, no longer on horseback but in the form of the immigrant
``guest worker.'' No wonder Europe threw a fit. ``We have to draw
the line somewhere,'' said Michael Steiner, the chief diplomat in
the German Chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   But where? And how? And why exactly? As Haider's Freedom Party
took office in a right-wing coalition, and the European Union's 14
other nations moved to downgrade diplomatic relations with Austria,
and the United States studied similar measures, it was hard to
resist the view that some sort of subliminal compensation for past
Western failure to respond quickly to the rise of another
Austrian-born leader with a six-lettered name beginning with ``H''
was involved. ``The reaction has been absolutely overblown,'' said
Jonathan Eyal, a British foreign policy expert.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is real concern in Europe that acceptance of Haider
and his coalition with the conservative People's Party could
shatter the general consensus that center-right parties like the
French Gaullists or Germany's Christian Democrats do not go to bed
with the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally clear that Europe's mainly center-left leaders
saw an opportunity to flex their muscles on the cheap and embarrass
the right. And officials who favor a federalist Europe perceived a
unique chance to advance their cause through a new form of
interference in a member state's affairs. In all of this, the fact
that Haider's rise is also related to the stifling 30-year
dominance of the Social Democrats and their cronies was
conveniently overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Europe is engaged in a unique
historical experiment involving an unprecedented voluntary
surrender of national sovereignty _ most recently the control of
currency. And as this integration continues, the question of what
``European identity'' is on a continent whose immigrant population
grows daily becomes more pressing. Which brings us back to the
grand vizier's head.
</P>
<P>
   In twice beating back the Ottoman Turkish armies at the gates of
Vienna, the Hapsburgs and their allies were defending ``Christian
Europe.'' Yet the Hapsburg Empire was also profoundly
multinational: Vienna was sometimes compared to ``Babel'' because
of its multitude of tongues. Then, of course, came the collapse of
empire, the rise of nation states, the unfurling of nationalism _
and much 20th-century ruin.
</P>
<P>
   On these ashes, the European Union has tried to build what
Churchill in 1946 called ``the United States of Europe.'' For a
long time, it was mainly a trade bloc. But it now is more than
that, a hybrid without a name and some characteristics of a
supranational state. Can it inspire European patriotism?
</P>
<P>
   Haider says no. With his statements that ``you are not at home
in your home any more'' because of the number of immigrants, his
odious posters of fair and red-cheeked Austrian girls representing
the essence of his country's goodness, his cultivation of the fears
of blue-collar workers over foreigners waiting to take their jobs,
he says identity is national and exclusive and, where possible,
blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his efforts to throw back the clock, Europe's
reality is another. About 1.5 million immigrants pour into the
European Union every year. Aging populations, low birth rates and
European reluctance to do many menial jobs make this influx
inevitable. Europe and its immigrants need each other.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems, Europeans' sense of identity must change to
reflect growing political union and more mixed populations. But
European states have never really seen themselves as ``lands of
immigration.'' In recent years, Europe has seen assaults on Turks
in Germany, tension in France over the refusal of Muslim girls in
schools to remove headscarves and clashes between British police
and minorities.

and the United States studied similar measures, it was hard to
resist the view that some sort of subliminal compensation for past
Western failure to respond quickly to the rise of another
Austrian-born leader with a six-lettered name beginning with ``H''
was involved. ``The reaction has been absolutely overblown,'' said
Jonathan Eyal, a British foreign policy expert.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is real concern in Europe that acceptance of Haider
and his coalition with the conservative People's Party could
shatter the general consensus that center-right parties like the
French Gaullists or Germany's Christian Democrats do not go to bed
with the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally clear that Europe's mainly center-left leaders
saw an opportunity to flex their muscles on the cheap and embarrass
the right. And officials who favor a federalist Europe perceived a
unique chance to advance their cause through a new form of
interference in a member state's affairs. In all of this, the fact
that Haider's rise is also related to the stifling 30-year
dominance of the Social Democrats and their cronies was
conveniently overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Europe is engaged in a unique
historical experiment involving an unprecedented voluntary
surrender of national sovereignty _ most recently the control of
currency. And as this integration continues, the question of what
``European identity'' is on a continent whose immigrant population
grows daily becomes more pressing. Which brings us back to the
grand vizier's head.
</P>
<P>
   In twice beating back the Ottoman Turkish armies at the gates of
Vienna, the Hapsburgs and their allies were defending ``Christian
Europe.'' Yet the Hapsburg Empire was also profoundly
multinational: Vienna was sometimes compared to ``Babel'' because
of its multitude of tongues. Then, of course, came the collapse of
empire, the rise of nation states, the unfurling of nationalism _
and much 20th-century ruin.
</P>
<P>
   On these ashes, the European Union has tried to build what
Churchill in 1946 called ``the United States of Europe.'' For a
long time, it was mainly a trade bloc. But it now is more than
that, a hybrid without a name and some characteristics of a
supranational state. Can it inspire European patriotism?
</P>
<P>
   Haider says no. With his statements that ``you are not at home
in your home any more'' because of the number of immigrants, his
odious posters of fair and red-cheeked Austrian girls representing
the essence of his country's goodness, his cultivation of the fears
of blue-collar workers over foreigners waiting to take their jobs,
he says identity is national and exclusive and, where possible,
blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his efforts to throw back the clock, Europe's
reality is another. About 1.5 million immigrants pour into the
European Union every year. Aging populations, low birth rates and
European reluctance to do many menial jobs make this influx
inevitable. Europe and its immigrants need each other.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems, Europeans' sense of identity must change to
reflect growing political union and more mixed populations. But
European states have never really seen themselves as ``lands of
immigration.'' In recent years, Europe has seen assaults on Turks
in Germany, tension in France over the refusal of Muslim girls in
schools to remove headscarves and clashes between British police
and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, the main political thrust of several center-left
governments remains toward greater openness. The recent invitation
to Turkey to join the European Union reflects a broad push to make
Europeans see themselves differently, not in juxtaposition to a
vizier's head, but in acceptance of the common humanity of the
guest worker. The rise of Haider demonstrates, however, that the
battle for Europe's soul is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans do not even agree on the history that defines them. An
old joke says Austrians have convinced themselves that Hitler was a
German and Beethoven an Austrian. Certainly self-delusion and a
sense of being misunderstood are rampant in this city where Freud
uncovered the secret of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that 1 million Austrians fought beside
Hitler, many Austrians believe they fought nobly or at least
dutifully, Eichmann ran the Third Reich's racial pogroms from
Vienna and, after the war, the Allies for their own reasons led the
Austrians to think they were really victims of Hitler, and the
first ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the son of virulent Nazis, has cleverly played on these
misgivings and resentments, so evident in the election of Kurt
Waldheim as president in 1986 despite his Nazi past. Haider has
intermittently offered a view of history still comforting to some
Austrians: that the Waffen SS saved Europe from communism and that
Hitler's labor policies succeeded because they put Germans to work.
</P>
<P>
   But those who foresee a unified Europe now have zero tolerance
for such outbursts. They want to make Europe's history clear in
order to make its identity clear. The European Union wants,
henceforth, to be on the side of liberty, democracy, human rights,
the rule of law and an end to ethnic persecution. It was for these
values that it says it went to war in Kosovo. Many Europeans
cheered. But Haider, while formally embracing this prevailing
ideology as he entered government, whispers another reality, as
does France's Jean-Marie LePen: the left-leaning, bleeding-heart,
tree-hugging, globalist bureaucrats have no monopoly on historical
truth.
</P>
<P>
   In another Viennese museum, the Army Historical Museum, are
displayed the clothes the Hapsburg crown prince was wearing in
Sarajevo when he was murdered, an assassination that ignited World
War I. Europe will not return to such trenches. But the battle for
a pan-European identity, able to accommodate both Christianity and
Islam, has only just begun.

<P>
   When television sprouted up in the living rooms of postwar
America it must have seemed like a techno-wonder straight out of
science fiction. In fact, television and science-fiction appeared
to be a match made in the heavens _ an imaginative literary genre
that had already excited the masses on radio (``War of the
Worlds,'' anyone?) could now be melded with pictures to give
audiences something truly new to think about.
</P>
<P>
   But for those expecting new horizons of literate entertainment
and provocative visions of the future, sci-fi television has
largely failed to live up to its promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, series like ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Outer
Limits'' effectively mixed social messages with simple special
effects. ``Star Trek'' combined space opera with memorable scripts
and flourished in syndication. With scripts that didn't pander to
audiences, these shows managed to pull early science-fiction
television away from pulpy stories about invading bug-eyed
monsters. Part of the magic may have been the times: the rocket
launches and moon missions of the era whetted a lot of appetites
for the possibilities of what might be Out There.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, channel surfers are more likely to
encounter fiction that has swapped ``science'' for ``sex'' to
attract viewers. Take ``Lexx,'' a cable series that began its
second season last month on the Sci-Fi Channel. The main character
is Xev, a voluptuous, scantily clad woman with a hyperactive libido
who travels around the galaxy with three male characters on a giant
bug that serves as a spaceship. In one recent episode, the crew
lands on a harmonious all-male world of gay space monks and
disrupts the society so badly that the planet blows up.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month NBC will roll out ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a
miniseries that draws on standard fairy-tale archetypes (think Snow
White) in a sci-fi/fantasy setting. Then there's ``Cleopatra
2525,'' a new syndicated series about three tightly dressed women
battling aliens. Even though the half-hour show weaves a bit of
ironic humor in with exposed midriffs, there's still far more eye
candy than brain benders on screen.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly boldly going where no one has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be because the pace of scientific discovery has outrun
the human imagination. After all, 7 of the top 10 highest-grossing
films have had science-fiction themes, and new books in the genre
like Michael Crichton's recent ``Timeline,'' about century-hopping
Yalies, regularly land on best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about a golden age in retrospect, but there's been
very little intelligent science fiction on television, period,''
said Paul T. Riddell, a writer and columnist for Sci Fi magazine,
pointing to the space-ranger exploits of Captain Video and Flash
Gordon as evidence. ``Nobody takes science fiction seriously,'' he
added, noting that most network executives believe that sci-fi fans
``will watch  &UR; anything &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the budget for special effects or sets became
excessive,'' Riddell said, ``the natural tendency was to push for
that teen-age male audience, or to dumb things down to expand the
available audience at any given time.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nicholls, in the ``Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (St.
Martin's, 1993), writes that, ``the pressures toward conformity and
formula'' over the last 40 years have resulted in programming that
has ``never approached the intellectual excitement of the best
written s.f., or indeed the best s.f. in the cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   For straightforward action-oriented fare, television has
depended for years on adaptations of sci-fi literature, for series
like ``The Six Million Dollar Man'' and ``Logan's Run.'' But the
literary genre's more cerebral material doesn't seem to translate
well to the budgetary and mental constraints of the small screen.
Think about it: Could Ursula K. LeGuin's 1969 book, ``The Left Hand
of Darkness,'' about a society of hermaphrodites, possibly fly in a
medium that makes a big deal about Ally McBeal's unisex bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   Books and television are different forms of entertainment, of
course, and perhaps it is unfair to compare them too closely. ``If
a story has too much conversation or too much explanation in it,
it's not going to work for television,'' said Bonnie Hammer, the
executive vice-president and general manager of the Sci-Fi Channel.
``You have to be able to tell it through action, through the story
line and through characters. If you have to explain everything in
the dialogue, it's going to be a very slow hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harlan Ellison, an award-winning author who has written much
science-fiction, says sci-fi TV has lagged decades behind what is
happening in the literary world, ``because it is being done by the
same people who produce cop shows, doctor shows and game shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And these are people who simply do not understand any of the
aspects or elements that make science fiction what it is,'' he
continued. What makes for good science fiction? ``A big idea that
deals with the human heart in conflict with itself and the effects
of science, the future or an imaginative idea on those people that
is rigorously logical within the terms of its own story,'' said
Ellison.

   While the human heart in conflict with itself is often a ploy
television uses to attract female audiences (and their valued

putting down the laser pistols and showing its sensitive side.
There may be comfort in genre cliches, but the preponderance of
women in variations of the little silver space bikini helps keep
science-fiction TV in a state of arrested development.

   ``Sci-fi vibrates at the key intersections of modernism and
postmodernism, with the macho sci-fi writers often reverting
subconsciously to essentialized gender identities and behaviors,''
says Dr. Christine Boese, an assistant professor in English at

``it was all about men and posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boese, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on the cyber-culture
created by fans of the action-fantasy show ``Xena: Warrior
Princess,'' consumes a wide variety of science fiction and doesn't
seem to mind a few guilty pleasures. ``I like sorting through the
wacky theories and deciding for myself which part is utterly wacked
and whether a kernel of truth might be buried in the dung,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis isn't all bad. There are some ambitious shows on
the air these days, like the Sci Fi Channel's acclaimed
``Farscape,'' and shows with promise like CBS' ``Now and Again.''
Other programs that mix supernatural elements with clever dialogue
and sharp writing, like ``The X-Files'' and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' may not be pure science fiction but are entertaining
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the show is produced and written well, it's all on the page
_ whether it's a book or a script,'' said Hammer. ``If it's not on
the page and it's not smart, it's not going to be there.''

attract viewers. Take ``Lexx,'' a cable series that began its
second season last month on the Sci-Fi Channel. The main character
is Xev, a voluptuous, scantily clad woman with a hyperactive libido
who travels around the galaxy with three male characters on a giant
bug that serves as a spaceship. In one recent episode, the crew
lands on a harmonious all-male world of gay space monks and
disrupts the society so badly that the planet blows up.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month NBC will roll out ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a
miniseries that draws on standard fairy-tale archetypes (think Snow
White) in a sci-fi/fantasy setting. Then there's ``Cleopatra
2525,'' a new syndicated series about three tightly dressed women
battling aliens. Even though the half-hour show weaves a bit of
ironic humor in with exposed midriffs, there's still far more eye
candy than brain benders on screen.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly boldly going where no one has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be because the pace of scientific discovery has outrun
the human imagination. After all, 7 of the top 10 highest-grossing
films have had science-fiction themes, and new books in the genre
like Michael Crichton's recent ``Timeline,'' about century-hopping
Yalies, regularly land on best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about a golden age in retrospect, but there's been
very little intelligent science fiction on television, period,''
said Paul T. Riddell, a writer and columnist for Sci Fi magazine,
pointing to the space-ranger exploits of Captain Video and Flash
Gordon as evidence. ``Nobody takes science fiction seriously,'' he
added, noting that most network executives believe that sci-fi fans
``will watch  &UR; anything &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the budget for special effects or sets became
excessive,'' Riddell said, ``the natural tendency was to push for
that teen-age male audience, or to dumb things down to expand the
available audience at any given time.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nicholls, in the ``Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (St.
Martin's, 1993), writes that, ``the pressures toward conformity and
formula'' over the last 40 years have resulted in programming that
has ``never approached the intellectual excitement of the best
written s.f., or indeed the best s.f. in the cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   For straightforward action-oriented fare, television has
depended for years on adaptations of sci-fi literature, for series
like ``The Six Million Dollar Man'' and ``Logan's Run.'' But the
literary genre's more cerebral material doesn't seem to translate
well to the budgetary and mental constraints of the small screen.
Think about it: Could Ursula K. LeGuin's 1969 book, ``The Left Hand
of Darkness,'' about a society of hermaphrodites, possibly fly in a
medium that makes a big deal about Ally McBeal's unisex bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   Books and television are different forms of entertainment, of
course, and perhaps it is unfair to compare them too closely. ``If
a story has too much conversation or too much explanation in it,
it's not going to work for television,'' said Bonnie Hammer, the
executive vice-president and general manager of the Sci-Fi Channel.
``You have to be able to tell it through action, through the story
line and through characters. If you have to explain everything in
the dialogue, it's going to be a very slow hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harlan Ellison, an award-winning author who has written much
science-fiction, says sci-fi TV has lagged decades behind what is
happening in the literary world, ``because it is being done by the
same people who produce cop shows, doctor shows and game shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And these are people who simply do not understand any of the
aspects or elements that make science fiction what it is,'' he
continued. What makes for good science fiction? ``A big idea that
deals with the human heart in conflict with itself and the effects
of science, the future or an imaginative idea on those people that
is rigorously logical within the terms of its own story,'' said
Ellison.

<P>
   When television sprouted up in the living rooms of postwar
America it must have seemed like a techno-wonder straight out of
science fiction. In fact, television and science-fiction appeared
to be a match made in the heavens _ an imaginative literary genre
that had already excited the masses on radio (``War of the
Worlds,'' anyone?) could now be melded with pictures to give
audiences something truly new to think about.
</P>
<P>
   But for those expecting new horizons of literate entertainment
and provocative visions of the future, sci-fi television has
largely failed to live up to its promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, series like ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Outer
Limits'' effectively mixed social messages with simple special
effects. ``Star Trek'' combined space opera with memorable scripts
and flourished in syndication. With scripts that didn't pander to
audiences, these shows managed to pull early science-fiction
television away from pulpy stories about invading bug-eyed
monsters. Part of the magic may have been the times: the rocket
launches and moon missions of the era whetted a lot of appetites
for the possibilities of what might be Out There.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, channel surfers are more likely to
encounter fiction that has swapped ``science'' for ``sex'' to
attract viewers. Take ``Lexx,'' a cable series that began its
second season last month on the Sci-Fi Channel. The main character
is Xev, a voluptuous, scantily clad woman with a hyperactive libido
who travels around the galaxy with three male characters on a giant
bug that serves as a spaceship. In one recent episode, the crew

<P>
   While the human heart in conflict with itself is often a ploy
television uses to attract female audiences (and their valued
advertising dollars), sci-fi on the tube has had some trouble
putting down the laser pistols and showing its sensitive side.
There may be comfort in genre cliches, but the preponderance of
women in variations of the little silver space bikini helps keep
science-fiction TV in a state of arrested development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sci-fi vibrates at the key intersections of modernism and
postmodernism, with the macho sci-fi writers often reverting
subconsciously to essentialized gender identities and behaviors,''
says Dr. Christine Boese, an assistant professor in English at
Clemson University, who disliked the original ``Star Trek'' because
``it was all about men and posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boese, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on the cyber-culture
created by fans of the action-fantasy show ``Xena: Warrior
Princess,'' consumes a wide variety of science fiction and doesn't
seem to mind a few guilty pleasures. ``I like sorting through the
wacky theories and deciding for myself which part is utterly wacked
and whether a kernel of truth might be buried in the dung,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis isn't all bad. There are some ambitious shows on
the air these days, like the Sci Fi Channel's acclaimed
``Farscape,'' and shows with promise like CBS' ``Now and Again.''
Other programs that mix supernatural elements with clever dialogue
and sharp writing, like ``The X-Files'' and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' may not be pure science fiction but are entertaining
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the show is produced and written well, it's all on the page
_ whether it's a book or a script,'' said Hammer. ``If it's not on
the page and it's not smart, it's not going to be there.''

   CAMPAIGN-PRIMARIES-REVIEW (Washington) _ After months in the
small states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the presidential campaign
turns national with an eye to March 7, a single day of voting so
big that candidates are calling it Titanic Tuesday. On this day,
more voters may have more influence over who is nominated than in
years. More than one-third of eligible voters will get to
participate. The compressed calendar resembles a European election:
a short but intense primary season where, candidates hope, voters
pay close attention. March 7 will be the closest thing America has
to a national primary. By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in the `a' and
`p' categories)
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-EUROPE-REVIEW (Vienna) _ In the European psyche, Vienna
is dense with symbolism. Behind the waltzes-as-muzak and the cozy
cafes lies a darker reality on which Joerg Haider has played. That
reality includes Christian Vienna's long rearguard action against
the Turkish ``infidel,'' enthusiastic Austrian support for Hitler,
and the historical distortion that long portrayed Austria as the
first victim of Nazi aggression. All of this makes Europe uneasy.

carved his initials into the flesh of an anesthetized patient
raises the question of assault vs. malpractice. The incident is one
of a range of medical violations, including sexual harassment of
patients, that experts say fall into a gray area between negligent
malpractice and criminality. By Edward Wong.

   GENETIC-FOOD-REVIEW (Undated) _ The paradox of genetically
engineered foods: science has reached what might be the takeoff
stage for a new green revolution. But it may go the way instead of
nuclear power _ a once promising technology largely rejected by
society. While its potential benefits are huge, genetic engineering
seems to conjure up images of mad scientists playing God and has

of the political establishments in both Washington and Havana. It
has come to mirror all the bitter political divisions and
dysfunction of the last four decades in the last, and seemingly
bitterest, confrontation of the Cold War, the only one that has not
yet thawed. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-PRESS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ A politician recently denounced
several magazines for running sex photos while conceding that the
magazines perform a useful service in their innovative
investigative reporting on serious issues. The backhanded
compliment to the magazines was a stinging indictment of Japan's
huge daily press. Virtually alone among advanced industrialized
democracies, Japan combines a lack of aggressive,
independent-spirited daily newspapers with a lack of commercially
successful news-oriented weekly newsmagazines. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-INTELLIGENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent CIA statements on
Russia, Iraq and Iran, worrisome enough by themselves, have led
experts to a larger and still more troubling concern that U.S.
intelligence services may be incapable of monitoring the

technology. By Judith Miller.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of SUNDAY, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-WARS (Kinshasa, Congo) _ Congo and the nine nations around
it sit on what may be the richest patch of this planet: There are
diamonds, oil, uranium, gold, plentiful water, fertile land and
exquisite wildlife. It is now also one of the biggest battlefields
in Africa's history, the object of a conflict that has been dubbed
``Africa's first world war.'' Six outside states are fighting
inside Congo alone, with at least 35,000 soldiers, men and boys,
battling for a bewildering number of reasons. By Ian Fisher and
Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-KABILA (Kinshasa, Congo) _ After languishing for three
decades in the mountains of eastern Congo, a little-known rebel was
picked by the Rwandans to lead the overthrow of the 32-year
dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. So Laurent D. Kabila
suddenly found himself president of a country a third of the size
of the United States. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-AID (Washington) _ The Clinton administration's $1.3
billion plan to help Colombia fight drug trafficking and leftist
insurgents is facing skepticism. By Tim Golden.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-PARABLE (Tehran, Iran) _ In the blood bath that followed
the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, in 1979, Hossain
Khorram's father, an immensely rich contractor who sometimes used
his 2,000-man work force as a political shock force in support of
the shah, was executed by firing squad. Khorram's story is one of
Shakespearean proportions, of how Iran's once-powerful fell from
grace and the once-powerless rose to supplant them. But it seems,
just as much, a warning for the mullahs, who face a popular
challenge now that in many ways is as serious as the one that
toppled the shah. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-ELECTRICITY (New Delhi, India) _ Throughout India,
billions of dollars worth of electricity is stolen each year,
according to the nation's ministry of power. At the same time,
people are routinely left in darkness and factories are frequently
idle during rampant power failures. Only recently have high-ranking
government officials openly talked about them and begun seriously
trying to reverse the dim reality. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-U.S. (Washington) _ President Clinton's top foreign
policy adviser said Washington's decision this week to impose
diplomatic sanctions against Austria was driven partly by a desire
to send a message across the Atlantic that the United States will
not stand by idly if other anti-immigrant, far-right parties try to
join other coalition governments in Europe. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-UNREST (Berlin) _ Clashes overnight between police and
demonstrators left more than 50 people injured in Vienna Saturday
after a coalition government including members of the
anti-immigration Freedom Party was sworn in. The riots, unusual in
a habitually sedate city, reflected the intense feelings stirred by
the arrival in power of the party that Joerg Haider has steered
from a fringe group to a serious political force over the past 15
years. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   CROATIA-REFORM (Zagreb, Croatia) _ The new Croatian government
is trying to move quickly to live up to its promises of social
equality and justice, with plans to cut officials' salaries by up
to 40 percent. But the new prime minister, Ivica Racan, says the
economic situation is worse than he imagined after nine years of
rule by a single party, the Croatian Democratic Union of the late
president, Franjo Tudjman. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-UNREST (Mitrovica, Yugoslavia) _ Peacekeepers clashed
with Kosovo Albanians for a second day Saturday in this town,
firing percussion grenades and tear gas to push back angry crowds
from the bridge that divides the city. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   EGYPTAIR-ASYLUM (Cairo, Egypt) _ An EgyptAir pilot claiming to
have information about the crash of the airline's Flight 990 last
year has requested asylum in Britain, EgyptAir officials said
Saturday. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-ATROCITIES (Moscow) _ Russia's seizure of Grozny did
not bring much security for Hedi, a 40-year-old resident from the
battered Chechen capital. When she and two other women returned to
the city to check on their homes, they stumbled across a group of
Russian soldiers who were looting their devastated neighborhood and
were blindfolded and shot. After interviewing refugees from Grozny,
the international human rights group Human Rights Watch said
Saturday that it has documented 22 cases in which Grozny residents
were killed by occupying Russian troops and were investigating at
least 14 more. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-HIRING (Daly City, Calif.) _ Dozens of big-name
retailers, including Target, Hollywood Video, Macy's and Longs Drug
Stores, are replacing paper applications and in-person interviews
with computer kiosks in the initial screening of job applicants. By
Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   PLANE-CRASH-PATTERNS (Port Hueneme, Calif.) _ The mechanical
problem that led to the crash of the Alaska Airlines jet here
Monday night was unusual to the point of being unprecedented. But
that is the problem with many high-profile crashes lately. The
pattern of recent accidents is that there is no pattern. By Matthew
L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   MORMON-CONFERENCE-CENTER (Salt Lake City) _ There was a time
when the Mormon Church counted barely 81,000 members, a pioneer
population largely confined to territorial Utah, whose remoteness
was as yet unbroken by the transcontinental railroad. But in two
months, in a historically resonant move, the church will open a
vast new Conference Center. The new building's great size and
technological sophistication offer symbolic testimony to how far
Mormonism has come from being a frontier faith to a global
religion. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   VT-GAY-MARRIAGE (Montpelier, Vt.) _ Imagine, nearly four hours
of State House testimony late into the night and not a moment of
tedium, not a single slide into the low-level murmur that means the
chamber's attention has drifted. Such is the experience of watching
the mass public hearings that the Vermont Legislature has held
twice in the last two weeks on how it should respond to the state
Supreme Court's ruling that gay couples must be granted the same
rights and benefits as other spouses. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   NC-STOLEN-PAINTING (Raleigh, N.C.) _ After confirming that one
of its most prized paintings had been stolen by the Nazis during
World War II from an Austrian Jewish art collector, the North
Carolina Museum of Art announced plans this week to give the
painting back to its rightful owners, two sisters in Austria. By
Emily Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   WORK-COLLEGE (Asheville, N.C.) _ Over the last decade, the
emphasis on community service has grown exponentially on college
campuses across the country. But few have taken the step of Warren
Wilson College, which requires work for all. Unlike other colleges,
where students on financial aid work in the cafeteria and library,
Warren Wilson also has students doubling as the campus garbage
collectors, plumbers, electricians, custodians, security officers,
mechanics and landscapers. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ It was just about this time three
years ago that John Weaver, a tall, terse Texan, dragged Sen. John
McCain from a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to tell him he
should run for president. Weaver, a Republican political consultant
from San Antonio, had decided that McCain had just the right resume
for the post-Clinton years. The idea, which had crossed the
senator's mind before, germinated into something neither man
expected: a seat-of-the pants populist candidacy that has turned
the Republican Party establishment on its head and is now
threatening its chosen candidate, Gov. George Bush of Texas. By
Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MRSCLINTON (New York) _ An exclusive interview with Hillary
Rodham Clinton. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES (Undated) _ For Steve Forbes, who promotes his business
acumen on the campaign trail, the calculation is a tough one.
Already, Forbes has spent $28.7 million of his own money on his
presidential effort. And all that this money has garnered is 55,880
votes _ with half from a race that was only symbolic. Even with so
much money spent for so few votes, Forbes said he would press on
with his campaign at least until the March 7 Super Tuesday
primaries. Only after that, said William Dal Col, Forbes' campaign
manager, ``will we begin to review'' whether to stay in the race.

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Peacekeepers clashed with Kosovo
Albanians for a second day Saturday in this town, firing percussion
grenades and tear gas to push back angry crowds from the bridge
that divides the city.
</P>
<P>
   Two Albanians and eight soldiers were reported wounded in the
clash as Albanian youths threw bottles and stones at troops
guarding the bridge. Police in riot gear with helmets and shields
reacted forcefully, advancing in formation, backed up by four Dutch
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Youths ran stumbling through the thick white smoke to get away.
At the height of the clash at 3 p.m., grenades exploded in rapid
succession, rattling nearby windows.
</P>
<P>
   At least two people, apparently wounded, were carried off by
friends. A local commander of the peacekeepers appealed for the
Albanians to end the protest. ``Please go away. This has been too
much already,'' he said, adding that eight peacekeepers had been
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The clash came after news of more Albanian casualties from
Thursday's night of violence on the northern, Serbian-dominated
side of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Albanians died as a result, U.N. officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One 46-year-old Albanian woman died in the hospital from her
wounds. Another Albanian woman was found by the U.N. police
Saturday morning, dead in her house, apparently as a result of the
Thursday night violence.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included an elderly couple, killed by gunshot wounds,
two women who were also shot dead, and three who died from grenade
attacks, one of them a 16-year-old youth. Six more are in the
hospital, two described as in serious condition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday night passed without incident, with the city under strict
curfew, said Mario Morcone, the U.N. administrator of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies of German troops had been brought up from the
south of Kosovo and positioned in the north side of the city to
keep the peace, Morcone said. Belgian and Dutch troops had already
been brought into the city from their positions in the north of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 250 U.N. police officers are also stationed
in the area, and are still evacuating Albanians from the north
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good working relationship now'' between the
peacekeepers and the U.N. police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morcone watched the crowds fleeing from the tear gas from his
office window just above the bridge and expressed frustration that
months of hard work trying to bring the two communities together
had exploded in one night. He blamed extremists on both sides for
causing the trouble, which began, he said, with the rocket attack
Wednesday on a U.N. bus carrying Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know if it is a problem of ethnicity,'' he said.
``There are a few people from each community who do not want to
find an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The police were pursuing their investigation but had not yet
arrested anyone for the violence committed Thursday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say the Albanians want to push them out and cleanse
all of Kosovo of Serbs, he explained. The Albanians in the south
say the Serbs want to force out all of the Albanians left on the
north side, intimidating them and breaking into their apartments,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way is to marginalize the extremists,'' he said. ``We
must ensure the security of the Albanians in the north and of the
Serbs in their enclaves, but at the same time we must do work on
the political side,'' he said.

EAST GERMAN SWIMMERS SEEK TO PROVE DAMAGES FROM STATE'S STEROIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In 1972, a committee from the swimming federation in
the East German town of Halberstadt went to the local primary
school looking for children who wanted to take part in a swimming
program. Six-year-old Martina Fehrecke loved to play in the water,
so she raised her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as she recounts her experiences with the East German
national swimming program, Fehrecke Gottschalt says she wishes she
had sat still that day in school.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out, she grew up too fast and still carries the
bitter reminders of being one of the victims of a systematic East
German doping program that claimed dozens of casualties through the
unknowing wholesale use of anabolic steroids. Scores of swimmers,
most of whom never saw Olympic competition, have major medical
problems. Some, like Gottschalt, have children with birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Lothar Kipke, head doctor of the East German Swimming
Federation, who oversaw the drug program from 1975 to 1985, was
convicted last month on charges of doping and causing bodily harm
to 58 swimmers in the latest of a series of highly publicized court
cases. And in May, two other former high-ranking East German sports
officials will go on trial for their roles in doping in the
country's overall sports system.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in Kipke's case did not result in compensation for
swimmers who gave birth to handicapped children, but Dr. Werner
Franke, a German molecular biologist whose research on the subject
was the impetus for the first criminal inquiry into doping two
years ago, believes there is a link.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the taking of male hormones led to
gynecological changes,'' Franke said. ``One of the changes could
have been a shrinking of the uterus, which would have affected the
fetus. The fact that many of the birth defects are in first-born
children is significant. The longer these women were away from the
steroids, the longer their bodies had a chance to start producing
female hormones again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 trial, in which four East German coaches and two
doctors were accused of seriously injuring female athletes, 19
testified that their bodies took signs of masculinity _ deeper
voices or facial and body hair.
</P>
<P>
   According to secret files recovered from the Stasi, East
Germany's secret police, some women were ordered to abort fetuses
that might have been deformed by the drugs. Petra Kind-Schneider, a
gold-medal swimmer in the 1980 Olympics, now has liver and heart
problems. Rica Reinisch, another gold-medal swimmer, has said
publicly that she was given steroids at age 12 without knowing what
they were, and she now suffers from ovarian cysts.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems as well for these swimmers, who are now
in their 30s, said Giselher Spitzer, a sports psychologist at the
University of Potsdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychological implications of being doped are immense,''
the psychologist said. ``These women live with the fact that their
successes were a result of having cheated. Their identities are
still very much connected with swimming, and they now fear that
they are not able to accomplish anything on their own. Added to
that is the fact that these drugs were administered along with
birth control pills. That can have unbelievable psychological
consequences. Most disturbing is that these problems may not fully
manifest themselves until these women are well into middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 10, Gottschalt had so impressed local coaches that she
was invited to attend a boarding school for promising young
swimmers in Magdeburg, the state capital. ``I was a little kid off
to the big city,'' she said recently from her living room in
Halberstadt. ``They gave me a brand new bathing suit. It was all so
exciting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fun stopped the moment Gottschalt stepped off the train in
Magdeburg. Her new school made swimming her life, requiring nine
hours of training a day. By evening, she was exhausted and in
tears, she said, because of constant verbal abuse by coaches. Even
a nose broken in practice one day could not elicit sympathy or a
short break.
</P>
<P>
   She excelled, nonetheless, improving her performances until she
was at the top of her age group. The new routine had its benefits,
like being served bananas _ a rarity at the time in East Germany _
in the school cafeteria. But she also had to take 40 pills a day,
including little blue ones taken under strict supervision. Along
with the pills came orders to keep that fact secret from her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other girls got them, too,'' Gottschalt said. ``The doctors
told us they were vitamins, and we believed them. When you're 12
years old, you don't ask any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure to be the best began to take its toll. One
afternoon, she confessed to the school director that she was having
doubts about continuing with the program. The director calmly
explained that giving up swimming could have negative consequences
for her parents, both of whom worked at her former school in
Halberstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were summoned to the school for an emergency meeting
the next day. She never found out what threats were made, she said;
she only knows that her father said she would have to continue
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she won national championships for 13-year-olds in the
100- and 200-meter backstroke. Her times, 1 minute 8.41 seconds in
the 100 and 2:27.79 in the 200, were outstanding for her age and in
the top 20 among all East German female swimmers. More incredibly,
she beat her best previous time in the 200 by a full three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then I should have known something was wrong,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The files of the Stasi included a report from 1975 by Hans
Schuster, head of the Research Institute for Fitness in Sport in
Leipzig. Schuster wrote that anabolic steroids were prescribed in
both combination and pure form and that they led to a
``considerable improvement in performance.'' He added that the
drugs resulted in ``liver damage and changes in physical
appearance'' when taken by girls and young women.
</P>
<P>
   With women's swimming a government priority, an East German
swimming team that did not win a single gold medal at the 1972
Munich Olympics captured 11 gold medals four years later in
Montreal. Gottschalt, although a long shot, represented one of the
hopes for the Moscow Games in 1980 or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pills, injections, teas,'' Gottschalt said. ``I was always
getting something. They must have been experimenting with new ways
to administer the drugs at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottschalt never made it to Moscow for the 1980 Olympics. As a
junior champion, she was invited to take part in national
qualifications, but she did not improve on her times from the
previous year. The stress and the drugs were too much for her
physically and emotionally, she said. The federation promoted other
young swimmers, including Kristin Otto, whom Gottschalt had beaten
at the 1979 age-group meet. Otto went on to win six gold medals at
the Seoul Olympics in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expendable,'' Gottschalt said. ``We all were. They bred
us to be winners, and there was always someone to take your
place.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Gottschalt recalled that in 1981, when she was 15, she left the
swimming school and returned home to hear friends and family remark
about how the little girl had developed into a muscle-bound woman
with a deep voice. Other problems ensued: liver ailments, a
hardening of back muscles. In 1984 she gave birth to a son with a
clubfoot. Gottschalt believes her baby's deformity was a result of
her being given drugs. As years passed and her anger grew, she
wondered exactly what the little blue pills had contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anyone cared enough about what happened to me
to take any interest,'' she said. ``I gave up thinking anything
might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope was restored last year when Gottschalt received a call from
Michael Lehner, a German lawyer who specializes in doping-related
lawsuits. Lehner brought the criminal case against Kipke, and with
the public prosecutor helped try it. Lehner represented Gottschalt
in this trial, along with eight other female swimmers who, he said,
also had children with birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Having read files kept by the swimming federation, Lehner
learned that Gottschalt was a member of the B group of swimmers,
young hopefuls who, according to the Stasi files, were to receive
``supporting means'' to improve their performance. ``Supporting
means'' was code for the drug Oral-Turinabol, an anabolic steroid
manufactured in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner embarked on a search for other former swimmers who had
also been administered the little blue pills and who would be
willing to testify. Court cases involving doping to that point had
involved only swimmers from programs in the former East Berlin.
Lehner widened the scope and found former members of teams in
Magdeburg, Erfurt, Potsdam, Chemnitz, Halle, Rostock, Leipzig and
Dresden who had been similarly doped.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner spoke to Ute Krause, also a product of the Magdeburg
program, and found that her experiences were nearly identical to
Gottschalt's. After Krause left the swimming school in 1981, her
voice was deeper, she had liver problems and she battled
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as the administrator of a nursing home in
Magdeburg, Krause learned more about Oral-Turinabol. Certain
patients were being prescribed the drug to help regain muscle loss
because of illness. In a medical textbook, she read of the link
between anabolic steroids and chronic depression. She made no
additional efforts to find out more about what had happened to her
until Lehner called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppressed what happened to me for so long,'' Krause said
recently in Magdeburg. ``I am still searching for my biography.''
</P>
<P>
   In early January, Gottschalt, 34, Krause, 37, and three other
former East German swimmers were present in a Berlin courtroom for
the trial of Lothar Kipke.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony, Kipke admitted that he had distributed
anabolic steroids to the swimmers but contended that he was unaware
that the drugs carried any adverse side effects other than a
deepening of the voice. According to Kipke, as research increased
in the 1980s, he began administering the steroids in lower dosages
and only in pill form.
</P>
<P>
   Ten feet from Kipke, Gottschalt listened to the doctor
rationalize his actions. When she heard his lawyer explain that
Kipke had only been following orders, Gottschalt exclaimed, ``Say
that to my son's face!'' Daniel, her 14-year-old disabled son, sat
beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Krause seized the chance to address Kipke directly near the end
of the trial. ``He avoided making a direct apology,'' Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner called Kipke a ``monster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives a doctor that right to treat young girls like
guinea pigs?'' Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the one-day trial, Judge Peter Faust ruled that
Kipke had acted with ``willful malevolence'' in overseeing doping
of the swimmers during his tenure as head doctor. Faust gave Kipke
a 15-month suspended jail sentence, the most severe doping-related
punishment meted out to a former East German official.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict provided little solace for Gottschalt, who had hoped
that the link between doping and birth defects would be addressed
at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Faust declined Lehner's motion that the women whose children had
birth defects receive financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to pursue this further,'' Lehner said. ``I am
representing nine clients who gave birth to children with birth
defects.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Berlin program, Barbara Krause, who won a gold
medal on the East German freestyle relay team in the 1980 Olympics,
has given birth to two children with clubfeet, according to Lehner.
She has been unwilling to testify at the doping trials, however,
because of her marriage to Lutz Wanja, a former swimming coach in
Potsdam. Since the Kipke trial, Lehner has learned that a former
swimmer in Leipzig has a 19-year-old daughter with a clubfoot.
</P>
<P>
   In the next trial, for which no date has been set, Lehner plans
to refer again to evidence yielded by the Stasi files, which show
that East German doctors ordered female athletes to take birth
control or have abortions because they feared Oral-Turinabol could
damage fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Kipke, 72, is the 26th East German sports official to be
convicted on charges of doping. They were involved in swimming as
well as other sports.
</P>
<P>
   In May, several months before the statute of limitations runs
out on the prosecution of middle-level East German criminals,
Manfred Ewald and Manfred Hoeppner will have their day in court.
Hoeppner, head doctor of the East German sports medicine service,
oversaw an unofficial group that the prosecution contends was the
committee for all doping programs. Ewald, former president of the
East German Athletics Association, wrote a book chronicling his
control over East German sports.
</P>
<P>
   Gottschalt said she would be in the courtroom once again. And to
current swimmers caught up in the latest controversy over the use
of dietary supplements like creatine to improve performance,
Gottschalt offers her own sobering advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just leave it,'' she said. ``It's not worth it. Let your body
perform on its own.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ Congo and the nine nations around it sit on
what may be the richest patch of this planet: There are diamonds,
oil, uranium, gold, plentiful water, fertile land and exquisite
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   It is now also one of the biggest battlefields in Africa's
history, the object of a conflict that has been dubbed ``Africa's
first world war.''
</P>
<P>
   Six outside states are fighting inside Congo alone, with at
least 35,000 soldiers, men and boys, battling for a bewildering
number of reasons. Some armies are allied with rebel groups to oust
President Laurent Kabila of Congo. Others are protecting him. Nine
rebel groups in Congo are fighting to overthrow governments in
neighboring countries. Nearly everyone carts off Congo's riches.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicts are a series of related wars, fueled by ethnic
conflict, by a scramble for power and riches among people with very
little of either, and by leaders with little notion of
responsibility for those people. Rooted in the Rwandan genocide of
1994, the fighting has smoldered inconclusively for 18 months;
during this time rebels and invading armies have expanded their
reach to half of Congo's vast expanse, but the war remains largely
a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kabila nor the rebels have strong support in the
population. The foreign armies on both sides have been reluctant to
commit their men to all-out battles that could explode into even
greater warfare, perhaps beyond Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, into this chaos, the United Nations is considering the
deployment of the oddly precise number of 5,537 troops to monitor a
cease-fire signed last summer, but violated with impunity by all
sides ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, seven African presidents met at the United
Nations for a special Security Council session, convened by Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative, in an attempt to make the
cease-fire stick. They did little beyond reasserting the goals of
the agreement, and continuing negotiations at a lower level hold
out only minimal hope.
</P>
<P>
   The worries are clear, the solutions elusive. Experts say Africa
has not been so consumed by conflict since colonial days. Tens of
thousands have died. Hundreds of thousands have been uprooted from
their homes. Elephants and gorillas are poached for food.
Economies, already as diseased and undernourished as their people,
are dying.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts argue that the force contemplated by the United
Nations is far too small, considering the sheer size and terrain of
Congo _ a decomposed nation of thick jungle, poor communications
and ghost tracks that once were roads. But for some of the nations
that would pay for this peacekeeping force _ the United States
first among them _ any number of soldiers is too many unless the
warring nations and factions in Congo show they are serious about
peace. The peacekeepers, they argue, would simply not be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Practically, the proposed deployment would likely mean
battalions of soldiers placed in three strategic spots around an
area roughly as big as western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally inadequate,'' said Jakkie Potgieter, senior
researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies in South Africa.
After all, this is a conflict of unprecedented scale in Africa. On
the eastern borders, two nations that had helped to install Kabila
only three years ago, Rwanda and Uganda, are now fighting just as
fiercely to overthrow him. They are allied with three Congolese
rebel groups, which have also skirmished with one another.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia saved Kabila
from almost certain defeat when the war started in August 1998, and
Kabila has also allied himself with tens of thousands of Hutu
militiamen responsible for the Rwandan genocide, as well as with
indigenous warriors known as the Mayi-Mayi, who believe that water
has magical qualities that protect them from bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The motives are as tangled as the conflicts. For those arrayed
against Kabila, the keystone is the devastating Hutu-Tutsi rivalry
that has kept Rwanda and Burundi in convulsions for years. The
Tutsi-led government of Rwanda is there to curb the Hutu militia;
Uganda joined in the fray to support Rwanda and to curb its own
rebels based in Congo. Burundi has also sent forces into Congo to
fight Hutu rebels of its own.
</P>
<P>
   From the south, Angola needs Kabila to fight its own UNITA
rebels, based in southern Congo. Namibia is there to help Angola.
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, has come to Kabila's support
out of personal ambition to be a force in the region, and because
his generals are growing rich exploiting Congolese resources of
timber, gold, diamonds and metals.
</P>
<P>
   The participation of these nations, in turn, has sent shock
waves further afield, in the form of fleeing refugees or
opportunistic rebellions, to Zambia, Burundi, Tanzania, Sudan. What
further confuses matters is the rivalry for regional authority
between Mugabe and Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni _ and, on
all sides, the lure of Congo's riches.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises the question: Is now a time for a return of
pessimism about Africa? Will its unending problems merely give rich
nations yet another excuse to write off Africa, already largely
forgotten without the Cold War to keep the continent strategically
relevant?
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, President Clinton traveled here proclaiming
a ``renaissance'' of vital new leaders, vibrant economies and great
hopes. And optimists say there is still plenty of good: South
Africa and many southern nations are thriving, and Nigeria, where
one in six Africans lives, returned to democracy last May after
nearly 16 years of military rule. In 1975, only three heads of
state were chosen through elections. Last year, 32 of 54 leaders
were elected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of the leaders singled out as models by Clinton are
at war. Fighting burns in an unbroken line from the south Atlantic
to the Red Sea: Angola, Namibia, Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi,
Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea (not to mention a military coup
in Ivory Coast, a West African nation that was once the model of
stability).
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, yes, it's a very depressing time right now,''
said Adotei Akwei, a Ghanaian who is the African advocacy director
for Amnesty International, which monitors human rights abuses
around the continent. ``The optimism we get comes from the progress
that doesn't attract too much attention,'' he said, like increasing
efforts by women and other civilian groups to bring peace and order
to the region.

</P>
<P>
   It is virtually impossible for outsiders to witness the fighting
around Central Africa, often because it takes place far inside
jungles so dense that U.N. logisticians have debated whether
peacekeepers should bother to carry binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   It is a war both modern and primitive, fought with helicopter
gunships and aerial bombings, but more often by bands of men armed
with rifles and machetes darting in and out of forest that has
become as inaccessible as when King Leopold II of Belgium first
commissioned Henry Stanley to explore it in 1878.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the toll; the estimate most often cited is 100,000
combatants, refugees and civilians killed since fighting in Congo
flared in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But it is easy enough to assemble a collage of the devastation.
Recently a newspaper in Kinshasa carried a front-page photograph of
a decapitated corpse from fighting in eastern Congo. Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented
scores of cases of civilians being killed by combatants, for food
or money, or because they were merely in the way.
</P>
<P>
   At the main hospital in Kinshasa, the largest in Congo, an
injured soldier, Sipriant Ndaki, 27, hobbled from his bed to the
street, to beg for food. He managed to come up with a quarter of a
corncob, which he clutched in his hand as he described how he was
shot in the left leg in a battle in Boende in December.
</P>
<P>
   He said his battalion of 300 men was attacked by Ugandan
soldiers. Many died, some drowning when they tried to flee in the
river. ``I am prepared to die so that the people can be saved,'' he
insisted. Still, he said he was lying in a bed with no sheets or
mattress and had not been treated properly. He lifted up his pant
leg showing open sores that still bled every day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fabulous potential wealth, Congo itself was nearly
bled dry by the time this latest war broke out in August 1998.
Three decades of pillage by Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator who was
propped up by the country's riches and the Cold War patronage of
the United States, had ravaged the land that Mobutu had renamed
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three years after Mobutu was overthrown by Kabila _
with widespread hopes among locals, Congo's neighbors and more
distant foreign powers _ life here remains surreally broken down.
</P>
<P>
   What state hospitals there are must survive on their own. Only a
handful of private airlines connect the vast expanse; phones are
scarce in Kinshasa and nonexistent in many parts of the country;
the roads are terrible.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Kinshasa _ the Congo's capital and
westernmost major city, which has grown to 6 million people from
only 400,000 at independence from Belgium in 1960 _ one in 10
children and mothers are malnourished. Rituals as basic as family
meals have broken down, as the prices of certain staples like yams
have tripled since November.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world shares much of the blame for the plight of
Congo and its neighbors: European colonists divided the continent
up into nations that rarely bore a relation to geographic or ethnic
boundaries. During the Cold War, the superpowers picked their
proxies, overlooking corruption and abuse of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at a minimum, the West is often accused of lacking the
imagination to find solutions in Africa. At worst, the United
States in particular is accused of keeping the Congo war going by
failing to strongly condemn its allies, Rwanda and Uganda, who
entered Congo in August 1998, hiding behind rebel forces that they
financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since President Kabila came to power, we have received no
assistance from the United States, while Rwanda and Uganda have
continued to receive aid,'' said Uba Thassinda, the Congo vice
president for international cooperation. ``How can the United
States keep helping those countries?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have privately urged Rwanda and Uganda
to pull out of Congo, but the leaders of the two countries rank
among Washington's closest allies in Africa. Other factors have
motivated the Clinton administration: Rwanda, because Clinton has
acknowledged that the United States did not do enough to stop the
genocide; Uganda, because it stands as one of the bulwarks against
Sudan, whose Islamic extremist government has harbored
anti-American terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the wars rage on. In Kinshasa, the government
has erected billboards in recent months seemingly preparing the
Congolese for a long war: ``Peace has a price. Be prepared for any
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue that the war in Congo is actually three wars:
</P>
<P>
   The first is the battle between Kabila and the Congolese rebels
fighting to overthrow him. The second war is an ethnic war in the
eastern provinces of Congo, primarily against ethnic Congolese
Tutsi. The third war _ really a series of conflicts _ involves all
the outside countries: Rwanda and Uganda on the side of the rebels;
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on the side of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Following, country by country, is a look at these wars:
</P>
<P>
   Congo
</P>
<P>
   After pursuing a somewhat quixotic rebellion against Mobutu for
decades from eastern Congo (then Zaire), Kabila came to power in
1997, largely through the patronage of Rwanda and Uganda, which
needed someone Congolese to head an anti-Mobutu movement.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, Kabila was joined in the Kinshasa government by
many advisers from Rwanda. Their presence angered the Congolese,
and Kabila cut his ties with the Rwandans. They started a new war,
now against Kabila, in August 1998. Rebels now occupy about half of
Congo, roughly the east and northeast. What that usually means is
that they nominally hold pivotal towns, airstrips and roads, but
remain highly unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila inherited an army of about 70,000 when he seized power.
He has been joined by several thousand soldiers from the southern
province of Katanga, and the government has begun a major
recruitment drive. Although Kabila's own army has improved in the
last year, his forces remain poorly trained, and poorly paid. Many
are simply boys.
</P>
<P>
   But in many areas nominally under Kabila's control, it is Angola
and Zimbabwe that are the real power.
</P>
<P>
   Although Western diplomats generally acknowledge that Rwanda and
Uganda have invaded Congo, almost no one has publicly supported the
Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
   First, Kabila himself came to power in what could be described
as Rwanda and Uganda's first invasion of Congo in 1997; after that
war, he allowed his Rwanda-Tutsi allies to seek out and sometimes
slaughter Hutu responsible for the Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Kabila's government, after promising reforms, openness
and elections, has turned into a repressive regime that has
tolerated little or no political opposition, jailed journalists and
failed to respect basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Kabila, in his struggle to survive, has made dubious
alliances, most notably with the genocidal Hutu, who were largely
responsible for the Rwandan genocide and who have taken refuge in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Kabila signed the Lusaka accord, calling for a
cease-fire and peace talks, but his commitment has been in doubt.
Still, he is under increasing pressure to negotiate. Of his allies,
Angola has reduced its participation in the war, and Zimbabwe's
efforts are proving increasingly costly for the government of
President Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Congo is occupied by three rebel groups. With
some exceptions, the rebels hold all areas of northern and eastern
Congo bordering the Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda,
Rwanda, Burundi and most of Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the peace accord last summer, fighting has been intense
in several areas _ in the northwest corner of Congo around Gemena
and south across the Congo River, southwest of Kisangani, and in
the North and South Kivu provinces in the far east of Congo.
Mbuji-Mayi, the major diamond mining town, is held by the
government but surrounded on the north and east by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Since late in 1999, the rebel groups have tried to work
together, with limited success. The major groups are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Movement for the Liberation of Congo, headed by
Jean-Pierre Bemba, a cell-phone entrepreneur and son of an
influential Congolese businessman. Bemba is backed by Uganda, whose
soldiers occupy all the territory he holds. The group is believed
to have fewer than 10,000 guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma, the main branch of a
rebel group that later split into two. Based in Goma, it is headed
by a medical doctor, Emile Ilunga. This group has a fighting force
estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 men, headed by many disaffected
Congolese officers, many of them Congolese Tutsi. It is backed by
Rwanda, which has many thousands of troops in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement, headed
by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, a university professor once jailed by
Mobutu who was kicked out as president of the main movement last
summer. Its soldiers number fewer than 3,500. Ugandan troops occupy
most of the territory the movement vaguely claims.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of groups sometimes termed ``nonstate actors''
further complicates the situation in Congo. These are mostly
aligned with Kabila. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hutu militias, who carried out much of the killing in Rwanda
in 1994, and then escaped to Congo. Rwanda and Uganda claim that
Kabila and Zimbabwe have trained thousands of them, some in
Zimbabwe itself. They are said to be at the front around the
Mbuji-Mayi diamond mines in the thousands. They are also active in
the Kivus, crossing occasionally into Rwanda. Many of the Hutu
militias have also crossed into Burundi, linking up with other Hutu
rebels fighting against the Tutsi-led government there. Rwanda has
said it will not leave the Congo until it is convinced the Hutu
militias are under control.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Hutu militiamen vary widely; Rwanda
has cited figures between 5,000 and 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mayi-Mayi warriors: These are groups of indigenous
fighters with shifting loyalties in the eastern Congo, North and
South Kivu. Most of them work for Kabila and alongside the Hutu.
The Mayi-Mayi believe that water protects them from bullets, so
some of them go into battle wearing things like rubber tub
stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that eastern Congo has become ungovernable,
and that the Mayi-Mayi have emerged as the warlords of a
disintegrated land. Their numbers are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda
</P>
<P>
   The problems facing Rwanda are in many ways the driving force of
the Congo war. If Rwanda's security could be resolved, diplomats
believe it is at least possible that the conflict in Congo could be
settled.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began in 1994, when hundreds of thousands of Hutu
fled into what was then Zaire, fearing retribution after Hutu
extremists massacred at least 500,000 Tutsi in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Those extremists, allied with Mobutu, in turn began attacking
Rwanda from Zaire. In 1996, the new Tutsi-led government in Rwanda
and its ally and neighbor, Uganda, decided to put an end to these
attacks by putting their power behind Kabila. After Kabila came to
power, he began to distance himself from Rwanda, and Rwanda accused
him, like Mobutu, of allying himself with Hutu fighters.
</P>
<P>
   So in August 1998, Rwanda and Uganda teamed up again, behind
another rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, to start
another rebellion. Rwanda reportedly has about a quarter of its
40,000-strong army in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwanda government has not disclosed what the war is costing
in money terms, but there is no doubt it has been effective in
terms of security. Northwestern Rwanda _ a Hutu extremist
stronghold _ has largely been quiet since Rwanda invaded Congo.
Rwanda says it will leave Congo only if the safety of its borders
is guaranteed and the Hutu fighters are disarmed _ a task that most
experts believe is far too dangerous for the United Nations to take
on.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutsi now make up only 15 percent of Rwanda's population.
But they argue that it will take time to recover from the genocide
sufficiently to share power.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda
</P>
<P>
   Uganda is often accused of being involved in Congo largely for
opportunistic reasons, and it may be eager to get out now that the
war no longer serves the interests of Museveni, the Ugandan
president _ a man with a reputation as one of Africa's brightest
and most progressive leaders. But withdrawal might make Ugandans
question the worthiness of the adventure in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda reportedly has between 8,000 and 10,000 soldiers in
Congo, some as deep as 750 miles from the Ugandan border, at
Basankusu. Uganda backs two rebel groups, the Movement for the
Liberation of Congo, in the northwest, and the splinter group of
the Rally for Democracy headed by Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
   What is most contentious, Ugandan soldiers are reported to be
the most vigorous in cashing in on Congo's wealth, taking out
diamonds, gold, timber and ivory. Despite the looting, the war has
been a drain on the Ugandan economy and is thus increasingly
unpopular at home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rwanda, Uganda backed both the 1996 and 1998 rebellions in
Congo by arguing that it needed to protect its border from from
rebels in eastern Congo. Uganda also said it was siding with
Rwanda, a longtime ally, to prevent another genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors behind Uganda's involvement are Museveni's
ambition to be perceived as a major leader on the continent, and
his close personal ties with Paul Kagame, the vice president of
Rwanda who is considered the real power there. Kagame fled to
Uganda during anti-Tutsi riots in 1959 and became a star in the
Ugandan army, helping Museveni come to power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the war has also strained relations between Rwanda and
Uganda to the point that the nations fought a bloody battle in
Kisangani in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Uganda government faces two major rebel groups. One, the
Allied Democratic Forces, is fighting from bases in eastern Congo.
The second, the Lord's Resistance Army, is supported by Sudan and
attacks Uganda from the north. Uganda, in turn, has supported the
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi
</P>
<P>
   Burundi has also admitted to having soldiers in Congo. It claims
not to be allied with either side, but to be fighting Hutu rebels.
Burundi has the same ethnic division as Rwanda between Hutu and
Tutsi, who have been locked in civil war since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The war has sharply escalated, and the Burundi government has
herded 300,000 people, mostly poor Hutu farmers, into ``regroupment
camps'' in the hills surrounding the capital, Bujumbura. The
government has partly lost control over the nation's southeast,
where fighting is pushing some 1,000 refugees a day into
neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania's role in the war has been mostly that of a haven for
hundreds of thousands of Hutu who have fled there since 1994.
According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, there are
320,000 Burundians in camps in western Tanzania. Since October,
when the fighting in Burundi began to escalate, 50,000 more have
arrived. Refugees from Congo are also arriving at a steady, though
lower, rate.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has reportedly helped Kabila several times, providing
aircraft to bomb towns in rebel zones in northern Congo last year.
Sudan denies this, but Kabila is clearly on friendly terms with the
Sudanese government, apparently on the theory that the enemy of an
enemy _ in this case Uganda _ is a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Though Uganda and Sudan agreed late last year to end
hostilities, the Ugandan government supports the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has been fighting the Islamist Sudanese
government for 16 years. Fighting, disease and famine generated by
the conflict in Sudan have reportedly taken an estimated 2 million
lives since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Angola
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of Mobutu in 1997, the Angolan government led by
Jose Eduardo dos Santos plunged into Congo, largely for its own
strategic reasons _ to attack the Congo bases of UNITA, the Angolan
insurgent movement led by Jonas Savimbi. The Mobutu regime had been
helping UNITA for decades.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, is believed to command about 35,000
troops, and the Angolan government, about 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, the government has pulled off its most
successful offensive in a civil war that dates to Angola's
independence from Portugal in 1975. After spending nearly $900
million in oil revenues on new military equipment, the government
has routed UNITA from nearly every major population center.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA's military losses are closely tied to its loss of Congo as
an ally. The rebels, experts at financing war by mining Angolan
diamonds, no longer have a conduit for selling diamonds into the
international market or for military supply. UNITA's access to fuel
and spare parts has been seriously reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Although routed in the cities and much less capable of waging
conventional war, UNITA remains a formidable guerrilla force. In
the last month, in part to steal food and fuel, it has begun
striking at civilian targets in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Government soldiers are also overextended and undersupplied.
They, too, have been attacking civilians and stealing. All this has
caused a humanitarian mess. The World Food Program says more than 4
million people have been internally displaced out of a population
of about 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA, meanwhile, still has a few bases in Congo, near the
Angolan border. The Kinshasa government, focused on rebels in
eastern Congo, has been unwilling to flush UNITA out. UNITA uses
its bases to stage attacks against Angolan government forces.
Angolan troops, in response, give chase as if the border were not
there.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia
</P>
<P>
   Namibia joined the fighting in Congo almost a year and a half
ago, and in December began allowing the Angolans to fight from
Namibian soil. Namibia, which has often accused UNITA of helping a
Namibian insurgency, and apparently believed the Angolan government
was finally in a position to crush UNITA, reportedly has 2,000
soldiers in Congo _ anywhere from a third to half its army.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say that Namibia was persuaded to enter the
fighting in Congo by Zimbabwe. The two presidents, Sam Nujoma and
Robert Mugabe, are quite close and had supported each other during
the years when South Africa's apartheid government was busy trying
to stamp out their black liberation movements. Last year, Namibia,
Zimbabwe, Angola and Congo even formalized a mutual defense pact.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA has threatened retaliation against Namibia's involvement
and has already carried out several attacks. Namibia announced last
month that it would spend about $120 million on defense this fiscal
year, a 65 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers, meanwhile, have questioned Namibia's
involvement in both wars. The Namibian, in an editorial that ran on
Jan. 28, raised concerns about the growing cost of the wars, at a
time when the country needs money for social spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``While one would not argue with spending on the need to protect
our country's borders, one could certainly argue with the fact that
wars a long way from our borders are continuing to be a drain on
our state coffers,'' the editorial read.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe government of Mugabe has sent between 7,000 and
11,000 troops to Congo to support Kabila, according to varying
reports. The intervention is motivated in part by Mugabe's longing
to be a major player in southern Africa and his rivalry with the
leaders of Uganda and Rwanda. Zimbabwe has taken advantage of
access to diamond mines under the control of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimbabwe's military involvement in Congo is deeply unpopular
at home. The full cost of the deployment has been concealed from
international donors and, a Zimbabwean banker said, is seen by many
Zimbabweans as contributing to the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to
Zimbabwe last year because of suspicion that Mugabe misled it about
the cost of supporting Kabila. That suspension of aid, among other
things, has left Zimbabwe struggling to pay for fuel and with
inflation as high as 60 percent. So low are Zimbabwe's reserves of
dollars and other foreign currencies that the country can no longer
afford to import diesel, which is in scarce supply.
</P>
<P>
   Zambia
</P>
<P>
   Landlocked and abutted by several troubled lands, Zambia has
long sought to cast itself as an island of stability in central
Africa's turbulence. Like former President Kenneth D. Kaunda,
President Frederick Chiluba, in power since 1991, has acted as a
broker in the wars that have consumed the region from the
independence struggles of the 1970s to the present-day
conflagrations in Angola and Congo. That has led to peace deals in
Angola and Congo, though these have been undermined by the
combatants' refusal to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the statesmanlike stance of its first two leaders,
Zambia has invariably suffered from the wars around it. Little of
its potential _ in tourism, agriculture and mining _ has been
realized. In the 1970s, Kaunda supported liberation movements in
Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and the former Rhodesia. In exchange,
the white minority regimes of the time in southern Africa strangled
Zambia's trade routes and attacked nationalist guerrillas based in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Angolan war, the effect is more insidious. Over
the years, some 200,000 refugees _ 160,000 of them from Angola _
have flowed into Zambia. According to the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees, some 20,000 have crossed into the country in recent weeks
as the war in Angola has broadened. And Zambia has sent troops to
its border to prevent Angolan troops from entering in pursuit of
fleeing UNITA rebels. The easy availability of weapons in Angola
has fostered arms trade and an upsurge of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Angola last year accused Zambia of supporting UNITA by supplying
the group with arms and other logistical supports. Chiluba
vigorously denied this, but South African military experts suspect
that some officials in Zambia are still helping Savimbi.

COMMENTARY: DUBYA AGONISTES IN AUSTIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reports are dribbling out of Austin about the Can
This Campaign Be Saved powwow there this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   W. won't come out of his room.
</P>
<P>
   He's curled up in fetal position, clutching that beloved feather
pillow he brings with him on the road.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd in the hall beseeches the Diffident Debutante to please,
please come out and campaign some more.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco has smelling salts. Soft Money slips hundred
thousand dollar checks under the door. Corporate America wants to
massage grapeseed oil into the governor's temples. The Right to
Life Committee is ready to give mouth-to-mouth. Pat Robertson is
praying for a miracle. Poppy and Bar are promising their Boy they
will not go back to Jeb, their first choice to run for president,
no matter what happens in South Carolina. Laura tries to lure her
honey out with a big slice of his favorite coconut pie. Spot, W.'s
loyal spaniel, scratches at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott jumps around, doing that ``Hotty toddy, gosh
almighty'' Ole Miss cheer. Tom DeLay is cracking his braided
Hungarian whip, seeking to replace diffidence with discipline. Karl
Rove is dialing Naomi Wolf on his cell phone. Karen Hughes is on
the floor, scribbling a sequel to W.'s autobiography, ``A Charge to
Keep,'' called ``A Keep to Recharge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Establishment puts its ear to the door, straining to catch
W.'s muffled whimpers into his pillow: ``This is just so much
harder than y'all said it would be. It's the hardest thing I've
ever had to do. I'm dog tired. This dog won't hunt. I ain't got no
dog in this fight. Snoop Doggy Doggonit! I miss my routine. I miss
coming down in the morning and feeding my cats, Cowboy, India and
Ernie. And I really miss seeing Ernie lying on my pillow. I miss
walking my dog. I miss my jogging. I miss my girls. I miss my down
time. I miss my down comforter. This is the longest I've been away
from my house and my family and my pets probably ever. I tried
using those orange foam ear plugs and dark ski goggles to nap on
the bus, but I could still hear Jack Kemp yammering. When I don't
get enough sleep, I get grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I did everything you told me to. I flipped pancakes. I
went sledding. I rode the stupid snowmobile. I pushed tax cuts, and
now no one wants them anymore. It was so cold up there, I wished I
did have a fire in the belly. I hate the cold! It makes my eyes
water. I did the endorsement strategy, the establishment strategy,
the inevitable strategy, the Jesus strategy. Now my handlers want
me to do the pretend-to-throw-off-my-handlers strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I posed with Quayle even though we knew the press would
caption it `Dumb and Dumber.' I kissed up to Sununu, the stamp
collector I fired from Dad's White House. I went to that racist Bob
Jones University to prove my conservative bona fides, and the press
slammed me for going to a school that doesn't allow interracial
dating even though my brother is married to a Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now McCain is braggin' he's Reagan. I was Reagan first!
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I had a few flubs. It's easy to mix up the words
`vulcanize' and `balkanize,' and `impetus' and `impotence.' I did
say I wanted `more fewer' access routes to the information highway.
I talked to those kids in New Hampshire about Preservation Month
when they were celebrating Perseverance Month. Reporters did catch
me asking, `Is our children learning?' Big pancake-flippin' deal.
In hindsight, I shouldn't have stood up with generals and trashed
McCain for forgettin' veterans. It was a Dukakis-in-the-tank
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I get into this thing anyhow? I wasn't even planning
to run for president, until the poll numbers took off and everybody
started sending me money. I'm not consumed by ambition, like Gore
and Clinton. I'm not even sure, deep down, that I would make a
better president than John Wayne McCain. I'm turned inside-out: Am
I the insider's outsider or is he the outsider's insider? Where are
my Topsiders?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there really such a thing as a firewall or is it like the
tooth fairy? Man, I can't believe those Republican state chairmen
and governors who talked me into this thing are already wishing me
hasta la vista, baby. Nobody likes me. The press is lickin'
McCain's ankles. Mom and Dad always liked Jeb better. Let him run.
See if I care. You can't see me, but I'm smirkin'.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, the long dark night of the front-runner's soul.

COMMENTARY: ADVICE AND DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief economic adviser of one candidate is the co-author of
an exuberant book claiming that investors ain't seen nothing yet;
unfortunately, the exuberance is a bit, well, irrational. The chief
adviser of the other is a pessimist, deeply skeptical about the
durability of our current prosperity. One candidate proposes huge
tax cuts that will break the budget unless the long boom not only
continues but accelerates. The other prefers not to count his
fiscal chickens before they hatch. Which is which?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, of course, is the tax-slasher. John McCain is
his cautious rival. Kevin Hassett is the raging bull. Lawrence
Lindsey is the dour bear. Now for the punch line: Lindsey is
advising Bush; Hassett is advising McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Bush economic program is deja vu all over
again. Just like Bob Dole's advisers in 1996 (who by and large were
the same people), Bush's economists have allowed the presumed
political appeal of tax cuts to override their professional
scruples. The other story is less well known. Indeed, like most
other people, I have only started paying serious attention to the
McCain campaign in the last few days, and I have to admit that
discovering that Hassett, of all people, is his chief economic
adviser was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Kevin Hassett? Until quite recently he had a solid, not
at all flashy reputation in fiscal economics, with a career that
moved from Columbia University to the Federal Reserve and then to
the American Enterprise Institute, an establishment-conservative
think tank. There he teamed up with the investment writer James K.
Glassman to write a couple of articles in The Wall Street Journal,
followed up by a book expanding on those articles entitled ``Dow
36,000'' _ a catchy title backed up by a thesis that was ingenious,
exciting and unfortunately quite silly.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean that their forecast was wrong. For all I or anyone
else knows, the Dow may indeed go to 36,000. But the way the book
justifies that forecast involves a series of conceptual confusions
about such things as the sources of risk and the difference between
dividends and earnings. (To be fair, when I talked to Hassett, he
offered a plausible explanation _ much better than Glassman's
indignant denials that he said what he actually said _ of why the
most glaring apparent error in the book might not be too bad an
approximation, but the other objections remain.)
</P>
<P>
   How did someone like Hassett end up writing that kind of book?
As I understand it, a casual, back-of-the-envelope calculation led
to a huge publisher's advance so quickly that the authors never had
a chance to have second thoughts. Yes, Virginia, that is the way
the world works.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting question is, How did McCain end up
designating Hassett, hardly a household name until that book, as
his chief economic adviser? The answer, which comes as something of
a relief, is that it apparently had nothing to do with ``Dow
36,000.'' Instead, it was that inevitability thing: all the usual
Republican policy suspects believed that if you worked against
Bush, you would never eat a free lunch in Washington again. (And
you might find a horse's head in your bed.) So McCain had to take
what he could get. Hassett was one of the few identifiably
Republican fiscal experts who wasn't intimidated. And if we ignore
the brief foray into stock-market hype, the senator could have done
worse: before Hassett succumbed to the imperatives of the book
trade he was regarded as quietly sensible, and freed from those
imperatives he seems likely to revert to type.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to admit that it's a depressing spectacle. The
Republican tent is a big one, which probably contains at least as
many first-rate economists as its rival. Yet that huge pool of
talent has not only been locked up by the Anointed One; it has been
forced to genuflect to the legacy of a crank doctrine _ supply-side
economics _ that even party loyalists don't believe in . Meanwhile,
Bush's main rival has been forced to assemble a scratch team from
the handful of Republican economists who know something about
policy yet are sufficiently remote from the corridors of power to
be immune to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to run a Grand Old Party?

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was just about this time three years ago that
John Weaver, a tall, terse Texan, dragged Sen. John McCain from a
Senate Commerce Committee hearing to tell him he should run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a Republican political consultant from San Antonio, had
worked with McCain as field director of Sen. Phil Gramm's
short-lived presidential campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided that McCain, with his compelling personal
biography and maverick stances, had just the right resume for the
post-Clinton years. And perhaps more important, he thought the
Republican Party had lost its way and let President Clinton emerge
as the one who understood the concerns of middle-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Weaver nor McCain knew what they were on their way to
creating that day: a seat-of-the pants populist candidacy that has
turned the Republican Party establishment on its head and is now
threatening its chosen candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Now Weaver, 40, the constant brooding presence on the campaign
bus _ McCain impishly calls him Sunny because he is not _ is one of
a small band of Republican insiders who are helping McCain mount a
campaign that often seems to run on instincts, impulse and wit.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCain acknowledges surprise that he might be creating a
populist reform message that is somehow larger than the sum of its
parts. His New Hampshire primary upset _ if replicated elsewhere _
suggests that he has an appeal that stretches broadly across the
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we knew what we were trying to do,'' McCain
said. ``But we didn't realize that it was catching on.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a hard road ahead of McCain, and many potential
pitfalls. The senator's appeal is built on intangibles that include
a public infatuation with his personality and his gripping
biography.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the luster could fade as voters focus more on his policy
positions. Bush is already trying to tar him as a hypocrite on
campaign finance reform because he has accepted campaign donations
from lobbyists. And it may still turn out that Bush's money and
organization will kick in.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success so far has been a combination of some early
planning, some risks that paid off and some clever off-the-cuff
decision making. His gamble to skip Iowa and concentrate on New
Hampshire paid off spectacularly, as did his certainty that he
could generate a bonanza of media coverage through his
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also benefited from the strangely ineffective
campaign that the front-runner has conducted. Bush has seemed
diffident, and he has kept piling on endorsements even after signs
that they were backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   For now the McCain candidacy has hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain set out to create an insurgency,'' said William
Kristol, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and
editor of The Weekly Standard, ``but as often happens in these
situations, it's almost bigger than him and bigger than any of the
proposals. And it goes beyond his personal ambitions or
intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the first one in his circle to notice what was
happening was Mark Salter, his speechwriter and longtime Senate
administrative assistant, who saw the excitement grow in McCain's
New Hampshire crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me three or four times, `Look at the look in these
people's eyes,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's themes were meticulously planned from the
beginning _ the emphasis on character, national security expertise,
campaign finance overhaul and the devotion of much of the budget
surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the populist tones of the campaign arose from snap
decisions made along the way, like McCain's antic appearance before
the Russian consulate accusing New York Republicans of acting like
apparatchiks seeking to preserve a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt was dreamed up the day before by Mike Murphy, McCain's
bomb-throwing senior strategist, as a way of fighting the party's
effort to keep McCain off the ballot for the state's primary. The
candidate loved it.
</P>
<P>
   And no one quite expected McCain's campaign bus, ``Straight Talk
Express,'' to become a symbol in itself of his live-off-the-land
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus just kind of evolved,'' Weaver said. ``I'm a big
believer in bus tours. John wanted to have the press with him, and
one thing led to another, and it became a tradition that
unfortunately I don't think we could ever stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, McCain's media consultant, said simply: ``We were
trying to win. We are creating a new party in the process of trying
to win.'' He said, ``There wasn't this overt decision on the part
of the campaign six months ago to try to create McCain
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   What is threatening to the Republican Party is that McCain in
many ways is running against its congressional leadership, against
its big-business wing and against some of its conservative allies,
groups like Americans for Tax Reform and the National Right to Life
Committee, which have both run advertisements against him. He tars
all of them as the Washington establishment that has lost touch
with the people.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unlikely group of battle-scarred veterans from
across the spectrum of the Republican Party who are helping McCain
do this. And they are hardly outsiders. Rick Davis, 42, the
campaign manager, is a Washington lobbyist and merchant banker
known as a fund-raising whiz, who has close ties to the same
business establishment that McCain likes to rail against.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 37, is known for some of the most rough-edged
commercials in the business and has worked for clients as diverse
as Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey and Oliver North. He did not
join the McCain campaign formally until Lamar Alexander had dropped
out of the race, because he had been with Alexander in 1996 and
remained loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 51, the media consultant, began his political career as
chief of staff to former Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey, and he worked
for the presidential campaign of Bob Dole. Bill McInturff, 46,
McCain's pollster, was Dole's pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Salter, 44, is the McCain loyalist who helped write McCain's
autobiography. Weaver was once the executive director of the Texas
Republican Party and has counted 11 senators as his political
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us came together for different reasons,'' Weaver said,
``but we're unified in thinking the party has to change its way.
We've lost two national elections and are in danger of losing
Congress.''

 WASHINGTON: losing Congress.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCain, 63, had been intrigued by the idea of running for
president, ever since he accompanied his friend Bob Dole on the
campaign trail in 1996, acting as what he calls Dole's designated
smiler. He says his role was to sit in front of Dole in audiences
and to grin as a way of trying to remind the candidate not to look
so dour.
</P>
<P>
   He made his decision to run in December 1998. From the start his
campaign emphasized his character and extraordinary experience as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, to distinguish him from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This laid the groundwork for what could have been a fairly
traditional Republican campaign, appealing to conservative voters
through the emphasis on a strong military and on military
traditions of honor and patriotism. Dole, who had been grievously
wounded in World War II, had himself sometimes emphasized his
biography and had certainly tried to run against Clinton's
character.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also had in his quiver of issues his Senate crusade
to overhaul the campaign finance law. His aides were concerned that
this would not resonate with the voters, and they hoped to persuade
him to play it down.
</P>
<P>
   But when they tested it in the polling they used to start the
campaign, they were surprised to find that in four critical primary
states, 60 percent of Republican voters said a change in the
finance system was important. Only 15 percent said it was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that John would talk about it,'' Weaver said. ``We
didn't think he should stress it. So we had to eat a lot of crow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also McCain himself, his aides say, who decided early on
that he wanted to depart from the tax-cutting wing of his party
that advocated supply-side economics and put more of an emphasis on
using the budget surplus for Social Security and debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   His plans to make this point last spring were disrupted when the
U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia began and McCain decided he would not
formally announce his candidacy during a military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nature of the McCain campaign was developed because
of his comparative lack of money, which forced some unorthodox
thinking. Murphy remembers gathering with McCain and a few aides in
1998 in his Senate office. He pulled out his laptop computer full
of slides and data and argued for 40 minutes that the senator
should save money by skipping the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who had also been courted sporadically by Elizabeth
Dole's campaign, then built an organization that was lean by
presidential standards, allowing as much money as possible to be
put into television advertising. The small number of his staff _
McCain has 65 full-time aides, compared with about 180 for Bush _
has been evident at times in the campaign's inability to turn out
polished position papers.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also made the campaign flexible and able to change
gears fast. Earlier this year, for example, after reading in a
newspaper that minority journalists felt insulted that Bush had
turned down an invitation to stop by their convention, McCain
decided to toss out his schedule and go to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's populist, establishment-bashing tones have come
in reaction to the Bush campaign and the establishment opposition
to him. He would not have been making gleeful attacks on the New
York Republican leaders if they had not tried to keep him off the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the establishment pushes, he pushes back,'' Murphy said.
``Weighing in as they have, they've created some of this. There's
poetic justice in all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a vindication of McCain's effort, a federal judge
put McCain on the ballot in all New York counties and ruled that
two requirements for circulating nominating petitions, the crux of
McCain's complaint, were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   At moments, members of McCain's inner circle have started to
fear the populism of their own campaign. On the stump, McCain began
skewering Bush's tax plan as too tilted to the rich after he read a
magazine article that made that analysis. When Stevens put that
line of argument into a commercial, aides say there was a debate
about whether to go forward with a class-warfare tactic that is
usually more the province of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants in the discussion, Vin Weber, a
lobbyist who is a member of McCain's informal kitchen cabinet,
opposed the move. Davis wanted any decision to run the
advertisement to be made deliberately and carefully. Weaver, Murphy
and Stevens were all for it. The commercial was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   And as McCain's campaign goes on, its rebel spirit is only
growing stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Salter joined McCain's Senate staff after working for Jeane
Kirkpatrick, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He
does not have the profile of a rabble-rouser, but on the night of
the New Hampshire primary, when McCain promised to ``break the
Washington iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and legislation,''
Salter was in the audience shouting, ``Burn it down.''

U.N. MISSION IN CONGO WOULD BE AREA'S FIRST SINCE '60S

<P>
   If it is approved by the Security Council, the new peacekeeping
mission to Congo would be the second the United Nations has
dispatched to the area. The first, called the U.N. Operation in
Congo and known by its French acronym ONUC, lasted from July 1960
to June 1964, and represents a particularly bitter interlude in the
organization's history.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of Congo's independence from Belgium in June 1960,
the country was on the verge of collapse. The government declared
martial law and asked the United Nations to help ensure the
withdrawal of Belgian forces and assist the government in
maintaining law and order. When the copper-rich province of Katanga
then seceded, the United Nations found itself trying to maintain
Congo's territorial integrity and independence, get all foreigners
not under U.N. command out of the country and prevent civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, U.N. personnel had to assume
responsibilities beyond normal peacekeeping duties. At its peak in
July 1961, ONUC, originally 4,000 troops, had almost 20,000
military personnel and 2,000 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned, the new peacekeeping operation in Congo will be
about one-quarter that size.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, 1961, while trying to secure a cease-fire between
Congolese and Katangan forces, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold
and seven other U.N. staff members were killed when their plane
crashed en route to Ndola, in what was then Northern Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. force suffered 250 fatalities during the Congo
operation. By comparison, during its three-year deployment in the
Balkans, the U.N. Protection Force lost 167 people.
</P>
<P>
   The secession of Katanga ended in January 1963. ONUC helped
consolidate the government and retrain Congolese soldiers and
security forces before withdrawing in 1964.

KABILA, ONCE NEIGHBORS' PUPPET, NOW THEIR FOE, CLINGS TO POWER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ After languishing for three decades in the
mountains of eastern Congo, a little-known rebel was picked by the
Rwandans to lead the overthrow of the 32-year dictatorship of
Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. So Laurent D. Kabila suddenly found
himself president of a country a third of the size of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, having angered his former patrons so much
that they are now trying to topple him, with half of his nation
occupied by foreign forces and all of it in economic ruin, Kabila
is, against the predictions of many people, still in power.
</P>
<P>
   The former puppet, who had survived over the years by reportedly
leading a small band of rebels who illegally mined gold and once
kidnapped some Western scientists studying gorillas, was even the
star guest at a special U.N. Security Council session two weeks
ago. Seven months after a cease-fire was signed _ and quickly
violated by all warring parties _ the United Nations is considering
sending a 5,500-member force to monitor the accord.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations and in several televised interviews,
Kabila forcefully made the point that he had been making since the
current war began in August 1998, but that had been falling on deaf
ears: The conflict in Congo is not a civil war, but an invasion by
two countries, Rwanda and Uganda, which happen to be among
Washington's closest allies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talk of a coup against Kabila, which had swirled
around Kinshasa a few months ago, seems to have quieted down for
now. Although the outbreak of the current war helped Kabila's
popularity at first, the deteriorating economic and social
conditions have caused a steady decline in his standing here.
</P>
<P>
   So low had his position apparently fallen that the government in
recent months began feeding a personality cult. Countless
billboards with Kabila's face now dot the capital alongside a few
older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Kabila here hoped that the trip to New York would
begin to change the outside perception of him. For them, he is a
liberator who began changing Congo for the better, but whose plans
were derailed by the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have already organized elections,'' said Delphin
Banza, a lawyer whom Kabila appointed vice president of a committee
to organize a national debate on Congo's future. ``Let's give him
the time to restore order in this country. Then he'll step down.''
</P>
<P>
   To his detractors, however, Kabila is a more brutal dictator
than Mobutu. Under his rule corruption and lawlessness are again
flourishing. Kabila, they say, is merely using the war as an excuse
to clamp down on freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila is governing the Congo as if it were an aquarium,''
said Joseph Olenghankoy, a well-known opposition figure here who
spent 18 months in prison for criticizing Kabila's government. ``He
controls the oxygen flow to the aquarium, and we, the Congolese
people, are the fish that are suffocating to death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a compatriot,'' Olenghankoy added. ``But he is utterly
incapable of governing a country. He is now the main obstacle to
peace. He's a man who is interested in nothing but his own hold on
power.''
</P>
<P>
   To fight the war, Kabila has sought and received help from,
among others, Libya, the hard-core Hutu militia that led the 1994
Rwandan genocide, and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila arrived here three years ago as a giant question mark.
The coalition that brought him to power, led by Rwanda but also
including Uganda and Angola, wanted a friendly power in Congo and
needed a Congolese face to head an otherwise foreign assault on
Mobutu's regime. Initially, Kabila even received the praise of
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a visit here.
</P>
<P>
   What was known of Kabila, though, did not necessarily augur well
for the West. He was a follower of Patrice Lumumba,
post-independent Congo's first prime minister and a hero of African
nationalism, who believed that African nations must decide their
own course. Lumumba frightened Cold War American policy-makers; in
1961, he was assassinated with what is believed to have been the
participation of the CIA. The CIA then created Mobutu and supported
him for years until the end of the Cold War made him irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Kabila's rebel band made news when it kidnapped
Western scientists studying gorillas, but slipped into obscurity
after that episode, said Salih Booker, director of the Africa
Studies Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He awakened at the moment when a motivated coalition had the
power to overthrow Mobutu,'' Booker said. ``Kabila _ by now a sort
of commercial/political entrepreneur _ rode the wave to Kinshasa,
but he lacked a plan, a movement, and grew tired of some of his
allies and their more focused agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The agenda of Rwanda's Tutsi-led government was essentially to
install a Congolese leader willing to help it secure eastern Congo.
That area concealed Hutu militias responsible for the 1994 genocide
in which at least 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But Kabila's closeness to the Tutsi, who are despised in distant
Kinshasa, made him unpopular here. He eventually cut his ties with
them _ causing the Rwandans to organize a second rebellion, this
time against Kabila, in August 1998. Kabila's government was very
close to falling, but he persuaded the Angolans and Zimbabweans to
rescue him at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   At home, most of the reforms Kabila had undertaken during his
first year _ the successful introduction of a new currency, the
stabilization of the economy and a campaign against corruption _
ground to a halt. Today, the economy has collapsed and the
Congolese franc is losing value every week. Soldiers from Kabila's
presidential guard prey on Congolese and foreigners here, invading
private cars for no reason and demanding money.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat based here said the president ``did not get
sufficient credit for what he did during his first year.'' He
added, ``Kabila had, and for all I know still has, a genuine
ambition to improve the conditions in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But others _ especially political opponents who have been
ignored, intimidated or jailed in the last three years _ say Kabila
is indistinguishable from other African despots who are willing to
sacrifice anything to remain in power
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila likes power,'' said Christophe Gbenye, a Lumumba
follower who knew Kabila in the early 1960s and who is now an
opposition figure here. ``He wants this war to continue. That way
he remains in power. He has absolute control over the country's
finances. Money is spent all in the name of war.''

   MOSCOW _ Yusup Magomedov woke up feeling a bit stir-crazy.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, the lanky, sandy-haired teen-ager had been
cooped up with his mother and three sisters in their two-room
wooden house in the village of Novi Sharoi, about 20 miles from the
Chechen capital Grozny. The village elders had closed school,
fearing the Russian warplanes that screeched overhead on their
bombing runs of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But that October morning, Yusup begged his mother to let him go
outside to play soccer with his friends. While cautious, Leila
Magomedov also was determined not to allow the fighting to
completely disrupt her family's routine. So, with a crisp morning
sun streaming through the kitchen window, she swallowed a feeling
of dread and said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later, an explosion rocked the town
square where Yusup and his friends had gone to play. The Russian
cluster bomb killed seven children immediately and wounded 14
others, including Yusup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, laying in a bed in a crowded hospital room in Moscow, Yusup
is a bit stir-crazy again, restless with all the undirected energy
of a 14-year-old. But he won't be pleading with his mother again to
go outside to play soccer. He no longer has legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian army says its four-month-old offensive in Chechnya
is aimed at eliminating terrorists and bandits. The Kremlin not
only denies targeting civilians in the war but also insists it is
protecting civilians like Yusup and his family, and providing
adequate medical care and other humanitarian assistance to the
200,000 Chechens uprooted by the war.
</P>
<P>
   The army has been accused of numerous attacks on civilians. On
Oct. 21, Russian jets bombed the central food market in downtown
Grozny. On Nov. 1, Russian jets strafed a Red Cross convoy carrying
aid workers and wounded civilians from the frontlines to refugee
camps in neighboring Ingushetia. The latter attack killed 27.
</P>
<P>
   According to eyewitnesses, the Oct. 23 explosion that tore up
Yusup's legs came from an unexploded cluster bomb fired the night
before during heavy shelling by the Russian troops. There were no
rebels in the town at the time of the Russian attack, villagers
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, while visiting
Russia last week, joined the chorus of international criticism of
Russia's conduct of the war against separatists in its rebellious
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that there has been an incredible amount of misery
injected upon the civilian population of Chechnya,'' she said last
Monday at the start of three days of talks with Russian officials
in Moscow. ``There has been excessive force used and civilians have
been, I think, indiscriminately targeted in a way that has
broadened and widened the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Yusup, U.S. condemnations of Russia's military
tactics in Chechnya are a case of too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I awoke and everything was covered in blood,'' he recalled
last week from a hospital bed here in the Russian capital, as he
wrapped his slender fingers around the angry pink stumps where his
knees used to be.
</P>
<P>
   After the blast, relatives and neighbors rushed him, his mom and
the other wounded children to the nearest hospital in the town of
Urus Martin, 15 minutes away, leaving his three sisters behind in
the care of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The exhausted doctors, already overwhelmed by wounded, told
Yusup's mother they had no anesthesia or electricity to perform an
operation to save her son's legs.
</P>
<P>
   She had one chance, they said. If she could make it in 24 hours
to Sleptsovsk, the major border crossing between Chechnya and
Ingushetia and the location of the region's largest hospital, there
was hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Oct. 23 was the day the Russians stepped up air raids
against rebel strongholds in Grozny and elsewhere in central
Chechnya, near Urus Martin. Russian authorities also had shut the
Sleptsovsk border crossing, trapping non-combatants in a war zone,
a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   For one week, Leila and Yusup cowered in the basement as Russian
bombs rained down around Urus Martin. Gangrene set in to Yusup's
shredded legs, forcing doctors sharing the hiding place to amputate
them with a kitchen knife. just above the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Yusup slipped in and out of consciousness, with doctors once
even pronouncing him dead. But the soft-spoken boy wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, Leila made a dash for the border in a borrowed car
and succeeded in getting to the refugee hospital in Sleptsovsk.
There, doctors operated on him, cleaning his wounds and saving what
remained of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   His 14th birthday was spent in the hospital, where he learned
for the first time that his best friend Sultan had been killed in
the Oct. 23 attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was all too much, and finally, he cried, Leila recalled. ``I
asked him if it was because of the pain. 'No,' he said. 'It's
because of everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Yusup recuperated, the doctors told Leila that if her son
was ever going to walk again, he would need yet a third operation,
one available only in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Big problems still stood in the way. First, the two had no money
to fly the 1,000 miles to Moscow or to pay for the cost of the
hospital stay. Second, Leila hadn't seen her three daughters in
almost one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched my son die, come back to life, and I was worried
sick about where my girls were,'' Leila said, tears welling in her
tired eyes. ``A mother shouldn't have to make the choice of leaving
some children to save another.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian journalist rescued her from at least one horrible
plight. Vera Kuznetsova contacted acquaintances at the Russian
Health Ministry and through them, found Moscow doctors willing to
operate on Yusup's legs so he could be fitted with prostheses and
allow the two to stay in a rehabilitation clinic free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Yusup is settled in a wing of the Central Russian Republic
Children's' Hospital on the southern edge of Moscow, learning to
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fragile, jerky process as his awkward teen-age body
climbs from a wheelchair and balances on the robot-colored metal
sticks. With all the resilience of someone who believes he has seen
the worst, Yusup views the challenge as part of another great
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys (physical therapists) say I gotta take it easy,'' he
says. ``They warned me it would be painful when I took my first
step. But when I did it, I laughed and said this is nothing
compared to the pain I've felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, minds mend at a different pace than bodies. A
psychologist meets with Yusup and his mother each week to talk
about their nightmare. While Yusup talks easily of his ordeal, he
secretly worries that his mother is having a more difficult time
coping than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Out of earshot of her son, Leila allows some pessimism about a
war no counselor can settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and these rebels will fight ... until we are all dead.
They won't sit together (in peace talks) by themselves. They need
to be pushed. It doesn't look like the United States is going to
push them together so who knows what will happen,'' she says,
wearily brushing a wan piece of hair that has fallen across her
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my neighbors are all sick and hurting. We don't need
independence, We need peace,'' Leila added.
</P>
<P>
   What unsettles Yusup most is not knowing whether the rest of his
family has survived. As of Saturday, the Russians were again
shelling the surroundings of Novi Sharoi, trapping Yusup's three
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd say it, but I miss my sisters,'' he said.
``And our cow Sida, she's quite a star. The whole village used to
feed her. I hope they're feeding her while we're gone.''

   DALY CITY, Calif. _ With a pick comb in his hair and his shirt
untucked, Roland Martin wandered into the Good Guys electronics
store on a recent Wednesday afternoon and immediately secured a
30-minute employment interview. Not only did the store disregard
his appearance, it welcomed his impulsive job hunt. Besides, the
interviewer could not see him.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's interview in this San Francisco suburb was conducted by
computer, making him a participant in a trend in retail hiring.
Dozens of big-name retailers, including Target, Hollywood Video,
Macy's and Longs Drug Stores, are replacing paper applications and
in-person interviews with computer kiosks in the initial screening
of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The computer programs query prospective employees on job history
and work habits. They then typically delve into psychological tests
that the companies say can help match job skills and personalities
with openings. Employers say the automation gives them an edge in
the tight labor market, enabling them to sift through applications
quickly, weed out duds, identify talent and, as in the case of
Martin, attract candidates who might not otherwise have taken time
to apply.
</P>
<P>
   But critics ask how a computer program can rightly judge a
person, even if only in an initial screening. For their part,
privacy advocates say that employers, and companies hired to
administer the kiosks, are creating vast databases of applicants'
psychological profiles _ as potentially damaging as a bad credit
rating _ that could find a larger audience than the applicants
expect.
</P>
<P>
   And this could be only the beginning for the automated
interview. Before long, employers envision that job seekers will
apply from home over the Internet. As technology advances,
companies even foresee putting prospective employees into virtual
video environments to see how they might react to stressful
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time before the technology advances and
before more companies get involved,'' said Alan G. Frost, director
of management development for Home Depot, which uses computer
kiosks for job applications in all of its roughly 900 stores.
``This gives us a great opportunity to have tremendously accurate
hiring and, No. 2, it saves on labor costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost said the kiosks, which administer a 40- to 60-minute
interview, are paying off for Home Depot. He said the procedure did
not waste managers' time scoring applications and tests. And he
said the turnover rate among new employees fell 11.4 percent in the
12 months after stores started using the kiosks. One reason, he
said, is that the kiosks show videos that give applicants a clear
idea of the job demands, whereas store managers, eager to hire
employees, may understate the stresses of a Home Depot job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing away with face-to-face interviews, but they
come later in the process,'' he said. ``We're not wasting time
interviewing the wrong people who don't have the job skills you've
proven you need here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Home Depot and Mirage Resorts, the Las Vegas-based hotel
chain, both of which have created their own computerized interview
systems, many retailers use a third-party company to operate the
kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens rely on Decision Point Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.,
whose clients include Macy's West, Duane Reade, Target and
Blockbuster Video. Decision Point processed 1 million applications
for clients last year and says it will handle more than 3 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Decision Point kiosks, like the one Martin used at the Good
Guys, include an 8-inch monitor attached to a miniature keyboard
and number pad. The interview usually starts with about 15
questions meant to weed out clearly undesirable candidates, like
those who decline to take a drug test required by a company, or
those who say they are younger than 16. Applicants who fail the
initial test are told the company has no suitable openings.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the questions vary from company to company,
depending on the skills or personality traits being sought. For
example, the roughly 90 questions on the Good Guys application are
heavily weighted toward the applicant's view of drugs and alcohol
in the workplace, and how the prospective employee might react in
stressful situations.
</P>
<P>
   At Target, the multiple-choice questions include more elaborate
hypothetical situations, like how an employee would react to a
theft, and questions about social views, such as whether drunken
driving laws are too strict and what percentage of Americans the
applicant believes cheat on their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   When the application is complete, the information is sent online
to Decision Point. The company says that within 10 minutes it sends
a three-page typed synopsis back to the store manager by fax or
e-mail to help determine whether the candidate is worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   The first two pages are fact sheets, indicating name, Social
Security number, job history and the like. The third page is a
computer analysis of the application and psychological test. It
highlights ``admissions'' (like gaps in employment or dismissals)
and ``omissions'' (like failure to include references) and suggests
interview questions, like ``Why did you leave your previous job?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it summarizes the personality profile by giving one of
three ratings: green (good candidate), yellow (manager needs to dig
deeper), or red (warning). The profile of a candidate in the yellow
zone might read, ``May not follow rules'' or ``May not be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of psychological tests is nothing new. But privacy
advocates say their use in automated form and their storage in
databases could become a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Lemmey, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
San Francisco-based privacy advocacy group, said candidates had no
choice but to submit sensitive information ``for a job they may not
get to a third-party company they don't realize they have a
relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Decision Point, there is a database of 2 million
to 3 million applications that have been processed in the last
three years, said the chief executive, Robert A. DeKoning. He said
that while the company ``co-owns'' the data with its clients, its
agreements with retailers currently forbid it to sell or divulge
information about individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Further, DeKoning said the company would not use such
information without notifying the candidates when they apply. ``We
would be morally obliged to do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But DeKoning said Decision Point's clients might eventually find
it useful to share the database information so that an applicant
not qualified for one employer might be referred to a more suitable
one. ``If we can make the case it's in their mutual best interest
to share applicants, I know they would do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew W. Finkin, a law professor at the University of Illinois
and a specialist in employment law, said applicants had reason to
be concerned. He said that depending on how Decision Point's
contracts with retailers were structured, some applicants might
have the right to see the reports and contest their accuracy under
the Fair Credit Reporting Act. But otherwise, he said, current law
in most states would probably allow the sale or dissemination of
such a database without prior notice.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, he said, the practice might be illegal only if
the companies had made a written promise not to share the
information. The kiosks administered by Decision Point do not tell
applicants that the information will not be used for data mining or
other purposes. Notwithstanding Decision Point's contract
limitations with its clients, ``they could be free to send the
information out,'' Finkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Finkin said he was also concerned that the psychological
profiles and grading were not always scientifically validated. As a
result, he said, the employers may be creating and potentially
disseminating profiles that are ``wildly in error.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer makes this all the more threatening,'' compared
with paper-based profile tests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one judgment in a data bank,'' he said, ``no
future manager has to sit across from the human being and make a
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if applicants might avoid the kiosks once they know about
the potential privacy risks, they appear to be flocking to them
now.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys, which has 79 stores in Washington, California, Oregon
and Nevada, said employment applications increased last year to
32,000 from 14,000 in 1998, a rise it attributed to the fact that
applicants do not have to ask for a paper application and to the
kiosks' appeal to the impulse job seeker.
</P>
<P>
   That category includes Martin, 27, who came to the Daly City
store with his father to return a television set and wound up
applying for a job as a car-stereo installer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the questions at the kiosk seemed easy, although he said
he sometimes had trouble reading the dimly lit screen and typing on
the small keys. Eventually, his father became impatient, and Martin
decided to return some other time to do the complete interview.
</P>
<P>
   The store does not tell applicants that the information winds up
in a database, where it could find a wider audience. But Martin
said he did not really mind. ``They should have listed that,'' he
said. ``But I've got a pretty good background. I've got nothing to
hide.''

U.S. ANTI-DRUG PLAN TO AID COLOMBIA FACES HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's $1.3 billion plan to
help Colombia fight drug trafficking and leftist insurgents is
facing skepticism from military and law-enforcement officials
concerned that the United States could be dragged into a long and
costly struggle that may have little impact on the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The aid plan, which is to be presented in detail to Congress on
Monday, is intended to help stanch the booming production of
cocaine and heroin in Colombia, strengthen the government and help
it take control of a large part of its southern territory now
dominated by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, some senior defense officials are decidedly
unenthusiastic about the U.S. military's growing role in the
anti-drug effort and worried that it may be dragged deeper into the
civil war that has ravaged Colombia for almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many drug enforcement and Coast Guard officials are similarly
concerned, officials said. While the aid package may help
Colombia's beleaguered army fight the guerrillas, they said, it
does not reflect a coherent strategy to fight illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually none of these complaints have been aired publicly. But
officials said the arguments have been heard repeatedly in the
debate over the aid plan, reshaping some of its elements but more
often overridden by administration officials determined to
establish a new U.S. commitment to Colombia's stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude is, `We don't really want to do this,''' one
senior administration official said of generals in the Pentagon.
Referring to the Colombian insurgency, he added: ``The last thing
they need is another level of engagement that has the `I' word in
it. That always has stress for the military _ it has ever since
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House drug policy chief, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey,
dismissed skeptics of the plan, noting that some of the criticism
came from agencies that tried unsuccessfully to win funding
increases for their programs as part of the Colombia aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tried to get aboard this mule,'' McCaffrey said in
an interview, referring to the administration's request for $955
million on top of the $330 million already budgeted for Colombia
aid this year. But he added, ``There wasn't a huge fight among
agencies over this package.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they are confident that the
aid, about two-thirds of which would go to Colombian security
forces, will be approved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have been an important part of the
impetus for greater American aid, warning that the Clinton White
House risked ``losing'' Colombia to the insurgents. A few
congressional liberals have criticized the aid program, but they
are unlikely to slow its passage except by attaching some
conditions meant to promote greater respect for human rights by the
Colombian military.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the package is only a first step in what many U.S.
officials acknowledge will probably be a huge, years-long effort to
strengthen Colombian institutions and help the government reach a
peace with three leftist guerrilla groups and large right-wing
paramilitary forces that operate in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Both Colombian and U.S. officials continue to say the United
States will not engage the guerrillas directly. Nor, they said,
will they aid the fight against the guerrillas _ except those who
hire out to the traffickers to protect drug fields, drug
laboratories or clandestine airstrips.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not involved in the business,'' President Andres
Pastrana said of the rebels, ``they should be confident that
nothing is going to happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, U.S. officials are clearly softening
their claims that U.S. aid will not be used for counterinsurgency.
</P>
<P>
   In a program summary released last month, the White House listed
the primary component of the aid plan as, ``Helping the Colombian
government push into the coca-growing regions of southern Colombia,
which are now dominated by insurgent guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Fred F. Woerner, a former commander of U.S. military forces
in Latin America, said the statement represented a significant
clarification of U.S. goals _ notwithstanding the administration's
assurances to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you push into an area dominated by these guys without
having anything to do with them?'' he asked, referring to the
rebels. ``Anyone who believes that these counternarcotics
battalions will not be involved in counterinsurgency is naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they will argue to Congress that
the situation is especially dire because of an explosion in the
cultivation of coca, the raw material of cocaine, in the same parts
of southern Colombia that the rebels dominate. Their main support
will be a new study by both the CIA and the Drug Enforcement
Administration showing that Colombia's coca production is more than
three times greater than American analysts had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last few years, nearly all the world's coca was grown
in Bolivia and Peru, but with the introduction of new varieties of
the coca plant, Colombia has more than made up for major reductions
of coca growing in the neighboring countries. Moreover,
intelligence officials said that new refining techniques allow
Colombian traffickers to produce more cocaine from coca base than
before.
</P>
<P>
   While the CIA reported that Colombia grew 182 tons of coca in
1998, officials said the new study will show that it actually grew
a staggering 480 tons, or more than half the worldwide total, which
is not expected to rise significantly overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see any signs of an explosion,'' one official said.
Despite a surging cocaine market in Europe and the former Soviet
Union, he added: ``At some point, there has to be an issue of
supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defense officials are virtually uniform in their view that
the Colombian military should be strengthened. But many of them
have also been wary of a greater involvement _ both because of the
rebel target that a bigger U.S. military presence would represent,
and because of the stress that it would put on Pentagon resources.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many Defense Department officials who fear being
drawn more deeply into Colombia's civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on who you talk to; I am personally concerned about
that,'' one senior military official said. But he added: ``Here's
the dilemma: Do you just let them go down the tubes? That's not a
good scenario, either. It is far preferable for us to try to train
them and equip them than it is for American troops to ultimately
have to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first major draft of the administration's aid plan, put
forward last fall, officials proposed U.S. military training to
create six new special Colombian army battalions that could operate
against drug traffickers and the insurgents who support them.
</P>
<P>
   After objections by senior U.S. defense officials, the proposal
was scaled back to the creation of two new battalions over about an
eight-month period, administration officials said. The number of
U.S. military trainers in Colombia will not be significantly
increased, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pentagon officials said they are also concerned about the
single biggest piece of the aid package: more than 30 sophisticated
UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters being provided to the Colombian
military at a cost of more than $400 million. The aircraft, which
will remain State Department property, are not only extremely
expensive but will require extensive pilot training and cost tens
of millions of dollars to operate, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, law-enforcement officials have more strategic
concerns, officials said.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to repair a candidacy that she acknowledges
has stirred concern about her political skills and spirit, Hillary
Rodham Clinton says she is now prepared to press an aggressive
campaign against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the race for U.S.
Senate, drawing distinctions on issues ranging from school vouchers
to tax cuts, and arguing that Senate Republicans ``don't need any
more votes'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In her first extended interview devoted to her Senate candidacy,
just days before her official announcement Sunday afternoon,
Clinton took pains to present herself as a moderate Democrat. She
went out of her way to note her support for the death penalty,
welfare restrictions and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who unsuccessfully championed national health
care six years ago, asserted that ``there are no government
solutions'' to most problems facing the nation. And, sounding very
much like a new Westchester homeowner suffering from a case of
property-tax sticker shock, Clinton said she was stunned to
discover the tax burden faced by state residents.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would use her formal announcement speech _ in the
gymnasium at the State University of New York at Purchase _ to try
to offer voters an education about her personal background and
professional accomplishments. Her travels through New York since
last summer had convinced her, she said, that she had become
something of a caricature. That was partly because her own
accomplishments had been eclipsed by her husband's career, and by
her mostly self-imposed isolation in the White House, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, reprising what has been a recurrent theme in her public
life, Clinton also blamed conservative attacks _ ``the drum beat of
an ideology that is really being promoted at my expense,'' as she
put it _ for distorting the public's view of her.
</P>
<P>
   She made her remarks in an 80-minute interview with The New York
Times, conducted Thursday evening in her eighth-floor corner office
overlooking Madison Square Garden, accompanied by her press
secretary, Howard Wolfson. The interview came after what has proven
to be a difficult six-month introduction into electoral life and
New York politics for Clinton, who has been criticized for running
a clumsy, passive, unfocused and vague campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She did not quarrel with criticism of her campaign style. But in
outlining her plans as she moved into the next phase of the race,
she offered signs of a significant shift in her strategy. She said
she would be more aggressive in presenting her case while trying to
offer a fuller, and presumably more sympathetic, portrait of her
life and career.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, aides trucked in cartons filled with 400,000
eight-page leaflets, titled ``Hillary: The Real Story,'' that were
to be distributed across the state starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has probably been the biggest surprise to me in the last
six months,'' Clinton said. ``What I have found is that people
don't know anything, really, about the work that I did before Bill
was elected president. And know very little _ except about health
care _ about the work that I've done in the White House. It became
so apparent to me that in order to introduce myself to the voters
of New York, I was going to have to go back and really share a lot
of my lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview, she was relaxed and jaunty, laughing
even when asked whether she was concerned that her campaign might
be jeopardized by the impending report on her actions by an
independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, who is still investigating the
failed Whitewater land deal and her role in other matters, like the
firings of several employees in the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have hoped that this would have been concluded by now,
but apparently that is not the game plan,'' she said. ``And I guess
New Yorkers will have to judge that for what they think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to speculate on what Ray might find, or the subject
of the investigation, saying: ``It is hard to believe that after 6{
years, tens of thousands of documents, grand juries, testimonies,
committee hearings and everything that's gone on, that this could
not be brought to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's report is due to be issued in the middle of the campaign,
and since Clinton is promising now to be available more often in
news conferences and one-on-one interviews, it seems likely that
she will be forced to address these issues frequently in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, she also talked about her new life outside
the White House, though she still is not living full-time in her
$1.7 million house in Chappaqua. She described her first few weeks
as something of an adventure, noting that she had barely driven a
car, cooked a meal or gone shopping for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, pushing that cart through the supermarket, and
standing and talking to _ I had a long conversation about
clementines with the produce manager because it's been a long time
since I bought a crate of clementines,'' she said of a recent visit
to a Grand Union near her home on Old House Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, standing over in the dairy department trying to
decide what Skim Plus meant. Because, you know, I'd never seen Skim
Plus. And having a man come up to me and kind of do a double take
and kind of say, `Is that you?' and I said, `I guess so, it is me.'
It made me feel like I was re-entering the real world.''

</P>
<P>
   After months of generally avoiding direct engagement with
Giuliani and not offering many specific proposals of her own,
Clinton asserted that there were clear differences between them,
notwithstanding their agreement on a number of issues that
typically divide Democrats and Republicans, including support for
abortion rights and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even though Clinton went out of her way to complain
about the tax burden faced by Westchester homeowners, like herself
_ a complaint that has historically reaped dividends for
politicians running for office in Westchester _ she criticized
Giuliani for supporting the large tax cut pushed by Republicans in
Washington. Democrats have instead endorsed small, targeted tax
reductions in order to use some of the surplus for Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that education would be the main issue in the
campaign, a reflection of a series of polls that suggest that the
topic is the top concern of New York voters and a vulnerable
subject for her opponent. Clinton criticized Giuliani for
supporting school vouchers, which she argued would drain money from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said that she supported some forms of competency
testing for teachers and school standards for children. Asked
whether she supported merit pay, Clinton said she favored ``pay for
performance,'' which she said she would elaborate on in a speech
devoted to education in Syracuse on Tuesday as part of her
statewide tour this week. Clinton has the backing of the teachers
union and a sizable bloc of labor support, which Giuliani's aides
have suggested could undermine any of her efforts to effect real
school reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated that she would take the advice of some
Democrats and, in effect, nationalize her contest against Giuliani
by characterizing a vote for the mayor as a vote for a Republican
majority in the Senate. She went so far as to suggest that she
believed the Democrats could capture the Senate next year, a view
that is not shared by most political professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republicans need any more votes to block
campaign finance reform, or turn back the clock on our budget and
deficit policies, or to side with the majority of Republican
leadership on issues ranging from school vouchers to whether or not
we deal with health care in a step-by-step way to try to eventually
reach a goal of providing quality affordable health care for
everybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton seemed eager to hold Giuliani accountable for
the actions of fellow Republicans in Washington, she seemed
reluctant to grant him too much credit for changes that have taken
place in New York under his watch. Clinton said that much of the
credit for the drop in crime in the city was due to federal funding
for new police officers, and the policies of the former police
commissioner, William Bratton, who was appointed by Giuliani,
though the mayor has since had a falling out with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find me trying to claim that nothing good
has happened in New York,'' she said. ``I love New York City. I
mean, if I weren't excited about living in New York City and
excited about the quality of life here, I wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Clinton has told friends in recent weeks that she
has been startled by what she sees as the ferocity of some of the
coverage of her, and by the speed with which some of her earliest
supporters have retreated as her campaign seemed to stumble. She
made no such observations in the interview, though, and instead
praised the state's Democratic leaders and presented herself as a
candidate who had fallen more than once while climbing an unusually
sharp learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a candidate, and being a candidate in the toughest
political environment in America, which I don't think there's any
doubt about, is a real challenge,'' Clinton said, playing with a
pair of reading glasses and sipping a cappuccino as she settled
into a couch in the office she shares with her campaign manager,
Bill de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan to, in effect, reintroduce herself to voters _ her
aides view it as perhaps the the most important tasks facing her in
Sunday's speech and the weeks ahead _ is reminiscent of what her
husband did in the spring of 1992. He and his chief political
advisers, including Mrs. Clinton and Mandy Grunwald, who is working
for Mrs. Clinton in this campaign, wanted to blunt negative
portrayals of him as a draft-dodger and womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   In remaking his image, they recruited Linda Bloodworth-Thomason,
the Hollywood television producer, to create a biographical film
introducing Bill Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. Ms.
Bloodworth-Thomason has prepared a similar film to introduce
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   She and her advisers hope the film will help to rehabilitate her
own image and try to establish that she has accomplishments, as a
lawyer and an advocate for children, that are not dependent on her
husband's record.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that has been obscured, she said, by attacks on her and
the president. Asked if she still believed they were a target of a
``right-wing conspiracy,'' as she first volunteered when the Monica
Lewinsky scandal erupted, she said: ``If you look at the mailings
that all of these groups are sending out _ I don't know if they're
part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. But they are certainly part
of a broad network of people who are all aiming their ammunition
against me because I don't believe what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said many voters, particularly women, had unfavorable
views of her merely because they had superficial information about
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the small groups I've been meeting with _ primarily of
women _ a lot of women become very skeptical, because they have an
idea in my mind of what I am going to be like,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
``They think I must kind of be carried around in some kind of a
chariot, with liveried servants, or something. So when they meet
me, and we start talking about what life is like, and what my
experiences have been like, we have an immediate bond.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not dispute the lament of her supporters that she has
run a timid and unadventurous campaign. She said she had made a
calculated decision to hold back until she learned the terrain of a
state where she had never lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural conclusion for some people to draw because I
deliberately set out to listen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring, she added: ``Look. I've had to learn how
to be a candidate. This is not something that, you know, I woke up
in July and went to Senator Moynihan's farm and said, `Here I am,
world, I'm a great candidate!' I've had to learn a lot.''

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Peacekeepers clashed with Kosovo
Albanians for a second day Saturday in this town, firing percussion
grenades and tear gas to push back angry crowds from the bridge
that divides the city.
</P>
<P>
   Two Albanians and eight soldiers were reported wounded in the
clash as Albanian youths threw bottles and stones at troops
guarding the bridge. Police in riot gear with helmets and shields
reacted forcefully, advancing in formation, backed up by four Dutch
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Youths ran stumbling through the thick white smoke to get away.
At the height of the clash at 3 p.m., grenades exploded in rapid
succession, rattling nearby windows.
</P>
<P>
   At least two people, apparently wounded, were carried off by
friends. A local commander of the peacekeepers appealed for the
Albanians to end the protest. ``Please go away. This has been too
much already,'' he said, adding that eight peacekeepers had been
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The clash came after news of more Albanian casualties from
Thursday's night of violence on the northern, Serbian-dominated
side of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Albanians died as a result, U.N. officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One 46-year-old Albanian woman died in the hospital from her
wounds. Another Albanian woman was found by the U.N. police
Saturday morning, dead in her house, apparently as a result of the
Thursday night violence.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included an elderly couple, killed by gunshot wounds,
two women who were also shot dead, and three who died from grenade
attacks, one of them a 16-year-old youth. Six more are in the
hospital, two described as in serious condition.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday night passed without incident, with the city under strict
curfew, said Mario Morcone, the U.N. administrator of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies of German troops had been brought up from the
south of Kosovo and positioned in the north side of the city to
keep the peace, Morcone said. Belgian and Dutch troops had already
been brought into the city from their positions in the north of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 250 U.N. police officers are also stationed
in the area, and are still evacuating Albanians from the north
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good working relationship now'' between the
peacekeepers and the U.N. police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morcone watched the crowds fleeing from the tear gas from his
office window just above the bridge and expressed frustration that
months of hard work trying to bring the two communities together
had exploded in one night. He blamed extremists on both sides for
causing the trouble, which began, he said, with the rocket attack
Wednesday on a U.N. bus carrying Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know if it is a problem of ethnicity,'' he said.
``There are a few people from each community who do not want to
find an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The police were pursuing their investigation but had not yet
arrested anyone for the violence committed Thursday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say the Albanians want to push them out and cleanse
all of Kosovo of Serbs, he explained. The Albanians in the south
say the Serbs want to force out all of the Albanians left on the
north side, intimidating them and breaking into their apartments,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way is to marginalize the extremists,'' he said. ``We
must ensure the security of the Albanians in the north and of the
Serbs in their enclaves, but at the same time we must do work on
the political side,'' he said.

 &HT;    The new black initiative: Adding wealth to the cause
 &HT;    By Thomas D. Boston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America's record economic expansion has brought into
focus a new dimension of the struggle for civil rights and equality
for blacks in America _ how to achieve equity in the American
dream.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, civil rights leaders have sought racial parity
through fair employment and pay. But civil rights leaders are now
coming to grips with the sobering reality that a job is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   For those fortunate enough to be full participants in the new
information age economy, these are the best of times. But those on
the outside are being left in the dust. And one sure-fire way to be
left out, as strange as it might seem, is to rely exclusively on
job earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of that, the civil rights manifesto is shifting.
The battle cry now is wealth accumulation, or ``economic
emancipation'' as the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. and his son, U.S. Rep.
Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), describe it in their new book, ``It's
About the Money.'' It is one of several recent publications on
personal finance aimed at African-Americans. Other enlistees: The
NAACP has launched initiatives on Internet access and black
homeownership, and Black Enterprise magazine this year began a
``Black Wealth Initiative,'' urging its readers to sign and return
a pledge that is oriented toward personal wealth-building.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of color and the working poor have won everything
they've fought for,'' the Jacksons write. ``But we've not fought
the battle for access to and democratization of capital. We must
learn how to manage money and grow money in a capitalist society.
We must learn how to be owners and entrepreneurs, shareholders
rather than sharecroppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today most of the extreme vestiges of social and political
inequality have disappeared. But racial economic parity still
remains an enormous challenge. Until now, society has addressed
this economic challenge by focusing on employment and income. We
have created opportunities with two kinds of policies. First,
policies and programs have been developed that are designed to
improve the skills, education and job qualifications of blacks and
thereby increase the number available to work. The second approach
has centered on promoting economic growth policies designed to
boost the economy and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is now reasonable to assume that we have achieved about as
much black-white parity in employment and income as we can expect
through growth policies. After all, the current expansion, which
has lasted 107 months, is the longest on record. Therefore, it is
not likely that the economy can grow much faster or sustain itself
much longer without generating unacceptable levels of inflation.
The latest interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve that is
designed to slow the economy down proves this point.
</P>
<P>
   Growth policies have certainly achieved some measurable
successes. For example, in 1991 at the start of the current
economic expansion, unemployment among blacks was 12.5 percent.
Today it is 7.9 percent. Among whites, unemployment was 6.1 percent
at the start of the expansion. Today it is 3.5 percent. These are
the lowest rates of unemployment for both groups in more than 30
years. So the record economic expansion brought a decline in black
unemployment of 37 percent and a decline in white unemployment of
43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year economic expansion has also brought about a slight
improvement in black income relative to white income. For example,
in 1991, black median family income of $24,823 was 57 percent of
white family income of $43,525, according to the 1998 Economic
Report of the President to Congress. By 1996, black income of
$26,522 was 59 percent of white income.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on income and employment, the traditional measures
of economic well-being, we get one snapshot of the economic
landscape. But this picture is incomplete. This is because the
current economic expansion has brought about significant changes in
the distribution of income and wealth. The income and wealth gap
between the rich and poor has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals in upper-income brackets who own stock or
participate in tax-deferred retirement plans, as well as
individuals who are self-employed and those with college degrees
have benefited most by the booming economy. In fact, between 1989
and 1998, median income grew appreciably, but only for families
headed by college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Wealth or net worth is measured as total assets minus total
liabilities. Although income has grown by moderate amounts, the
booming stock market has caused a substantial rise in net worth. In
addition, employers have expanded their offerings of tax-deferred
retirement accounts and the emergence of Internet-based brokerage
services has made trading available to broad segments of the
population at reduced costs. Families who are well positioned to
take advantage of these developments have benefited significantly.
By contrast, those that are not well positioned have fallen further
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its enormous importance, wealth is an infrequently
measured index of economic well-being and is seldom used as the
basis for making policy changes. But issues such as mortgage
lending discrimination and equitable access to credit are growing
in importance because of their role in facilitating wealth
accumulation among blacks and other historically disadvantaged
groups.
</P>
<P>
   For all groups, the three most important components of household
wealth are housing equity, holdings of stocks and mutual funds and
private pension funds. In 1994, the latest year for which there is
detailed wealth data specifically comparing blacks and whites,
black median income was about 60 percent of white income, but black
wealth was only 17 percent of white wealth _ $59,826 vs. $10,000.
In addition, black-owned financial assets, which include items such
as checking and savings accounts, stocks and bonds and other
managed assets, were less than 1 percent of financial assets owned
by whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro's book, ``Black
Wealth/White Wealth,'' addressed this neglected dimension of racial
inequality. The Jacksons' book takes up the theme with an
individual plan of action for dealing with the issue. The Jacksons
explore the many roads to wealth-building, exploring such topics as
the prudent management of financial assets, homeownership,
retirement planning, entrepreneurship and the importance of
investing in human capital, meaning education and skills.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the issue of wealth inequality may well be one of the
toughest of all civil rights agendas. Further, the economy is
rewarding those with the skills required for the new information
age and the assets needed to take risks. At the same time, others
are being reshuffled from the sector of the economy where advanced
education and skills are in high demand to a secondary sector,
where high pay and other job-related amenities are usually lacking.
So while we celebrate the unprecedented performance of the economy,
we should not forget that the rising tide is not necessarily
lifting all boats.

 &HT;    Resources to help children appreciate other cultures
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What better time to teach your child about
diversity than Black History Month? In ``Becoming the Parent You
Want To Be'' (Broadway, $20), authors Laura Davis and Janis Keyser
have included an excellent chapter titled ``Preparing Children to
Live in a Richly Diverse World.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors encourage families to learn about their own cultural
identity as well as that of others.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their tips for helping children appreciate
others:
</P>
<P>
   _ Help your child meet all kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide images that reflect diversity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk about differences as well as similarities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Broaden your family's experiences by learning about the arts
and traditions from other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teach children that diversity applies to everyone, including
themselves. From another person's viewpoint, your children look
different, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work on your own appreciation of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work on your own prejudices. The Museum of Tolerance in Los
Angeles, an interactive museum that focuses on ending bias, has a
dramatic way of getting this across. There are two doors in front,
one says ``prejudiced'' and one says ``not prejudiced.'' The one
that says ``not prejudiced'' is locked.
</P>
<P>
   FOR YOUNG VICTIMS OF PREJUDICE
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen to the child talk about the hurt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give information. Tell your child that what happened is not
acceptable. Explain where teasing usually comes from: ``Sometimes
people say those things because they are afraid. They may have been
told that people who look different are scary or bad. That's not
true, and people who think that way are losing out. There are a lot
of friends they are going to miss having.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer support, action or protection. It is too much for
children to respond to discrimination alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speak up when you hear slurs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer a vision of social change.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invite children's initiative. ``Let's think about what you can
do if something like that ever happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   RECOMMENDED READING
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Grace's new book, ``A Shot of Loyalty'' (Your Books,
$5.95), is written for fifth- and sixth-graders. The theme is
girls' sports _ basketball and track.

 &HT;    Garth fans flock to Mets spring-training site for tickets
 &HT;    By Teresa Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ He's pudgy, balding and went 1-for-22 at
bat last spring, but make no mistake _ country music icon Garth
Brooks is drawing fans to spring baseball faster than
schoolchildren to a Pokemon critter.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who confirmed last week he'll work out with the New York
Mets during spring training in Port St. Lucie this year, is
expected to arrive with the other players on Feb. 20 and will go
everywhere the team goes. Fans hoping to get a close-up gander or
autograph should be in luck, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz says, since
Brooks was known for his devotion to fans during his first
major-league foray in Arizona last spring.
</P>
<P>
   At the Peoria, Ariz., spring-training stadium of the San Diego
Padres, observers say, the top-selling male vocalist of all time
(97 million albums sold) was often the first to enter and the last
to leave the stadium each day _ sometimes staying until 9 or 10
p.m. to sign autographs long after other players had departed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mets officials don't have an up-to-date count of ticket
sales this spring, one thing's for certain _ the Garth factor, as
one agent called it, is drawing 'em in like cowboys to a
10-gallon-hat giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's darling _ what a cutie,'' swooned Susan Bowne as she
waited in line to buy tickets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kinda swayed me to country music. I caught his concert in
Central Park on HBO and I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   A baseball player for his high school team in Yukon, Okla.,
Brooks _ who turns 38 Monday _ ran track in college but longed for
the crack of the major-league bat when he trained as a nonroster
player with the Padres. The Padres got plenty of exposure and
Brooks' reward was twofold: To live out a baseball fantasy and
raise money for his national children's charity, the Touch 'Em All
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mets third baseman Robin Ventura has been a major contributor to
the foundation and persuaded Brooks to consider training with the
Mets this spring, Horwitz said. In exchange for making a sizeable
contribution to the charity _ which Horwitz said will get exposure
in the New York market thanks to the Mets _ the team will bask in
the same limelight the Padres enjoyed last year. Fans couldn't be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter's a fan of Garth's, and she told her mother so her
mother told me, 'Get over there right away and buy tickets,'''
63-year-old Bill Jones of Port St. Lucie said Friday, less than 12
hours after the Garth news had been beamed into Amy Jones'
television set in Flemington, N.J. ``My daughter's going to make a
special trip down just to see Garth. She's followed him all over
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   According to county stadium manager Peter Keogh, Jones is not
alone. Since last Sunday, Mets phones and ticket booths _ which
typically have long lines only on the first day of sales _ were
jammed. Ticket agents said they haven't seen it so busy since the
stadium's debut in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phones have been tied up with calls from all over the
country, calls from people who are actually going to plan their
vacations around a ballgame,'' said Keogh, himself a devoted Brooks
fan. ``It's turned into quite a happening and we're very excited
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brooks was known to hold some impromptu concerts after
exhibition games in Arizona, Horwitz doesn't expect that to happen
in Port St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll just be playing ball like all the other players,''
Horwitz said. ``He takes ground balls and bus trips and he won't be
taking practice time away from any of the roster players. There's B
games and other ways of working him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and business leaders hope Brooks' presence will
inject life into a baseball stadium that could lose its
major-league team in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks arrived in Peoria in a rented Ford Explorer each morning
and had nary a bodyguard as he drove to and from the stadium, Keogh
said.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects Brooks will rent a home in the exclusive gated
community of The Reserve, where several Mets have winter homes and
is only a few minutes' drive from the Thomas J. White Stadium in
St. Lucie West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking for ways to make the Mets more fan-friendly
and here they are bringing in the most popular male singer in
history,'' Keogh said. ``That's a great gesture in my opinion.''

 &HT;    Mobile longs for cruises
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ Just off the eastern end of Dauphin Street, this
port city's version of the French Quarter _ complete with shops,
art galleries and restaurants trimmed by forest green wrought iron
_ barber Bob Williamson sits in the back of his shop on a lazy
morning, quietly prying the posts out of his silver metal
watchband.
</P>
<P>
   On the waterfront just a few blocks away, a freighter glides
through the Mobile River to the Alabama State Docks.
</P>
<P>
   The sleepy pace has continued for decades in this city of
azaleas and magnolias, which lets down its hair once a year for
Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happens quickly in Mobile,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   To help quicken its economic pulse, business leaders are
aggressively promoting the downtown water district as a home port
for cruise ships. If its pitch is successful, Mobile, an occasional
layover stop for ships such as the Regal Empress, would become a
Gulf Coast launching spot for cruises to the Caribbean and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep putting the pressure on cruise lines to make some
commitments,'' said Brenda Scott, chief executive officer of the
Mobile Convention &AMP; Visitors Corp. ``There's a lot of ships coming
out and they want their share of the market. ... We present to them
potentially new passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, strip malls and the suburbs sapped downtown's
business heartbeat.Storefronts stood empty, decorated only by real
estate signs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, downtown slowly has climbed back. A South
Beach theme club failed. But sports bars abound near New
Orleans-style cafes and Royal Barbers, owned by Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, government workers and lawyers fill restaurant
tables. Conventioneers pack hotels. But the weekend still belongs
to the beaches and the chain restaurants _ not to home-grown shops
like Williamson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile's a certain size where we're trying to get to the next
level,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Money-toting passengers aboard vast cruise ships could give
downtown the boost it seeks. Typical passengers have a household
income of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in the southwest corner of Alabama between the beaches of
Pensacola, Fla., and the casinos in Biloxi, Miss., Mobile sits
along Interstate 10 and I-65.
</P>
<P>
   There's a potential market estimated at 26 million people. With
at least a dozen daily flights every day from Hartsfield
International, Atlanta figures to be a large market if the ships
eventually do berth here.
</P>
<P>
   Based on current orders for new ships, the Caribbean cruise
market will expand by 56 percent in the next five years, a South
Florida trade group estimates. If chosen, Mobile would offer
service now primarily available at home ports in Miami and Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Mobile officials have spent nearly $300,000 in the
last three years recruiting ships.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are hopeful of a formal agreement by year's end. That
means the earliest a ship could dock would be 2001. Mobile has
scouted waterfronts in Charleston, S.C., and Baltimore as potential
models for a Water Street makeover. Among the current anchors are
the Adams Mark Hotel, an Imax theater and a convention center.
``The idea is just to get more people here,'' said Al St. Clair,
Mobile's director for downtown redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Big E's sandwich shop sits on Dauphin Street, right next to Boo
Radley's, a restaurant named for a mysterious character in the
novel ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   Big E's owner, Ed Coffee, always had wanted his own business. In
1998, the lease price for the two-story brick building with an
awning that covers plastic green porch furniture in front was just
too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched downtown go from something dilapidated to
something nice,'' Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   The business lunch crowd has been strong enough to keep Coffee
from advertising. E's is open 8 a.m.-2 p.m. Mondays through
Saturdays, but Coffee would love to serve his soups, salads and
sandwiches from 7 to 7 every day. He would love the jolt of tourism
that comes from cruise lines.

 &HT;    The Peanuts gallery
 &HT;    Compiled by Leigh-Ann Jackson, Blanca Madriz and Jeff Salamon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When a strip has been around as long as Peanuts,
and appeared in so many languages in so many media, it will touch a
staggering variety of lives. Below, a diverse crew of people from
many walks of life discuss Peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 26 years that I've been on television, (Peanuts)
has given me more introductions to sermons than probably any single
entity. I try to use up-to-date things to interest people in the
messages, and Mr. Schulz _ being a Christian _ has been able to
distill Christian theology into practical everyday living, and he
does it not only in a humorous way, but in a manner that everyone
will understand.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rev. Harold O'Chester is host of ``Great Hills Baptist
Church Hour'' on KVUE-24
</P>
<P>
   When my baby was born, he was all head. And it reminded me first
off of Charlie Brown and how appealing the shape of his head is.
Everybody loves babies, and I thought Charles Schulz drew Charlie's
head that way on purpose to remind everyone of babies ... (One day
we went to the ice skating rink he owns in Santa Rosa, Calif., and)
we saw this white-haired gentlemen sit down by the fireplace at a
table that had been marked 'reserved.' They brought him tea and a
sugar cookie. I'd never seen Schulz before, but I knew it was him.
I couldn't believe it. He just looked like a gentleman. He was very
polite when I went over and talked to him. He invited my wife and
me to sit down, and we talked to him for almost an hour. He's very
polite, but he's also very sad and bitter. Schulz thinks that
everyone has forgotten him. He said to me, 'Editors don't even read
my strips,' because they didn't notice a rerun he dedicated to his
daughter on her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Collier's work will appear in the forthcoming ``Comix
2000'' collection from
</P>
<P>
   L'Association/Fantagraphics Books
</P>
<P>
   I just think it's been the heart and soul of our newspapers for
the past 50 years ... I was knocked out by it the first time I saw
it as a kid and from that day, I just wanted to be a cartoonist.
Now that I'm actually doing a strip, I'm even more knocked out
because I've realized it's not the easiest job!
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrick McDonnell's Mutts appears every Sunday in the Austin
American-Statesman
</P>
<P>
   My impression of Peanuts is that it is cross-cultural,
cross-ethnic and cross-racial, because all of us grew up with
little boys and little girls like Lucy and Charlie Brown and Linus.
I was the Linus in my group; I had a mean older sister ... We'll
miss Schulz. If you wanted to remember the way things were when you
were a little boy or a little girl, Peanuts will give you a great
way to remember.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gus Garcia has never brought a security blanket to an Austin
City Council meeting
</P>
<P>
   When I was in fourth grade we were looking at a Peanuts strip in
class in some Weekly Reader thing, and during the discussion of it
the teacher, Mrs. Halpern, kept calling Shermie ``Schroeder'' by
mistake, and it was driving me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   I raised my hand to correct her (I was a know-it-all even then)
and surprised myself and the class by vomiting all over my desk.
The teacher then walked me to the bathroom and I threw up again on
her red high-heeled shoes. It was those fat, short macaroni noodles
from the school cafeteria that day.
</P>
<P>
   My mom came to pick me up and yelled at me in the car for
throwing up in front of ``all those poor kids.''
</P>
<P>
   I never got to correct the mistake about Shermie.
</P>
<P>
   Damn.
</P>
<P>
   _ A collection of Tony Millionaire's comic strip Maakies will be
published by Fantagraphics Books in May
</P>
<P>
   Do you know who I love? I love Peppermint Patty. I love her
Birkenstocks, I love that she's butch, I love that she's her own
person. My middle name is Patty. I know I get accused of being a
narcissist, but why else do we like art except that we feel a
personal connection? If I was a Peanuts character, that's who I'd
be. I could watch the Peanuts Christmas Special every year _ and
I'm not big on the Hallmark cards or the sappy sentimental stuff _
but every year when they stand around the tree and they sing the
song _ I could cry just remembering that... It just captures that
thing in life that genuinely is so important to me. I never thought
I had strong feelings about Peanuts, but I realize that they've
literally been a part of my life, my whole life, ever since I could
look at a newspaper. They're kind of like the Kennedys and if
something happens to the Peanuts, like with Charles Schulz's
retiring, that really impacts us all on some level.

   Mr. Lunch is based on our dog of the same name, but I do admit
that Snoopy was somewhere in my subconscious. I remember at the
time I started with Mr. Lunch, Snoopy was flying around on the
blimp outside my studio window. I promised myself then to never let
Mr. Lunch shill for some massive insurance concern.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Charles Schulz and the Peanuts gang are as much a part of the
American psyche as baseball, mom and apple pie. I count myself
among the millions of Americans who will miss the humor and subtle
brilliance of Linus, Lucy, Snoopy and Charlie Brown.

 &HT;    Scary yarn hails from the (back of) beyond
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They see dead people.
</P>
<P>
   Does that line sound familiar? It should. That hypnotic kid from
``The Sixth Sense'' has nothing on a group of misfits with
extrasensory abilities in ``The Others,'' NBC's promising new
supernatural drama.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to brazenly rip off a horror film, it might as
well be the most successful horror film of all time. Surprisingly,
NBC gets it right. ``The Others'' is downright spooky,
thought-provoking and mesmerizing. Too bad it's buried in a lousy
time slot. Heck, ticked-off spirits have a better chance of being
found than ``The Others.'' Let's hope viewers do find it, however.
This compelling drama deserves to become a hit.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's creepy opener, Marian (``One True Thing's''
Julianne Nicholson) is a waifish college student who learns she has
a ``fearsome'' talent. After moving into the same dorm room where a
young woman died, Marian keeps seeing the girl _ now a dripping wet
corpse in need of a serious sun tan. There she is, in Marian's bed,
in her bathtub and dancing with her at parties. That sure can put a
cramp in a girl's style, can't it?
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a spooked Marian reluctantly joins the Others, an
oddball group of people with unique paranormal talents. There's a
hunky medical intern (Gabriel Macht) who can sense other people's
feelings; a grumpy blind guy (John Aylward) with a heightened sixth
sense; a homeless man (Kevin J. O'Connor) who can see things that
aren't there; and a New Age psychic (Melissa Crider).
</P>
<P>
   The leader is Elmer (Bill Cobbs), a famed 83-year-old medium
who'll demand your attention whenever he's on screen.
</P>
<P>
   The group members basically act like paranormal detectives. They
investigate haunted houses and solve mysteries from beyond the
grave. If there's something strange, going on over here, who ya
gonna call? Theeeee Others!
</P>
<P>
   While tonight's more sinister episode boasts impressive
``X-Files''-like production values (you know, dimly-lit alleys,
ominous blue lighting streaming through windows), an upcoming
installment about a woman who loses her husband and baby in a car
crash takes an unexpected, thoughtful turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Others'' is blessed with a first-rate cast, led by Cobbs
as the world-weary medium who's ready for his journey to the other
side and Nicholson as the freaked-out gifted student.
</P>
<P>
   The series also boasts top-notch talent behind the camera.
Former ``X-Files'' vets Glen Morgan and James Wong _ they wrote
some of that series' best episodes _ are executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   We already know the characters on ``The Others'' can see dead
people. Let's hope they'll see good ratings, too.

 &HT;    Crooner Damone always had the `pipes' - and still does
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Vic Damone steps into the courtyard of
his lushly landscaped home in Palm Beach, extends a warm greeting
and invites you to sit down for a light lunch. You're armed with a
list of tough questions _ about his good buddy Frank Sinatra, his
failed marriages to actress Pier Angeli and singer Diahann Carroll,
his decision to turn down a role in the Mafia epic ``The
Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, he's got a request: ``Let's say a little prayer
here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly what you'd expect from an Italian-American
crooner (real name: Vito Farinola) who grew up on the mean streets
of Brooklyn, followed the path of his idol Sinatra and recorded
some 2,000 songs in the course of a still-active 53-year career.
Where's the slick attitude?
</P>
<P>
   If there's any, Damone is putting it on hold until after grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Lord, for all your blessings,'' he starts, holding
your hand with paternal care. His wife of the past two years,
fashion designer Rena Rowan, puts her portable phone aside and
takes part in the quiet moment of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first of many surprises during the course of a two-hour
conversation. On a chilly January afternoon, the sweater-clad
Damone talks about his shopping expeditions to Costco, his
promising second career as an inventor, his devout Baha'i faith and
his possible retirement from the concert stage.
</P>
<P>
   The latter comes as the biggest shock: At a time when so many
vocal legends have departed or faded away _ Sinatra, Dean Martin,
Mel Torme _ Damone is among the last of a dying breed. Unlike the
overhyped Tony Bennett, whose voice is a shadow of its former self,
Damone can still sing: Listen to his most recent release, a
three-CD set on Reader's Digest Music called ``The Legendary Vic
Damone,'' and the baritone is smooth and assured. Why quit when
you're at the top of your game?
</P>
<P>
   At first, Damone stumbles for an answer, noting his other
business interests and saying ``the venues aren't there like they
used to be.'' Then, he cuts to the heart of the matter: ``I just
think it's an age of mediocrity right now. There isn't the kind of
pride in our business like there used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   DAMONE'S NOT A CURMUDGEON
</P>
<P>
   It could be an old man's lament, but Damone, 71, doesn't come
off like a curmudgeon. He's a guy who wears his age well, right
down to his delicately combed gray hair and perfectly creased tan
slacks. But in another sense, he's very much a relic of a bygone
cool-cat era: He still refers to his wife as ``babe'' and shows his
approval with a wink and a finger cocked in your direction like a
gun finding its target. Even if Damone isn't all show-business
bluster, he's still a showman: The spirit of the Rat Pack lives in
Palm Beach County, Damone's home for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Why not New York or Los Angeles? ``I came here to be near my
family,'' Damone says, noting a contingent of sisters,
brothers-in-law, nieces and nephews, all of whom reside in Broward
County. Damone has a couple of places in New Jersey and Santa Fe he
shares with Rowan, his fifth wife. But he's clearly most at ease in
Palm Beach: The rich, relaxed lifestyle suits his taste, even if
he's just as likely to head to the other side of the Intracoastal
in search of a good Italian restaurant. (He won't let you print the
names of his favorite places, fearing they'll become too popular.)
And then there's his golf game: Although he moved a couple of years
ago out of his Palm Beach Gardens home overlooking a golf course _
too many stray balls kept finding their way into his pool _ he
still plays whenever he can. His handicap? An impressive nine.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Damone's first priority is still the voice. He's
always been a singer who's gotten by on the sheer texture of his
instrument: Sinatra had the phrasing, Bennett had the
sophistication, but Damone had the best ``pipes,'' as Ol' Blue Eyes
once described it. For much of his career, that was enough. But in
the last couple of decades, he's dug a little deeper. ``I think he
had a more laid-back personality, and for that reason, he didn't
emerge until later in life,'' explains Jenny Hudson, who produced
the Reader's Digest set.
</P>
<P>
   Damone says it was a matter of growing into the music.
``(Sinatra) used to say to me, `You must use emotional memory. You
must use something in your life that affected you that would fit
the story of the song,''' he recalls. ``And now I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that his repertoire has changed. Damone still swears
allegiance to the music of Broadway and the big-band era, the
so-called American standard: A typical program will include such
classics as ``April in Paris,'' ``On the Street Where You Live,''
``You Made Me Love You'' and ``S'Wonderful.'' As for anything after
that period, it's more miss than hit: He'll sing a couple of
Beatles tunes, but he still complains about the band's haircuts.
Mention the name of folk great Pete Seeger and he draws a blank.
And don't even bring up the pop stars of the past couple of
decades, particularly anyone who's won a Grammy: He's still
smarting from not being nominated for the Reader's Digest set.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that group Vanilla Manilla? (Milli Vanilli.) They
didn't even go to the studio and record the songs. It's all full of
crap,'' he says, before quickly apologizing for his bluntness.
(''That's Brooklyn coming out of me,'' he adds.) As for Tony
Bennett's success with the Generation X crowd, Damone attributes it
to shrewd marketing, but says that approach would kill him: ``He's
working 300 one-nighters a year ... I feel sorry for him.''
Damone's schedule, by contrast, is a more modest 15-25 weeks on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   PERRY COMO INSTRUMENTAL
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Damone has paid his dues. The only son of a
piano-teaching mother and an electrician father, Damone went to
work when he was still in high school. With an eye on a singing
career, he started as an usher at New York's Paramount Theatre. The
legend goes that one night he stopped Perry Como on the elevator,
asked him if he could sing a few bars of a song and when he
finished, Como responded, ``You've really got something, kid.'' To
this day, the two have remained friends _ and neighbors. (Como
lives in Jupiter.)
</P>
<P>
   With Como's vote of confidence, Damone made his radio debut in
1947 and was an Arthur Godfrey talent-scout winner soon thereafter.
Milton Berle helped arrange his first nightclub gig _ at the famed
La Martinique. A short career in the movies followed, including
roles in ``Kismet,'' ``Deep in My Heart'' and ``Hit the Deck.''
Damone admits he could have done better as an actor, but didn't try
hard enough. ``I was out there (in California) to play golf and go
out with the starlets,'' he says. He regrets not following his
friend Sinatra's example: ``He used to hang out with all the stars
_ Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall _ and ask them questions ... If I
had to do it all over again, I would have really studied it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Damone was pressed to find a middle ground between
his brand of traditional pop and the chart-topping genre of rock.
He recorded a version of the Tom Jones hit ``It's Not Unusual,''
but then drew the line with his record company. ``I said, `You
can't order me to sing,''' he recalls. RCA Victor tore up his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the story doesn't end there. Damone insists he's never
wanted for work _ and his core audience has never abandoned him. He
even turned down the opportunity to play the singer Johnny Fontaine
in Francis Ford Coppola's first installment of ``The Godfather'' _
the part ended up going to Al Martino _ because he couldn't spare
the 10 weeks for filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it's only one page of dialogue, but they said with
Marlon Brando, they have to go when he feels like shooting, so you
have to sit there and wait,'' Damone recalls. Given that they were
offering him only $400 a week, barely enough to meet his alimony
payments, he passed.
</P>
<P>
   SINGER: `I'M A ROMANTICIST'
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and about alimony: It's true Damone has had his share of
wives. ``I'm a romanticist, what can I tell you?'' he said. He
recounts how he tried unsuccessfully to patch up his differences
with Angeli (wife No. 1), using his newfound Baha'i faith as his
guide (although raised a Catholic, Damone was introduced to the
Middle Eastern religion by a member of his band 40 years ago).
``People talk about how my first wife died from an overdose, but
nobody knows she remarried after me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's on to Carroll (wife No. 4), whom Damone met during a
1984 concert date in Palm Beach, of all places. The partnership
lasted a decade, and, by press accounts, it was a bumpy-road affair
from the start. Damone partly blames the marriage's demise on the
couple's different views about their craft. ``Her whole life is
show business and with me, it isn't,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Damone isn't kidding. In the past few years, he's devoted more
and more time to his other passion: inventing. He holds patents on
a range of gizmos, from a wrist guard he claims helps prevent
carpal tunnel syndrome to a car safety device that connects your
horn to your headlights, so that a hearing-impaired driver will
still sense your presence. (''This has already saved me four or
five accidents,'' he says.) He's even created a money clip that
doubles as a key holder, after he kept losing his keys on the golf
course. The business ventures have yet to take off, but he's barely
begun the marketing phase.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is confident that he will succeed. ``He's very logical.
He puts things where they belong,'' says Rowan, who met Damone a
few years ago when she hired him to appear at a benefit for the
homeless. Having idolized the singer when she was much younger _
``I said you can have Frank Sinatra. I'll take Vic Damone'' _ she
could barely believe it when he asked her out for a date. ``When my
housekeeper told me Vic Damone called, I said `That's right. And
tomorrow it will be Robert Redford.'''
</P>
<P>
   A CAREER _ AND NORMAL LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Damone's life today is very much a work in progress. He's got
his business interests, his golf game and, most important of all,
his wife and family (he has four children from his previous
marriages _ and five grandchildren). He's also got time for the
occasional bargain shopping trip to Costco. (''Hey, you don't throw
money away,'' he says.) And he's got his faith. ``He gets that
peace within him from that religion,'' says Lou Cammarata, a close
friend and retired oil broker who lives in Palm Beach Gardens.
``I've never seen anyone that can be so focused.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Damone also has the most precious of
commodities: his voice. What he chooses to do with it remains the
toughest decision ahead. ``I figured before I retire, let me do one
more here,'' he says of this weekend's round of dates, which will
be attended by many friends and family members. He winks and points
a finger in your direction. The showman still lives.

 &HT;    Lessons of acceptance learned at an early age
 &HT;    can help break circle of prejudice
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Rebecca Cress-Ingebo was at a restaurant with
friends when she spotted four people having a business lunch
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person was Hispanic, one was African-American, one was
Asian and one was white,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our future,'' the woman remembers thinking to herself.
``We are the first country in the world to try and embrace all
these nationalities. To be an effective person you have to be able
to accept different kinds of people _ not just on a surface level
but from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson her social-worker parents passed on to her and
that she's transmitting to her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Cress-Ingebo says that lesson must begin at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is very exciting, but it can be threatening if it's
superimposed after children have formed their core values,'' she
says. ``It should be a gentle exposure throughout their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Her military family has lived in Miami and in Europe. It
regularly hosted international students, has been involved with
Liederkranz Turner and sister-city activities, and eats at ethnic
restaurants where different languages are spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``To broaden your perspective you have to have friends from
different religions and races,'' she says. ``My children try to
reach out to students at their school who are studying English as a
second language.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Varga, a nationally known educator who's been guiding
youngsters at Gloria Dei Montessori school in Dayton for more than
35 years, believes teaching children to understand and appreciate
differences is the best way to prepare them to deal with change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with television and the Internet and travel, it's even
more important for children to understand that there is commonality
among all people, and yet there are cultural differences,'' she
says. ``That kind of understanding is important for the development
of world peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Grace, a Beavercreek author whose books for young people
reflect diverse cultures, says her family moved nine times in 20
years. That experience has been a positive one for her two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Antonio, which has a big Hispanic community, the
children learned all about the fiestas, and there's even a day off
school to go to fiesta,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When stereotypes are portrayed in the movies or on television,
be the first to tell your children that people should not be
depicted that way and that it is a false portrayal of a group of
people,'' she advises.
</P>
<P>
   Varga says adults should pay attention to the verbal and
nonverbal messages they communicate to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to pass our own prejudices or rigid thinking on
to our children,'' she says. ``We can have enough respect for our
kids to know that it's not an attitude that will serve them in the
present or in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents can begin by teaching children that something is not bad
or strange just because it's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respond to differences with wonder and curiosity,'' she
advises.

 &HT;    Choice - even on abortion - central to Bible message
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ All Republican candidates for president
are vehemently anti-abortion. They intentionally cater to the
powerful conservative Christian vote. But the truly Christian
position demands choice.
</P>
<P>
   Those politicians _ and many Christians _ would restrict
options. God insists on them.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christian conservatives want everyone, by force of law, to
behave the way they think we should. But Jesus always gave his
followers enough rope to hang themselves. Judas did. Peter nearly
did.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, John McCain, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes each
try to out-shout the other to demonstrate the depth of their
Christian-based anti-abortion stance. They may grasp the political
landscape, but they don't understand their own faith.
</P>
<P>
   Choice, decisions and responsibility are at the heart of the
Biblical message. To be sure, the Bible is filled with laws and
commandments, but never does it imply that God wants to remove the
individual's responsibility to choose to obey them _ or not.
</P>
<P>
   The great prophets of the Hebrew Scripture constantly scolded
Israel as a stubborn people always making the wrong decisions. But
they never suggested the people should be denied that choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian New Testament even more adamantly insists on the
faithful's responsibility to decide between good and evil, God and
mammon, Jesus and other messiahs.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Christians demand that new converts ``make a
decision for Christ.'' But they often then deny them the freedom to
make other choices. Are they unable to trust their colleagues to do
the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   Mature Christians make decisions. Some commit sin in doing so.
But sin is not the critical problem. Slavery is.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars of the early church wrestled with the question of free
will and the problem of God's will interfering with it. They almost
always embraced the idea of free will.
</P>
<P>
   God limits his own sovereignty to give us freedom, they argued.
If we are to truly love God, we must have the opportunity not to
love God. If we are to truly follow God's way, we must have the
freedom to go another.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is always a sad, sometimes tragic and occasionally evil
decision whether it is contrary to God's will or not. The Bible is
silent on God's mind in that. Nor does the Bible have a medically
accurate comment on when life begins. We must decide.
</P>
<P>
   For many who do make the choice, abortion, for them, is the
least onerous of the hard options they face.
</P>
<P>
   God will not, and the state should not, make those decisions for
them. Both Christianity and the American tradition of individual
responsibility encourage us to do that.
</P>
<P>
   A line in an old advertisement urging people to go to church
says, ``Christ died to take away your sins, not your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   God wants us to use our mind making decisions. He no doubt weeps
at many of them. But God is patient.
</P>
<P>
   And he insists we choose.

   FEDBUD-DEBT _ WASHINGTON _ Not so long ago, it seemed hard to
imagine how this country would pay off the federal debt. When
President Clinton submits his budget to Congress on Feb. 7, though,
it will contain a plan for paying off the publicly held portion of
that debt _ some $3.3 trillion _ by 2013. That, says Clinton, would
be a stunning achievement that would dramatically change the
country's economic landscape for a generation to come. How,
precisely, would the plan work? Who would get paid, where would the
money come from and what impact would it have on the economy? And
why do some economists _ and some Republicans _ say that paying off
the debt might not be wise? (Deans, Cox News Service).

AN OUTCAST IN IRAN DARES TO TELL HIS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ But for his battered brown brogues, Hossain
Khorram might never have told his story. But there was something in
the overstretched, heavily scuffed leather of his shoes, and the
back seams held together with string, that suggested that the
heavyset Khorram, quietly sipping tea in an artists' workshop in
old Tehran, was harshly down on his luck.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry about the shoes opened the way to a riches-to-rags
tale. Khorram, 53, said they were a hand-lasted pair that he had
bought for $400 more than 20 years ago in London and wore still
because his monthly income as a free-lance evaluator of paintings,
ancient scripts and other antiquities rarely exceeded $300, and in
many months amounted to nothing. On that, he said, he could barely
afford food for his family, much less new shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, the brogues were the only thing left from
his days of wealth, before the Islamic revolution in 1979 cast
power to the mullahs, or Muslim clerics, who remain Iran's rulers
today. In the blood bath that followed the overthrow of Shah
Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, before dawn on May 9, 1979, Khorram's
father, Rahim Ali Khorram, an immensely rich contractor who built
roads and airports for the government, and used his 2,000-man work
force as a political shock force in support of the shah, was
executed by firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening lengthened, Hossain Khorram's reminiscences
became, in a way, a parable of modern Iran. The story he told in
the workshop, and over supper later in his cramped three-room
apartment in a working-class district of south Tehran, was one of
Shakespearean proportions, of how Iran's once-powerful fell from
grace, and the once-powerless rose to supplant them. But it seemed,
just as much, a warning for the mullahs, who face a popular
challenge now that in many ways is as serious as the one that
toppled the shah.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, and in a second round of voting in March, the
clerical establishment will face its sternest challenge yet when
the country's 30 million voters go to the polls in a parliamentary
election. If the reformers, led by Muslim clerics, can overcome the
disqualification of hundreds of reform candidates and obtain a
majority in the 290-seat legislature, they could break the
hard-liners' stranglehold on power by passing new laws that would
move Iran toward greater democracy and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians, including Khorram, think that could be the
beginning of the end for clerical rule. ``The mullahs promised the
poor the world _ free electricity, free transportation, a dividend
for every family from the country's oil wealth _ and what did they
get? Nothing, in fact worse than nothing,'' he said. ``There are
millions who have no jobs, and those who do have to take two or
three jobs to survive. Is it any wonder people say the mullahs are
finished?''
</P>
<P>
   That Khorram dared to speak up, and allow a Western reporter to
quote him, is a measure of how Iran is changing. Not long ago,
anybody with his troubles would have been well advised to stay
silent. For more than 20 years, as one of Iran's new dispossessed,
he has been stripped of his civil rights, rebuffed by a bureaucracy
entrusted with restoring the assets of members of the old ruling
class, and barred from traveling outside Iran or getting a
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   But the winds of change are blowing through Iran, and the clergy
are bending with them. While the courts continue to imprison
dissident clerics, editors and other activists in an attempt to
blunt the popular clamor, many Iranians are speaking up, in ways
harshly uncomplimentary to the mullahs. Increasingly, too, there is
defiance of the social and moral rigidities imposed by the clerical
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class women think little of attending dinners in
figure-hugging dresses and fashionably streaked hair, covering
themselves with cloaks and head scarves only in public. Love
affairs outside marriage, in theory punishable by death, are
increasingly common in the wealthy suburbs of north Tehran. Alcohol
is widely available. A common theory is that the mullahs care less
about how Iranians behave privately since they are forced to care
more about holding on to power.
</P>
<P>
   In taking advantage of the new mood, Khorram is hardly
impartial. In 1979, the mullahs, declaring his father ``an enemy of
God'' and guilty of widespread corruption in his business dealings
with the shah, seized everything his family owned. This included
the construction company, a Tehran amusement park, several
mansions, dozens of bank accounts, and a collection of priceless
Persian carpets, old European furniture, paintings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   His father's execution was crueler by far. Khorram, quoting
prison guards, said Rahim Khorram, 56, suffered a fatal heart
attack when he was taken before the two mullahs acting as his
judges to hear his sentence after a five-minute trial, but was
dragged to the execution ground anyway. ``The mullahs said, `It
doesn't matter, the sentence must be carried out anyway,''' Khorram
recalled. ``So they dragged him out to the execution ground and
fired three shots into his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, the younger Khorram, in the first of several
periods in prison, was himself led out across the cobblestones,
blindfolded, and placed before a firing squad. But the fusillade
turned out to be blanks, the ``execution'' an amusement for the
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, tears well up in his eyes when he recalls
what he saw as he walked back to the cell. ``There were four other
men who were taken out there with me, and they weren't so lucky,''
he said. ``Their blood was flowing across the cobblestones.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Khorram said, Iranians had reasons to be disenchanted
with the shah, considering how the old ruling class lived. For 16
years, until he was 26 and returned to Iran to help run his
father's businesses, Khorram was educated at Swiss boarding
schools, and at a university in Zurich, where he earned an
engineering degree. He toured Europe with his brothers, Gholam
Reza, now 46, and Ali, now 42, spending part of a monthly allowance
of about $25,000 gambling _ and losing _ in the Monte Carlo casino.
Both brothers now in Tehran and are virtually penniless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rich man's boy, without any worries,'' he said. ``But
in the shah's time there were many who couldn't eat. Iranians
stopped loving him because he lost contact with them. In the end,
he cared so little for the people who supported him, like my father
and General Nassiri'' _ Nematollah Nassiri, the shah's childhood
friend who headed the secret police _ ``that he left without
ordering them released from prison, where he'd sent them to appease
the mobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Khorram speaks of his experiences without self-pity, but
his voice falters when he speaks of finding a way out of penury
that offers his wife, Mekhri, 38, herself the daughter of a once
well-connected family that came on hard times, and the couple's
daughter, Jayran, and son, Salar, 3, a better future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken away from me the smallest thing a man can hope
for, the chance to build a future for my children,'' he said, as
his daughter sat beside him on the arm of a sofa, her arm around
her father's neck. ``All I ask is a chance to build a future for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mullahs, Khorram believes that whatever happens in
the parliamentary election, their days in power were numbered from
early on in the revolution, when they, like the shah, lost their
connection to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, people have been comparing their lives under the
mullahs to life under the shah and saying, `The dictatorship of the
boots was better than the dictatorship of the slippers,''' he said.
``It's too late for me, but perhaps for my children's generation,
who will have learned not to mix politics and religion, there can
be a renaissance for Iran.''

 &HT;    Trade rumors continue to swirl around Hasek
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dominik Hasek's absence from today's All-Star Game
because of a recurring groin tear has not cooled speculation about
his future. Fact is, rumors are more rampant than ever. Hasek, who
returned to make 29 saves in a 2-2 tie against Anaheim, says he
doesn't know when or if he can play again this season. There is
increasing speculation, fueled by Hasek's hedging on retirement
plans, that the goalie and his agent, Rich Winter, are trying to
force a trade out of Buffalo. When Hasek was asked if he had
informed the Sabres of his plans, he said he didn't think they
cared. Of course, that couldn't be further from the truth. When
healthy, Hasek is the best player in hockey. Further, if Hasek does
plan to continue his career, the Sabres have major decisions to
make. They don't want to lose rookie Martin Biron in the expansion
draft. So they would need to either protect both (likely leading to
losing two other players) or deal Hasek. General manager Darcy
Regier has said that would never happen. But Hasek could put the
team in a difficult position. And if another team is willing to
part with high draft picks and/or players for the playoff stretch,
it might be worth it for the Sabres, who aren't going anywhere this
season, anyway. Philadelphia and Los Angeles, big-market teams
looking for stability in goal, reportedly have made inquiries about
Hasek. Stay turned for next week's rumor.
</P>
<P>
   A SLOW BURNS
</P>
<P>
   Boston coach Pat Burns can only hope last week represented the
worst week of his career. If he had any more problems, he would be
making sock puppets right now. It started when Bruins owner Jeremy
Jacobs stunned everybody by making this declaration in the Boston
Globe: ``I think the players are better than they have played. I
think our team has been managed well by Harry (Sinden) and Mike
(O'Connell), but our coaching has not been what I think it should
be. I think our coaches need to do a better job.'' Jacobs also was
upset because he recently had the coaches and players to his house
in West Palm Beach when the team was in Florida, and one player was
quoted anonymously in the Boston Herald, saying, ``The guy
nickel-and-dimed us and we all get to go see how rich he is.''
More? The Bruins suspended Joe Murphy after he yelled at Burns
during and after the first period of a game at Ottawa. The exact
subject is not known. But Murphy, in effect, has been fired, and
the team will not pay the remaining $350,000 on his contract.
Burns, too, may soon know what it's like to be on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY ...
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa owner Rod Bryden gave fans a long list of demands for the
team to stay in town, including selling another 1,500 season
tickets and a 7 percent increase in prices. That's French for
goodbye. ... Florida (30-18-4) already has matched its win total
from last season (30-34-18). ... Panthers goalie Mike Vernon
launched a profanity-laced assault on a South Florida beat writer
who overheard Vernon tell assistant GM Chuck Fletcher that the team
needed defensemen. Coach Terry Murray's reaction: ``Mike better do
just what he does best, which is play the net. Maybe someday Mike
will be a GM and make those kind of moves. But he's not now.'' ...
When Tampa Bay defeated Atlanta last week, it was the first time in
40 games the team did not allow an even-strength goal. ... Worst
rumor of the week: Senators moving to Kansas City.

 &HT;    Leafs turn it around
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the NHL's All-Star Game is played in Toronto
today, it will be returning to its origins.
</P>
<P>
   The league's first midseason diversion was held at Maple Leaf
Gardens in 1947, so long ago that the Maple Leafs were coming off
one championship and on their way to another.
</P>
<P>
   The team's fortunes since have been similar to that of the
Canadian dollar. Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1966-67, the final
season before the league expanded from six to 12 teams, and hasn't
been back to the finals since. But as the NHL went into the break,
it appeared that Canada's most tormented hockey fans may have a
reason to celebrate in June.
</P>
<P>
   If the Leafs do not have the league's best record at the break,
it might have more to do with some young players not being pushed
in the Northeast Division than an inconsistent defense. Toronto
spotted Tampa Bay a 3-0 lead the other night before rallying to
score five straight goals and win 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're full of themselves,'' coach Pat Quinn
said of his players. ``I think it's more self-satisfaction. It's
like a person putting his feet up on a desk. I don't know if you
can (change the tendency) with a slap in the face or by talking
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental lapses may be the only thing keeping Toronto from league
dominance. The Leafs have what every general manager wants _ the
speed and talent to play a wide open style and the goaltender
(Curtis Joseph) to get away with it. Only a greater being, Dominik
Hasek, kept Toronto from reaching the finals last season. Hasek
won't be a problem this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some other first-half honors and dishonors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest bust: New York Rangers. That Gotham is thrilled the
Rangers are at .500 at the break speaks volumes. General manager
Neil Smith stuck his hand into the free agent pool like others
stick their hand in the peanut bowl. The biggest reason for the
Rangers' recent turnaround is not Theo Fleury or other new
millionaires but goalie Mike Richter. But odds are against Richter
being able to carry this team far. Playoff chances are no better
than even for the team with the league's fattest payroll.
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest surprise: Phoenix. The Coyotes lost their goaltender
(free agent Nikolai Khabibulin remains unsigned). Three of their
best players (Keith Tkachuk, Jeremy Roenick, Rick Tocchet) are
available to be traded. Owner Richard Burke is having financial
problems, and an arena deal is fizzling. Result: Phoenix is tied
with Dallas in the Pacific Division under rookie coach Bobby
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brainlock Award: Alexei Yashin. It's one thing for Khabibulin
and Keith Primeau to overvalue themselves as restricted free
agents. But Yashin is under contract with Ottawa, and for agent
Mark Gandler to believe that any court from here to Flin Flon will
declare his client a free agent in July runs counter to standard
contract law, to say nothing of logic. Yashin's reaction? He went
skiing in the Swiss Alps with Carol Alt.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the firing line: 1) Boston's Pat Burns remains one of the
league's best coaches. But when owners start siding with the
general manager and taking shots at the coach on the bench, it's
not a good sign; 2) Chicago's Lorne Molleken now has his boss, Bob
Pulford, standing next to him behind the bench. Goodbye, Lorne; 3)
It's not Alain Vigneault's fault in Montreal. But in Hab-land, it
doesn't matter; 4) Anaheim's Craig Hartsburg works for a Mickey
Mouse corporation (literally) and somebody has to take the fall for
Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne possibly finishing in last place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Player to watch: Philadelphia's Primeau: His me-first attitude
doesn't make him a favorite of general managers, especially when
contrasted with ex-Flyer Rod Brind'Amour (now of Carolina). But
Primeau makes the Flyers even bigger, stronger and better up front
than before, and he takes some of the pressure off Eric Lindros on
the power play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Team to watch: Colorado: Despite a turnover in personnel
before the season, the Avalanche is loaded with youth and speed,
and is in first place in the Northwest Division at the break
despite missing Peter Forsberg for much of the first half. If
goalie Patrick Roy does his part, the Avs could be the team coming
out of the West.

on any thoughts about it. I want to have a nice run here and focus
on that. I've said all along that once everything is said and done
this year, I'll sit down and think about it. It may very well be my
last year _ I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   On staying in Boston despite the team's problems: ``The last
couple of years we were going in the right direction. We had a good
crop of young guys, and then we lost them. Now, we're in a battle
for a playoff spot again. But we've had some good runs here.
Obviously, I could've gone in there to try to force (a trade). But
this is my home now, and that has a lot to do with wanting to stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   On what Russians brought to the NHL: ``A lot of skill and a lot
of headaches for everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   On having an All-Star Game without Gretkzy: ``It will be
different. I was in awe of him last year (when Gretzky won the
game's MVP award in Tampa). It was so much fun being a part of that
and watching him go out there and play the game the way he did. He
could still be around if he had the desire to do so.''

although he actually was born in Anchorage, Alaska, and barely
speaks Spanish. But the NHL is on the verge of getting a second
``Hispanic'' player. Canadian Raffi Torres plays for Brampton,
Ontario, in the juniors, but his father is Mexican and mother is
Peruvian. Torres is ranked as the seventh best North American
prospect by the NHL's Central Scouting and had three assists in a
prospects All-Star Game the other night.

 &HT;    Ducks feeling mighty again
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It remains to be seen how much, if at all, this helps
Craig Hartsburg keep his job in Anaheim. But the most mighty of
Ducks, Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, said a recent conversation
they had with the coach led to them gaining more offensive freedom.
Kariya has 10 goals and five assists in a six-game span. Selanne
has six goals and five assists in the past five games. Each has
scored in five consecutive games, the first time teammates can
claim such a feat since Philadelphia's Eric Lindros and Josef
Beranek in 1993. Kariya said the team ``had a little
miscommunication with Craig. We'd stopped playing our game
offensively and stopped making the plays we normally would. A
couple of weeks ago, he sat down and told us, `You guys have a
little more rope out there.''' Hartsburg, however, maintained he
never attempted to put restraints on his stars.
</P>
<P>
   AVALANCHE FALLOUT
</P>
<P>
   A blind-sided hit by Dallas' Richard Matvichuk in the playoffs
last year possibly led to Peter Forsberg needing offseason shoulder
surgery, which caused him to miss 23 games this year. Last week,
Forsberg was knocked out of the Vancouver game and today's All-Star
Game with a concussion when he was boarded by Todd Bertuzzi. That
was enough for Avs coach Bob Hartley, who said the league's stars
are still victims of head-hunting, despite recent rule changes to
limit such hits. ``Every team puts some of their tough guys on
(Forsberg) with cheap shots,'' Hartley said. ``For the first time
since I've been coaching Peter, I can feel frustration in his game.
You can feel that sometimes he wishes he could take his stick and
break it on somebody's head. That's the last thing we want to
happen. As a league, we have a responsibility of protecting our
best players.''

   Maybe Grant Fuhr should give it up. He lost his job in Calgary,
he suffered a knee injury, he came back last week, was sent to the
minors for a conditioning assignment, allowed six goals in two
periods for Saint John (AHL), then injured the knee. ...
Negotiations between Detroit and Igor Larionov are officially
closed for the season. ``I thought I was being very fair, but life

Los Angeles has won two in a row for the first time since Nov. 16.

Colorado in his first NHL start, then gave up two goals on four
shots in 1:57 against the Islanders in his second start. ... Why
are the Sharks slumping? Try these numbers: Niklas Sundstrom, no
goals in 24 games; Vincent Damphousse, one goal in 23; Jeff
Friesen, two in 19; Mike Ricci, one in 14. ... Edmonton's Alex
Selivanov scored 18 goals in his first 24 games, two in his next
29. ... Mike Smith, Chicago's new director of operations, said he's
in no rush to deal Doug Gilmour, although the veteran center will
be among the most attractive players to teams as the trading
deadline approaches. ``I've already identified the players who will
be here next year, who might be here next year and who won't be
here next year,'' Smith said. ``This won't be the same team we put
on the ice next year. But you can't start making trades to tell the
team we're not making the playoffs, and right now we're on the
periphery.'' ... Detroit's Sergei Fedorov has been sending hockey
equipment_ new, not used _ back to Russia to aid youth programs.

INDIA TRIES TO PLUG A CASH DRAIN: ITS POWER SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Throughout India, billions of dollars worth
of electricity is stolen each year by consumers in league with
utility workers, bureaucrats and politicians, according to the
nation's ministry of power. Line workers are bribed. Meters are
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and one of its
poorest, more than 40 percent of the power generated is pilfered, a
recent independent audit says.
</P>
<P>
   Corrupt, politicized state power systems have turned into
sinkholes that are sucking down staggering sums of money that could
be used to educate the world's largest concentration of illiterate
people or to provide them with clean drinking water, economists
say. At the same time, these bankrupt systems routinely leave
people in darkness and factories idle during rampant power
failures, retarding economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these everyday facts of life have been common
knowledge, but only recently have government officials begun
seriously trying to reverse the dim reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power's not being sold, it's being stolen,'' the country's
minister of power, P.K. Kumaramangalam, declared in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the state of Uttar Pradesh won a crucial test case
when it refused to back down on its move to break up the State
Electricity Board despite a strike by 89,000 power workers. The
workers, rightly, saw the move as the first step toward privatizing
parts of the system and establishing a regulatory commission to set
rates high enough to make the power system profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Workers feared that a better-managed private system would
threaten their jobs and stop an unchecked flow of bribes, experts
said. But on Jan. 25, after an 11-day strike, workers gave up and
went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   In the workers' absence, a mere 1,100 substitute workers were
able to keep power humming for the 160 million state residents.
Kumaramangalam, a former trade union leader who once battled
privatization, said the state's whole system could easily operate
with 15,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and officials say the state's victory, with firm
backing from the central government, was a turning point. The state
electricity system will now be divided into separate units, for
generation and for transmission-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state had caved, it would have been the end of the
reform process in transport, roads, ports _ not just in the power
sector,'' said Kumaramangalam, a leader in the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the nation's governing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The process of change is slowly building. Last fall, the state
of Orissa became the first to award power distribution completely
to private companies. Two other states besides Uttar Pradesh are
moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1996, the World Bank, which has helped finance
India's power system, stopped lending for power projects. Theft,
huge subsidies for farmers and domestic consumers, and a bloated
bureaucracy had turned the state electricity boards into huge money
losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the hard conclusion that there was no way to reform
the state electricity boards from within,'' said Joelle Chassard,
the bank's coordinator for India. ``We tried and failed
miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank made further aid conditional on a state's
willingness to reform its power system. In states like Uttar
Pradesh, which are broke, bank officials felt there would be no
real money for education, health and poverty programs unless the
financial hemorrhaging for power could be stopped, nor could the
reliability and adequacy of the power supply be improved.
</P>
<P>
   The bankrupt power system had helped cripple anti-poverty
measures and economic growth in Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   If Uttar Pradesh goes forward with plans to privatize power
distribution, the World Bank is likely to loan the state billions
of dollars over the next five to 10 years for a wide variety of
development projects, bank officials say.
</P>
<P>
   And more states are showing an interest. In recent months, since
Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu _ known for
having taken politically unpopular steps to reform the power system
_ won re-election, other state leaders have gone to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few months, we have observed real competition
among states for going ahead with reforms,'' Chassard said. ``We
are facing a problem now of having to say no to some requests for
help because we have more than we can handle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Change will not come without opposition. Over the years,
thievery has become entrenched because so many have benefited: the
consumer whose meter is slowed to give a lower reading, the worker
who collects bribes for tinkering with the meter, and the
politicians and bureaucrats who sell jobs to supervising engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big juice is in distribution,'' said Jairam Ramesh, a
Congress Party official who is an economist. ``A guy comes to me
and says: `I'll fix your meter. You'll pay 1,000 rupees instead of
2,000 rupees. You keep 800 and give me 200.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As power workers poured out of a jail in the town of Dasna in
western Uttar Pradesh, where they had been held recently for taking
part in a strike the state had declared illegal, the men bitterly
blamed the politicians for the corruption and insisted it could be
cleaned up if the political will were there.
</P>
<P>
   But their descriptions of the problem only underlined the
pervasiveness of the corruption, and how hard it would be for
anyone who is part of the system to root it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political interference in the electricity board leads to
theft by industrialists close to bureaucrats and ministers,'' said
Jagdish Singh Sisodia, who has worked as a clerk at the board for
32 years. ``They are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   And as other workers clustered around, seconding his opinions,
Sisodia related how government investigators who are supposed to
stop the bribery just wind up demanding their cut of the take.

RIOTS LEAVE 50 INJURED AS PROTESTS RISE IN VIENNA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Clashes overnight between the police and demonstrators
left more than 50 people injured in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday
after a coalition government including members of the
anti-immigration Freedom Party was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   The riots, unusual in a habitually sedate city, reflected the
intense feelings stirred by the arrival in power of the party that
Joerg Haider has steered from a fringe group to a serious political
force over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 police officers, 11 demonstrators and several
bystanders were injured, none of them seriously, and dozens of
police vehicles were damaged, the police said. Ten people were
arrested, but all of them were subsequently released.
</P>
<P>
   The government, composed of the center-right People's Party and
the Freedom Party, immediately set about trying to calm the
international storm provoked by what is widely viewed as the
unacceptable legitimization of Haider, a man who has praised
aspects of Hitler's rule but more recently dismissed the Nazi
regime as barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must defend myself against unacceptable comparisons,''
Wolfgang Schuessel, the new chancellor and a member of the People's
Party, said. ``There is no new Hitler on the rise in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   His remark went to the heart of an international outcry over
Haider that has seen Austria's 14 European Union partners downgrade
diplomatic relations and the United States recall its ambassador
``for consultations.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel, who embraced a coalition with the Freedom Party after
protracted talks with the Social Democrats broke down, acknowledged
that in the short term Austria was certain to face difficulties,
but said he hoped that ``in the medium term it may be possible to
achieve a significant normalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, whose 14 other members have moved with
unusual rapidity and severity in their measures against Austria,
has halted bilateral political contacts with Austria, downgraded
relations with Austria's ambassadors, who will be received only at
``technical level,'' and said it would not support Austrian
candidates for positions at international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, who swore in the
government on Friday, appealed to the European Union to ease its
measures against Austria. A statement from the presidency said that
Klestil had contacted Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime
minister and current president of the European Union, to request
``an exception'' allowing bilateral contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear how the European Union would be able to
retreat from the steps it has taken as long as the Freedom Party
remains in government.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that Haider's party, which now has up to
33 percent support, has benefited from a widespread feeling that
the country is being unfairly punished.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview with an Austrian news agency, Haider, 49,
adopted the confident and unguarded tone that has appealed to many
Austrians who are tired of three decades of government by a Social
Democratic party that has continued an old practice of dividing
spoils among the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These European Union measures are nothing to get hysterical
about,'' Haider said, adding that other European ministers would
have to get used to talking to the government members from his
party because decisions in the 15-member bloc are taken by
unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has not made any move to prevent ministers of
the new government from attending European Union meetings, because
it has no legal basis to do so, and Haider appeared to be
suggesting that Austria could respond to the sanctions by blocking
European Union decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   But the People's Party quickly declared that no such action was
contemplated.

U.S. MOVE ON AUSTRIA REFLECTS WIDER CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's top foreign policy adviser says
Washington's decision last week to impose diplomatic sanctions
against Austria was driven partly by a desire to send a message
that the United States would not stand by idly if other
anti-immigrant, far-right parties tried to join other coalition
governments in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concern about whether the extreme hateful right
could emerge in Europe,'' Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, said in an interview on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extreme small parties that exist in some
countries,'' he added, clearly referring to Germany and France,
though carefully not naming them. The United States, he said, had
to make it clear that ``democracy is about more than elections _ it
is also about shared values.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time a senior U.S. official had publicly
voiced fears that the inclusion of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party
in the new Austrian government could inspire similar groups
elsewhere in Europe. In private, some U.S. officials have expressed
particular concern about Germany, fearing that the troubles of the
scandal-ridden Christian Democrats could create a political vacuum
that far-right parties might try to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Berger peppered his remarks with praise for the swiftness with
which the European Union acted to downgrade diplomatic relations
with Austria, a formal step the United States has so far not
joined. Instead, it has temporarily recalled the U.S. ambassador,
Kathryn Walt-Hall, for ``consultations,'' and on Friday it barred
the Austrian defense attache from a relatively routine meeting of
U.S. and European officials here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Europeans themselves who have set the pace on this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Berger said, was deeply involved in the
decision to condemn the Austrian action, but he has yet to talk to
Austria's leaders, a step that was left to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. ``We had to send a signal, to say like the
Europeans that there will not be business as usual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the U.S. response, Berger acknowledged, was being carefully
measured in hopes of not inciting a greater nationalist backlash in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that this strategy is working. Chancellor
Wolfgang Schuessel defended the inclusion of the Freedom Party, led
by Joerg Haider, in the new government and said he ``sharply''
rejected what he called ``unjustified accusations'' from Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must defend myself against unacceptable comparisons,'' said
Schuessel, who heads the Austrian People's Party. ``There is no
Hitler on the rise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Washington's reaction broke from the Clinton administration's
usual playbook. Except in rare instances, the inclusion of
extremist minority parties or politicians in democratic foreign
governments is termed an ``internal affair'' in the State
Department's lexicon, a matter to be left to the voters of the
nation involved.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent years Washington has stood silent while Japanese
cabinet officials have expressed sympathy with the invasion of
China and Korea during World War II, for example, and while
far-left governments have come to power in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger made clear that he saw the events in Austria as
qualitatively different, and he seemed unimpressed by a declaration
issued by the new government that it would commit itself to
``understanding all human beings irrespective of their origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider seemed to backtrack on that statement almost as soon as
he had signed it, saying it was an ``affront'' that Austria had to
sign such statements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the verbal barrage unleashed here last week against
Austria, however, the Clinton administration still seems unwilling
to take actions that would truly hurt Austria or that could speed
the fall of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Berger argued that the European Union had passed some kind of
particularly difficult test last week. ``They have asserted here
that the EU is not just an economic concept, that it is a political
concept,'' he said. ``That reflects both their sense of history and
their sense of the future.''

ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HINDER CHANGES IN CROATIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ The new Croatian government is trying to move
quickly to live up to its promises of social equality and justice,
with plans to cut officials' salaries by up to 40 percent, and with
the arrests of a former Cabinet minister and a favored tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the new prime minister, Ivica Racan, says the economic
situation is worse than he imagined after nine years of rule by a
single party, the Croatian Democratic Union of the late president,
Franjo Tudjman. Racan heads a coalition government of six
opposition parties sworn in on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking for savings across the board, he said in an
interview Saturday, including cutbacks in the bloated state
bureaucracy, trying not to seek the rescheduling of Croatia's large
foreign debt. ``There is a way out if everyone helps and accepts a
policy of economies at all levels,'' he said. ``But we must give an
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Racan's first foreign trip _ to Lisbon, Portugal; Brussels,
Belgium, and Berlin this week _ will be on scheduled airlines, he
said. He and his deputy, Goran Granic, say government cars and
security will be cut back.
</P>
<P>
   They intend to give Parliament the government's legislative
agenda this week and report to lawmakers on the real state of the
country's finances in the next two weeks. Racan said he would move
gradually to bring the overvalued currency, tied to the German
mark, to a more realistic exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Racan also faces the consequences of ``the irresponsibility of
the transition in the last few months,'' when the departing
government incurred large debts and hired ``many unnecessary people
to work in the ministries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He promised that allegations of corruption against former
ministers and officials would be pursued, even if they, like a
former Tudjman aide, Ivic Pasalic, hold parliamentary seats and
official positions. And Racan confirmed that the former government
had burned or destroyed many documents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the cloudy days after his election were the result of
fog or ash, he said: ``From my information, the fog was supported
by the burning of papers. This makes things more difficult, but it
will not save anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The former tourism minister, Ivan Herak, is in prison on charges
of embezzlement. The police say they arrested him after being
emboldened by the opposition's election victory. More important,
perhaps, Miroslav Kutle, a tycoon from Herzegovina, in neighboring
Bosnia, who was close to the Tudjman government, was arrested on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kutle is considered close to Pasalic, an instrumental figure in
the group of businessmen from Herzegovina favored by the old
government. Both are reported to have been involved in a banking
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The new interior minister, Sime Lucin, 41, the former mayor of
Trogir, promises fast action under the law, and said in an
interview that Croatian journalists need no longer worry about
their phones being tapped.
</P>
<P>
   The new foreign minister, Tonino Picula, 38, said his first
foreign visit would be to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. He
intends, he said, to show the Bosnian leaders that the new Croatian
government recognizes Bosnia's independence and wants to work
openly with its officials to make it ``a self-sustaining country.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a sharp contrast to Tudjman's support, both open and
secret, for a separate Bosnian Croatian entity, including its army,
that Racan said cost over $130 million a year and U.S. officials
think cost even more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Racan admitted that cutting aid to the Bosnian Croats too
radically could risk a new, expensive immigration to Croatia. But
he and Granic vowed that all aid would now go through established
institutions, mainly the Bosnian government.
</P>
<P>
   Racan also said he would turn over an indicted war criminal,
Mladen Naletilic, to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, as soon as he is healthy enough, and that foreign
doctors could examine him if they insisted.
</P>
<P>
   All these points will please the United States and the European
Union, which are eager to bring Croatia quickly into Western
institutions and provide needed economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   Granic _ the brother of the former foreign minister, Mate Granic
_ made it clear that the new government would cooperate with the
West, but ``as partners, not pupils to whom teachers give new
homework every day.'' The people of Croatia ``gave us our homework
in these elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned Western investors that there would be no special deals
but ``open tenders for everyone,'' and said, ``I'll never accept
that we should be poor so that foreign companies and investors
should be rich.''

GROZNY'S CIVILIANS TELL OF RUSSIAN KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's seizure of Grozny, the capital of Chechnya,
did not bring much security for Hedi, a 40-year-old resident of the
battered city. When she and two other women returned to Grozny to
check on their homes, they stumbled across a group of Russian
soldiers who were looting their devastated neighborhood. The women
were blindfolded and shot.
</P>
<P>
   Hedi survived by pretending she was dead even as the soldiers
heaped several mattresses on the bodies, doused them with gasoline
and set them on fire, according to the account she gave last week
to Human Rights Watch, an international rights group, from a
hospital in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing refugees from Grozny, the group said Saturday
that it has documented 22 cases in which Grozny residents were
killed by occupying Russian troops, and it is investigating at
least 14 more. In some cases, the residents appear to have been
shot by vengeful Russian soldiers, distraught at the losses their
units had suffered. In others, robbery may have been the motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence has confirmed some of our worse fears,'' Peter
Bouckaert, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone
interview from Ingushetia. ``We are not talking about incidental
casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sergei Yastrezmbsky, the Russian government's spokesman
on the war, nor any of his aides were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the conduct of Russian troops
has been criticized by human rights experts. Human Rights Watch
asserted in December that Russian troops had pillaged the village
of Alkhan-Yurt in Chechnya and killed civilians there.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges were supported by testimony from some of the
survivors, much of which was recorded on a videotape prepared by a
Chechen businessman who supports the Russians. Russian authorities
say they are investigating the episode.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony from the Grozny refugees recalls many of the
allegations of human rights abuses during the 1994-96 war in
Chechnya. It is particularly embarrassing for the Kremlin since it
comes as Russian forces are celebrating their near ``liberation''
of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have blocked virtually all of the Western
press from reporting from Grozny, making it difficult to evaluate
Russia's claims that it is concerned about the safety of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony covers events from Dec. 22 to Jan. 24. Many of the
victims were civilians from Ingushetia who lived in Grozny and were
later evacuated from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch spoke to a woman who said she was hiding in a
cellar with five other civilians when Russian troops routed a band
of rebels from her neighborhood. Hearing Russian voices, the
civilians went outside only to be accused of aiding the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   After the civilians returned to their shelter the soldiers threw
in several grenades. The wounded civilians were later lined up
against the wall of a garage and shot.
</P>
<P>
   Saidpudin, a Grozny resident who asked that his last name not be
published, said he was detained in mid-January after witnessing the
shooting of a civilian by Russian troops. He was later beaten and
forced to crouch in a pit while Russian soldiers doused his head
with cold water. He was released, but does not know what happened
to eight other men who were also taken away with him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hedi's ordeal began on the morning of Jan. 21 when she and two
other women went to check on their homes. A group of soldiers who
were looting homes took them away, telling them they would be
questioned at a local Interior Ministry outpost. Instead, the women
were blindfolded and taken to a ruined house across the street. The
two other women were shot to death. Hedi was shot in the shoulder
and acted as if she was dead as the soldiers searched her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They checked me all over and found 400 rubles'' _ $14 _ ``in
one pocket,'' she said in her testimony to Human Rights Watch. ``It
was tough for them to get my gold ring, and they were looking for a
knife. They tried again and fortunately the ring came off.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers piled old mattresses on top of the bodies and tried
to burn them. But the mattresses were damp, and Hedi survived.
</P>
<P>
   Bouckaert said that Hedi's bullet wounds and burn marks were
consistent with her testimony. A second witness, a relative who
came from Ingushetia to evacuate Hedi, also confirmed her account.

 &HT;    Celtics fans: Trade Walker
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the trade deadline 18 days away, it has gotten
this bad in Boston: Fans booed Antoine Walker, who scored 35 points
against the Heat on Wednesday but missed his last three shots, two
of them threes, at the end of a 105-103 loss to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Pitino tried to take the heat off Walker. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to understand is, yeah, he may take an
ill-advised shot. He may miss the free throws. The guy's
exhausted,'' Pitino said. ``He played his (butt) off (Tuesday in
Indiana). He played 47 minutes tonight. He's going to make some
mistakes because of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort that he has given for the Boston Celtics is
flat-out extraordinary _ unbelievable. ... He's given as much
effort as any player I've ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, what can the Celtics get for him?
</P>
<P>
   MERCER FINDS A HOME
</P>
<P>
   Boston couldn't sign Ron Mercer and shipped him to Denver, which
couldn't sign the 6-foot-7 guard and shipped him to Orlando, which
has plenty of cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer certainly approves. ``This was meant to be,'' he said.
``I've had my eye on Orlando for some time. I don't know if I
should say this, but I've always been a Penny Hardaway fan as well.
... I really like what they've been doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   AT LEAST THE NETS WANT HIM
</P>
<P>
   The Nets said they had set up a meeting with rookie Leon Smith
on Monday, but it was called off by commissioner David Stern until
Smith's contract was terminated with Dallas on Wednesday. Nets
president Michael Rowe said the Nets might go ahead and pursue him
in the near future. ``The thought behind bringing him in was to see
what he's like physically and as a person,'' Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
   JERKED AROUND IN JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dikembe Mutombo has a valid argument when he says the Nets
stats crew never gives him his blocked shots. On Dec. 26 the Bulls
lost in New Jersey and tied an NBA record for fewest assists with
three. Incredulous, the Bulls went to the league for a review. The
league informed the Bulls last week they counted 12 assists and
would change the official scoring. Said Bulls GM Jerry Krause:
``That's a pretty big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   PISTONS SPLIT OVER AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are in the Ike Austin sweepstakes. It comes down to
a split between team vice president/basketball Rick Sund and coach
Alvin Gentry, who wants Austin badly and went over Sund to Joe
Dumars (v.p./personnel) to plead his case. Gentry wants the Pistons
to put up Bison Dele's contract ($35 million), a future first-round
pick and Don Reid. Sund, however, has heard the knocks on the
Wizards center from Chuck Daly, Pat Riley and Gar Heard, and wants
no part of him. Sund is certain Austin will end up with the Lakers.
Gentry still hasn't forgiven Sund for not bringing in Cliff
Robinson in 1998. Instead, he got Loy Vaught _ a flop.
</P>
<P>
   MCGRADY'S IN DEMAND
</P>
<P>
   Here's why teams are salivating for Tracy McGrady: During
Toronto's four-game winning streak, McGrady has been the Raptors'
best player, averaging 18.8 points on .547 shooting, 5.8 rebounds,
5.5 assists, 1 steal, 2.3 blocks and 31.2 minutes. His 1.93 average
in blocks is first among the Raptors, and his 13.9 scoring average
ranks second. ``When I think of Tracy's game lately, he reminds me
so much of Magic Johnson,'' Kevin Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan gave the Wizards more than a new coach. He
implemented a dress code _ slacks and shirt _ and all employees
received a pair of his name-brand sneakers _ in white and Carolina
blue. ... Hornets guard David Wesley, who will be charged Monday
with racing and reckless driving, has been charged with speeding
four times since 1997, according to records in North Carolina and
Alabama. ... Charlotte minority owner Ray Wooldridge understands
Eddie Jones' value, calling him ``essential to the success of our
team.'' Jones is a free agent July 1.

 &HT;    Higgins the loser in search for Wizards coach
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a wonder Rod Higgins can continue his job as
assistant coach of the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   All indications last week pointed to Michael Jordan's good
friend landing his first head-coaching job, with Jordan's
Washington Wizards. As it turned out, the Warriors got greedy,
Jordan got impatient, and Higgins got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In all the madness that went on after Gar Heard got fired,
Higgins is the biggest loser. Even bigger than Heard, who still got
paid for the remainder of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that in these circumstances we have a real
victim in Rod Higgins,'' said Michael Goldberg, executive director
of the National Basketball Coaches Association. ``People sit in a
room and make business decisions and very often don't think through
the ramifications on the human side very clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this thing wasn't handled right with respect to
Rod,'' Goldberg said. ``But I don't think anybody had any negative
intentions. Something certainly should have been worked out here.
It's not unusual for teams to ask for compensation for a coach. And
historically, these things have been worked out. I think in this
instance, though, the Warriors weren't protecting a first assistant
or a guy who was in line for the (head) job.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reported nationally that Higgins was prepared to take the
Washington position after coach/general manager Garry St. Jean
first talked to Jordan. St. Jean even hired former Charlotte coach
Dave Cowens to replace Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Michael that, from my standpoint, I was very excited
and elated, because Rod is one of my best friends in the league,''
St. Jean said. ``We both agreed this would be good for Rod. I then
told Mike, `You know I got to get approval from my owner
(Christopher Cohan), and I'll get back to you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was great. He went about it the right way. He called
me and asked permission to talk to Rod like he was supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called Michael back,'' St. Jean continued, ``I said,
`You know Michael, if you were one of the other 27 teams, it would
be OK. But the fact we have your first-round draft pick (in the
June draft) is a unique situation.' Then he said, `Holy-moly,
you're right.' So we then agreed it would be best to wait until the
end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan did not wait. He was not about to take the conditions
off the draft pick, which requires that the Warriors return it to
Washington if it lands in the top three selections. No one could
fault him for that. However, instead of consulting the coaches
association to examine his options, Jordan reacted as the novice
basketball executive he is.
</P>
<P>
   He shunned Higgins and hired Darrell Walker, another friend and
former teammate who was coaching in the CBA. So, Walker, the
ex-Toronto coach, gets the second chance in the NBA he deserves,
while Higgins remains with the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   And Higgins is distraught. It took him three days before he
could address the matter publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Higgins said, ``it was a situation that I was
prepared to go and prepared to take. Unfortunately, it didn't
happen, and, while it's a disappointment, it's also business.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he feel like a hostage?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Higgins said. ``Obviously, I would have liked it
to have happened while I had an opportunity, but it didn't, and I'm
not going to dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Higgins made it in the NBA because he played a
smart and cunning game. He showed an acumen for the game and
because of his pleasant, professional nature, he was a favorite
among players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel one positive of all this is that the spotlight has
shone on Rod,'' Goldberg said. ``If Michael Jordan, who is a
well-respected basketball personality, feels Rod is somebody who
can coach his team under tough circumstances, maybe other teams may
take a look at Rod.''

 &HT;    Hits and misses for this year's NBA All-Star team
 &HT;    COURTSIDE
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As every year, several players are miffed that they
are left off the NBA all-star teams, via fans' balloting or
coaches' selections.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of this year's good choices and bad omissions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Good: Dale Davis, Indiana. It's refreshing that the Pacers'
power forward finally got acknowledged for his yeoman's work and
unselfish play. He's a bruiser whose game is unappealing but vital.
``It's not pretty what I do, but somebody has to do the dirty
work,'' Davis said. ``And I'm glad to be recognized for it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bad: Stephon Marbury, New Jersey. What does the former Georgia
Tech star have to do to get his due? He's been brilliant for the
Nets but was hurt when the fans voted in Charlotte's Eddie Jones,
who missed significant time because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good: Michael Finley, Dallas. The Mavericks are so bad that
Finley's development as an all-around talent goes mostly unnoticed
and underappreciated. Not anymore. He plays above the rim and
beyond the 3-point arc and maintains a field-goal percentage above
.500. ``The last time my phone rang like that, I got traded,''
Finley said. ``At the time, I really didn't want to answer the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bad: Shawn Kemp, Cleveland. The Cavaliers' big man continued
to put up all-star numbers: 18.8 points, 9 rebounds, but he got
shunned for the Hawks' Dikembe Mutombo, who at times has been
invisible on a bad team. ``If we were in first or second place,''
Kemp said, ``I'd be going to Oakland. I'm smart enough to know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Good: Jerry Stackhouse, Detroit. He deserves a lot of credit
for peacefully deferring to Joe Dumars the last two years. With his
chance, Stackhouse has excelled, making a tandem with Grant Hill
that's among the best in the league. ``I can't even put into words
what this means to me,'' Stackhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bad: Clifford Robinson, Phoenix. Once regarded as reckless,
Robinson has honed his game and been the best player on the Suns.
He scored 50 this season, but his consistency has been most
impressive. Deserves an all-star spot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good: Glenn Robinson, Milwaukee. ``The Big Dog'' finally is
getting the recognition he deserves as a prolific scorer. No player
in the league has performed better in the clutch. ``It's a great
thing for our team and the city of Milwaukee,'' Robinson said.
``This will do a lot for the franchise, with myself and Ray (Allen)
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWKS LOSS, SONICS GAIN
</P>
<P>
   The same Shammond Williams the Hawks drafted and cut in 1998 has
been a brilliant find for Seattle. He has his moments where he
shows he needs more work _ such as nine turnovers in two games last
week. But he also has shown great speed, quickness and toughness,
elements the Hawks definitely could use at the point.
</P>
<P>
   Williams scored 16 points with no turnovers against Utah, and
had 18 and 22 at New Jersey and New York, respectively. ``He's got
a lot of confidence,'' SuperSonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``He's
also got a lot of skill. He doesn't have the experience, but he's
not afraid of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To the NBA. The league granted Russ Granik, the deputy
commissioner, a four-year contract extension. David Stern has been
at the forefront of the NBA's growth and worldwide appeal. But
Granik's a strong ``right hand'' whose value is immeasurable. He
will succeed Stern.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To the Dallas Mavericks. Why new owner Mark Cuban would sign
Dennis Rodman is a mystery. If the Mavs were a playoff club, it
might make sense. But they are not. The team will learn that a
goofy rebounder is hardly a big draw on a bad team.

EGYPTAIR PILOT CLAIMS TO KNOW ABOUT CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ An EgyptAir pilot claiming to have information
about the crash of the airline's Flight 990 last year has requested
asylum in Britain, EgyptAir officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Hamdi Hanafi Taha, asked for sanctuary after he
landed a scheduled flight from Cairo to London on Friday. He had
radioed ahead, officials said, and asked to be met by police
officers. In London a spokesman for Britain's Home Office confirmed
that an Egyptian had asked for asylum, but did not give further
details.
</P>
<P>
   News of Taha's action, as well as the description of what is
said to be the pilot's claim, came first from EgyptAir, which is
government-owned. But Egyptian officials immediately dismissed the
possibility that Taha could possess information pertinent to the
crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's chairman, Muhammad Fahim Rayan, said Taha ``does
not have any connection to or knowledge about the cause of the
plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Flight 990 dived into the Atlantic Ocean near
Nantucket, Mass., on Oct. 31, about 30 minutes into a flight from
New York to Cairo, killing all 217 people on board. Investigators
from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board have speculated
that an EgyptAir pilot who was flying the plane deliberately sent
it plummeting into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have vehemently rejected that theory, as have
many of the airline's pilots. Pilots and airline officials
dismissed Taha as a disgruntled maverick.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir's vice president for operations, Hassan Musharrafa,
told the newspaper Al Ahram that Taha had been under internal
investigation for several ``offenses,'' but he did not specify what
they were.
</P>
<P>
   Taha, 49, apparently surprised not only his crew and airline
officials but also his family in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids are crying because everyone is asking them if their
father is crazy,'' said his wife, Hoda Youssef. ``He is a normal
person.''

 &HT;    The flamboyant one
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Frankly, they don't know what to make of Sacramento's
precocious Jason Williams. Asked about him, Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said, ``Interesting. I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings assistant Pete Carril, who spent years perfecting the
backdoor play at Princeton, said of Williams' blind passes: ``I
feel a little pain in my chest when he does it. I don't know if
it's driving me crazy. But I notice the difference, I'll tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his flamboyant style, Williams said:
``Behind-the-back passes for me are just as easy as a chest pass
would be for you. It's just so simple for me to just whip it.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to critics, such as TNT analyst Hubie Brown, Williams
said, ``Lots of older people in the crowd and older announcers
really don't like it, and I think they don't like it because they
couldn't do it when they were little or younger. ... But I bet
they're the first in line to see us come to town. They're talking
out of both sides of their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   RODMAN THE RENTER
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman is living in an expansive guest house adjacent to
Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's North Dallas mansion. They went
furniture shopping together. ``He's paying rent,'' Cuban said.
``Just like I have rented a car to (guard) Greg Buckner, who pays
me $15 per day. Dennis would only live here for the three or four
months left in the season. The furniture would stay. That's why I
was with him, to get furniture that fit the house. He went along
for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   PIPPEN KNOCKS, FINLEY'S IN
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs' Michael Finley says he owes Scottie Pippen for being
on the West All-Star team, because Pippen's knock on him as
``unworthy'' made coaches take notice. As for Pippen being left off
the All-Star roster, Finley could only savor the irony. ``He'll
always have next year. He's an All-Star not having an All-Star
season.''
</P>
<P>
   MAILMAN NOT DELIVERING
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone had his two worst games in Utah's back-to-back
losses to Vancouver (116-99) and Portland (85-75). ``People have a
right to say, `What is going on?' That's fair,'' Malone said. ``I'm
saying the same thing because I know the standard I've set for
myself. ... But I'll work my way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S THE DEAL?
</P>
<P>
   Denver players have not endorsed the Ron Mercer-to-Orlando deal.
``I couldn't say we are a better team,'' forward Antonio McDyess
said. Nick Van Exel called a players-only meeting and wondered why
the Nuggets didn't wait a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   WAIVER'S OK WITH ELLIOTT
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs made Sean Elliott sign a waiver freeing them from
liability when he came back to practice this week after his kidney
transplant. ``I have no problems with that whatsoever,'' Elliott
said. ``I'm the one who is forcing the issue. I know they're
concerned. I've just been really anxious to get back.'' When will
he play? ``It's a basketball decision at this point, not a medical
decision,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   FINGER-POINTING CLIPPERS
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers lost to the Warriors by 31 and the Suns by 46 and
pointed fingers at coach Chris Ford. ``Guys went out and did what
they wanted to do and the fact of the matter is we have no
direction whatsoever,'' center Michael Olowokandi said. ``If you
want to blame it on the individual players, that's fine because I'm
no stranger to that ... but the truth is we have no direction,''
... Vancouver owner-to-be Michael Heisley has fellow Chicagoan and
failed coach Dick Versace on board as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   BARKLEY TO COME BACK?
</P>
<P>
   Houston physical therapist Russ Paine said Charles Barkley (torn
quadriceps) could play before the end of the season if his
rehabilitation continues at its current pace. ``I'm way ahead of
schedule,'' barkley said, ``but everything has to be perfect and I
would still only get back for the last couple games.

ANALYSIS: PATTERNS HARD TO FIND IN AIRLINE ACCIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ The mechanical problem that led to the
crash of the Alaska Airlines jet here Jan. 31 was unusual to the
point of being unprecedented. But that is the problem with many
high-profile crashes lately: The pattern of recent accidents is
that there is no pattern.
</P>
<P>
   It may take months to find out exactly what happened to the
plane, an MD-83 carrying 88 passengers and crew members. But it is
already evident that the plane had some kind of failure, which
became progressively worse as it cruised from Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, until the crew could not control it. Crashes that begin in
the cruise phase of flight are very rare, as are mechanical
difficulties that cannot be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, airliner crashes themselves are very
rare. With years of progress in engines, navigation and control
systems, and with better training and procedures, many of the types
of crashes that were once common are now unusual. There was only
one airliner crash in 1999, in Little Rock, Ark., and the year
before there were none, meaning that the drive to and from the
airports was more risky than the flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a pile of accident risks, with the most risky at the
top, and the most remote at the bottom,'' said Anthony Broderick, a
former director of aircraft certification at the Federal Aviation
Administration. ``Obviously, everybody in the industry works at the
top first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of decades, we took the pile away,'' he
said, or at least the top of the pile, the high-risk part. What is
left, Broderick and others said, are the crashes that were rare to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Matthews, the chairman and president of the Flight Safety
Foundation, which publishes accident statistics and reports, said
that ``in North America, airline accidents tend to be rather
random,'' and when they do occur, they tend to be ``because of
something nobody ever thought about before.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800, for example, exploded in flight in an incident
that many experts did not think was possible until it happened. The
Boeing 747, which crashed off Long Island, N.Y., in July 1996, had
an explosive atmosphere in its center fuel tank that engineers did
not believe existed, combined with wiring problems that few had any
inkling of.
</P>
<P>
   Valujet Flight 592, which came down in the Florida Everglades
because of a fire in a cargo compartment, was well-protected
against such incidents, according to its designers, who made the
compartment air-tight and assumed that any fire would die when it
used up the available oxygen. But the airliner was carrying oxygen
generators, which were misdescribed and packaged incorrectly,
without safety caps to keep them from operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would ever have thought somebody would one day mislabel
the package, never put the safety caps on them, throw them into a
rough box and put them in to a hold full of things that would
burn?'' Matthews said. ``There are so many minute probabilities in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still some accidents involving familiar causes, like
pilot errors. Examples are those involving the American Airlines
jet that landed in a thunderstorm at Little Rock last June and ran
off the end of the runway and the American Airlines jet that hit a
mountain on its way to Cali, Colombia, in December 1994. And many
people have died in runway collisions, with the FAA reporting a
worrisome level of cases in which planes mistakenly taxied into the
paths of others.
</P>
<P>
   But experts believe there will eventually be a solution to the
problem of collisions on the ground. And as technology and training
improve and other causes of airline accidents decline, the unusual
ones become a larger percentage of the total, like the crash of
EgyptAir Flight 900, in which an apparently sound Boeing 767
crashed into the Atlantic in what many investigators believe was a
pilot suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people like the FAA, the Safety Board and the airline
safety people do their job extremely well,'' said Charles N.
Eastlake, a professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University, in Daytona Beach, Fla., ``then the
possibility certainly exists that they will find and successfully
control most of the systemic causes.''
</P>
<P>
   And when that happens, Eastlake said, ``freak accidents will end
up being he predominant thing.'' And they will get more frequent,
he said, as the number of flights grows. With the airlines in this
country flying six billion miles a year, there are lots of chances
for the one-in-a-million event to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or two, the Safety Board will lay out the cause of
the Alaska Airlines crash in excruciating detail. Soon after, or
possibly even before the conclusions are drawn up, the FAA will
propose changes to eliminate the possibility of a repetition.
Months or years after that, the rules will take effect, and within
five years or so from now, all the companies that operate
MD-80-series airplanes, and possibly similar ones like the DC-9,
will make the required changes. A repetition will be extremely
unlikely. But the initial event was hardly likely, either.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a White House commission on aviation safety and security
set a goal of reducing the accident rate by 80 percent within 10
years. The idea did not come out of the FAA, where some experts
doubt it is achievable. But it is certainly more achievable than
the goal of zero accidents set by Federico F. Pena, in 1995, when
he was the secretary of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Airlines crash may turn out to have been preventable.
But it may be, Matthews said, that the aviation accident rate is
like the bar in a limbo dance. It can go lower and lower, but it
cannot touch the floor.

ART MUSEUM TO RETURN PAINTING TIED TO NAZI THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ After confirming that one of its most prized
paintings had been stolen by the Nazis during World War II from an
Austrian Jewish art collector, the North Carolina Museum of Art
announced plans last week to give the painting back to its rightful
owners, two sisters in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, ``Madonna and Child in a Landscape,'' by Lucas
Cranach the Elder, a German Renaissance artist, was deeded to the
museum in 1964 by an art collector in Beverly Hills, Calif. The
museum took possession of the painting when that collector,
Marianne Khuner, died in 1984. Since then, the work, which was
painted around 1518, has hung at the entrance to the museum's
Northern European collection.
</P>
<P>
   But last March, the museum received a letter detailing evidence
of the painting's history from an agency based in New York that is
concerned with recovering assets taken by the Nazis during World
War II. The museum researched the trail of the Cranach piece and
verified the Nazi connection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 the painting was part of a collection of about 85 works
owned by a wealthy Austrian industrialist, Philipp von Gomperz.
When Austria was taken over by Hitler that year, Gomperz fled
Vienna, leaving the art collection with his niece. In 1940, Nazis
confiscated the collection, including the Cranach painting, which
was then acquired by a Nazi leader in Austria, Baldur von Schirach.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Schirach was tried with other Nazi war criminals
at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In the 1950s the
painting showed up on the New York art market and was eventually
bought by the Beverly Hills collector who, apparently unaware of
its history, donated it to the North Carolina Museum of Art. Museum
officials say they think the collector was an acquaintance of the
director at the time.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffey, the museum's curator, said that as soon as he heard
about the possibility of a Holocaust connection, the painting took
on a new, unsettling aura. ``The fact that one of our paintings
might not be ours,'' he said, ``and that the Nazis might have been
a part of its history, added a sort of eerie veneer to the
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commission for Art Recovery of the World Jewish Congress
wrote the letter to the museum last March, and the Holocaust Claims
Processing Office of New York state's banking department
represented Gomperz's two grandnieces, Marianne and Cornelia
Hainisch, through the process.
</P>
<P>
   Gomperz died in Switzerland in 1948 at age 87, but his heirs
have worked since the end of the war to reclaim pieces of his
collection. The Cranach painting is the 13th work they have
recovered. The market value of the painting is still being
determined, but unofficial estimates have ranged from $500,000 to
over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Monica Dugot of the Holocaust Claims Processing
Office in New York, spoke to the Hainisch sisters, who are in their
80s and living in Austria, and told them of the North Carolina
museum's decision. ``They are ecstatic,'' Dugot said. ``The
acknowledgment that this painting belonged to their family meant a
huge injustice could be corrected during their lifetime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dugot said that similar claims had been made about artwork in
the collections of other American museums, but that this was the
first time she knew of that a resolution had been reached without
legal action. ``I hope this sets an example for other U.S. and
European museums,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Constance Lowenthal, director of the Commission for Art
Recovery, which is based in New York, said, ``It's a very exciting
development to realize that a museum can review a claim rationally
and politely, without throwing up legalistic defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the North Carolina museum said they were asking the
Hainisch sisters to consider letting the museum keep the painting
and develop an exhibit around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People could learn a lot from this painting,'' Coffey said.
And its lessons are all the more poignant, he added, considering
``the contrast between the painting's exquisite beauty and
spirituality, and its past as an object that was witness to one of
the most tragic moments in human history.''

NEW CONFERENCE CENTER SYMBOLIZES MORMON GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In October 1867, when the now-famous Mormon
Tabernacle opened, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints created a traffic jam of horse-drawn carts on
nearby dirt streets as they arrived for the first church conference
held within.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, under a ceiling supported by hand-hewn beams and wooden
pegs, the Mormon prophet, Brigham Young, marveled at being able to
speak to so many people _ 6,000 bunched together on pine-wood pews
_ under a single roof.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when the Mormon Church counted barely 81,000
members, a pioneer population largely confined to territorial Utah,
whose remoteness was as yet unbroken by the transcontinental
railroad.
</P>
<P>
   In two months, in a historically resonant move, the church will
open a vast new Conference Center to replace the venerable
Tabernacle as a site for the semiannual church conferences. The new
building's great size and technological sophistication offer
symbolic testimony to how far Mormonism has come from being a
frontier faith to a global religion. The church is entering its
third century with nearly 11 million members, more of them outside
the United States than within, the result in large part of the
proselytizing of 60,000 young missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Center has risen on a 10-acre city block across
from Temple Square, home to the Tabernacle, with its rounded roof,
and the Salt Lake City Temple. Sheathed in local granite and
designed with straight lines and right angles, it rises about 70
feet above street level. Its roof is being landscaped as a park,
with a channel through which water will flow to the building's
front and cascade down in a waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   But the most impressive dimension lies within the 1.4
million-square-foot interior, where an auditorium of 21,000 seats
makes the center one of the world's largest religious buildings.
``It's about the size of a contemporary arena,'' said Thomas
Hanson, the project's manager. (Madison Square Garden's main arena
seats about 20,000.)
</P>
<P>
   One church-prepared diagram shows the outline of a Boeing 747
fitting into the space between the seats and the rear of the stage.
Booths near the ceiling will provide space for translators to
render church leaders' speeches in 60 languages, to be heard
through headphones in the seats below.
</P>
<P>
   The building is scheduled for use April 1, for the next
conference, just days short of the 170th anniversary of the upstate
New York meeting where Joseph Smith, with a handful of others,
organized the church that has since proclaimed its teachings as the
restoration of true Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the beliefs that sets Mormonism apart, Smith said he
had been guided by an angel to uncover a divinely inspired account
of an ancient American society, which had received a visit from the
resurrected Jesus. The church regards the Book of Mormon as
Scripture, ``another testament,'' along with the Bible. It has
published 94 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   The conference center caps the church's extraordinary growth in
the 1990s, when membership increased by more than a third. Of 10.7
million Mormons on church rolls, 5.6 million, or 53 percent, live
outside the United States, mostly in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop H. David Burton, who as presiding bishop holds a post
roughly equivalent to chief operating officer, estimated that the
church had 1,400 capital projects under way worldwide (double the
number a decade ago), including new buildings, renovations and
expansion of existing structures. ``I don't think you're going to
see a breathing point,'' he said. ``The church is growing at such a
rate that it's really practically geometric.''
</P>
<P>
   The work includes construction of temples, central to Mormon
faith and closed to outsiders. There, members in good standing
perform rites like having their marriages ``sealed for eternity''
and vicarious baptisms for the dead, duties stemming from church
teachings that families exist in the afterlife and the spirits of
those who died without converting still possess the free will to
choose the faith.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1980, the church's 150th anniversary, there were 17
temples. Two weeks ago, Mormon officials dedicated the 70th. Burton
said there would very likely be 100 by the end of the year,
although many are being built to a smaller plan than the older
ones.
</P>
<P>
   What all this costs remains undisclosed. The church keeps its
finances secret. Officials credit the generosity of members with
the building success. The members are encouraged to tithe, to
donate 10 percent of their income to the church, a principle shared
by many evangelical and some mainline Protestant churches. A recent
book, ``Mormon America'' (HarperCollins), by Richard and Joan
Ostling, estimates that the tithing generates more than $5 billion
annually for the church. Church officials have said the figure is
too high.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also declined to disclose the price of the
conference center. But a local newspaper, The Salt Lake Tribune,
has reported the cost at about $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   What is probably of greater moment to the church is the center's
religious dimension. The church teaches that its president is a
living prophet, who, with his two counselors and the dozen men who
make up the next tier of authority, the Quorum of the 12 Apostles,
receives revelation about the church directly from God. Because of
that, the conferences carry a special spiritual intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mormons, said Richard E. Turley Jr., managing director of
the church's historical department, ``the general feeling is, if
you want to understand the will of the Lord to his people, attend
the General Conference.'' For those who cannot, the speeches _ 30
or more, delivered over two days _ are reprinted in the church
magazine, posted on the Internet and recorded on cassette tapes and
compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Tabernacle _ a National Historic Landmark since 1970
_ it will remain open to the public, church officials said, still
home to the 335-member choir that began in Brigham Young's time and
eventually made the building famous.

PRESSURE GROWING ON FORBES TO DROP OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Steve Forbes, who promotes his business acumen on the
campaign trail, the calculation is a tough one. Already, Forbes has
spent $28.7 million of his own money on his presidential effort _
not including the bills still to come from the contests in New
Hampshire and Iowa. And all that this money has garnered is 55,880
votes _ with half from a race that was only symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Even with so much money spent for so few votes, Forbes said he
would press on with his campaign at least until the March 7 Super
Tuesday primaries. Only after that, said William Dal Col, Forbes'
campaign manager, ``will we begin to review'' whether to stay in
the race. ``Right now, we don't talk about it,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, others do. Voices are being raised in conservative
circles suggesting that Forbes withdraw, by people who fear he will
continue to pull votes away from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in
Bush's race with Sen. John McCain of Arizona. An editorial in the
Feb. 21 issue of The National Review, a conservative magazine that
has championed Forbes, called for him to quit. ``It's time for
Steve Forbes to pull out,'' declared the editorial, saying that
Forbes has ``not lit the fires'' and has become ``merely a
distracting figure on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other conservatives are saying the same. Jack Kemp, an
ideological and personal friend of Forbes, endorsed Bush just
before the New Hampshire primary. And Ralph Reed, the former leader
of the Christian Coalition and a Bush supporter, has publicly
criticized Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be increasing pressure on Mr. Forbes to get out,''
Reed said in an interview. ``By running negative attacks, he has
only succeeded in hurting the front-runner and it is self-evident
he has not helped himself. He is playing the same role he did in
1996, as the spoiler in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that the longer Forbes stays in, the more he takes
votes from Bush, forcing Bush to engage in distracting and costly
battles. In Iowa, for instance, Forbes' fiery anti-abortion talk
raised an issue Bush would have preferred to avoid and resulted in
Bush's responding with a hard-line anti-abortion position that
could cost him moderate votes in the fall, should Bush be the
Republican Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Forbes' presence in the race forces Bush to conduct a
two-front war _ fighting McCain for votes on the Republican left
and Forbes on the right. And unlike socially conservative
candidates like Gary L. Bauer, who withdrew from the race on
Friday, or Alan Keyes, Forbes can use a personal fortune of more
than $440 million to match Bush's considerable campaign war chest
dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder whether, at this point, Forbes will stay in the race
merely to help destroy George W. Bush,'' said Larry Sabato, a
political science professor at the University of Virginia. ``The
odds are that most of the votes Forbes is getting would go to Bush
in a two-man race of Bush and McCain. There is no question Forbes
dislikes Bush. Forbes' calculus is that he can stay in, spend more
of his children's money and help defeat the candidate he hates,
which is George W. Bush, or he could cut his tremendous losses and
get out now. He would relish being given substantial credit for
Bush's defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist who heads his own
Washington lobbying firm, said: ``Steve Forbes injected fresh ideas
into the public debate, but the longer he stays in, the more people
will think he is a spoiler, and people do not like spoilers. It's
not as if Forbes is giving voice to a broad swatch of
disenfranchised voters. To many people, he seems to be on a bit of
an ego trip. If he doesn't realize his time has passed, he will
hurt himself.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is no love lost between the Forbes and Bush
campaigns. Hardly a day goes by on the campaign trail when Forbes
does not take shots at Bush. While campaigning last week in
Delaware, he proclaimed Bush's 19-point loss to McCain in New
Hampshire as proof that ``George W. Bush's campaign is melting
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will continue to be Forbes' main target, Dal Col of the
Forbes campaign said: ``Bush is still the front-runner and he's
still the one candidate we will get our votes from.''
</P>
<P>
   In the New Hampshire primary and the Iowa caucuses, Forbes kept
up this drumbeat of criticism. He flooded airwaves with television
advertisements critical of Bush's politics in Texas. His radio
advertisements attacked Bush as a ``pro-life pacifist'' and as
someone who ``has taken millions from Washington interests and
lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, groups friendly to the Bush campaign struck
back. The Republican Leadership Council, an independent Republican
group, showed television advertisements criticizing Forbes for
being critical of Bush. And Bob Dole, the former Republican
presidential nominee whom Forbes had harshly attacked with negative
advertisements in the 1996 Republican primary, took out
advertisements in The Des Moines Register and made television
commercials chastising Forbes for attacking Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Forbes, stop the negative ads,'' said the Dole commercial,
which said Forbes' 1996 attacks on Dole left him ``battered,
bruised and broke.'' The advertisement concluded by imploring
Forbes, ``Don't help the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all this byplay between Forbes and Bush, polls taken
in New Hampshire before and after that state's primary showed that
part of the reason that Forbes did so poorly there _ he came in
third with 13 percent of the vote, just a point above his 1996
showing _ had more to do with a lack of interest in Forbes himself
than anything else. McCain won the primary with 49 percent of the
vote, while Bush took 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to McCain and Bush, who both elicited far more
positive than unfavorable opinions among those asked in a CBS poll
taken the day before the primary, Forbes had just the opposite: 47
percent of those polled had a negative view of him, while 25
percent had a positive view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes' tax message is out of date,'' said Lynn Vavreck,
assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College. ``And he's
a Johnny-come-lately on social conservative issues. Forbes may
suffer when people look at his personal attributes _ he has never
held office before. When you listen to McCain, the message is broad
and deep and inspirational. Forbes has a narrow message. It's just
think about your own self-interest and that we need a tax plan to
protect your self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those New Hampshire voters who said they liked Forbes' core
conservative stances _ anti-tax, anti-abortion _ often voted for
McCain or Bush. Surveys taken by the Voter News Service, a
consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press,
showed that of New Hampshire voters who said they were members of
the religious right, 37 percent voted for Bush while 15 percent
voted for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Forbes do much better among those seeking to make
abortion illegal, a centerpiece of his campaign: 33 percent of
those polled who supported that position said they voted for Bush,
compared with 20 percent for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Forbes' signature anti-tax theme failed to rouse voters.
The CBS pre-election poll showed that more than half _ 53 percent _
of those questioned said they preferred the current federal
graduated income tax plan, while 40 percent said they preferred
Forbes' proposed flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   On primary day, those voters helped Forbes, though barely. The
voter surveys showed that of those voters who said the most
important issue was taxes, 35 percent voted for Forbes, 31 percent
for Bush and 29 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know who these Forbes supporters are,'' Ms.
Vavreck said. ``Even on a lot of his issues, voters went for
someone else.''

WHEN PLUMBING 101 BECOMES A REQUIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.C., Vt., Tenn.)  (jw) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ When her beeper went off on a Friday night in
November, Clair Jenne, an art student, was in a studio here at
Warren Wilson College, applying charcoal to a giant canvas
depicting the central female relationships in her life.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from campus security, and it was urgent. So Jenne,
a 23-year-old senior from Chapel Hill, dropped her pencils and
walked briskly through the Blue Ridge mountain air to the front
door of the campus building to which she had been summoned.
</P>
<P>
   There, she pulled out a handful of tools and delicately picked
the lock, so that a security officer, who did not have a key, could
get in. She then returned to her senior art project.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical evening at Warren Wilson College, where Jenne
is both an exhibited artist and the campus locksmith, and where she
and each of the 679 other students are required to work at least 15
hours a week for four years as a condition of obtaining a degree in
the liberal arts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, the emphasis on community service has
grown exponentially on college campuses across the country, as well
as at elementary, middle and high schools. But few colleges have
taken the step of requiring service for all _ afraid, no doubt,
that they would lose applicants, said Douglas M. Orr Jr., president
of Warren Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other universities, where students on financial aid fill
the jobs in the cafeteria and library, Warren Wilson also has
students doubling as the campus garbage collectors, plumbers,
electricians, custodians, security officers, mechanics and
landscapers, regardless of family income.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the college president, the professors and several
deans, the students are virtually the only employees on the payroll
at Warren Wilson. And it has been that way since 1894, when the
college was founded by Presbyterian missionaries as a school for
poor boys from Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   Though its niche in the academy may be offbeat, Warren Wilson is
not alone. Six other small liberal arts colleges require all
students to work on campus; the latest is Sterling College in
Craftsbury, Vt., which instituted a work requirement for its
students last year. An eighth college, Knoxville in Tennessee, is
weighing a similar mandate.
</P>
<P>
   As at those other so-called work colleges, administrators at
Warren Wilson say their primary motivation is to combine a rigorous
academic curriculum emphasizing English and science with life
lessons rarely offered on more conventional campuses. Students at
Warren Wilson talk a lot about how the work of even one individual
contributes something to society, about the importance of treating
everyone equally and about the pride that is instilled by learning
a trade or doing a menial, but valuable, task.
</P>
<P>
   And students and professors say that learning these timeless
teachings has taken on new importance in a fast-paced information
age. Applications to Warren Wilson, and to other work colleges,
have been rising steadily in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got these things that they do in life that give
them a sense of identity,'' said Jenne, whose father is an
assistant director of a political institute at the University of
North Carolina and whose mother oversees a nursery school at a
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as an artist and a locksmith, and here I can be
both,'' she said. ``I think a liberal arts education is less about
learning how to do what you're going to do in the world, and more
about learning how to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The two hats worn by Jenne hardly stand out here.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, when the temperature was below zero, the
three students who rode a beat-up pickup truck across campus
collecting garbage were two prospective elementary school teachers
and an aspiring journalist. Later, a 20-year-old pre-law student,
lay in a puddle of water beneath the sink in an old science lab,
disconnecting the pipes. Above her, a 21-year-old senior who wants
to be an outdoor-recreation educator disassembled the electrical
wires from a wall-mounted fan.
</P>
<P>
   As they work on their respective crews, the students are
supervised by people licensed in the trades, who pick up a hammer
or wrench only for purposes of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing all 111 crews is an administrator known, in all
seriousness, as the dean of work.
</P>
<P>
   He is Ian Robertson, a native of England whose college major was
pig husbandry and who was hired at Warren Wilson 19 years ago to
supervise the campus garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is Robertson who must encourage students who do not get the
assignments of their choice to stick with the program. Seniors, who
get first pick, usually snap up jobs on the campus farm or as
landscapers; freshmen are often stuck washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   For some, there is a financial incentive. The annual tuition,
room and board at Warren Wilson, after student salaries are
applied, cost $15,572, half as much as at some other private
colleges. Warren Wilson, with a modest endowment of $31 million,
saves as well, because everyone is paid the same: minimum wage,
with no raises, so no one can pull rank.
</P>
<P>
   Though almost none of the students enter the trades in which
they are trained, most describe a deep, newfound kinship with
blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   When Kari Christin, 19, a freshman from the Upper West Side of
Manhattan who collects garbage on campus, returned home for
Christmas break, she said she wanted to give cookies to the
sanitation workers who serve her block, but could not find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my friends at home I'm a garbage man, and they just
sort of laugh,'' said Christin, an aspiring teacher who has bulked
up her 90-pound frame considerably after lifting so many heavy
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Wilson College, named for a 19th-century minister, no
longer has a formal religious affiliation and now draws students
from 45 states, across a broad socioeconomic spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Applications have nearly doubled over the last decade to 886 and
the average College Board score of accepted students at Warren
Wilson, where tie-dyed shirts and scraggly beards are not uncommon,
is a respectable 1,149, out of a possible 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   To be certain that its students know what they are getting into,
the cover of the Warren Wilson catalog blares, ``We're not for
everyone.'' Even so, about 30 percent of students transfer or drop
out after freshman year _ the national average, for four-year
colleges, is 16 percent _ often because they have fallen behind in
their work or studies, which can be a challenge to juggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents love the work program,'' Orr says. ``Not every
18-year-old is ready to make that commitment.''

A KALEIDOSCOPIC LOOK AT ATTITUDES ON GAY MARRIAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ Imagine, nearly four hours of State House
testimony late into the night and not a moment of tedium, not a
single slide into the low-level murmur that means the chamber's
attention has drifted, not a seat or a spot on a railing left
vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the experience of watching the mass public hearings that
the Vermont Legislature has held twice in the last two weeks on how
it should respond to the State Supreme Court's ruling that gay
couples must be granted the same rights and benefits as other
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the widespread fascination stems from the importance of
the events: Vermonters take seriously the possibility that theirs
will be the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. Vermont was
the first state to outlaw slavery, some point out, and it could be
on the verge of a similar act of moral leadership. Others warn that
the state risks degenerating into the next Sodom.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearings also fascinate in that, with scores of citizens
testifying for two minutes each, they provide a kaleidoscopic look
at current attitudes toward the country's decade-long debate over
gay marriage. And those attitudes are full of parallel arguments
and competing claims.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the effect of a long marriage on a man's thinking:
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday night's televised hearing, one man argued that his
marriage of 39 years convinced him that marriage was meant to be
only between a man and a woman. ``No matter how far back it goes,
to the Bible, marriage has been one man, one woman. That's all. Not
one man, one man, one woman, one woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But another man, Kenneth Wolvington, said, ``Mrs. Wolvington and
I have been married for 52 years'' and ``for the life of us, we
can't imagine how gay marriage would adversely affect anyone in our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the question of Scripture:
</P>
<P>
   Those who spoke against gay marriage, repeatedly cited a verse
in Leviticus that calls sex between men ``an abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God's words were that some sexual relations were indeed
immoral,'' Jon Freeman said, arguing that children should be taught
the difference between moral and immoral behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A Unitarian who spoke pointed out that the Bible cannot always
be taken by its ancient word in this modern time: for example, he
noted, it condoned slavery, which no one today would justify. The
central tenet in the Bible, he said, is to love your neighbor as
yourself _ whether or not your neighbor is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Weighty political questions are also at play in the debate,
among them, the separation of church and state, and the issue of
when a majority's opinion should be overridden in favor of a
minority's rights.
</P>
<P>
   A proponent of gay marriage argued that ``the state is not in
the business of giving people their morality,'' it is meant ``to
pass laws based on what's good for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opposing gay marriage argued that the nation's founders
established the country based on Judeo-Christian morality, and that
the morality inherent in the biblical concept of marriage could not
be separated from the law.
</P>
<P>
   The question of majority versus minority stems in part from a
poll indicating that most Vermonters disapprove of the idea of gay
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Those who back gay marriage recalled past racial issues: Most
Americans did not support ending the ban on interracial marriages,
they said, and school integration was not supported by most
Southerners, yet the courts are now deemed right in both mandates
because they protected the rights of a minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is similar to the objections to interracial marriages a
few decades ago,'' Molly Goldberg, a high school student, said.
``Lawmakers had to move one step ahead of the people and pave the
way for more tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gay marriage countered that the question of gay
marriage was so important to so many that the truly democratic
method would be to put it to a popular vote in the state, through a
referendum on a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the people answer this issue,'' Anthony Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Charlesworth argued: ``The government is responsible
for protecting minorities. It's not responsible for imposing
minority values on the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Even nature came into the argument, used by each side. An
opponent of gay marriage remarked that ``each fall, we see the
majestic white-tailed buck chasing and mating with females, not
with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   One backer of gay marriage countered that if procreation were
the point of marriage, infertile couples would not be allowed to
wed. Several lesbians testified that they had not chosen to be gay,
but that they now had relationships every bit as committed as any
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are debating is not just policy and law,'' said Susan
Clark, ``what you are debating is my life, my partner's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides also disagreed over the best analogies for the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents said gay marriage should be compared to polygamy,
or worse:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not homophobes,'' one man said, ``We'd be equally
offended by attempts to legislate incest, rape or child
molestation.'' (That remark drew the only muffled groan of the
evening from the gay marriage camp.)
</P>
<P>
   Backers of gay marriage drew parallels most often to the
struggle for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, both sides argued that the future of the state, its
children, and more, were at stake. One opponent of gay marriage
said that ``the downfall of every civilization is preceded by
homosexuality.'' Others predicted an influx of gays into the state,
which, they asserted, would damage its moral fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gay marriage called for leading the way to improve
the climate for gay men and lesbians who now fear persecution, and
for allowing Vermont's children to grow up in a state that does not
discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope,'' said Julie Wilson, who runs a high school
gay-straight alliance, ``is that my students, when they're old
enough to be married, will be able to marry whoever they want.''

EX-OFFICIAL KEEPS PENTAGON'S CLEARANCE AFTER LOSS OF CIA'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the former director of central
intelligence, John Deutch, had his security clearances revoked by
the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency, he has kept a security
clearance at the Pentagon, a senior Defense Department official
says.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's intelligence clearances were revoked last year because
he had violated security rules by keeping classified information on
computers at his house that were connected to the Internet, making
them vulnerable to entry by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not taken similar action in part because it has
not been given the CIA's report that resulted in the action against
Deutch, the Defense Department official said. The Pentagon asked
for the report some time ago, the official said, but he added that
he did not know exactly when.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's case has received considerable attention since it was
revealed last week that the CIA's inspector general had concluded
that top officials impeded an internal investigation into Deutch's
case. In addition, members of Congress have questioned why Deutch
was treated differently from Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at a weapons
laboratory who has been accused of keeping nuclear secrets on an
unsecure computer.
</P>
<P>
   The current director of central intelligence, George Tenet, came
under heavy questioning about his handling of the matter in two
days of testimony last week. Tenet said Deutch's behavior was
different because there was no evidence that he had intended to aid
a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet acknowledged that his agency had been slow in notifying
Congress and the Justice Department about Deutch's case. But in two
days of congressional testimony, Tenet did not mention that Deutch
had been allowed to keep a Pentagon security clearance. The
Pentagon disclosed it in answer to questions by The Washington
Post, which reported it on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The clearance is a limited one, a Pentagon official said, what
he called an ``industrial clearance.'' It allows Deutch to work on
specific Defense Department contracts for Raytheon, SAIC Corp. and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Deutch teaches.
The Pentagon official said the clearance did not give Deutch access
to a wide range of intelligence information. Deutch was the deputy
secretary of defense, the No. 2 position at the Pentagon, from 1994
until May 1995, when he was confirmed as director of central
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to become secretary of defense in President Clinton's
second term, and when he did not get that post, he stepped down as
head of the CIA in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Under agency regulations, Deutch should have turned over the
classified computers he had at his home. He told the agency he
wanted to keep them to conduct personal banking, and he was allowed
to keep them only after he managed to be hired as a consultant to
the agency. In a visit to Deutch's home, in December 1996, CIA
security officials found classified documents on the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a follow-up investigation, Deutch's security clearances
were revoked by Tenet, denying him access to a wide range of
intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges and issues at hand were very serious,'' Tenet
testified on Thursday in explaining why he had revoked Deutch's
security clearances. ``I took a tough decision to indefinitely
suspend John's clearances.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of a reciprocal arrangement with the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Deutch also lost his security clearance there,
the Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutch kept the more limited security clearance. The
Pentagon official said a higher standard of proof was required
before this clearance could be revoked, partly, he said, because it
affected Deutch's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Pentagon had no evidence that Deutch had
violated any security regulations when he had been at the Pentagon,
and that the Pentagon had not seen the CIA's evidence. As a result,
he said, there was no basis for revoking Deutch's industrial
clearance.

<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ As a professional basketball player, Bill
Bradley had a reputation for being a stealthy fouler, brilliant at
holding, hooking and elbowing his opponents without getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   Watching his increasingly bruising battle with Vice President Al
Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination, one can get the
feeling that he is trying to use the same nuanced tactics in the
political arena.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for instance, Bradley asked more than 400 people at
the University of Maryland why they thought trust in government had
fallen so low. ``Let's look at what has happened since 1974,''
Bradley said, hinting that he was about to wallop Gore by
cataloging the Clinton administration's ethical problems, from lost
FBI files to Whitewater to campaign finance abuses in 1996 to
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley slammed the last two Republican presidents,
Ronald Reagan and George Bush, then made passing reference to
``fund-raising scandals, partisanship and negative campaigning''
over the past decade. But he offered no specifics.
</P>
<P>
   So, was an elbow thrown at the Clinton-Gore administration or
not?
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were unsure and asked Bradley's press secretary, Eric
Hauser, to elaborate after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about an essential pattern of distrust that
comes from people not having enough faith in presidential
leadership or at least governmental leadership,'' Hauser replied.
``I suspect over time that we'll return to that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it excessive polling, excessive fund-raising or what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the elements that are contributing to public
skepticism about the state of politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And are those things integral to the Clinton administration,
which just happens to have been in power in 7 of the last 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is that changing it is integral to the
Bradley administration,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The elbow was cocked, but not thrown. No harm, no foul.
</P>
<P>
   Later in his speech, Bradley took a clearer pop at Gore, reading
from a 1991 newspaper article in which Gore was reported to have
said, ``You have to rip your opponent's lungs out and then move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The watchwords of this kind of politics is attack, deny,
distort,'' Bradley said. ``It's the old politics that says the ends
justify the means, any means to win the election. And the end is
holding power, and not exercising power to do good.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he asserted that students at the University of New
Hampshire, considered a bastion of Bradley support, had been
intimidated from voting in the nation's first primary on Tuesday by
being told by unnamed ``state officials'' that they might lose
scholarship money if they registered as New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offered no proof of the accusation, although his aides
later pointed to a news story citing complaints from Bradley
supporters and some students. And he did not accuse the Gore
campaign of instigating any such intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley let the insinuation hang heavy. ``I look out there
and I can say, after a lot of these things I've just described, who
can blame your generation for the skepticism and cynicism that many
have toward politics?'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said they knew nothing about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also tried to draw parallels _ sometimes subtly,
sometimes overtly _ between Gore and President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate two weeks ago, Bradley said: ``When Al accuses me of
negative campaigning, that reminds me of the story about Richard
Nixon. They said Richard Nixon is the kind of politician who would
chop down a tree, then stand on the stump and give a speech about
conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech two days later, Bradley said: ``I think when you
listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very carefully. Because
old politics uses words in a very tricky manner.'' It sounded like
a veiled reference to the nickname ``Tricky Dick'' used by some of
Nixon's critics.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday in California, Nixon's home state, Bradley fell
prey to his own analogy.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the microphone before a large audience in San
Francisco, Bradley raised both hands in a salute that almost looked
like Nixon's signature two-handed victory wave. Catching himself,
Bradley said, with a smile: ``I shouldn't do that. That might be
dangerous. I should just do that with one hand.'' He added, ``That
might remind people of somebody here in California. A guy they've
been trying to forget in California for a long time.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Jet stream winds from the northwest will dominate the nation
from the Rockies to the Atlantic Seaboard. As a result, dry and
seasonable conditions will prevail in many sections. A surge of
arctic air into New England will retreat as surface winds shift and
begin to blow from the southwest. Morning readings will be near
zero in northern sections and brisk breezes will cause hazardous
chill factors early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure moving from the Tennessee Valley to the
Southeast Coast will promote very chilly readings in the Gulf
states and northern Florida. Freezing temperatures will be noted
along the coast and as far south as Orlando. However, sunny skies
and gentle breezes will allow more seasonal readings by afternoon.
A moistening onshore flow will produce clouds in southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer weather will surge northward into the western Plains,
though clouds will quickly gather in the central sections as chilly
air over the snow-covered areas slowly moves away. Temperatures
will rise above seasonal levels in the northern Plains and Middle
West despite a freshening wind and patches of high clouds.
</P>
<P>
   A large fair weather system settled over the central Rockies
will provide protection from precipitation for much of the interior
West, but clouds will be broken across most of the northern and
central sections. The Southwest will be bright and warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will push inland from northwest California to the
Washington coast. Some snow will fall in the northern Cascades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Freezes and Fires
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Deep South were warned this weekend about
hazards from both extremes of the temperature scale. Freeze
warnings were posted for north-central Florida as a surge of chilly
air reached the peninsula. A high fire danger was also posted from
east Texas along the Gulf Coast into parts of central Florida. The
recent spell of very dry weather has caused vegetation to shrivel
and an arid air mass aided by gusty winds will further dry out the
underbrush Sunday. Most of the Gulf Coast has had less than 50
percent of its normal rainfall so far this winter.

 &HT;    SCHOOLCHILDREN FED CHICKEN FROM DISEASED POULTRY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) national categories
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 6
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOAZ, Alabama _ Schoolchildren in 31 states are being fed
chicken nuggets made in part from diseased poultry, according to
several federal food safety inspectors at two Alabama processing
plants where the food is prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors say the chicken nuggets will not hurt anyone because
humans do not get poultry diseases, but they argue the food is not
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skin's got sores and bruises and things on it,'' explained
Ellen Dingler, a federal food safety inspector at a Gold Kist
poultry processing plant here. ``They mix that with the meat and
it's called 'binder.' So I won't eat a chicken nugget or a pressed
patty or anything because of that. Because that skin is mixed in
with it and it's got sores.''
</P>
<P>
   Other inspectors described chickens with tumors or coated with
pus moving unhindered down the processing line where they are
eventually turned into chicken nuggets or other processed chicken
products.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Gold Kist headquarters in Atlanta did not respond
to repeated requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   John McCutcheon, who oversees the U.S. Agriculture Department's
food safety inspectors, said the government does not want diseased
poultry going to consumers. But he acknowledged his agency approves
a plant's product even though half the carcasses may have sores,
scabs or some kinds of infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the questions is, 'Are birds with sores and scabs being
passed and getting the mark of inspection', the answer is yes,''
McCutcheon said. But he said that even with ``100 percent
inspection'' diseased birds would still slip through.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCutcheon faulted any inspectors who see
diseased poultry and do not condemn it. ``When you know a carcass
has a condition on it that shouldn't go into commerce,'' McCutcheon
said, ``we expect our inspectors to act immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors see this as the government being deceptive. ``The
agency is speaking out of both sides of their mouth,'' complained
one inspector. ``They are saying the regulations are still in place
and (diseased poultry) ought to be thrown away. But if it does go
to the consumer it will not hurt you. Just cook it properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors blame the conditions at the two plants on a
four-month-old experimental federal food surveillance program that
effectively turns over poultry inspection to the company. Under the
old system still used at most plants, inspectors who monitor the
slaughter operation are expected to look at every carcass and can
order the company to correct problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Inspectors) are frustrated over what they are seeing (in the
new inspection program).'' said Stan Painter, president of Local
2357 of the National Joint Council of Food Inspectors that
represents government inspectors at the plants. Painter is himself
an inspector. ``They are frustrated over what is going on and they
are frustrated that they cannot do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the inspectors, truckloads of live chickens first
go to the Gold Kist plant in Boaz which uses the traditional
poultry inspection program. If diseased birds begin turning up,
inspectors can slow the production line to make more thorough
checks.
</P>
<P>
   When the line slows in Boaz, inspectors say birds are trucked to
Gold Kist's Guntersville plant 15 miles away. There the plant is
operating under the experimental inspection program begun last
October that gives the company responsibility for examining their
own product. In Guntersville the company regulates the line speed
and culls out diseased birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minute of the day, diseased product is going down the
line (in Guntersville),'' Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Guntersville inspectors said that the amount of diseased
product leaving the plant has increased by 50 per cent because of
the experimental program. One inspector estimated that about 18,000
carcasses out of approximately 185,000 with diseases, scabs or
sores are shipped from Guntersville every day. Painter said that,
based on inspections he has seen, he estimates 20 to 30 percent of
the product leaving the plant is diseased.
</P>
<P>
   However, inspectors acknowledged this was only an educated
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Even inspectors who say they support the experimental inspection
program are dismayed by what they are seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no control,'' said one inspector who asked not to be
named. While he agrees with the goal of making the company take
greater responsibiity for producing safe products, he said,
``Action needs to be taken if stuff fails. But we can't make them
(the company) take any action.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon said it is important to give the company an
opportunity to correct production problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to them to decide what they want to do as a corrective
action. We don't want to enter into and interfere with their system
`` McCutcheon said. The inspector is only supposed to observe what
action the company takes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the chickens are slaughtered, cleaned and boxed at
Guntersville, they are returned to the Boaz plant where they are
cut up and turned into chicken nuggets. The federal government's
Agriculture Commodities Program then buys the nuggets and gives
them away to schools around the country. Federal records also show
chicken being purchased directly from Guntersville for the school
lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   Meat industry spokesmen say inspectors are speaking out because
they fear losing their jobs as companies begin monitoring
themselves. But Felicia Nestor, a lawyer with the Government
Accountability Project (GAP) in Washington, a consumer group that
protects whistle blowers, claims the government has already pledged
to switch inspectors to new jobs rather than fire them.
</P>
<P>
   She also said it is ``very unusual'' for inspectors like the
ones in Alabama to speak out because she said the Agriculture
Department has a history of punishing whistle blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Painter agreed that the government tries to silence inspectors,
saying ``If you speak out, they will get you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials say inspectors can talk to the
press as long as they make clear they are speaking as private
citizens and not in their official capacity.
</P>
<P>
   All the inspectors were clearly uncomfortable talking to a
reporter. Some asked not to be named for fear of retaliation and
others repeatedly emphasized they were speaking as private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   An inspector in the Guntersville plant, who did not want his
name used, said he estimates that about half of the birds coming
into the plant are diseased.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run `em just like all the others. They are just processed
out. Gold Kist has a. . .problem. They have a lot of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Smalley, a chicken grower in the Guntersville area and a
member of the Gold Kist board of directors, denied the company had
a problem with diseased birds. But other local growers, as well as
inspectors, said flocks in the area, which are the primary source
of chickens at the plants, have been ravaged by various infections.
</P>
<P>
   George Timmerman, a local grower, said that suddenly two years
ago various diseases began decimating his and other flocks in the
area. One farmer said the number of chickens dying from disease in
one of his flocks jumped from around 50 to 2300 out of a total of
about 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Government inspectors like Dingler and Diane Franklin, who also
works in the Boaz plant, said that over the last few years the
number of diseased birds reaching the plant has escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past couple of weeks it's been 90 percent,'' Dingler said.
``It's been really terrible. This is the worst that I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors said birds usually have either Airsacculitis, a
pneumonia-like infection, or Inflammatory Process, which is similar
to an infected cut. In both cases pockets of pus form in various
parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Airsacculitis) is an infection and pus can cover virtually
the entire cavity and in the severe stages it can be like a
jelly,'' Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon said he was unaware of a high incidence of disease
among birds coming into the plants. In fact, he said Guntersville
was chosen to test the new inspection program because they
slaughter young birds that are generally healthy. He said testing
the inspection program in plants that slaughter young, healthy
animals was a way of safeguarding the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Guntersville plant, inspectors say the new inspection
rules do not allow them to pick up a carcass and inspect it as it
moves along the line. Instead, company employees called ``sorters''
look for infected birds. But two times every shift, inspectors
said, they sample 10 carcasses as they come off the line. In this
instance, inspectors are allowed to actually pick up a carcass and
examine it for sores, scabs and infections.
</P>
<P>
   Painter said he kept track of these so-called ``10-bird''
examinations by inspectors for a three week period last October and
found 62 instances where inspectors detected everything ranging
from sores to infections.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a diseased bird is found, inspectors say little is
likely to happen. New government regulations permit the company to
find defective birds and still not flunk the ``10 bird check.'' The
experimental inspection system regulations say, for example, that
an inspector can find sores on 52 percent of the birds and the
company's product will still pass inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company fails the inspection, inspectors say nothing
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the plant and they say, 'OK.' Its up to them whether
they want to do another test. It doesn't do anything. We record it
on a sheet of paper and stick it in the drawer. Under the new
program we don't write them a non-compliance report like we used
to,'' a Guntersville inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   While they say more diseased carcasses are getting through the
Guntersville plant, inspectors said Gold Kist is condemning more
birds under the new inspection system than inspectors ever did when
they were in charge. Inspectors say this is because Gold Kist runs
its processing line at a much higher speed.
</P>
<P>
   After a chicken is slaughtered, the carcass is placed on a
conveyor belt. As the belt moves through the plant, different
machines remove feathers, guts, and wash the carcass. If defective
birds are found, they are removed from the line and sent to
reprocessing where workers cut away infected areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boaz plant the government will not permit this line to
run faster than 91 birds per minute. But in Guntersville, the
company sets the speed. Inspectors say the line typically runs at
105 birds per minute but has gone as high as 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are throwing away more birds than we did before because
they are running faster,'' said a Guntersville inspector. ``They
are throwing them away because at the speed they are going, their
salvaging and reprocessing lines overfill.''
</P>
<P>
   Painter said, ``The plants are condemning a lot of product. More
so than we were because they want those lines to run faster and
faster and faster.''

105 birds per minute but has gone as high as 130.

   ``They are throwing away more birds than we did before because
they are running faster,'' said a Guntersville inspector. ``They

   Painter said, ``The plants are condemning a lot of product. More
so than we were because they want those lines to run faster and
faster and faster.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid the feel-good vibes emanating through the sheen
of the National Basketball Association finals last June, Jeff Van
Gundy was still in character. More rumpled than bed sheets in the
morning, he peered through his raccoon eyes during a news
conference and uttered a line fit for a mob scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't get you on results, they get you on
relationships,'' Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, said before Game 3
against the San Antonio Spurs. ``So they're going to get you on
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, the remark was as unnecessarily rough
as a bouncer at a tea party. After all, no one had gotten Van
Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April, he survived the team's dysfunctional journey when
Ernie Grunfeld was sacrificed by Dave Checketts, the Garden's
president. In mid-May, he watched destiny fall his way on Allan
Houston's runner while Miami coach Pat Riley fell crestfallen.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June, Van Gundy coached a team hanging on by its
Band-Aids into the finals, knocking Indiana off its pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he had beaten everyone but David Robinson and Tim
Duncan. Van Gundy had dodged the bucking political beast inside
Madison Square Garden like a rodeo clown.
</P>
<P>
   After he dusted himself off last summer, Van Gundy signed a
contract extension and will earn $14 million over the next four
years. He knew the reward was coming, but he had also internalized
a tumultuous season. So on that June afternoon in San Antonio, he
had an untimely catharsis masked as paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my own way, I was probably giving it a `in your face' to
everybody,'' Van Gundy said. ``Hey, I'm being honest. That's what
it probably was. I was venting. Was it the wrong time? Yes. But the
difference is, when people hear something they don't agree with,
they instantly call it paranoia. If they walked in your shoes, and
knew what you had to deal with, they wouldn't see it as paranoia,
they'd see it as your take on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The take on Van Gundy has changed through his 11 years with the
Knicks. He is less the martyr now after his unlikely ascension from
assistant five years ago to the All-Star Game coach of the Eastern
Conference next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the romance of Van Gundy the Underdog has faded. As a
multimillionaire, his preference for hamburgers and shakes and
choice of driving a banged-up Honda aren't so blue collar anymore.
Over time, his grim referendums on his team have worn as thin and
transparent as cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   Even members of the organization have crossed their fingers for
a more positive approach. While he hasn't been confronted by team
officials directly, Van Gundy has taken some well-placed hints
about his dour demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about image, I think,'' Van Gundy said. ``I don't think
they should care. This is the way I coach. If it's worn out its
welcome, then they'll make a change. I am who I am. I coach the way
I coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he is still standing. Perhaps he has maneuvered through
the Garden politics by being a self-deprecating former college
honors student who outsmarted the system. Or maybe he is just an
example of how fine the line is between a skilled coach being
unemployed and being named to guide the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all fragile,'' he said. ``One bounce, one decision.''
</P>
<P>
   That one bounce came against the same Miami Heat team that will
visit Madison Square Garden Sunday afternoon. After Houston's
magical shot bounced off the rim and glass and was finally gulped
by the net, and the last-second shot by the Heat went awry, Van
Gundy wasn't celebrating the potential save of his job; he was
slinging his coat on the floor like a whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to kill the ref because of that last play,'' Van
Gundy said, referring to the excessive time Terry Porter got for
his last-second shot. ``But once I hit the locker room, I was happy
for the team. My job never entered my mind. Honest. For one thing,
I didn't think necessarily I'd get fired if we lost. Now, I will
say, the chances were pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a trip fantastic played out. But praise for that
achievement has been spare. At times, Van Gundy still finds himself
taking jabs from inside and outside the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot who told me this but it was another coach,'' Van
Gundy said. ``He said that each year you lose about 10 percent of
your support. So I figure, well, it's my 11th year, and I'm at a
negative 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   If Van Gundy's personality traits are considered to be his
shtick outside of his locker room, he can live with that. If his
team begins to tune him out, if he begins to lose the ears of his
players, there is a threat to his staying power. In every difficult
moment, his core players have huddled around him as tightly as a
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Often, there has been the unflagging support of Patrick Ewing.
When his Achilles' tendon was aching last year, part of the reason
Ewing said he kept playing was because Van Gundy's job was on the
line. When the truth about a meeting Checketts had with Phil
Jackson in April was disclosed, Ewing declared he wouldn't play for
the former Bulls coach.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ewing sulks over his diminished role and playing time and
hears his name bandied about amid trade exploration. This is new
territory for an aging superstar whose 15-year tie to the
organization has grown more frayed while his relationship with Van
Gundy has shown increasing signs of wear.
</P>
<P>
   It's a delicate situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read a book Bill Walsh wrote,'' Van Gundy said of the San
Francisco 49ers' former coach. ``One thing that stood out is the
one thing that applies to every coach: The hardest thing to do is
coach the star as he gets older. And Patrick has made it easy to
this point. My admiration for him hasn't changed, but I know that
he wants more. And I understand that. But I still, in my mind, have
to do what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy might resist the notion, but some of his players see
the coach's departure from a Ewing-based system as a sign of
progress. One Knick player sighed and said, ``It's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At his own pace, Van Gundy has adjusted to his ever-changing
personnel. Under his watch, the once passive Houston has developed
into an All-Star; the once impetuous Latrell Sprewell has morphed
into a team player and the once isolated Marcus Camby has been
brought into the fold as an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he told me he respected me as a player and a person,
everything was fine,'' Camby said, referring to a summertime
meeting he had with Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One thing has remained the same over the years: Van Gundy's
image as a players' coach. But he is not immune to criticism. When
the season hit a peak in tension last season _ with an inept 76-63
loss to Chicago on March 12 _ Van Gundy moved swiftly to waive the
happy-go-lucky Dennis Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff used me as a scapegoat,'' Scott said the night he was
cut. ``That's how he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Manipulator or not, Van Gundy has been effective. Not to say
that his players have not rolled their eyes at Van Gundy this
season, but the Knicks are currently neck-and-neck with the Heat
for the Atlantic Division lead. Something must still be working for
Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   It was much different last April. The newness of Knick
personnel, the severity of injuries and the crunch of the lockout
led to disarray behind the scenes and acrimony between management
and the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this about Ernie Grunfeld,'' Van Gundy said. ``The
relationship we had was never as bad as it was portrayed. We had
problems, but they were born from losing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks, strapped with the league's highest payroll, were
on the verge of collapse. Perhaps rationalizing his decision _
leaning on the something-has-to-change philosophy _ Checketts
picked Van Gundy over Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get lucky,'' Checketts said. ``I don't want to
rehash the past, but I have to say that Jeff had the respect of his
players.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What motivates Van Gundy is his relentless pursuit of winning.
To that end, some wonder if he does calculate every word when he
discusses the state of his team, an opponent or officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one took me to task for things earlier, when I was young,
saying things that were on my mind,'' Van Gundy said. ``All of this
has crept in recently. Think about it: I once called Michael Jordan
a con man. I was more up front then. People say they want honest,
but most of the time they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered the perils of honesty in January 1997. Van Gundy
walked into a food court at a mall in Indiana the night after
Jordan responded to the ``con man'' reference by scoring 51 points
in a 1-point victory by the Bulls over the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players saw me, and they were giving it to me like there
was no tomorrow,'' Van Gundy said. ``It was funny, but they were
letting me have it, like, `Couldn't you pick on somebody else?'''
</P>
<P>
   That is not his nature. Van Gundy is the same coach who lunged
in the middle of a fight between Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning
two years ago, grabbed onto the ankle of the Heat's center like a
terrier and held on for the humiliating ride. Has he grown from
each embarrassing experience? Has he changed or matured?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look at coaches and their ability to last in
New York, it's tough for a lot of reasons,'' Checketts said. ``But
we all have the ability to change and grow and remake ourselves.
I'm not saying he needs to do that, but I think he has done that in
a way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Van Gundy has. He has been more reserved this season.
But this year it is easier to measure his words and actions. The
Knicks are winning. There is no tension behind the scenes, and all
seems healthier under the guidance of general manager Scott Layden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott has a wonderful sense of humor and a great way with
people,'' Checketts said. ``Scott and Jeff have a great
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Van Gundy has an answer for this. ``Scott's new,'' he
said. ``He hasn't grown tired of me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in his rumpled blue sweats, with an unshaven chin,
he either meant what he said or he was just in character.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing after 11 years,'' Van Gundy said. ``No one
takes you at face value.''

DUNGY MAKES HARD BUT NECESSARY CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy should have enjoyed the
sun and fun of Hawaii this past week at the Pro Bowl. Instead, he
agonized over his decision to fire Mike Shula, his offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   For years, close friends have urged Dungy to make a change, but
Dungy has resisted because he is extremely loyal to his staff.
Shula has not been impressive. The offense did not score an
offensive touchdown in five games this season, and during Shula's
four seasons at the helm of the offense, it has never ranked higher
than 22nd in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers have won, especially this season, when Dungy led
the team to the conference title game and almost beat St. Louis on
the road, because of their great defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Dungy was prodded _ some around the league say
forced _ to fire Shula by Tampa Bay's management. Dungy was
heartbroken and released a statement saying, in part, that such
decisions were hard ``because it involves someone's livelihood and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy is one of those coaches whom people in the league office
like to see succeed. He is not ruthless or conniving as some head
coaches can be. Dungy is a nice person who is also a great coach.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are the decisions head coaches have to make to
improve a team. If an assistant isn't doing the job, he may have to
be cut loose. Dungy must realize that Tampa Bay would do the same
to him if he one day failed to cut it.
</P>
<P>
   XFL Seeking Credibility
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the World Wrestling Federation's new XFL football
league are expected to contact the former Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor to join the upstart league in some capacity. Taylor
may be asked to become a head coach, or even an executive.
</P>
<P>
   XFL officials may make a run at a number of former NFL stars,
like Mike Singletary or Jim Kelly, and use their names and star
power to add credibility to the league.
</P>
<P>
   Is the National Football League taking this new league
seriously? So far, not really. NFL officials are taking a
wait-and-see approach.

OUTSIDE THE NORM: THE MIND-SET OF ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Canada) (Eds.: Language in 30th graf may be offensive to some readers)

 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   Michael Miletic had recently finished his psychiatric residency
when he was called to the bedside of a young NHL player, barely
conscious in intensive care, who had swallowed an overdose of
sleeping pills, painkillers and anti-depressants. He was near death
when his fiancee found him.
</P>
<P>
   Miletic began treating him in the hospital. The player was eager
to talk about his suicide attempt. Under pressure from fans,
family, teammates, coaches and the news media, he said, he had lost
the key to his game, a fearsome slap shot. He wanted a quick fix,
the psychiatric equivalent of arthroscopic knee surgery, to get him
back on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   During a year of frequent face-to-face and telephone sessions
with Miletic, the player was able to rejoin the team and block out
enough negative emotions to reclaim some of his effectiveness. But
it would be another year before the psychiatrist, also a former
athlete ``raised in the culture of shame,'' as Miletic puts it, was
able to penetrate the hockey player's ``closely guarded mind'' and
discover the underlying cause of the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   In a shrink's version of ``Rocky,'' once the young player's
pattern of repetitive childhood trauma and its repressed rage,
guilt, shame and fear were revealed, he went on to become an
All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   The success of that therapy, a dozen years ago, began Miletic's
career as one of the few psychoanalysts currently treating active
professional and elite amateur athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Now 42 and in private practice in the Detroit suburb of
Birmingham, Mich., Miletic has been a psychiatric consultant to the
parents group of the N FL Players Association, to several NHL teams
and to the Detroit Pistons. He is also developing, in papers and
talks delivered at professional conferences, a psychological map of
the jock mind, which he believes operates differently from the
fan's mind. He theorizes that the highly adaptive abilities of
successful athletes were often formed to create a sense of
invulnerability in the face of early physical and emotional
hurdles. Thus, the seeds of success for some athletes _ perhaps as
well for some opera singers, police officers, test pilots, surgeons
_ are sown in trauma, often including physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now don't take this as a blanket statement,'' said Miletic
recently in his Birmingham office, ``but I have seen a significant
proportion of high-achieving athletes who have come out of abusive
homes. Their ability to block out pain and fear, to dissociate from
their emotions, comes from their adaptive tactics to the trauma of
their childhoods. It's a form of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hockey player stopped being able to hit the net with a
slap shot from the blue line, something he had done since he was a
peewee, because an emotional event was occurring that he was no
longer able to successfully dissociate. It was disguised and it
wasn't conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was willing to talk about his first psychiatric
case, so long as the hockey player's name and team were not
revealed, Miletic gingerly picked his way through the particulars
of more recent patients, who include high school and college
swimmers as well as pro hockey and basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Other than to say that the Pistons are ``a forward-looking
organization,'' and that his loyalty is to the individual players
that he treats, he will not discuss his relationship with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond routine confidentiality, he is concerned about
``appearing as a threat'' to his clients' near paranoia about
allowing people into their minds and of becoming vulnerable to
others. Like cops, doctors and soldiers, athletes tend to distrust
those who have not shared their shames and anxieties. Miletic says
he wins their trust by letting them know that he, too, has been in
the dark corners of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The grandson of Croatian and Polish immigrants, Miletic grew up
in Windsor, Ontario. At 14, he began serious strength training for
his main love, ice hockey, and for high school football at a gym
where Canadian weight-lifting champions also worked out. Miletic
liked the explosiveness of weight lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at 6 feet 2 inches and 242 pounds, he became a
member of the Canadian Olympic team. The same week in 1982 that he
graduated from the University of Western Ontario medical school, he
won a national title at 100 kilograms. After his internship, he
moved with the national team to Montreal but injured his hip just
before the 1984 Los Angeles Games. He was invited, he said, to go
with the team as a physician, but the disappointment was too
devastating. It was also time, he felt, to get on with his career.
</P>
<P>
   While practicing family and emergency medicine, Miletic
discovered he was more interested in his patients' stories than in
their physical diseases. He began a psychiatric residency at Wayne
State University in Detroit, the hometown of his first wife. He
trained at the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He had not considered sports psychiatry as a career path until
he was called to the bedside of the suicidal hockey player. Another
psychiatrist at the hospital had suggested to the player's mother
that Miletic, as a former athlete, might be able to reach her son.
</P>
<P>
   The player's willingness to be treated _ he asked his family to
leave the intensive care unit so he could talk to the young
psychiatrist _ and the superficiality of the insights he offered
turned out to be typical of Miletic's future athletic patients. So
was the thoughtfulness and enthusiasm; the player approached his
initial psychotherapy with the same work ethic he brought to
physical training.
</P>
<P>
   But he resisted the trip into his unconscious mind. The hockey
player ascribed his suicide attempt to outside pressures; the fans
and news media expected him to lead a subpar team racked by
dressing-room dissent. Because of this pressure, he said, he had
become so unsure of himself that he even suspected his fiancee of
having an affair with a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the second year of therapy that the player was
ready to deal with the repressed trauma that had led to his
breakdown. He had become anxious because he was soon to be married
and a father, and that had stirred old ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a lot of work,'' Miletic said, ``what we reconstructed
was that the act of standing at the blue line with a puck and with
a forward potentially charging at him brought back traumatic
memories of when he was _ he called it spanked; I would call it
beaten _ as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would remember someone approaching him with a stick or a
belt to hit him, his father or uncle. There would be a sudden
change in the way his body worked, he would experience acute
anxiety and he stopped being able to hit the net.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Miletic has treated a number of athletes
suddenly unable to complete a signature action, dunk a basketball,
fire a combination of punches, throw a strike. Invariably, they
came to him for some version of the cognitive-behavioral therapy
offered these days by many specialists in performance enhancement.
Frequently, they became analysands on a longer, scarier soul trek
that might not solve all their athletic problems but would surely
deal with their unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Because of managed care and drug therapy, psychoanalysis is no
longer in vogue. It is even more rare in sports, where the emphasis
is on short-term solutions to immediate crises. This has caused a
conflict of interest among some mental-health professionals
(including Miletic), be they evaluating prospects or counseling
suspects. They are torn between their responsibility to the patient
and their loyalty to the team. If Miletic's ideas about athletes
and early trauma ever lift from anecdote to data, it may help
create a productive discussion of the ethics of sports
psychologists and the responsibilities of teams and leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Such disparate recent cases as those of Leon Smith, the
19-year-old former high school basketball star and first-round pro
draft choice who attempted suicide; Bobby Phills, a veteran pro
basketball player who killed himself and injured two strangers
while drag-racing after practice; Ray Lewis, the Pro Bowl
linebacker who was charged with murder Monday in the slaying of two
people outside an Atlanta nightclub last Sunday night; Rae Carruth,
a pro football player accused of masterminding his girlfriend's
murder, and those self-destructors John Rocker, Lawrence Phillips,
Pete Rose and Mike Tyson, have raised the issue of the
mental-health needs of celebrity athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes' sense of ``agency'' _ their power to make changes by
their own actions _ is a two-edged sword, Miletic says. Athletes
have been conditioned to believe that if they do enough
repetitions, shoot enough baskets, they can overcome anything, from
poverty to injury. Yet a belief that serves them so well on the
field can be translated, Miletic says, to a sense of entitlement in
everyday life, a sense that they are above the law.
</P>
<P>
   It is a feeling too often reinforced by how they are treated, as
superior humans with extraordinary achievements. Rarely, until they
get into serious trouble, do fans, the news media, coaches and
management see them as fellow vulnerable humans with problems that
need to be faced.
</P>
<P>
   Miletic's ideas are too new in sports to have been reviewed in
context.
</P>
<P>
   Several mental health professionals interviewed expressed
interest but caution; the consensus was that Miletic's sample was
extremely narrow, and that most people are aware of their early
traumas.
</P>
<P>
   Miletic agrees, although he believes that most people are not
aware of, or discount, the continuing impact of their childhood
trauma. He says that he has a way to go to fully understand the
process by which athletes adapt to their trauma, how their
processes may be different from those of nonathletes or even why
athletes are so driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of their drivenness is their orientation to their
goal, their ability to focus,'' he said. ``The downside is they are
often emotionally constricted outside the white lines, with
superficial marriages and friendships. The only place where real
emotion can come out is on the playing field, where they can hug
and kiss and cry. The only time they feel alive is when they are
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole culture of the socialization of appearing
invulnerable that's put into play, almost automatically and
unconsciously by coaches and parents. For example, they've been
shamed, humiliated as wimps and pussies, if they show pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The end zone is one of the few places where athletes can feel
free to unabashedly express themselves, Miletic says. Celebratory
dances, demonstrations of affection, even throat-slashing gestures,
he says, are necessary emotional releases and forms of bonding
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean throat-slashing is healthy?
</P>
<P>
   Miletic laughs. ``Healthy is a tough word,'' he says. ``This is
where the concept of dissociation comes in. There is an aliveness
during the game. But to be in that state, you have to block
everything else out of your mind. When you are performing, playing,
attacking a defense, you are not thinking about your wife and kids
at home, your parents, your investments, the crowd, even pain. You
are only thinking about what you are doing. That is what I would
call healthy dissociation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game is over, the most healthy athletes _ from this
armchair I would think of Wayne Gretzky and Joe Montana _
dissociate themselves from the game and are able to shift back into
being husband, father, son, daughter, friend. However, there has
been a lot of pressure over a long period of time to be emotionally
constricted. No wonder so many are in trouble when they get hurt or
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Or when they get challenged off the field.

SPORTS COLUMN: ONE MAN THE CARTER MOVIE IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' is an acclaimed motion picture. Denzel
Washington, who portrays the wrongly convicted boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, won the Golden Globe for best actor in a
drama and is expected to be nominated for an Academy Award; the
movie might also be nominated for an Oscar. It's advertised as the
``most inspiring film of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just not the most truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the scenario is distorted, if not blatantly false and
inaccurate, from what happened in Carter's struggle for freedom
after having served nearly 20 years in New Jersey prisons, along
with John Artis, for the 1966 murder of three people in the
Lafayette Grill in Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay is based on two books: Carter's autobiography
that he wrote in prison, ``The 16th Round'' (Viking, 1974), and
``Lazarus and The Hurricane'' (Viking, 1991), by Sam Chaiton and
Terry Swinton, members of the Canadian commune that the movie
credits with Carter's release.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadians, from whom Carter is now estranged, were
latecomers to his struggle by more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And shamefully, the movie never mentions Fred Hogan, then and
now an investigator in the New Jersey Public Defender's office.
More than any person, Hogan was responsible for Carter's conviction
eventually being overturned by Federal Judge H. Lee Sarokin in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Several years before the Canadians' involvement, Carter talked
about the ``one man'' who didn't forget him when he was imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one man is Fred Hogan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Fred Hogan, I'd be dead now,'' he added,
meaning that he would have died in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan had remembered Carter as a middleweight contender out of
Paterson best known for a first-round knockout of the welterweight
champion Emile Griffith. As a teen-age Police Athletic League boxer
in Bayonne, N.J., Hogan had first met Carter at his Summit, N.J.,
training camp. Hogan's father was a guard at the Hudson County jail
where Carter's manager, Pat Amato, was the warden.
</P>
<P>
   After his Army discharge, Hogan was a policeman in Atlantic
Highlands, N.J. On moving to the public defender's office, he often
visited inmates at the Rahway prison, where Carter was serving
three life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in my heart that there was no way that Rubin did
that,'' Hogan has often said, alluding to the triple murder. ``And
the more Rubin told me about the trial, the more I knew it stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was not a choir boy. As a 14-year-old involved in a
mugging incident, Carter had been sent to the Jamesburg State Home
for Boys before escaping. He was also convicted of assault and
robbery in 1957. But regarding the triple murders, he argued in a
1972 newspaper column that he had been ``cleared by a man wounded
by the killers,'' that he had passed a lie-detector test, and that
the description of the killers fit ``neither me nor John Artis,
convicted with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Two career criminals, Alfred P. Bello and Arthur D. Bradley, had
told the police that they had witnessed Carter and Artis leaving
the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Hogan, working on his own time, tracked down Bello and
Bradley, obtained their recantations and delivered them to Selwyn
Raab, a New York Times reporter. Raab confirmed the recantations
and wrote a story that appeared on Page 1 _ the first break in the
case that would drag through a second trial and conviction in 1976
(and the return of Carter and Artis to prison) before Judge Sarokin
let Carter walk free out of a Newark courtroom in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But in the movie, it's as if Hogan (and Raab) never existed, as
if the recantations of Bello and Bradley never happened except for
an oblique reference by one of Carter's lawyers to ``no witnesses,
except for admitted liars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 54, Hogan lives in Brielle, N.J., with his wife, Mary, and
their sons David and Matthew. Not long ago he and Carter were at a
Manhattan party introducing James S. Hirsch's truthful book,
``Hurricane, The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter'' (Viking,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin pointed to me,'' Hogan recalled, ``and said, `There must
be a beginning and the beginning is you.'''
</P>
<P>
   At that same party one of Carter's lawyers, Leon Friedman,
inscribed Hogan's copy of Hirsch's book. Hogan said proudly, ``This
is what Leon wrote: `To Fred Hogan, who started us all on the road
to freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, this public defender did not seem to resent being
ignored in the movie. ``I hope Rubin makes a trillion dollars,'' he
said, ``and I hope Denzel Washington wins the Academy Award; he's
terrific as Rubin.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to know the real Rubin Carter story, don't go to
the movie. Read Hirsch's book. Fred Hogan is in that.

U.S. ANTI-DRUG PLAN TO AID COLOMBIA FACES HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing) 
(Exclusive)  
 (bl)  
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's $1.3 billion plan to
help Colombia fight drug trafficking and leftist insurgents is
facing skepticism from military and law-enforcement officials
concerned that the United States could be dragged into a long and
costly struggle that may have little impact on the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The aid plan, which is to be presented in detail to Congress on
Monday, is intended to help stanch the booming production of
cocaine and heroin in Colombia, strengthen the government and help
it take control of a large part of its southern territory now
dominated by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, some senior defense officials are decidedly
unenthusiastic about the U.S. military's growing role in the
anti-drug effort and worried that it may be dragged deeper into the
civil war that has ravaged Colombia for almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many drug enforcement and Coast Guard officials are similarly
concerned, officials said. While the aid package may help
Colombia's beleaguered army fight the guerrillas, they said, it
does not reflect a coherent strategy to fight illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually none of these complaints have been aired publicly. But
officials said the arguments have been heard repeatedly in the
debate over the aid plan, reshaping some of its elements but more
often overridden by administration officials determined to
establish a new U.S. commitment to Colombia's stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude is, `We don't really want to do this,''' one
senior administration official said of generals in the Pentagon.
Referring to the Colombian insurgency, he added: ``The last thing
they need is another level of engagement that has the `I' word in
it. That always has stress for the military _ it has ever since
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House drug policy chief, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey,
dismissed skeptics of the plan, noting that some of the criticism
came from agencies that tried unsuccessfully to win funding
increases for their programs as part of the Colombia aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tried to get aboard this mule,'' McCaffrey said in
an interview, referring to the administration's request for $955
million on top of the $330 million already budgeted for Colombia
aid this year. But he added, ``There wasn't a huge fight among
agencies over this package.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they are confident that the
aid, about two-thirds of which would go to Colombian security
forces, will be approved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have been an important part of the
impetus for greater American aid, warning that the Clinton White
House risked ``losing'' Colombia to the insurgents. A few
congressional liberals have criticized the aid program, but they
are unlikely to slow its passage except by attaching some
conditions meant to promote greater respect for human rights by the
Colombian military.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the package is only a first step in what many U.S.
officials acknowledge will probably be a huge, years-long effort to
strengthen Colombian institutions and help the government reach a
peace with three leftist guerrilla groups and large right-wing
paramilitary forces that operate in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Both Colombian and U.S. officials continue to say the United
States will not engage the guerrillas directly. Nor, they said,
will they aid the fight against the guerrillas _ except those who
hire out to the traffickers to protect drug fields, drug
laboratories or clandestine airstrips.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not involved in the business,'' President Andres
Pastrana said of the rebels, ``they should be confident that
nothing is going to happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, U.S. officials are clearly softening
their claims that U.S. aid will not be used for counterinsurgency.
</P>
<P>
   In a program summary released last month, the White House listed
the primary component of the aid plan as, ``Helping the Colombian
government push into the coca-growing regions of southern Colombia,
which are now dominated by insurgent guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Fred F. Woerner, a former commander of U.S. military forces
in Latin America, said the statement represented a significant
clarification of U.S. goals _ notwithstanding the administration's
assurances to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you push into an area dominated by these guys without
having anything to do with them?'' he asked, referring to the
rebels. ``Anyone who believes that these counternarcotics
battalions will not be involved in counterinsurgency is naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they will argue to Congress that
the situation is especially dire because of an explosion in the
cultivation of coca, the raw material of cocaine, in the same parts
of southern Colombia that the rebels dominate. Their main support
will be a new study by both the CIA and the Drug Enforcement
Administration showing that Colombia's coca production is more than
three times greater than American analysts had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last few years, nearly all the world's coca was grown
in Bolivia and Peru, but with the introduction of new varieties of
the coca plant, Colombia has more than made up for major reductions
of coca growing in the neighboring countries. Moreover,
intelligence officials said that new refining techniques allow
Colombian traffickers to produce more cocaine from coca base than
before.
</P>
<P>
   While the CIA reported that Colombia grew 182 tons of coca in
1998, officials said the new study will show that it actually grew
a staggering 480 tons, or more than half the worldwide total, which
is not expected to rise significantly overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see any signs of an explosion,'' one official said.
Despite a surging cocaine market in Europe and the former Soviet
Union, he added: ``At some point, there has to be an issue of
supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defense officials are virtually uniform in their view that
the Colombian military should be strengthened. But many of them
have also been wary of a greater involvement _ both because of the
rebel target that a bigger U.S. military presence would represent,
and because of the stress that it would put on Pentagon resources.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many Defense Department officials who fear being
drawn more deeply into Colombia's civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on who you talk to; I am personally concerned about
that,'' one senior military official said. But he added: ``Here's
the dilemma: Do you just let them go down the tubes? That's not a
good scenario, either. It is far preferable for us to try to train
them and equip them than it is for American troops to ultimately
have to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first major draft of the administration's aid plan, put
forward last fall, officials proposed U.S. military training to
create six new special Colombian army battalions that could operate
against drug traffickers and the insurgents who support them.
</P>
<P>
   After objections by senior U.S. defense officials, the proposal
was scaled back to the creation of two new battalions over about an
eight-month period, administration officials said. The number of
U.S. military trainers in Colombia will not be significantly
increased, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pentagon officials said they are also concerned about the
single biggest piece of the aid package: more than 30 sophisticated
UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters being provided to the Colombian
military at a cost of more than $400 million. The aircraft, which
will remain State Department property, are not only extremely
expensive but will require extensive pilot training and cost tens
of millions of dollars to operate, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, law-enforcement officials have more strategic
concerns, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Drug-enforcement officials argue essentially that the Colombian
government's push into its southern territory _ which was intended
to destroy coca-processing laboratories and secure growing areas
from guerrillas _ is important, but not that important. Under the
administration's plan, that campaign is to cost about $600 million,
or nearly half the $1.28 billion to be spent on the entire package.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, officials note, successful Drug Enforcement
Administration programs to train and support special Colombian
police teams that work against the country's biggest traffickers
cost only a few million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   While most money in the aid plan would be for the military
rather than the police, some officials argue that an expansion of
police efforts would have a far greater impact per dollar on the
drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials make a broader point, asserting that Washington
should start by pressing the Colombian government for important
policy changes that would cost nothing: increasing prison sentences
for drug offenses, reorganizing the judiciary, taking cellular
telephones away from jailed drug traffickers so they cannot
continue to do business behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the changes that are required there could be made
overnight,'' one U.S. official said, ``and they would require no or
nominal amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Coast Guard officials also argued for a bigger piece of the
new package, officials said. After a year of booming cocaine
seizures last year, the agency has sought new funding for
innovating programs to detect drug shipments and deploy armed
helicopters against high-speed drug boats in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that while they had not put any
new money for those programs in the Colombia aid package, they had
agreed to ask for about $17 million for the helicopter program next
year, $7 million more than in the current year. But funds for other
high-priority Coast Guard drug programs were denied, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating for us,'' one official said. ``We have
demonstrated that these things work, but we still cannot get the
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the funding increases for
nonmilitary programs like crop-substitution efforts, strengthening
human rights and economic development would be rising at a far more
rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a case in which we really said to people, `How fast
can you spend money,''' one budget official said, referring to
United States economic development officials. ``It gets to a
question of what is achievable; almost none of these programs are
in place in Colombia now.''

DOUBLES LOSS THREATENS AMERICANS IN DAVIS CUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ They are preparing to party here, stoking the
passions and cueing the clown. They are planning a parade on
rationed gas. The mighty United States is on the verge of losing in
the first round of the Davis Cup to a team from the northern
suburbs of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The Black brothers, Wayne and Byron, got an assist Saturday from
a friend and neighbor, Kevin Ullyett, who grew up a little more
than walking distance away. Ullyett teamed with Wayne Black
Saturday to scramble back from a two-sets-to-one deficit and
outlast the Americans Alex O'Brien and Rick Leach. A double fault
by Leach completed a 7-6 (4), 5-7, 0-6, 7-5, 7-5 win for Zimbabwe,
putting John McEnroe's team in need of a sweep of Sunday's reserve
singles and sending the local fans, clown included, into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Andre Agassi must beat Byron Black, and then Chris
Woodruff, who was positively wooden in losing to Byron Black on
Friday, must take out the 5-foot-7-inch but indisputably scrappy
Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't pull it off, maybe we will be the reason why there
will be a lot of great African players in 10 years,'' McEnroe said.
``We'll look at the bright side.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe is trying to, anyway. Beyond a few jousts Saturday with
the chair umpire, Bruno Rebeuh, and some post-match sniping with
the opposition, McEnroe has been handling what he originally
believed would be a scenic drive on safari as well as he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's building up, like a bomb waiting to explode,'' he said,
but he was smiling, in almost a convivial mood, after a 3 hour 23
minute ordeal he called ``as tough a match as I've ever been part
of without playing.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and Leach, especially O'Brien, acquitted themselves
better than Woodruff on Friday, but in the end, the Americans were
done in by Leach's shaky serve and ground strokes. Leach, 35, was
called in by captain McEnroe last Friday, after Todd Martin
followed Pete Sampras to the inactive list. As long as McEnroe
wasn't averse to using an aging southpaw, it was only natural to
inquire, given the result, if he regretted not putting himself in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I could have done a better job than those guys,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know if McEnroe, one of the all-time doubles greats
who won 18 of 20 Davis Cup matches, could have, at 41, better dealt
with the chanting, flag-waving and drum-beating than Leach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frenzy out there, a blur,'' Leach said. ``Every time
I went to serve, the people were whistling. You couldn't hear
yourself think.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the fans, though persistently loud, were usually quiet
when the ball was thrown up. And if anyone was aroused after Leach
lost his serve in the 12th game of the fourth set to bring about
the fifth, it was Ullyett and Black. Down the homestretch, they
formed the more cohesive unit than the Americans, who had never
before been paired.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly wilting, Leach needed consecutive aces to avoid a
service break in the eighth game of the fifth set. By the 12th
game, Leach serving at 5-6, the match seemed nowhere close to
conclusion, as the Americans built a 40-15 lead. Ullyett struck a
clean backhand down the line on a first-service return for 40-30.
Then Leach, coming in to take ``a floater,'' tripped slightly and
netted the backhand.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien blamed himself for Leach's stumble, saying he feared the
down the line pass and was caught ``picking my nose'' on a ball he
could have poached. Match point was set up by another Ullyett pass
down the line, this time with the forehand. And that's when Leach
double faulted the Americans into a corner Woodruff will have to
lead them out of.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How did it to come to this for McEnroe and the United States?
Sampras' injury, Martin's illness, Woodruff's inexperience _
there'll be plenty of reasonable excuses to go around should the
Americans lose. And O'Brien and Leach will look back and wonder how
this match got away from them after they appeared to be in command,
running off nine straight games from 5-5 in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this game that McEnroe boiled over on a line call on
the first point. He rose to give Rebeuh an earful, and when play
resumed, the United States proceeded to break Black's serve.
McEnroe and the U.S. team bench erupted. Agassi, sucking on a
lollipop, held up an electric fan behind the players while McEnroe,
crouched at the knees, chatted away like a basketball coach during
his final timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Even in victory, the Zimbabweans weren't about to let this go,
suggesting that McEnroe was engaging in a deliberate display of
gamesmanship unbecoming a Davis Cup captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umpire shouldn't have let him argue like that, about a
minute, and I'm waiting to serve,'' Black said. Ullyett, for his
part, said McEnroe was at this stage also talking some trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can produce evidence of that, I'll give them a million
dollars,'' McEnroe said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Black's contention that he argued too long, McEnroe
added, ``If he thinks that, you know what I wish? That he played me
in my prime.''
</P>
<P>
   Point to McEnroe, though at the end of the day, it didn't
improve the unenviable position he and his players find themselves
in _ depending on Woodruff to avoid a Davis Cup disaster equivalent
to losses at Paraguay in 1987 and Columbia in 1974. Only three
times _ the last in 1981 against Mexico _ has the U.S. recovered
from a 2-1 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Chris will be a little nervous,'' Black said.
``He's holding the flag up for the big United States.''

COMMITMENT, REDEFINED: RODMAN RETURNING
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK)

<P>
   Dennis Rodman, wayward soul in need of shelter and minimum
salary, found a home last week. Mark Cuban, the new owner of the
Dallas Mavericks, offered up his 4,000-square foot guest house and
a chance for Rodman to resume his career.
</P>
<P>
   The deal worked like this: Rodman gets $470,000 to corral missed
shots for the next three months. He does not have to practice with
the team or show up at the same time before games as his teammates.
Meanwhile, the moribund Mavericks reap profits at the gate, using
Rodman's antics to sell tickets and maybe win a few games.
</P>
<P>
   What a touching story; the tale of a new-breed owner and a
38-year-old codger of a rebounder, whose tattoos are turning
splotchy.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that first interview:
</P>
<P>
   Cuban: ``Dennis, can you help our team?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman: ``I can help your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban: ``Can you show up for games on time?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman: ``I can show up for games on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban: ``Finally, can you comport yourself in a way that will
not bring further embarrassment or harm to the organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman: ``I can show up for games on time.''
</P>
<P>
   They were lining up in Dallas on Friday afternoon, purchasing
tickets for the Mavericks' home game against Seattle on Wednesday
night, when Rodman is supposed to suit up. The circus had already
begun.
</P>
<P>
   And you have got to love Rodman's commitment. Team officials
said he planned to take a week off to get in shape or maybe fly to
Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. He has been out of the league since
playing just 23 games last February and March for the Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's initial talks with the Mavericks broke off last week so
he could go to Atlanta for some Super Bowl parties. He moved next
door to Cuban's Dallas mansion last week as he wrapped up talks
with the incoming owner. Cuban has told Rodman that he will be
allowed to ride a stationary bicycle instead of going to practice
and can have a later pre-game arrival time than his teammates. All
of this is satisfactory with Don Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could sell that to my guys,'' Charlotte
Hornets coach Paul Silas said. ``I mean, how do you make special
rules for some and expect others to respect you? To each their own,
but it just sounds like a very tough situation for a coach to be
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat's owner, Micky Arison, said: ``I think that's
wonderful _ for them. I can't imagine Pat Riley could live with
that. But I think it's great. It'll bring a lot of interest to the
team and to Dallas. They're not going anywhere, so why not have
some fun?''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the Continental Basketball Association or the
International Basketball League, some young, strapping
6-foot-8-inch forward is hunting down loose balls, showing up early
for his practices and games, waiting for his agent to call with
good news. If he only knew.
</P>
<P>
   Without a pierced navel, the right toe nail polish or a
publicized domestic problem, he has no shot.

TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
PORTLAND IS LACKING 
TAX TIME

<P>
   Karl Malone became the third player to score his 30,000th point
last week in the third quarter of a game. What went relatively
unnoticed is what happened on the play he scored the point. The
Mailman, furious over a noncall, received a technical foul for
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, the marquee point guards Gary Payton and
Jason Williams have been ejected in separate games at Madison
Square Garden. The first-time All-Star Rasheed Wallace has managed
to accrue 21 technical fouls. Including his ejection against the
Knicks on Thursday night, Wallace had been thrown out of three
games in seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships between egocentric players and Napoleonic
referees have always been a bit strained, but lately no one is
getting along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' Payton said recently. ``You
think you're talking to a guy and being respectful, and the next
thing you know you're walking to the locker room, wondering what
you said. I'm not saying I haven't gone overboard, but some of the
technicals are ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The players association is worried enough about high-profile
players being tossed that it plans to speak to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us some concern,'' Billy Hunter, the executive
director of the players association, said on Friday afternoon.
``We're trying to monitor it ourselves. If this keeps up, it's
something we need to address with the league at some point. People
pay too much money for these players to be thrown out
unjustifiably.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was in attendance at the Garden on Jan. 24 when Payton
was ejected by referee Ted Bernhardt at the beginning of the second
quarter. Trying to engage Bernhardt in a dialogue about the initial
technical foul, Payton sidled up to the referee, smiled and said:
``Are you mad at me? You mad at me?''
</P>
<P>
   Payton walked away. He was standing nearly 25 feet away from
Bernhardt 15 seconds later when the referee surprisingly threw him
out of the game, a decision that enraged Payton. Charging the
referee, he was restrained by teammates before he made contact with
Bernhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Williams was ejected by the veteran referee Hue
Hollins. Williams heaved the ball into the air after Hollins called
him for traveling on one end, a stunt that earned him the first
technical. Shaking his head on the other end and muttering
incoherently under his breath, Williams was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably should have been thrown out for tossing the ball
into the air like that,'' said Rod Thorn, the NBA's senior vice
president of operations who oversees the officials along with Ed T.
Rush, the head of the referees. ``I don't think there are any more
problems now than we've had in the past with regard to technicals
and ejections. And regardless of who you are _ a bench player or an
All-Star _ there is some behavior that's just not going to be
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorn did not see any correlation between the expiration of the
referees' collective bargaining agreement with the league after
this season and the referees' need to show their worth as the
game's gatekeepers. Even so, NBA referees are seeking a richer deal
from the league after their contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   Referees make between $80,000 and about $250,000 annually based
on experience. With Major League Baseball umpires about to
negotiate their own deal, the NBA referees' goal is to remain the
highest-paid officials in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with our contract expiring and even less
to do with vendettas against certain players,'' one referee said on
condition of anonymity. ``You know what it is? After they get their
first `T,' some of these guys just won't shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland Is Lacking
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the way Rasheed Wallace blew a gasket in the fourth
quarter, going off on the officiating crew on Thursday night until
he was thrown out of the game. Maybe it was the sight of Scottie
Pippen and Damon Stoudamire cutting each other up on the bench
during a timeout with less than nine minutes remaining, until Gary
Grant finally yelled to Stoudamire, ``Yo, Damon! Get your behind in
the huddle!''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, for all the Trail Blazers' incredible depth,
Portland is still lacking two championship qualities: composure and
a genuine leader.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Knicks played in their 98-88 victory on Thursday,
the Blazers took themselves out of the game at key junctures. Their
obsession with the referees, their inability to block out
questionable calls have hurt them this season.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, when a known hothead like Wallace erupts, there is
no one on the roster to calm him down. Not coach Mike Dunleavy or
any of his players. Wallace shoved several teammates away when they
tried to intercede on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them frustrate us,'' Dunleavy said of the officials.
``Instead of complaining and moaning to them and everybody else, we
should have made the Knicks pay for it. Until we are able to
control that, we're not going to get all the way and win a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tax Time
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the NBA's escrow tax in relation to trades, the tax
does not penalize every team over the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Juwan Howard, who is scheduled to earn $18.7
million in 2001-2, would not cost the Wizards an additional $18
million if the team is over the salary cap in that season.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the escrow backup tax would not even begin to
penalize a team unless its total salary was at least $13 million
over the cap. If the Knicks were to, say, trade Patrick Ewing for
Howard, their committed salary would rise from $59.7 million to
78.4 million. They would end up paying a hefty sum in luxury tax,
making the trade a bad one for monetary reasons.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR BUTCH'S PLAYERS, 23 HOOP DREAMS AND ONE
NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ After 40 years, the old boys from Hofstra
University agree on one thing: That buzzer shot on a bleak
afternoon may have ruined an undefeated season, but it did not ruin
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They remember how they loved playing for Butch van Breda Kolff,
who would later bark at Bill Bradley and Wilt Chamberlain the same
way he barked at them.
</P>
<P>
   In that long ago time, they enjoyed the best of college sports _
fun and respect and practices as competitive as the games. They won
23 games and lost only one, not a bad ratio at all.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, most of them will return to Hofstra to be
honored at the dedication of a spiffy new arena, five times the
size of the cramped little gym where they lost that game to Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 60 years old and I'm still stunned,'' said Steve Balber,
the point guard for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it so vaguely,'' said Stephen Dunn, known as Radar
for his jump shots against the zone, now a nationally acclaimed
poet, who will read a poem about aging, ``Losing Steps,'' to his
teammates on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many versions that the shot seems to have come
straight out of ``Rashomon,'' the Japanese fable of perception. Two
teammates _ no names mentioned _ even said the game took place at
Wagner, on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   They all remember different things from the year when John F.
Kennedy was gearing up for a presidential run, and crew cuts were
still in fashion, and the coach was a blunt former New York
Knickerbocker who could still scrimmage with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just kids having a good time,'' said Stanley
Einbender, who beat West Point at the buzzer. ``We didn't care how
we looked; we just wanted to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the layup drills,'' said Curtis Block, a senior
guard, who once had started. ``You'd run the court six times, and
if you missed the last layup, Butch would yell, `And two!'''
</P>
<P>
   Butch did not believe in set plays, but he did believe in set
positions. Teddy Jackson, a few inches too short for the big time,
was encouraged to drive when isolated against one defender. And
Butch was ruthless about finding room for the limber sophomore
guard, Richie Swartz. Stephen Dunn has written an essay about ``the
bad Richie,'' who took away his starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close in a strange way,'' said Adam ``Zeke''
Gadzinski, the backup center, who gives credit to the nicknames
dropped on them by Balber, a spindly motormouth out of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are now wives and children and grandchildren and
mature dignity to consider, there will be no attempt to identify
Heavy Head or Neanderthal Man or Attitude or the Hamster. (The
student publicist, yours truly, was labeled ``Grantland'' by van
Breda Kolff.) And those were the kinder ones.
</P>
<P>
   The players remember the long car rides back from Pennsylvania
(``One of those colleges that doesn't exist/ until its players walk
on the court,'' Stephen Dunn once wrote.) They remember van Breda
Kolff and his assistant, Paul Lynner, telling uproarious stories in
diners late at night in Allentown or Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   The team jelled early, winning 10 straight games. Then came an
afternoon game during intersession, with Hofstra coming out cold
and scrambling to tie Wagner with a minute left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the terrible sinking feeling that we had a chance
to lose,'' said Bob Lauster, a Navy veteran and spare forward.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner froze for one shot, and Harry Orlando, an energetic
guard, was trapped by Balber and Swartz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great defense,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``Right in front of our
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Balber still shudders at what happened next: ``We had him
nailed, but he somehow flung it over his shoulder. Even Richie,
with his long arms, couldn't get his hands on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball zipped to Bob Larsen, tall and slender, ``with long
sideburns,'' Curtis Block recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing a zone, and I rushed out at him,'' recalled
Brant Alyea, a rangy sophomore. ``I thought about blocking the
shot, but I didn't want to foul him, so I just tried to distract
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the foul line and the key,'' said Richie Goldstein, a
reserve guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer to half-court,'' said Swartz.
</P>
<P>
   The ball swished into the basket at the buzzer for a 50-48 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just chucked it with two hands from midcourt,'' said John
McGowan, a reserve. ``He was the most surprised guy on the court _
except for us, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running up and down the court like they had won the
Super Bowl,'' recalled Alyea, disregarding the fact that the Super
Bowl was nearly a decade in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just were in shock,'' Goldstein said. ``Most of us lived at
home because Hofstra didn't have dorms in those days. I drove
Stevie Dunn home to Forest Hills. Very depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra regrouped and won its last 13 games, but Wagner, with
its 16-8 overall record, went undefeated in the Middle Atlantic
Conference and qualified for the playoffs, while Hofstra most
emphatically did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember how all of us waited around to get picked for the
NIT,'' said Robert Stowers, a springy forward.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff, who had some cachet at the Garden, made an
inquiry but remembers a veiled comment from the National Invitation
Tournament: ``Forget it.'' One of the last teams picked was
Detroit, with a rangy forward named Dave DeBusschere, and all the
teams had size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have whipped their butts,'' proclaimed Einbender, the
center, all of 6 feet 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Then they took their educations and went about being responsible
adults _ Gadzinski an accountant; Stowers a teacher; Jackson a
parole hearing officer; Einbender an endodontist; Block for many
years a vice president for media relations at NBC; Swartz a
furniture salesman; Lauster a salesman for I.B.M.; Goldstein
operating the family shoe accessory business; Balber the chairman
of MIT Interlink, a direct-mail company; Alyea playing 361 baseball
games in the majors; McGowan an engineer; and Dunn a poet and
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   They all followed the career of van Breda Kolff, now 78 and
reluctantly retired in Florida after a second tour with Hofstra six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are grateful to the school that made them study hard for
their scholarships and their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, Jackson went back to Hofstra's superb
Shakespeare Festival for a performance of ``Othello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around and started thinking how many things I didn't
get involved in,'' Jackson said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   There was not time for everything. They had a master teacher,
and talented teammates, and they once won 23 of 24 games. ``I could
have played more if I had gone to Post or Adelphi,'' said
Goldstein, who had been the high scorer on the freshman team. ``But
I wouldn't trade this for anything. It was great to be with a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   They remember the victories. A few still try to block the shot
in their dreams.

 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Above all else, the Rev. Martin J. Carter, 70, is a
man of determination. Raised in rural North Carolina during the
Great Depression, he knew early that he wanted to be a priest. It
was an unusual choice, even with a Catholic mother. Back then,
black priests were about as common as black sheriffs, and seminary
after seminary rejected him because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin Carter fought on, decade upon decade, first becoming
a friar, then traveling the world on church missions, and finally,
at 50, after more racial slights than he cares to share, being
ordained a priest. ``If it wasn't God's calling,'' he said, ``I
couldn't have survived.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Carter found himself at the threshold of another
personal triumph. He was appointed the first black pastor in the
126-year history of Our Lady of Victory, a handsome Roman Catholic
church in the Stuyvesant Heights section of Brooklyn. Yet, at this
moment of fulfillment, Carter came to an unsettling realization.
</P>
<P>
   The Victory parish did not want him. ``There were those,'' he
recalled, ``that said, `We don't want no black priest.'''
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, there was no racism _ Victory is
overwhelmingly black. But the parishioners longed for the return of
a popular white priest who had served them for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Carter came anyway, determined as ever, to chip away at the
tensions between race and religion and win over a parish along the
way. Five years later, his mission has come to exemplify the
complexities of black Catholicism in the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Brooklyn, home to more black Catholics than any other diocese in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an estimated 300,000 black Catholics in the diocese,
there remains a ``great cultural divide'' between them and the
church hierarchy, said Madeline Anderson, executive director of the
diocese's Office of Black Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   There are white priests and monsignors who still have much to
learn about black America, she said. During Mass, they frown on the
``amens'' and other emotional displays common to black services,
Anderson said. In their sermons, they avoid the subject of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid sometimes to be black and Catholic,'' she
said. ``They think that if they are Catholic, they have to leave
their blackness outside.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Carter's goal, one shared by a growing cadre of black
priests, to persuade his parishioners that there is no need to
leave their blackness outside. Last year, to make the point, he
sent a nun out to the front of the church with a can of black
paint. This is where a statue of the Virgin Mary stands. On
Carter's orders, the nun painted Mary's white skin a glistening
black.
</P>
<P>
   Some at Victory appreciated the message _ that an image of a
black Madonna is as legitimate as one of a white Madonna,
particularly for a black church. But many objected vehemently,
arguing that Carter had inserted race where it did not belong.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the reaction, it helps to know something of
Victory's history. Founded in 1869, Victory was an all-white parish
for the first half of its existence, serving Irish and Italian
immigrant families in a prosperous neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Frederica Cadiz, a worshiper at Victory, tells how her mother
helped integrate the church in the 1930s. White ushers, she said,
tried to direct her mother to St. Peter Claver, which, in 1921, was
the first parish in the diocese established for black Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told her, `Your church is Claver,' which was four blocks
away,'' Cadiz said. ``And she said, `Well, I am a Roman Catholic
and this is my neighborhood.' They sat her in the last pew.''
</P>
<P>
   More blacks followed, faster still as white families moved away
before a tide of immigrants from Catholic strongholds in the West
Indies. By the 1950s, Victory had completed its transformation,
filling each Sunday with hundreds of mostly middle-class Caribbean
families. They were drawn by Victory's school, by its breathtaking
stained-glass windows and by the Voices of Victory, a huge choir
that on its best Sundays could be heard up and down Throop Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The altar, though, remained the preserve of white pastors. It
would take decades for the diocese to ordain its first black
priest. Black parishes were led by a succession of Irish or Italian
priests, many of whom were admired for their dedication. One such
priest was Joseph Nugent, who was at Victory from 1971 to 1992.
When he was reassigned, he hoped to be succeeded by a black pastor.
``The time had come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But another white pastor was sent, a man with a shy, nervous
manner who was widely regarded as not suited to the task. Many
parishioners left; finances deteriorated. ``In two years he undid
what I did in 21 years,'' Nugent said. The priest was removed, and
Victory petitioned Bishop Thomas V. Daily for Nugent's return.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop sent Martin Carter instead. In an interview, Daily
said it was important to increase the number of black priests
running parishes. According to Anderson at the Office of Black
Ministry, at least 80 of the diocese's 218 parishes are now
predominantly black. But there are only five black pastors in the
diocese, which comprises Brooklyn and Queens. ``People have to see
their own,'' the bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also said that race should not play a central role in
personnel decisions and that Carter's race had little to do with
his selection. ``My job _ and it's not easy, either _ is to give
people a good priest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when members are asked why Carter's appointment met
opposition, the answers are complex. Part of the reason was their
affection for Nugent. There were also cultural differences between
Carter, a Southern black, and a largely Caribbean parish. Deeper
still, several members said, was the sense that there was something
odd, even wrong, about a black priest.
</P>
<P>
   The parishioners were so used to seeing a white face behind the
altar that Carter's face seemed jarring. ``Sometimes,'' John Eley
said, ``we are our own worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is driven by the conviction that black Catholics must
understand their roots in Catholicism to claim equal footing in the
church. ``We are not Johnny-come-latelies,'' he said, noting that
three early popes were from Africa. It was a message he pushed as
director of the Office of Black Ministry in the Raleigh diocese in
the '80s, and later in the same position in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   At Victory, Carter has hung portraits of black bishops in his
rectory conference room. Upstairs, opposite his bed, are those of
Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. He has encouraged the choir to include
more gospel music, though not everyone likes it. ``They say, `That
gospel kind of music is not Catholic,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is winning converts. Attendance has climbed
steadily to 520 families. Some who first thought him out of line
with his black paint now like the notion of recreating a church in
their image. Combining Catholicism and black culture no longer
seems so weird, they say. ``We have to let people know who we were
and what we did _ that we were here,'' Frederica Cadiz said.

MCGWIRE RISES IN STATURE  
 THE GRIFFEY GAME CONTINUES  
 JOURNEYMAN LEFTY LANDS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire has never leaped tall buildings in a single bound,
but he might be stronger than a locomotive and he has shot up the
career home run list faster than a speeding bullet.
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire hits the number of home runs he has averaged in the
past four seasons (61), he will become the fifth-leading home run
hitter ever. If he hits one more than he has averaged the past
three seasons, 64, he will become No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred forty-five home runs ago, after the 1995 season,
McGwire had 277 home runs, a respectable but not mind-boggling
number. He was tied with Rudy York for 83rd on the list. Ahead of
him were seven active players: Cal Ripken Jr., Harold Baines, Jose
Canseco, Darryl Strawberry, Barry Bonds, Gary Gaetti and Fred
McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McGwire hit 52 home runs, giving him a career total of
329 and the 57th spot on the career list, surpassing Baines,
Strawberry, Gaetti and McGriff. He slugged 58 in 1997, catapulting
up the list to 30th with 387. He left Ripken, Canseco and Bonds
behind. Then came his record-shattering season and 70 more home
runs; his new total of 457 vaulted him to 20th.
</P>
<P>
   In hitting 65 last season for a total of 522, McGwire soared to
10th, eclipsing six players in the 500s: Eddie Murray, Mel Ott,
Eddie Mathews, Ernie Banks, Ted Williams and Willie McCovey.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, barring injury, has a good chance this year of passing
Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Reggie Jackson and Harmon
Killebrew. That advance would leave only Frank Robinson, Willie
Mays, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting on Griffey
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. may very well wind up with the Cincinnati Reds.
The Seattle Mariners may very likely trade him there. But despite
persistent reports, he is not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no truth to it at all,'' Jim Bowden, the Reds' general
manager, said of a reported three-way trade the week before last.
``I've had no conversations whatsoever with the Kansas City Royals.
The status as far as Seattle and Cincinnati hasn't changed since
December. We've had no discussions with Seattle about a three-way
deal involving Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bowden denied that a two-way trade was impending.
``No truth to it,'' he said. ``We haven't made progress since Dec.
11. We haven't talked to them since last Friday. Nothing has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has talked about the possibility of not making a trade at
all but rather waiting until Griffey is a free agent after the
season. It would probably cost the same to sign him, but the Reds
wouldn't have to give up players for him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, by making such comments, waiting patiently
and playing hard to get, Bowden may just induce the Mariners to
lower their asking price to a level of players he would not mind
surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   There's Room for Assenmacher
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels signed Greg Cadaret to a minor league
contract earlier in the winter, so why wasn't anyone giving pitcher
Paul Assenmacher a job?
</P>
<P>
   Montreal signed Graeme Lloyd, Oakland signed Mike Magnante,
Texas re-signed Mike Munoz, the Yankees re-signed Mike Stanton and
Allen Watson. Seattle snatched Arthur Rhodes from Baltimore, and
the Orioles signed Buddy Groom. The Mets signed Rich Rodriguez;
Tampa Bay decided to keep Norm Charlton around. But with spring
training approaching, Assenmacher did not have a job.
</P>
<P>
   Then last Friday, the Atlanta Braves gave the 39-year-old
journeyman a minor league contract, and all was right in the world
of left-handed relief pitchers. More than any species of mankind,
they seem to be guaranteed work, no matter their age, no matter
their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Assenmacher, pitching for Cleveland last season, relieved 55
times, working only 33 innings, and emerged with an 8.18 ERA, the
worst of his 14-year career. His trouble might have stemmed from
too much exposure to right-handed batters.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Assenmacher has often been used only against
left-handed hitters, but last year the Indians let him face
right-handers, too. They were either charitable or foolhardy,
perhaps desperate. In 78 at-bats against him, right-handers amassed
35 hits for a .449 average. Left-handers managed only 15 hits in 66
at-bats for a .227 average.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his problems last season, the timing might have been
right for Assenmacher. With John Rocker suspended for the first
four weeks of the season, barring a reversal by the arbitrator, the
Braves could have been short a left-hander.

   FEDBUD-DEBT _ WASHINGTON _ Not so long ago, it seemed hard to
imagine how this country would pay off the federal debt. When
President Clinton submits his budget to Congress on Feb. 7, though,
it will contain a plan for paying off the publicly held portion of
that debt _ some $3.3 trillion _ by 2013. That, says Clinton, would
be a stunning achievement that would dramatically change the
country's economic landscape for a generation to come. How,
precisely, would the plan work? Who would get paid, where would the
money come from and what impact would it have on the economy? And
why do some economists _ and some Republicans _ say that paying off
the debt might not be wise? (Deans, Cox News Service).

A TEAM CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY PITCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the course of dismantling the 1997 World Series champions,
the Florida Marlins made 16 trades and acquired 33 players.
Twenty-four of those players were pitchers. Dave Dombrowski, the
Marlins' general manager, gobbled up pitchers as if they were
becoming extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, good pitchers are scarce, and Dombrowski, given his
orders to slash the championship payroll, decided to test the adage
that there is strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope the numbers you have will end up giving you enough
pitchers for many years to come who will be healthy and pitch at a
premium,'' Dombrowski said. ``Hopefully, the odds will be in our
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins got a glimpse of their future last season and will
see more of it this season. Vladimir Nunez and A.J. Burnett spent
some time last season in the starting rotation and are expected to
be full-fledged starters this year. Burnett came from the Mets in
the trade for Al Leiter two years ago , and Nunez was part of the
package that came from Arizona for Matt Mantei last July.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny came with Nunez, and, heading into spring training,
he appears to be the leading candidate for the No. 5 spot in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a fine Arizona Fall League,'' Dombrowski said of Penny.
``Everybody who saw him pitch there said he threw fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grilli also pitched impressively in the fall league, the
general manager said, but remains just behind Penny. Grilli, a
Baldwinsville, N.Y., resident and former Seton Hall University
student, was the fourth player selected in the 1997 amateur draft.
He was one of two pitchers the Marlins obtained from San Francisco
for Livan Hernandez last July.
</P>
<P>
   The championship replacements will be well represented in the
bullpen, too. Braden Looper, a right-hander, and Armando Almanza, a
left-hander, were two-thirds of the contingent that came from St.
Louis for Edgar Renteria last winter. Jesus Sanchez, a left-hander,
is another product of the Mets minor league system who was in the
Leiter trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins know that none of the pitchers they acquired came
with guarantees of major league success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any research you do, I don't know that there are any
specific answers,'' Dombrowski said. ``Look at the Braves'
situation. They have three guys who are good and healthy. Then look
at the Mets' situation. They had three good young pitchers, and
none of the three stayed healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, the Mets thought they had in the wings a
rotation of the future. Paul Wilson, Bill Pulsipher and Jason
Isringhausen were going to be the nucleus of their pitching staff
for years. Wracked with injuries, Wilson hasn't pitched for the
Mets since his rookie season in 1996. Pulsipher is back for a
second term with the Mets, though with no job guarantee, and
Isringhausen will try to become the closer for the Oakland
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was with the White Sox when we won in
1983,'' Dombrowski said. ``We had two young guys, Richard Dotson
and Britt Burns, who were among the top pitchers in the league.
They didn't last for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins can afford to use young, inexperienced pitchers
because they aren't going anywhere just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our situation,'' Dombrowski said, ``we're willing to go
with the growing pains attached to having some young guys in the
rotation for building up the organization. If you were in a
different situation, you'd say, `Go get a veteran pitcher and plug
him in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez, a 24-year-old right-hander, made 12 starts and five
relief appearances for the Marlins after joining them in July. He
emerged with a 4-8 record and a 4.58 earned run average. Burnett is
23 and also right-handed. He became a major league pitcher last
August and became the first Florida starter to win in his first
game. He started seven times altogether, winning four times and
losing twice with a 3.48 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Penny, 21 and right-handed, pitched in the Double-A level of the
minor leagues. His 3-7 record wasn't impressive, but his 135
strikeouts with 39 walks in 122 1/3 innings were.
</P>
<P>
   Grilli, 23 and right-handed, was a Triple-AAA pitcher, compiling
an 8-10 record with a 6.16 ERA in the offense-minded Pacific Coast
League.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' pitching supply does not come solely from trades.
The most promising of their home-grown minor league talents appears
to be Michael Tejera, a 23-year-old left-hander, who defected from
Cuba in 1994. With a 13-4 record and 2.62 ERA, he was named the
pitcher of the year in the Double-A Eastern League. He is
considered to have an outside shot at a starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Three nonpitchers whom the Marlins obtained in trades related to
their dismantling are also expected to start: catcher Ramon Castro,
third baseman Mike Lowell and outfielder Preston Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   One pitcher who will not be in the starting rotation is Ed
Yarnall, even though he figured in two trades. Yarnall went to
Florida with Wilson when the Mets acquired Mike Piazza, but then
the Marlins sent Yarnall to the Yankees in a package for Lowell.
Yarnall is expected to be the Yankees' fifth starter.

NHL GAZING AT NEW STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The family, friends and high school coach of Scott
Gomez walked toward the white stretch limousine outside the elegant
hotel. All had come from Alaska to see Gomez, the Devils rookie, in
his first NHL All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as cool as he's acting,'' his father, Carlos Gomez,
said with a smile Friday night in the hotel lobby as his only son
greeted strangers who shook his hand, wished him well and asked him
for his autograph. Father and son were last into the car, smiling
and shaking their heads at the hubbub around them.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was on his way to be the host of the television show
``Combat Zone,'' which shows rock videos on Much Music, the
Canadian version of MTV. Carlos, an ironworker by trade who is the
son of migrant farm workers from Mexico, is a lean man of modest
height, casually dressed, not the limousine type. But sometimes
life forces you to adjust. As he and his son rushed into the back
seat, Carlos Gomez put his arm around Scott, gave him a quick hug
and kissed him on the cheek. Then they both beamed and leaned back
as the vehicle pulled into the busy flow of traffic and into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who recently celebrated his 20th birthday, is the
youngest player in the All-Star Game, North America vs. the World,
which will be played on Sunday afternoon in Air Canada Center and
televised on ABC. It is the first one of the new century and the
NHL's first season in 20 years without Wayne Gretzky, who retired
last spring. When someone in the limo mentioned that Gretzky was
hosting a party later this night, Scott Gomez said, with animation,
``He's in town?''
</P>
<P>
   His father, in a quieter voice, added, ``Scott would love to
meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gomez is the leading candidate for the rookie of the
year, with 13 goals and 33 assists in the Devils' 53 games, no one
expects him to be the next Gretzky. Who could be? The lack of a
megastar in the post-Gretzky era is one of several difficulties the
league is facing among its growing pains as it nears the end of a
decade of rapid expansion. Two more teams will join next season,
bringing the circuit to 30, up from 21 just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rules changes this season have helped hockey begin to solve some
of its problems. With fewer video reviews negating goals, scoring
is up. The use of two referees for more games has helped cut down
on penalties. Rosters have been trimmed by one player, contributing
to a decline in fighting because there is less room for
bare-knuckle specialists. There will probably be a record for
penalty shots. The new four-on-four format for overtime has reduced
the number of ties and added excitement at the end. Some are
suggesting that entire games be played with one fewer skater as a
way to increase scoring and decrease injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries are still severe and frequent _ not including the
freakish slap shot to the throat that almost killed Montreal's
Trent McCleary last weekend. Stars like Mike Modano of Dallas, Eric
Lindros of Philadelphia and Petr Forsberg of Colorado have
sustained more concussions. Dominik Hasek of Buffalo, the league's
best goalie in recent seasons, will miss Sunday's game with
injuries. Television ratings on the ESPN networks are down, and
everyone in the business is hoping the new ABC presence will change
the momentum where the Fox network failed.
</P>
<P>
   Although this weekend's festivities are presented as a
celebration of hockey in its native land, they take place in an
atmosphere of financial reckoning for Canadian teams. Their
government's formula for monetary assistance collapsed last month,
starting renewed speculation that teams from Edmonton, Calgary and
Ottawa could soon follow Winnipeg and Quebec to new locations south
of the border. And all is not well for every club in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Hurricanes, struggling for customers in their first
season in Raleigh, N.C., are discounting ticket prices. The New
York Islanders, near the bottom of the standings, draw tiny crowds
in New York's eastern suburbs, and their uninterested ownership
cannot seem to sell the troubled franchise. The team from the
western suburbs, the Devils in New Jersey, has the league's best
record but rarely sells out. Mario Lemieux helped rescue the
Pittsburgh Penguins from bankruptcy, but their payroll cannot
compete with top franchises. Teams from major markets like New
York, Los Angeles and Chicago missed the playoffs last season and
are not certain to return this spring.
</P>
<P>
   So the league is heavily promoting Gomez, exposing him to target
demographics, playing up the fact that he is hockey's first
Hispanic star. In the TV studio, Gomez touted the band Korn and
bantered on air with Tyler Stewart, the drummer from Bare-naked
Ladies, who will perform ``O, Canada'' on Sunday. During a
commercial break, Gomez gazed out the large studio window and
suddenly recalled that, two years ago, while visiting Toronto for a
game of junior prospects, he walked down this same street and stood
at the same window, looking in at a telecast of a rock music show.
On this night, kids just younger than Gomez were standing at the
window, staring in at him.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, later in the evening, Gretzky would meet and greet
the news media at his restaurant while touting his new beer
sponsorship. One of the commercials on the big video screen behind
him showed the Great One as the designated driver, taking a friend
home on a Zamboni. Everyone laughed. Turning serious, Gretzky said
beer and its commercials are for adults.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about watching an All-Star Game instead of playing in
it, Gretzky said: ``I miss it. I miss it dearly. I wish I was
playing Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no player on Sunday will show Gretzky's comprehensive
skill level, some _ like Gomez _ have pieces of the Gretzky style:
the soft touch on give-and-go passes, the vision and imagination
for playmaking, the palpable joy of competing. Gretzky, 39, is
almost twice as old. When someone mentioned to Gretzky that Gomez
would like to meet him, Gretzky smiled and nodded and said: ``I'd
like to meet him, too. I'm looking forward to seeing him play.''

BRUSH WITH LAW INCREASINGLY ENDS WITH NIGHT IN JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After stewing for 24 hours in crowded holding cells,
Robert Schenck found himself in a drab first-floor courtroom of the
Manhattan Criminal Courts building one night last month, exhausted,
confused and charged with trespassing in an apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Schenck, a 29-year-old South Carolina man, insisted he was a
bystander wrongly caught up in a police sweep. With a job in
construction and no criminal record, he did not fit the typical
profile of a criminal defendant. But he was about to encounter the
assembly-line justice of Manhattan night court, side by side with
hardened felons and repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In a proceeding that took less than a minute, Schenck accepted a
deal that gave him his freedom in exchange for a guilty plea to a
lesser trespassing charge and a $45 fine. Facing a yearlong wait
for a trial, he pleaded guilty to be free of the charges and free
of New York. ``I just came here to visit my family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schenck was among the first of 86 people to be arraigned before
Judge Martin P. Murphy in a Jan. 27 night court session that
illustrated how, in the final years of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration, the city's six-year ``quality of life'' crackdown
against low-level crimes is approaching its zenith.
</P>
<P>
   The zero-tolerance approach toward ticket scofflaws, turnstile
jumpers, public drinkers, marijuana smokers and others, which may
be out of the headlines but is still in full effect, has been
widely credited with the sharp decreases in overall crime.
</P>
<P>
   But with misdemeanor arrest totals still high despite the drop
in crime, judges and defense lawyers say an increasing number of
people from all walks of life are spending nights in jail for minor
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many low-level offenders would have been taken to a
precinct station house, issued a desk appearance ticket and told to
be in court at a later date. But frustrated that half the people
issued tickets fail to show up in court, administration officials
say that even petty lawbreakers must be jailed overnight to ensure
that they come before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the number of desk-appearance tickets issued declined
63 percent to 16,748, from 45,868 the year before. Overall, during
the Giuliani years, the number of people arrested and jailed
overnight in the city has increased by a third, to 366,288 last
year, from 272,718 in 1993, the last year of the Dinkins
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of arraignments, in which defendants are formally
charged before a judge, leaves the courts in a continual struggle
to keep from being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening progressed, Murphy, a 50-year-old former Legal
Aid lawyer from Brooklyn who was appointed by Giuliani in 1996,
resolved such cases so quickly that court administrators were
prompted to praise him.
</P>
<P>
   During his 5:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift, he arraigned defendants in
96 cases _ nearly three-quarters of them misdemeanors. A decade
earlier, half the cases at an arraignment shift would have been
felonies, court administrators say, and arraigning 50 cases in a
night would have seemed speedy.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy leaned heavily on an old court tactic, plea bargains,
using them to resolve 59 percent of the cases. Ten years ago,
roughly 45 percent of cases were resolved with a plea at
arraignment, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the system abound. Giuliani, police officials
and prosecutors have said that the plea deals are far too lenient
and that more judges are needed. Defense lawyers said that their
clients must wait a year for trials and that their minority
defendants in particular complain of unfair arrests and pressure to
plead guilty to crimes they did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Schenck, who is black, seemed to be a case in point. Instead of
being grateful for his plea bargain, he seethed outside Murphy's
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as he and two friends from South Carolina were
walking up a flight of stairs to his cousin's apartment the night
before, they had been confronted by police officers who had already
arrested several young men for trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the police said no one in the building knew the
three young men. But Schenck said the officers never checked.
``Before I could knock on the door, the police had the gun at my
head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O. Griffith, an insurance executive from Teaneck, N.J.,
whose nephew was arrested with Schenck, pointed out that the vast
majority of the low-level defendants in court that night were black
and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a common complaint, he asserted that Schenck and his
friends were picked up because they were black. ``It's pure
harassment,'' he said. ``You don't see these kinds of things
happening in white neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Back inside Murphy's courtroom, the crush of minor cases
continued. During the dinner break, the judge, who also worked as a
criminal justice aide in both the Dinkins and Giuliani
administrations, defended the city's aggressive arrest policy.
Trespassing sweeps in apartment buildings sometimes capture
innocent people, he said, but they also lead to major arrests. In
one of the most serious drug arrests of the evening, he pointed
out, a large amount of cocaine was discovered on a man stopped for
trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   And the court system is far more efficient than a decade ago,
Murphy said, when it was routine for defendants to be held on
relatively minor charges for four to five days before being
arraigned and released. Today, thanks to computerization and
streamlined procedures, nearly all defendants are arraigned within
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani administration officials said the night in court
demonstrated the need for more judges to handle more cases, which
would reduce the pressure to offer plea bargains. Steven M.
Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, said the arrests
and overnight detentions were justified. ``They've had a tremendous
beneficial impact on decreasing crime and improving the quality of
life in the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To many of the low-level defendants, the vast majority of whom
were minorities, a night in jail is overkill. ``It's a waste of
time,'' said George Solis, a maintenance man who is Hispanic and
was arrested for public drinking. ``It's a waste of taxpayers'
money.''

MCCALL SEEKS A STATE MORATORIUM ON NEW GAMBLING VENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In an indirect challenge to Gov. George Pataki,
state Comptroller Carl McCall called Saturday for a moratorium on
the expansion of gambling in New York and said the state must
devote more attention to gambling's social and economic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a Democrat, is considering running for governor in 2002
against Pataki, a Republican who has made several attempts to
expand gambling in New York. Without mentioning Pataki by name,
McCall's report, to be released Sunday, criticizes state officials
for rushing to embrace casinos and new lottery games as ready
sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Introducing all this gambling is a gamble itself,'' he said in
a statement. ``The state is gambling away good sense for the sake
of expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCall, who has a reputation as a cautious politician, never
makes clear in his report whether he supports or opposes gambling.
Instead, the 52-page report is loaded with general information
about national and state policies on gambling and the social
problems created by gambling addictions. It ends with a call for a
moratorium on the expansion of gambling until the state addresses a
wide range of gambling-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for McCall, said the comptroller
was ``not anti-gambling'' but wanted to focus attention on an
important issue because some Albany lawmakers have forged ahead
with plans for everything from new lottery games to Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is regarded as the most
powerful Democrat in the Legislature, wants to allow casino
gambling in economically depressed areas like Niagara Falls and the
Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has lobbied to bring Powerball, the lottery game
sponsored by 20 states and the District of Columbia, to the state,
and he won legislative approval for Quick Draw _ a keno-style
lottery game played on video monitors in bars and delis _ in 1995
with the promise of new revenue. But last year, as antigambling
forces mobilized, the Legislature passed on his request to expand
Quick Draw.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Pataki has given tacit support to a proposal for
an Indian casino in Monticello that is awaiting approval from the
federal government. In 1997, he backed an unsuccessful amendment
that would have changed the Constitution to allow non-Indian
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Conway, a spokesman for the governor, said Pataki had not
yet seen McCall's report but questioned its intent. ``If it's like
most of Carl McCall's recent work products, I'm sure it will be
long on political rhetoric and very short on the facts,'' Conway
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall did not specify how long the moratorium should last, but
he urged Pataki and lawmakers to address a number of issues ranging
from the economic impact of casinos to gambling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked for more money to finance treatment and prevention
programs for gambling addictions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCall's efforts were welcomed by at least one group. Laura M.
Letson, executive director of the New York Council on Problem
Gambling, a nonprofit group, estimated that nearly 11 percent of
adults in the state, or about 1 million people, had
gambling-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem that every time you turn around, the governor is
promoting one form of gambling or another as a means of moving
forward,'' she said. ``We take objection to these recommendations
being made without having a comprehensive plan of action that would
address the adverse effects.''

NEW JERSEY FITS THE PRESCRIPTION FOR DRUG COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to run with the big dogs, you have to go where the
big dogs are,'' said Gerald P. Belle, the president of Aventis
Pharmaceutical, about the company's decision to shift the operating
headquarters of his newly merged company from Kansas City and
suburban Philadelphia to Parsippany, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry is in a phase of consolidation as
companies seek to spread the cost of developing new drugs over a
broader sales base. Increasingly, it is consolidating in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company executives and consultants say there are a variety
of reasons, some of them historical, that have led to the
industry's concentration in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And as the recent decisions of a number of companies to move
into the state or expand their New Jersey operations indicate, many
leaders of the industry believe that a location in the state offers
the advantageous combination of access to business and technical
talent, regulatory agencies and global markets.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia AB of Sweden and Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich.,
initially chose an area near London as an operating base after the
two companies merged in 1995. But within a year of the appointment
of a former American Home Products executive, Fred Hassan, as chief
executive, the company was hunting for headquarters space on the
East Coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It landed first in Bridgewater, N.J., and then moved on to
nearby Peapack, where it currently has over 1,000 employees in a
550,000-square-foot building once occupied by Beneficial Corp. If
the company completes its merger with Monsanto Co., as expected in
the second quarter of this year, a spokesman said, much of
Monsanto's pharmaceutical operations will be transferred from St.
Louis to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey was the jewel we were looking for,'' Hassan said
after signing a 12-year lease for the Peapack building. ``With 15
of the world's largest drug companies dotting the landscape, New
Jersey truly was the nation's medicine chest.'' Hassan has also
called New Jersey ``the global center of gravity of the
pharmaceutical industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now called Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the company will change its name
to Pharmacia Corp. once the merger with Monsanto is completed, with
the names Upjohn and Monsanto used to designate divisions within
the overall company.
</P>
<P>
   Another heavy hitter may be on the way. Two British companies,
Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham have announced their
intention to merge, creating the largest drug company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have already said they plan to place an operating
headquarters in the United States, although the corporate
headquarters will remain in London. The company has said they plan
to build in the general vicinity of New York City and the betting
in real estate circles is that it will be somewhere near Princeton,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis will be staying in the state, but plans to move from
Parsippany in Morris County to Bridgewater in Somerset County when
two buildings, each with 310,000 square feet of space, are built.
In the meantime it is renting 340,000 square feet of space as an
interim headquarters from SJP Properties, a New Jersey-based
developer and property owner that is also building the Bridgewater
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Belle said it was important to have the company's major
administrative and research operations in one location to help
create a brand image to go with a new name. ``We have an
opportunity to put a united front on Aventis before the financial
community and the world at large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies that have long been established in the state are
expanding to keep up in the race to develop new medicines. Merck &AMP;
Co. has said it is investing $1 billion in its research and
development facility in Rahway. Hoffman-LaRoche is building a new
factory on its 125-acre tract in the towns of Clifton and Nutley
that will be dedicated to its new anti-obesity drug, Xenical. Other
companies have major projects under way as well.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of mergers has meant that some properties are coming to
market. Since research and development centers are costly and take
a long time to build, the properties are attractive to companies
who want to enter the U.S. market or expand their operations here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pharmaceutical industry's capital investment is
enormous,'' said Thomas Glerum, a senior director at Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield, a real estate brokerage and services company. ``Those
research and development buildings cost $400 a square foot without
equipment,'' he said. ``High-end office buildings do not exceed
$220 a square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   James J. Garibaldi, chief executive of the Garibaldi Group, a
brokerage and services concern in Chatham, said that among the
interesting properties coming on the market as a result of mergers
is Aventis' research and development complex in Collegeville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis, which was formed by the merger of Hoechst and
Rhone-Poulenc, is consolidating its research and development at
Hoechst's facility in Bridgewater, making Rhone-Poulenc's
Collegeville facility surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a 1.7 million-square-foot research campus in Summit
that is being offered for sale by Novartis. The company was formed
in 1997 by the merger of the pharmaceutical division of Ciba-Geigy
and Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corp., and the combined company has
decided to consolidate its research facilities and offices at the
former Sandoz headquarters in East Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the former Ciba-Geigy property in Summit on the
market. ``A lot of pharmaceutical companies want to acquire it, but
they want it instantly,'' said Andrew Merin, an executive director
of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield of New Jersey. But since construction in
East Hanover will probably not be completed until 2003 or 2004, he
said, instant gratification is not possible, at least for the
entire property.
</P>
<P>
   Merin said he expects the sale to take place this year, but
Novartis is expected to lease about 400,000 square feet of space at
the Summit site until the East Hanover buildings are completed.
</P>
<P>
   All this activity and investment is producing results, according
to a study underwritten by the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey,
a trade group for the larger pharmaceutical companies in the state.
More than 40 percent of all the new medicines approved by the Food
and Drug Administration in 1999 were developed by companies based
in New Jersey.

 &HT;    Drive, determination fuel Buzek's success
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ He never quite drew the four- or five-deep hoard of
notepads that circled Jaromir Jagr or the Canadian TV cameras that
followed Mark Messier. But Petr Buzek did nice, consistent business
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They walked up, Buzek told the story of his car accident, they
left. Another wave came, leading to another story about the same
accident. Occasionally, there would be new details. Sometimes he
was changing a CD before he hit the tree. In most versions, he had
just fallen asleep. Fortunately, in no version did he ever actually
die.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change it up a little bit sometimes,'' the
Thrashers rookie, said smiling. ``It would be boring if it was the
same thing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years ago, he was in a wheelchair. Saturday, Buzek
officially became the Thrashers' first All-Star when he
participated in the World team practice and mass interviews for
today's game at the Air Canada Centre. A red All-Star jersey with
the No. 2 and Buzek's name was hanging near an interview podium
when he walked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey look _ Buzek,'' he said in his heavy Czech accent. ``Must
be a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzek's talent, however, had little to do with the constant flow
of reporters to his area. The subject was the car crash in the
Czech Republic on June 3, 1995, a month before the NHL draft, that
nearly took his life; that nearly resulted in him having his right
leg amputated; and that nearly ended his dream of playing in the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly'' went 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   He retold the tale so many times Saturday that it was suggested
he have his X-rays hanging by his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think that would be a good idea,'' he said. ``It
wouldn't be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what they would show: 21 screws and two metal plates
holding Buzek together. The box score: 10 screws and a plate in his
left leg, seven screws and a plate in his right ankle, two screws
in his right knee cap, two screws in his right wrist. That doesn't
take into account the facial fractures, the concussion, the broken
left leg, the fused big toe, the busted nose, the cuts and the
bruises that also came with smashing into ``the big tree.'' That's
how the accident story always ends. ``I hit the big tree.''
</P>
<P>
   It was late at night after a party. Buzek was driving home in
Jihlava, a small town about 45 miles outside of Prague. A friend
was with him. Buzek was speeding at about 80 mph on a windy road.
Then came the CD change or the unscheduled nap. Can't be sure.
Concussion, you know.
</P>
<P>
   The friend suffered a broken nose. Buzek was a mess. The car was
a mess. He was unconscious for more than two hours while a crew
worked to cut him out of the car. Buzek woke up in the hospital _
three days later. Seemingly every part of his body was in a cast,
stitched, bruised or all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, he went to the draft in Edmonton, where most had
projected him to be a top-10 pick. Dallas took him 63rd. Not bad,
considering he was in a wheelchair at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another series of operations followed. Dr. David Reid,
Edmonton's team physician, rebroke Buzek's right knee _ the bone
wasn't set properly by doctors in Czech. ``I was healing, and then
they say we want to break it again,'' Buzek said. ``But they said,
`Don't worry, you'll be asleep.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was another six months before Buzek made it back on skates.
After a year out of uniform, Buzek played 67 games with the Stars'
top minor-league affiliate in Michigan (IHL). He had 10 points in
1996-97, 25 the following year. There were cameo appearances for
three seasons in Dallas. But when it came time for the expansion
draft, the Stars felt they couldn't afford to protect Buzek and
leave a top veteran defensemen available for the Thrashers.
Assistant general manager Les Jackson, formerly of Dallas, advised
GM Don Waddell to grab Buzek.
</P>
<P>
   That led to Saturday. Buzek was the Thrashers' best player for
the first two months of the season, then he started incurring some
of the ups-and-downs associated with young players. Coach Curt
Fraser even sat him for two games _ ironically, just prior to him
being named to the All-Star Game. There also have been some
injuries _ a concussion knocked him out for six games, a bruised
shoulder for one, a strained groin for four, a virus for two.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, he looked around the room and felt fine. He
planned to get autographs later. ``Here I am, in the same room with
Jagr and (Pavel) Bure. It's like a dream. The whole thing is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents are back in Czech. They will visit Atlanta later
this season but Buzek didn't think they should come to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has never even been on an airplane,'' he said.
``Seeing all this would give him a heart attack.''

 UNDATED: New Jersey.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the 40 new drugs and biological agents approved by the
federal agency last year, 17 were from New Jersey companies.
California, home to many new biological-development companies, was
second with six approvals, and North Carolina was third with three.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has an outsized economic impact on the state,
according to an economic survey conducted for the institute by the
PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting and consulting company. The
survey, using 1998 data, found that the industry was responsible
for 140,000 direct and indirect jobs in New Jersey and contributed
$10.3 billion to the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the pharmaceutical companies themselves
represent 57,629 full-time jobs, with 43,716 more in services, such
as overseeing clinical trials, shifted from the companies to
outside suppliers. Indirectly supported jobs, such as those in
restaurants and other services used by pharmaceutical employees,
brought the total to 140,000, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Those drug industry workers certainly have money to spend. Total
compensation of workers at pharmaceutical companies, excluding
benefits, averaged $80,223 per worker, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compensation level reflects the high proportion of
industry employees with advanced scientific and business degrees,
as well as the fact that almost one-fourth of the industry's
employees work in the sophisticated research and development
functions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Tremayne, president of the institute, which was
formed in 1997 to give the hotly competitive industry a single
voice, said the number of jobs makes the drug industry the largest
manufacturing industry in the state, with twice as many as the
second-ranking category, printing and publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Zenner, the chairman of the institute and president
of the American operations of the Swiss-based Hoffman-LaRoche, said
the industry's need for common voice was the result of the health
care debates of the early 1990s. He said the industry was surprised
to find that it was unpopular in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were heavily criticized and realized we needed to do a
better job of communications,'' he said. He said criticism based on
the cost of new medicines overlooked the costly and complex nature
of inventing new drugs. ``It takes from 12 to 14 years between when
a discovery'' is made and when it comes to market as a drug, he
said, ``and it costs $500 million to bring a new medicine to the
public. We don't think that message went out.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why the drug industry is concentrated in New Jersey, he
said that in Hoffman-LaRoche's case, it was the result of a drive
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1896 in Basel, Switzerland, came to the
United States in 1905, opening an office in New York City to sell
medicines imported from Europe. As the business grew, it became
clear that the company would have to begin doing research and
manufacturing in this country and that doing so would be difficult
in the cramped confines of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zenner, Nelson Peterson, then the head of the
company's United States operations, went for a drive in New Jersey
in 1928. At that time, large tracts of land in the northern part of
the state were still devoted to farms. Stopping for gas, he decided
that a site straddling the Clifton-Nutley border just south of
Route 3 would do nicely for a production plant and offices.
</P>
<P>
   (A similar tale is told of why Johnson &AMP; Johnson is in New
Brunswick, N.J. According to a corporate history, one of the
brothers for whom the company is named, James, was on a
Pennsylvania Railroad train headed for Philadelphia in 1886. As it
slowed to cross the Raritan River at New Brunswick, he spotted a
``To Let'' sign on a four-story brick building in the town. It
became the first headquarters of the company.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some pharmaceutical companies that put manufacturing,
administration and R&AMP;D in different locations, Hoffman-LaRoche does
all three on its main campus. In addition to the building being
constructed to make Xenical, Zenner said some older buildings have
been demolished to make way for a new research complex.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other companies now in New Jersey have their roots
in New York or, if foreign based, opened their first offices there.
But as they grew, the cheap farmland in New Jersey beckoned because
it was still close to the city and its port. At first they stayed
close to the city or along the railroad lines, but as the state's
highway system developed, they scattered around the northern part
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the easy accessibility to Newark International Airport
became an important factor. ``Accessibility to an international
airport is important because these are global businesses,'' said
Tremayne. ``If you are located in the hinterland, you have to take
a domestic flight to get to the international flight.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to international travel, New Jersey's location about
an hour's flight from Washington is important to companies that
have to be in regular contact with the Food and Drug Administration
during the drawn-out process of seeking approval of new medicines,
Tremayne said.

 UNDATED: Tremayne said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many in the pharmaceutical industry observe that the
concentration of drug companies in New Jersey has produced a pool
of talent in the state that companies moving in can tap. This
allows new entrants to hire researchers and executives without the
expense of moving them from other parts of the country and allows
individuals to move up the ladder without disrupting their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Within the pool of pharmaceutical talent, ``New Jersey has the
largest concentration of scientists in the nation,'' said Gualberto
Medina, the state's director of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Palo, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who helped
conduct the economic study for the HealthCare Institute, said that
``access to talent is no small issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about Ph.D.s, MBAs and masters in public
health,'' Palo said. ``When pharmaceutical companies go shopping
for these kind of people, they do so in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the sites for meetings of professional and scientific
societies was an indication of the number of highly educated people
living and working in the state. ``They are almost always in New
Jersey, at places like the Newark Airport Marriott or the Princeton
Hyatt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug companies are often not happy about the prospect of
their scientists mingling with those from other companies, out of a
concern that research secrets may leak out and the danger that
their brightest talents will be recruited by others. As a result
they tend to build campuslike research facilities, both to
replicate the academic settings where researchers received their
training and to keep them on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies build self-contained developments with a ton
of amenities to keep their scientists at home,'' said Merin of
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Medina said it became apparent about five years ago that the
pharmaceutical industry was going to globalize and that his agency
has been wooing companies still based offshore. ``When Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn was still in London, we sent a letter to Fred Hassan
reminding him about New Jersey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medina predicted that by the time the globalization process was
completed, New Jersey would have gained 50,000 additional jobs in
the industry, despite the layoffs that will come as a result of
combining companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Belle said state incentives were not the critical factor in
the decision to locate Aventis in the state. ``Missouri and
Pennsylvania were pretty interested, too,'' he said. ``So it is not
a question of New Jersey winning the incentive pool. It was no
better and no worse than the other states.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, geography may have been destiny. Palo noted that
about 32 percent of the drug industry's dollar sales are in the
United States, 28 percent in Europe and 20 percent in Japan, with
the rest scattered around the rest of the world. In a global
industry, he said, drugs are launched simultaneously in the major
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey is a pretty good place to be,'' he said. ``It's
about halfway between Europe and Japan.''

JAGR WANTS FOUR ON FOUR AT ALL TIMES  
 CONNOISSEUR OF ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also HKN-NHL-FUTURE)

 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Jaromir Jagr of the Pittsburgh Penguins is leading the
league in scoring with 80 points and is again a candidate for the
Hart trophy as most valuable player. He said the increasing number
of injuries in hockey is a matter of size and space, not equipment,
and he favors a radical solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot move very well, the rink is too small and the guys
are getting stronger and bigger,'' Jagr, who grew up playing on
larger ice surfaces in what was then known as Czechoslovakia, said
Saturday. ``If you skate, you are just going to hit the guy. You
cannot go around him. That's why there are a lot of concussions, a
lot of injuries. It's got nothing to do with equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing with five skaters and one goalie, Jagr
suggests that teams ``play four on four, all the time,'' plus a
goalie, the way they do for overtime in the new format instituted
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to improve the game, make it more exciting for the
fans, I would make it four on four,'' Jagr said. ``It would be
really exciting. I would change it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for attendance problems in many cities, Jagr said tickets are
too expensive. ``I remember it was $20 when I came into the
league,'' Jagr said. ``Now, it's $75. If it was $20, it would be
sold out every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros Makes Voice Heard
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros, the captain of the Philadelphia Flyers, is not the
only player in the league who complains about poor ice conditions
that hinder skating and cause pucks to bounce and roll out of
control. But Lindros is one of the NHL's biggest stars. His words,
like his shots and body checks, carry more weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go and they build these facilities for $200 million or
$300 million, and it would be great if the ice surfaces were up to
the standards of the dressing rooms,'' Lindros said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are paying a lot of money to watch players play hockey
and guys want to perform. To make proper passes and to skate, it's
much easier to do on proper ice. The game would be much quicker, it
would be a better product.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 rinks in the league, Lindros said ``three or four are
really good'' and ``about seven are pretty decent'' and ``some are
just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   The best ice surfaces tend to be the ones that don't share their
buildings with basketball teams. ``Edmonton,'' Lindros said, ``and
Calgary have great ice. Detroit has terrific ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros put Ottawa, Washington and New Jersey in the middle
group, but added: ``There's got to be a way something can be done.
Our ice in Philly has improved over the last month, but it was
awful at the start of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the worst ice surfaces, Lindros said: ``L.A., San
Jose, Anaheim. Madison Square Garden has awful ice.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PATH TO THE TOP JOB IS BIASED 
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look no further than the case of Art Shell and the New Orleans
Saints to see why it so difficult for blacks to get head coaching
jobs in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   People who are close to Shell, NFL team executives and several
league coaches, both black and white, say that what happened to
Shell last week is the typical experience of what a black person
undergoes while traversing the interview process to become a head
coach. The process, black coaches maintain, is extremely biased,
because in the end, team executives hire people they are
comfortable with _ often coaching buddies or close friends _ and
those people are usually white.
</P>
<P>
   Shell's odyssey began last year in Atlanta, where he was the
offensive line coach of the Falcons and helped guide the team to
Super Bowl XXXIII. After the Falcons' surprising success, Shell's
phone rarely rang, and it didn't this off-season, either, when
there were seven vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   This off-season one of the few phone calls Shell received was
from the Saints, who had fired Mike Ditka. Shell, one of several
candidates, had his first interview late last month. Some others
included the Giants' defensive coordinator, Mike Fox, the Denver
offensive coordinator, Gary Kubiak, and the Pittsburgh defensive
coordinator, Jim Haslett. Shell, Fox and Haslett had great
interviews but only Shell and Haslett were asked back for a second
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shell met with the owner, Tom Benson, last Tuesday, and they
talked for over three hours. The interview, league officials said,
went extremely well. Shell and Benson talked about everything from
Shell's philosophy as a head coach to how he would emphasize the
off-season workout program.
</P>
<P>
   Shell got support from Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, who called
Benson and others in the Saints' organization on Shell's behalf.
Despite a 3-13 record this season, the Falcons' offensive line
remains one of the better-coached lines in the league.
</P>
<P>
   So Shell seemed to have everything. A track record as a head
coach _ he was 56-41 with the Raiders _ a successful stint as a
Falcons key assistant, a recommendation from a potential Hall of
Famer in Reeves and a great interview with the owner.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Haslett get the job and not Shell? This was the rub,
and it replays itself again and again in this hiring process.
Benson had recently hired Randy Mueller from Seattle to be the
team's general manager, and he wanted Mueller to have the final
decision on the new head coach. Mueller liked Haslett more than
Shell. Haslett had a stronger defensive background, and Mueller and
Haslett are extremely close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Haslett, who was the Saints' defensive coordinator in 1996 and
linebackers coach in 1995, is a good coach and deserves the job.
Mueller, of course, has a right to hire whomever he wants. There is
no question that the Saints' interest in Shell was sincere. But
black coaches maintain that they generally do not have what Haslett
did, a good friend in a high-ranking position who will hire them.
</P>
<P>
   Haslett and Shell seemed to be even as candidates, but it was
Haslett's friendship with Mueller that gave Haslett the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may think our friendship had something to do with this
hiring,'' Mueller said. ``I can promise you that it had zero to do
with it. We pick the guy that can do the best job.''
</P>
<P>
   So when black assistant coaches complain about the ``old-boy
network'' it is not always a case in whining. Sometimes it is a
legitimate, serious barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Of the last 32 head coaches hired in the NFL, dating to February
1996, only one, Ray Rhodes in Green Bay, was black. There were
seven head-coaching vacancies this off-season. In most cases, the
person who got the job was a close friend of either the previous
head coach or a team owner or executive.
</P>
<P>
   Miami replaced Jimmy Johnson with his longtime friend Dave
Wannstedt, who was 41-57 as a head coach in Chicago from 1993 to
1998. The Dolphins interviewed no minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells hired his longtime friend Al Groh to replace him
with the Jets. The team interviewed no minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   New England interviewed the veteran black assistant Willie Shaw,
but gave the job to Bill Belichick, who was 37-45 as coach of the
Cleveland Browns from 1991 to 1995. Belichick is a good friend of
the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the Dallas Cowboys did not interview any
black candidates before promoting their defensive coordinator, Dave
Campo, to be the new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay fired Rhodes _ who had lost control of the team _ and
hired Mike Sherman, the former Seahawks offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints went with Haslett.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson told Sports Illustrated recently that the
slow pace of black coaching hires is a result of ``a culture driven
by white supremacists.'' The NFL strongly denounced Jackson's
statement, which was indeed extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Some things have gotten better. According to a June 1992 NFL
internal memo, there were 34 minority coaches and 35 minority
front-office personnel in the league. (Positions like head
groundskeeper and director of team dancers were counted as
minority-filled.) The NFL has since increased its number of key
team front-office positions.
</P>
<P>
   Some things, however, have stayed the same. There were only two
black head coaches _ Tony Dungy and Dennis Green _ in 1992. Eight
years later that number has not changed.

MESSIER'S CAREER AT ANOTHER CROSSROADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Mark Messier's days as a Vancouver Canuck may be
coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The man who willed the New York Rangers to their first Stanley
Cup in 54 years in 1994, and then left for Vancouver three summers
later after a bitter contract dispute, seemed to leave the door
open when asked whether he would return to New York. Or, at the
very least, Messier seemed to signal that he is ready to waive his
no-trade clause and may be sent to a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's going to play out or what's going to
happen,'' the 39-year-old Messier said on the eve of his 14th
National Hockey League All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of ruling it out or ruling it in. It's a
situation where I don't know what's going to happen in the end,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Messier is in the final season of a guaranteed $18 million
three-year deal. The Canucks have an option on next season at $6
million or they can buy him out for $2 million. If the Canucks pick
up the option for the fourth season, they can renew Messier for a
fifth season at $6 million or buy him out at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes things will ever get that far. And on Saturday,
Messier _ who wants to continue playing into his 40s _ sounded as
if he felt the end was near to a Vancouver tenure that has been a
disappointment to the Canucks, their fans and, most of all, to
Messier himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult three years,'' Messier said. ``To sit
here and hypothetically talk about the Rangers, or all the teams
you hear about that are being spoken of, I don't think it would be
fair to my teammates, the team, the city, our fans. I don't want to
sit here and address it in those terms. It's an interesting
situation, obviously, and we don't have long to wait to see how
it's all going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Messier will waive his no-trade
clause if the Canucks guarantee the final two years of his
contract. If so, the Canucks _ who have been in perpetual
rebuilding mode since Messier signed _ could deal Messier to a
contender, or back to the Rangers, before the March 14 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Rangers nor the Canucks has reached the postseason
since Messier signed with Vancouver. Eight teams from each
conference qualify for the playoffs. The surging Rangers entered
the All-Star Game break seventh in the Eastern Conference standing.
The Canucks are 12th in the Western Conference, 10 points out of a
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Messier was selected as an All-Star for what he has accomplished
in 21 seasons more than for his performance this season. A certain
Hall of Famer when he retires, Messier has been hampered by nagging
injuries the last two seasons, especially to his knees. He has
played in 36 of Vancouver's 52 games this season, registering nine
goals and 19 assists for 28 points, third most on a Canucks team
that went into a spiral when Messier missed six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Messier left New York, most felt all the bridges had been
burned. Up until Saturday, it would have been almost impossible to
envision a situation in which Messier would return to the Rangers.
But even though many feel his relationship with the team president
and general manager, Neil Smith, is beyond repair, Saturday's
comments _ however guarded _ could be seen as a possible overture
toward detente. Or even a rapprochement of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not speaking for either side, and I don't want to put
words in anybody's mouth, but when it comes down to winning,
there's never too much water under the bridge,'' said Rangers
goalie Mike Richter, a longtime friend of Messier's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at New Jersey and Claude Lemieux. If he was willing to
come back there, anything's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Messier's skills may have declined from his peak,
there is no questioning his stature throughout the league. Saturday
morning, Messier made a point to say hello to Scott Gomez, the
Devils' 20-year-old rookie, who will be appearing in his first
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `There's Mark Messier,''' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like Jesus walking by.''

GOAL IS 17 FEET IN WOMEN'S POLE VAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Idaho) (lb) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as Stacy Dragila prepared to break her indoor
American record in the pole vault Friday night, organizers of the
Millrose Games clumsily began a Hall of Fame ceremony in the
infield. The meet stopped, her rhythm was interrupted. The lights
went out at Madison Square Garden, and so did any chance for a
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to learn to deal with that stuff,'' Dragila said
later, standing in a portal in the Garden, signing autographs,
shaking hands, thanking the spectators for coming after winning the
vault with a leap of 14 feet 6 inches. ``That's me!'' she screamed,
looking up at the scoreboard to see herself in a credit-card
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   All this is new, the recognition, the commercials, the respect
for an event that will be contested in the Olympics for the first
time in September in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 1984, they didn't think women could run a marathon in
the Olympics,'' the 28-year-old Dragila said. ``Running that many
miles, they thought it might do something inside your body.
Pole-vaulting was the same way. People used to ask me, `Aren't you
worried it's going to mess up your reproductive organs?' Now they
say: `You go, girl! Don't let anyone tell you no.' We deserve
something. We're good at it. Certainly, as participants, it's nice
to see how women can be feminine and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's pole-vaulting has gone from novelty act to headlining
status on the indoor circuit, with its gymnastic grace, frequent
chance for records and spandex muscularity.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila is the world outdoor champion, having tied a world
record of 15-1 last summer. A week ago, she set the American indoor
record of 14-9{. She has also generated considerable buzz in the
athletic world by posing nude in a track-and-field calendar,
holding a pole and wearing nothing but thigh-high boots and spiked
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists cringe at what they call the ``female apologetic,''
the willingness of athletes to put themselves in compromising
situations to gain attention and public acceptance. But Dragila has
joined Katarina Witt, Brandi Chastain and other women of her
generation who believe their exposed bodies can be appreciated as
much for strength and power as sex appeal, even as feminists say
that these women do not control the images they intend to project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're discreet, not nasty,'' Dragila said. ``We are
feminine and strong and confident with our bodies. I'm not going to
look like this forever. I might as well show it while I can.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not set out to become a pole-vaulter. Her family owned a
ranch in Auburn, Calif., north of Sacramento, and in high school
Dragila participated on the rodeo team in the sport of goat-roping.
Her brother Eric finished second in the state in saddle bronc
riding. Goat-roping involved riding her horse to the center of the
arena, dismounting, flipping the animal and binding its legs with
rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm always known as `the goat-roper turned vaulter,'''
Dragila laughed. ``I don't mind. I think it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   At Idaho State University, Dragila was recruited as a
heptathlete. She took up vaulting at the suggestion of her coach,
Dave Nielsen, who had been a pole-vaulter. Several high school
girls, most notably Melissa Price of Fresno, Calif., were
participating, and Dragila agreed to try it, just to please her
coach. ``I had no idea there would be a future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She began gingerly in 1993, attempting 6 feet on her first
attempt. A year later, she cleared 10 feet. Later, she read that 10
feet was an American record. ``If that's an American record and I
stink at it, just think if I put everything into it,'' she told
herself.
</P>
<P>
   As she jumped higher, though, she became unnerved by the idea of
sprinting down a runway with a fiberglass pole, planting it in a
box and inverting her body to clear a bar. It did not seem that she
would ever be able to jump 12{ feet, or 13 feet, the height of the
overpasses in Pocatello, Idaho, where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disorienting, being in the air,'' Dragila said. ``I
didn't feel safe. I didn't know if I was going to land on my feet,
my neck, my head.''
</P>
<P>
   She began training on a trampoline at a gymnastics school to
gain awareness of her body in the air, to lose the fear of being
upside down. Between 1995 and 1996, she improved from 12-1{ to
13-9\. Last summer, the 5-foot-7-inch, 140-pound Dragila jumped
15-1 to win the world championship in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   She continues to train using gymnastics _ on the parallel bars,
high bar, rings _ to increase the strength in her shoulders. And
she also rehearses the events of the heptathlon to increase her
speed. Her speed has increased so much that she had to push her
approach from 102 feet to 106.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen feet is possible this year, Dragila believes. That is
pushing the outer edge of the envelope, she said, given that women
have less speed and upper body strength than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a few women are capable of more than that,'' Dragila
said. ``My goal is 17 feet. Seventeen feet for women is like 20 for
men.''

ANTHONY BLUM, FORMER DANCER AT CITY BALLET, DIES AT 61
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Ala.)   (jw) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Blum, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet
in the 1960s and '70s, died on Dec. 28 at the Wesley Health Center
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He was 61 and lived in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from AIDS, said Patrick Lavin, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and craggy-faced, Blum was a dancer of casual nobility.
Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes described Blum as
having ``a style you could recognize on a darkened stage, a loose
and loping style, with a technique always just as good as it needs
to be and never any better (Blum is no vulgar overachiever) and who
dances like a poet, a characteristically American poet at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Mobile, Ala., Blum trained with Aubrey Hitchens and at
the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   He performed on television and on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   He joined City Ballet in 1958 and was promoted to principal
dancer in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   A quick learner, he soon found himself cast in roles that ranged
from leads in George Balanchine's modernist classics and in Merce
Cunningham's ``Summerspace'' to character parts like the
cigar-chomping husband in Jerome Robbins' ``Concert'' and Hot
Chocolate in Balanchine's staging of ``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Blum originated roles in ``Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3,'' ``Don
Quixote'' and several other Balanchine ballets; in Robbins'
``Dances at a Gathering'' and ``Goldberg Variations''; and in works
by John Clifford, Jacques d'Amboise and Francisco Moncion.
</P>
<P>
   On his retirement from City Ballet and the stage, Blum moved
into a cottage in Saratoga Springs that he had bought and
remodeled, wryly naming it ``Dying Limbs.'' He became a collector
of antique ``things that have a look, but that I won't have to
worry about because their value comes from my liking them,'' he
said in a 1977 interview. He specialized in 19th-century American
pottery and bronze.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked as a designer with the Lily and the Rose, a
catering service in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, John, of Mobile.

USTAD ALLA RAKHA, MASTER OF HINDUSTANI CLASSICAL MUSIC, DIES AT 80
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ustad Alla Rakha, the most important tabla drummer of his
generation, died Thursday at his home in Bombay. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   He had a heart attack when he learned of the death of his
daughter Razia during cataract surgery, said a spokesman for Moment
Records and Zakir Hussain Management, which releases albums by
Rakha and his son Zakir Hussain, who also plays the tabla.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha, who was given the honorific Ustad as a master
musician and teacher, was a virtuoso of the complex system of
talas, rhythmic cycles that are central to Hindustani classical
music, and he used his skill to invigorate every musician who
shared the stage with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All life is rhythm,'' he once said in an interview. Sitting
calmly, with his hands a blur of speed above his drums, he traded
smiles and dazzling, incendiary improvisations with leading figures
in Indian music, among them the sitar players Ravi Shankar, Vilayat
Khan and Ali Akbar Khan.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the first tabla player to give solo concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has lost an accomplished maestro whose mastery
over the tabla created waves all over the world,'' the prime
minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said in a statement. ``He
strode like a colossus on the scene of Indian classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   Alla Rakha Qureshi was a farmer's son who grew up in a small
village in the Jammu region of Punjab. He was drawn to music and
theater as a child, and began studying music against his parents'
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   His first tabla teacher, Lal Mohamed, was a disciple of Mian
Qader Bakshi, a leading musician in the Punjab gharana, or school,
of classical music. When he was 12 he ran away from home to study
with Bakshi in Lahore, in what is now Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He began performing on Lahore Radio, and in 1936 he moved to
Delhi to work for All India Radio, and then to Bombay. During the
1930s he studied raga singing with Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan of the
Patiala gharana. He also married a cousin, Bavi Begum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943 he began working in the Bombay film industry as a music
director for Rangmahal Studios, and he provided music for two dozen
films in Hindi and Punjabi.
</P>
<P>
   He performed with Shankar, who also worked for All India Radio,
in the '40s, and their partnership carried Hindustani classical
music beyond India's borders.
</P>
<P>
   He made a percussion album with the jazz drummer Buddy Rich, and
he performed with Shankar at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and
at the first Woodstock festival in 1969. Although he occasionally
collaborated with Western musicians, he was revered for his
classical performances.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he had devoted much of his time to teaching. His
three sons _ Hussain, Fazal Qureshi and Taufiq Qureshi _ are all
tabla players, and he ran a music school, the Alla Rakha Institute
of Music, in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and sons, he is survived by another
daughter, Kurshid Aulia of London, and nine grandchildren.

HERBERT I. SCHILLER, 80, CRITIC OF CORPORATE CONTROL OF TV
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., N.Y., Ohio, Ill.)   (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbert I. Schiller, a teacher, writer and critic who studied
the subject of communication, died Jan. 29 in La Jolla, Calif. He
was 80 and a longtime La Jolla resident.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller was trained as an economist, began studying the media
in the '60s and was a professor of communication at the University
of California at San Diego from 1970 until he retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave shape and texture to the modern study of communication
and culture in America,'' said Neil Postman, a professor of media
ecology at New York University, where Schiller taught frequently in
his last years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the targets in his books was television. In ``Culture,
Inc.: The Corporate Takeover of Public Expression'' (Oxford
University Press, 1989), he asserted that commercial television
represented ``the daily ideological instruction of the viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, The New York Times television critic John J. O'Connor
said the television series ``Beverly Hills 90210'' with its
emphasis on fashion was a ``perfect illustration'' of Dr.
Schiller's point.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said he studied the impact of the expansion of
corporate power in America ``on the social landscape _ especially
the cultural activity and the visions that sustain a people.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that U.S. corporations had come to exercise undue
control over cultural life elsewhere, particularly in the
developing lands.
</P>
<P>
   Kaarle Nordenstreng, a Finnish scholar who is president of the
International Association for Mass Communication Research, said,
``His ideas traveled well in the divided world of the East, West
and South.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller's last book, finished recently, is ``Living in the
Number One Country: Reflections from a Critic of American Empire.''
It is to be published this year.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he grew up in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan, graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and
received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from City College of New York,
a master's degree in 1941 from Columbia and, after serving in the
Army during World War II, his doctorate in 1960 from New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   He lectured at City College and was a government economist, a
professor of economics at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and a
research professor at the University of Illinois before moving to
the University of California &UR;  &LR; at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Anita L.
Rosenbaum; two sons, Dan, of Del Mar, Calif. and Zach, of
Cleveland, and two grandchildren.

SARAH CAUDWELL, BRITISH AUTHOR AND LAWYER, DIES AT 60
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Britain)   (jw) 
 By MARILYN STASIO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Caudwell, the British author whose modest but ecstatically
received output of three erudite and maliciously witty mystery
novels led at least one critic to compare her to Oscar Wilde, died
Jan. 28 at her home in London. She was 60.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Barney Karpfinger, her agent.
</P>
<P>
   Caudwell produced her first novel, ``Thus Was Adonis Murdered,''
in 1981, during an accomplished career as a Chancery barrister. The
novel was set in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where the author had
practiced law. It featured a sleuth, Hilary Tamar, who taught law
at Oxford, as did Caudwell.
</P>
<P>
   Although the story revolved around the lusty antics of ``a
decorative little group'' of junior barristers, it was the
classical erudition and acerbic tongue of the narrator, whose sex
is never stated, that set the droll tone of the series. ``I am an
historian'' was Tamar's explanation for the devious workings of his
or her mind. ``My profession largely consists of speaking ill of
the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shortest Way to Hades'' (1985) and ``The Sirens Sang of
Murder'' (1989) continued in the same elegantly mannered style,
with stories bound up in arcane areas of British law and steeped in
obscure allusions to classical literature. (A crucial clue in ``The
Shortest Way to Hades'' is embedded in Book XI of ``The Odyssey.'')
Her final novel, ``The Sybil in Her Grave,'' which deals with
insider stock trading and corporate takeovers, will be published in
June by Delacorte Press.
</P>
<P>
   The incisiveness of her legal points won her admirers among
members of the profession, including Robert Bork (who was once
quoted as saying, ``In my opinion, there can't be too many Sarah
Caudwell novels''), while the gleeful savagery of her satiric style
made her a darling of the critics. Newgate Callendar, in The New
York Times Book Review, praised her for writing ``in a kind of
English that has not been around since the days of Oscar Wilde.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Caudwell was born May 27, 1939, to the author and
journalist Claud Cockburn and his wife, Jean Ross, the actress and
writer who was Christopher Isherwood's model for Sally Bowles in
his Berlin stories and the musical ``Cabaret.'' Caudwell chose the
surname Caudwell because it was a family name. She is survived by
her half-brothers, the political writers Alexander, Andrew and
Patrick Cockburn.
</P>
<P>
   Her family ``recognized how much of Sarah there was in her
characters,'' Andrew Cockburn said. ``There are certain aspects of
Hilary Tamar, certain eccentricities, that are pure Sarah, although
not Sarah's pipe-smoking. And, of course, that acuity of mind.
Sarah had this incredibly sharp brain, which was evidenced by her
success at both navigating and portraying what someone in Oliver
Cromwell's Parliament once called `the tortuous, ungodly jungle of
English law.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Aberdeen University and received her law
degree at St. Ann's College, Oxford. When she arrived there, the
Oxford Union, a prestigious debating society, was still closed to
women, said Andrew Cockburn. She led the fight that changed that,
and she made her point at one off-limits event that she attended
dressed as a man. Her disguise was discovered and she was ejected,
but ultimately won the war.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the Chancery bar in 1966 and worked in property and
tax law. When she joined Lloyds Bank, she became a senior executive
in the trust department.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a woman, she had to have had a first-class mind to join the
Chancery bar, to have built up a successful practice and to have
become a senior executive at Lloyds,'' said a friend and fellow
barrister, John Tackebury. ``All these institutions were highly
resistant to women at a senior level, and certainly to a woman who
smoked a pipe.''

ALAN NORTH, CHARACTER ACTOR, DIES AT 79 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Calif., Md., D.C.)  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan North, a character actor whose career spanned more than 50
years, died on Jan. 19 at a hospital near his home in Port
Jefferson, N.Y. He was 79 and also had a home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was kidney and lung cancer, his wife, June, said.
</P>
<P>
   Across five decades, North portrayed a wealth of characters on
the stage and screen, appearing in some 30 films, including ``Plaza
Suite,'' ``Serpico,'' ``... And Justice for All,'' ``Thief of
Hearts,'' ``Billy Galvin,'' ``Lean on Me'' and ``I'm Not
Rappaport.'' A frequent player on such early television series as
``The Jackie Gleason Show,'' ``Studio One'' and the Ellery Queen
mystery series, he landed one of his most prominent and popular
roles in 1982 as the co-star, with Leslie Nielsen, of the
short-lived ABC spoof ``Police Squad!''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, North shuttled between musical comedies and straight
plays, making his Broadway debut in the 1955 musical ``Plain and
Fancy.'' He went on to perform in ``Conversations With My Father,''
``Dylan,'' the City Center revival of ``South Pacific,'' ``Plaza
Suite'' and ``Marilyn'' before his final stage performance last
spring in the Signature Theater production of John Guare's ``Lake
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   North, who was born in the Bronx, served in the U.S. Navy in
World War II before venturing into the theater, initially as a
stage manager. Early on he was the host of a pre- and post-game
television show for the Baltimore Orioles and broadcast his own
sports program on WRC-TV in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters,
Alexandra Jackson of Rocky Point, N.Y., and Victoria North of Port
Jefferson, and three grandchildren.

DAVID LEVY, TV EXECUTIVE WHO MADE `THE ADDAMS FAMILY,' DIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., Pa.)   (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Levy, a television executive and producer who created
``The Addams Family'' series for ABC, died Jan. 25 in Beverly
Hills, Calif., where he lived. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming vice president for programming at NBC in 1959,
Levy helped to turn around the network's fortunes with shows like
``Dr. Kildare'' and ``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sparked some controversy when he introduced
commercial-release movies to network television with the ``Movie of
the Week'' series, and he was instrumental in elevating Johnny
Carson to host of ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy left NBC in the early 1960s at the height of the Senate
hearings into sex and violence on television, refusing to accept
the blame for excesses he believed he had rallied against.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, during his 20-year tenure as the executive director of
the Caucus of Producers-Writers-Directors, he helped to steer the
organization into support for stricter ratings on television for
sex, violence, nudity and strong language.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving NBC he moved to Los Angeles and produced ``The
Addams Family'' for ABC. He also developed other series, including
``Sarge'' and ``The Pruitts of Southampton,'' and assisted in the
revival of ``Name That Tune.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania, Levy began his career in radio, producing ``We the
People'' in the early 1940s before joining the Navy during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge he joined the Young &AMP; Rubicam advertising
agency and rose to vice president in the television department. He
also pioneered the televising of political conventions, beginning
in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Lance Lee of Pacific Palisades, Calif.;
a daughter, Linda Gorman of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.; a twin
brother, Dr. Charles Lee of Wynnewood, Pa.; five grandchildren; and
two great-grandchildren.

EX-FOES FROM SOUTH AFRICA HOPE TO MEDIATE ULSTER CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
 AFRICA-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Two men who negotiated the end of apartheid in South
Africa, one an ANC guerrilla leader, the other a leader of the
white minority government, were set to arrive in Belfast Sunday to
seek a compromise over the arms dispute that threatens to wreck the
new power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Sathyandranath ``Mac'' Maharaj, a Nelson Mandela confidant who
was one of the last African National Congress fighters to lay down
his arms, and Leon Wessels, a Cabinet minister in the apartheid
regime, are scheduled to hold meetings with political parties and
paramilitary groups over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   While the British and Irish governments were still frustrated
Saturday in their efforts to get the Irish Republican Army to
commit itself to disarm or to persuade the Ulster Unionists not to
walk out of the two-month-old assembly, it is hoped the perspective
of outsiders who have long-established links with the parties will
bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the difficulty facing the African negotiators,
however, the IRA issued a statement Saturday saying it would not
respond to the British government's warning that the power-sharing
government would be suspended by Friday if the IRA did not commit
to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA repeated its commitment to finding what it called a
``permanent peace,'' but lashed out at a claim by Peter Mandelson,
the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland, that the IRA
has ``betrayed'' everyone in Northern Ireland by not disarming, or
decommissioning, as it is called here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA have never entered into any agreement, undertaking or
understanding at any time with anyone on any aspect of
decommissioning. We have not broken our commitment or betrayed
anyone,'' the IRA said. ``The IRA believes that this crisis can be
averted and the issue of arms can be resolved. This will not be on
British or Unionist terms nor will it be advanced by British
legislative threats.''
</P>
<P>
   To avert a walkout by Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble that
London believes would make it more difficult to reconvene the
power-sharing government, Britain introduced legislation that would
suspend the Belfast assembly if the IRA does not make a gesture on
disarmament by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the unionists say they want to see actual weapons being
handed in, Mandelson suggested Friday that a public commitment from
the IRA to begin disarming would be enough to keep the
power-sharing government afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally,
met with Trimble for about a half-hour Saturday in Belfast, but
neither man reported any progress.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said the IRA statement, which repeated a pledge to
maintain its cease-fire, was disappointing because ``they have
nothing new to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and his party, which represents most Protestants in
Northern Ireland, had agreed to form a government that includes two
Cabinet ministers from Sinn Fein, but only with the understanding
that the IRA begin turning in its arsenal by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein maintains that Trimble had no right to set deadlines
that fall outside the terms of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.
That agreement, which set up the political institutions aimed at
ending 30 years of conflict that has taken some 3,600 lives, said
paramilitary groups should finish disarming by May, but set no date
for the process to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, George Mitchell, the former senator from Maine who
mediated the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement and then
fashioned the compromise leading to the power-sharing government,
ruled out returning again.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Africans Sunday will attempt to bring the warring
factions together. The South Africans who negotiated a peaceful end
to apartheid have a relationship with all the major players in the
Irish peace process, a bond that traces its roots to a conference
at the University of Massachusetts at Boston in 1992. Padraig
O'Malley, a senior fellow at the McCormack Insitute of Public
Affairs at UMass, who organized that conference and follow-up
gatherings in Boston in 1995 and South Africa in 1997, helped get
Maharaj and Wessels to Belfast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Saturday night in South Africa, where he is doing
research, O'Malley said Maharaj and Wessels represent ``a last
gasp'' in trying to find a compromise to keep the power-sharing
government and the peace process alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maharaj and Wessels are crack negotiators who know all the
players, and enjoy the respect of all the players,'' said O'Malley.
``I contacted every party and asked if their presence would be
useful and they all said yes. They are hoping to find a way to keep
the process alive. Their message is you've got to keep talking, you
can't close the process down.''
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj has met with senior members of the IRA before, and also
has worked with Mandelson, when he was South Africa's transport
minister and Mandelson was Britain's trade minister.
</P>
<P>
   In Maharaj, doubting IRAcommanders will find a man who once
shared their ambivalence about shutting down a paramilitary
organization and entrusting its interests to democratic politics.
Maharaj served time with Mandela in the Robben Island prison where
Mandela spent 30 years, and the two are extremely close.
</P>
<P>
   But even while Mandela and the ANC were in negotiations with
Wessels and the white National Party, Maharaj continued to mount
attacks against South African security forces. Maharaj eventually
came in from the cold, and became a member of Mandela's Cabinet. A
one-time Communist, Maharaj is now a bank director, personifying a
dramatically changed South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Wessels also personifies how much change is possible. Once
director of the apartheid regime's security system, he now sits on
the South African Human Rights Commission. Wessels was South
Africa's deputy foreign minister in 1991 when he stunned both
blacks and whites by becoming the first member of the white
minority government to apologize for apartheid. Mandela said
Wessels' apology convinced many in the ANC that the National Party
was serious about reform.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said Maharaj has considerable credibility with the IRA
and loyalist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Belfast-Johannesburg connection had borne fruit before.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in South Africa in 1997, Mandela urged Irish
republicans to call a cease-fire so they would be allowed to enter
negotiations, and telling unionists they had to talk to their
longtime enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who became Sinn Fein's
chief negotiator, said watching the ANC and National Party
officials at the 1997 conference pushed both sides in Northern
Ireland toward compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were bitter enemies. and here they were together,
sitting together, and from watching their body language it was
clear that many of them actually liked each other, even loved each
other,'' said McGuinness. ``The message for me was that if they can
do it, we can do it also.''

ASSERTING RIGHT TO BEAR LESABRES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATERSON, N.J. _ Motor vehicle agencies everywhere are the bread
lines of democracy _ maddening organizational beasts that demand
much and offer little. But in New Jersey, the lines have grown
longer, and the bread stale.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it's inevitable that New Jersey would become the
capital of a new civil liberties cause: automotive rights. One of
its leaders is named Butch and he believes that the government is
infringing on the people's right to bear Buicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pursuit of happiness,'' he says at his family's sprawling
auto parts store here. ``We're talking about automotive rights and
basic human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen DeZuzio, known as Butch in the surprisingly politicized
world of antique cars, takes an extreme view of the state's
floundering effort to tighten standards for auto emissions and
safety. The real aim, he says, is to rid the road of older cars
owned by those who can't afford to lease a new Audi every two years
_ in the process, threatening the curbside folk art of turning a
jalopy into the envy of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not big on conspiracy theories,'' he says. ``But believe
me, this is collusion, at least. If they can tell you what kind of
car you can own, what are they going to tell you next? Who you can
live with? Where you can live?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you think of DeZuzio's logic, the robust,
self-proclaimed ``Christian biker'' is hardly a loner honking in
the night. New Jerseyans are bellowing as loudly at the pain of
stricter auto testing as New Yorkers did at tougher reading
standards.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, here's a recap: A company with some
political connections won a $400 million contract (for which it was
the sole bidder) to bring state auto inspections into line with new
federal emission standards and to increase safety tests. Once
inspections began in December, drivers waited hours for the new,
sophisticated equipment to perform the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment shredded some tires. It broke down in cold
weather. More and more cars failed inspection. Memos surfaced
revealing that a consulting firm had warned the state of disaster
beforehand, but the administration didn't pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman came to resemble a white-gloved cop
directing traffic at a 20-car pileup on a foggy highway. Each wave
of her hand landed another car in the pile. Finally, she suspended
the new tests at some inspection stations. But this added fuel to
the auto rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   However unrealistic, the call to end the new tests is spreading
on the Internet, on talk radio, through faxes and at meetings with
private mechanics who bought expensive inspection equipment and
feel cheated. The campaign has shades of another decade's ``Dump
Florio'' cry against tax increases. Involved are people like John
Budzash, a former postal worker and a ringleader of the campaign
against Gov. Jim Florio, and Murray Sabrin, a Ramapo College
finance professor who ran against Whitman in 1997 as a Libertarian
and now is running for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In this most suburban of states, car policy is the rutted road
of politics. Every serf is king of the road. And, as the rebels see
it, the governor is messing with their chariots. She veered onto
this path before, nearly losing re-election three years ago partly
due to anger over auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a cliche, but most of us really do have a love
affair with the car,'' said DeZuzio, president of the Council of
Vehicle Associations/Classic Vehicle Advocate Group, who began
fixing cars as a kid and met his wife racing cars. ``It's a freedom
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger is muffling the governor's argument that she wants to
make cars safer and cleaner and to reduce inspections to every two
years, not annually. The cause of clean air may prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, surely New Jerseyans have loftier concerns than their
cars. One recent day, a man creeping through the line at the Newark
inspection station in his shiny Lincoln Town Car seemed to
illustrate the possibilities. He declared the system a disgrace,
but said he was taking the wait in stride, engrossed in a book he
had brought along. The title? ``Owner's Manual.''

BUSH TO STEP UP CAMPAIGN PACE, HIS AIDES SAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ When Texas Governor George W. Bush arrives
Monday in Dover, Del., it will be as a sharper, more aggressive
presidential candidate, aides promised.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase will follow a weekend of talks in Austin, Texas,
among Bush and his senior campaign advisers. But Ari Fleischer, a
Bush spokesman, said Saturday's discussions were not out of the
ordinary. There will be no major policy shifts and no change in
message, Fleischer said. And despite a low-level buzz about ``heads
rolling'' following Bush's dismal showing in New Hampshire,
Fleischer said no firings are in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person close to the campaign, Bush plans to step
up his campaign schedule and attack Arizona Senator John McCain,
his chief GOP rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're moving towards making it a real campaign instead of a
pillow fight,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began toughening his rhetoric Friday, accusing McCain of
``Washington double-talk'' for attacking special interests while
currying support and raising money from lobbyists. The Bush
campaign also launched a advertising blitz in South Carolina that
accuses McCain of misrepresenting Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Saturday that more attack ads have been filmed or
are being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist who is sympathetic to Bush said he
expects to see a more energetic candidate with a more rigorous
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bush frequently found time to work out at
health clubs, and his days were marked by long stretches of down
time. Just before the primary, Bush skipped a planned trip to
Exeter, citing the presence of protesters there. And on election
day, he visited four polling places, then cut the campaigning short
to watch a movie at his hotel with his wife and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to toughen up,'' said the strategist, who has donated
to Bush's campaign and plans to vote for him. ``He's a strong
candidate. We've got to let Bush be Bush, and let him get out there
and mix it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But ahead of Delaware's primary on Tuesday, Bush's schedule
Monday is not much heavier than it was in New Hampshire. He will
attend the Kent County GOP luncheon in Dover; talk to veterans at
the American Legion, also in Dover; and travel to Wilmington for a
question-and-answer session at an arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the McCain camp, there is nervousness about the coming
days and the Bush promise to increase the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have millions of dollars, they're desperate and they have
the entire Republican Party establishment and all of its allies at
their disposal,'' said Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster. ``The
Bush people will outspend by two or three or four to one. It's
going to get very ugly. It's a testimony to how desperate they are
that they feel it will be required to stop the momentum of what's
happening in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said, ``We're not going
to be attacking Senator McCain. We're going to be setting the
record straight on his attacks on us.''
</P>
<P>
   A new Time/CNN poll of likely Republican voters in South
Carolina showed that McCain has rallied from 20 points behind Bush,
to a statistical dead heat. McCain had 44 percent of the vote
compared with 40 percent for Bush, with a 4.5-percentage-point
margin of error. The state holds its primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a controversy in South Carolina threatened to
continue distracting the Bush campaign. Seven former Prisoners Of
War visited Bush's Columbia and Greenville headquarters, calling on
Bush to apologize for standing by silently while a supporter
assailed McCain's record on veterans' issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home and forgot us,'' said J. Thomas Burch, chairman
of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Committee, who
introduced Bush at a rally last week.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign described Burch as ``a Washington,
D.C.-based special interest lawyer and longtime McCain hater.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel George ``Bud'' Day, who served in World War II, Korea
and Vietnam, said Saturday that Bush should be held responsible for
Burch's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just bad judgment and it reflects the fact he doesn't
know the veteran scene at all or he wouldn't put this guy up to be
speaking for him,'' said Day, who shared a prison cell with McCain,
nursing him back to health after he was shot down over Hanoi and
beaten by the North Vietnamese.

ANNA CLARK, ADVISER TO LA GUARDIA, DIES AT 95
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Mass., Pa., N.C.)   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anna Holbrook Clark, who transcended a secretarial job to become
an influential policy adviser to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and
worked at five levels of government, died Jan. 28 in a Manhattan
nursing home. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   The era in which Clark served the dynamic mayor known as ``the
Little Flower'' seems almost impossibly quaint: He had no telephone
on his desk and wandered into her cubbyhole to take calls. But it
was the Depression era, and as the country moved toward World War
II she was at the center of events during a turbulent period at
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that anyone who stops to consider it can deny
that we are in the midst of a social revolution,'' Clark said in a
paper on economic strategies written for La Guardia in 1940. She
saw the mayor's office as ``one of the nerve centers of the
world,'' according to an oral history she prepared in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of life _ eventually as secretary of the Board of
Estimate, the panel of top elected officials that then ran city
government _ was blistering: La Guardia resented staff members'
taking lunch, barely tolerated their vacations and routinely
punished unproductive commissioners by making them wait five or six
hours for appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was one of dozens of women promoted by La Guardia to
positions of influence as part of his reformist philosophy. She
eventually held jobs at the city, county, state, federal and
international levels. Her approach to her often-chaotic working
environment was steady, soft-spoken and utterly attentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You told her something once,'' said Susan Alt, former
president of the Women's Civic Club, a policy analysis and advocacy
organization of which Clark was a member throughout her adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Clark possessed a steely determination learned from her
grandmother Kate, a suffragist and prohibitionist who frequently
campaigned on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Women won the right to vote when Clark was 16. Her mother took
her along to the polling place even though she was too young to
vote. Smiling broadly, the mother told officials that her daughter
was 21 _ a bit of calculated revenge for centuries of female
disenfranchisement.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Clark was born in the Manhattan neighborhood of Washington
Heights in 1904. She was the oldest of five children. One sister
contracted polio and another died of influenza in 1918, leaving a
long shadow over the family, said a niece, Cheryl Chalmers.
</P>
<P>
   But spirited discussions of public affairs obscured the sadness.
Talk often revolved around corruption cases that her father, John
Kirkland Clark, investigated as a lawyer in the Manhattan district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Clark attended the Barnard School for Girls, but she later
regretted that the school taught her little science. She graduated
from Smith College, majoring in government. Her first job was with
a magazine published for social workers.
</P>
<P>
   She then received a one-year fellowship to Bryn Mawr College to
study bias in the news. Her next job was as a writer for The
American City, a technical journal for city government managers.
She was laid off during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying to my family that I thought if I were a man
I might try for a job in city government,'' she said in her oral
history. Her father suggested speaking to his secretary, who just
happened to be La Guardia's sister. ``I'm not averse to using
contacts,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an interview with the mayor at his temporary
offices in the Empire State Building during a renovation of City
Hall. In the middle of the session, an aide scurried in and
whispered in the mayor's ear. The mayor jumped up. ``I have to go
to a fire,'' he said. ``Come back on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   She was not sure she wanted the job, which involved reorganizing
extensive files, supervising three secretaries and much more. But
when it was offered, at a salary of $2,600 a year, she grabbed it.
Eight months later she received a raise of $280 a year, according
to a one-paragraph report in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   She was meeting people like Robert Moses, the man behind the
city and state's highways, bridges and parks. Introducing her, La
Guardia said, ``She's a career woman.'' Moses looked at her and
asked how long that would last.
</P>
<P>
   She never married, perhaps because her social life was
circumscribed by the mountains of work she habitually brought home.
She was tall and slender, and had ``a sweet manner of speaking,''
said Edith Spivack, 89, a lawyer who worked in the La Guardia
administration. Her voice was authoritative, and she squinted a bit
when making an important point, said Richard Lieberman, director of
the La Guardia and Wagner Archives.
</P>
<P>
   Spivack said: ``She was neat and tidy. She was all the things a
lady should be.''
</P>
<P>
   As the war deepened, the Board of Estimate did less and less. So
Clark went to Washington to work in the Pentagon, the State
Department and the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After the war she used a recommendation from Moses to get a job
working on transportation issues in Nassau County. She then worked
for the United Nations, raising money for UNICEF and helping
refugees in Bremen, Germany. For years Clark continued to fight for
civic improvements, as a member of her Upper East Side community
board and in other forums. She led the successful fight to expand
bus service on First Avenue to better serve the hospitals there.
She lobbied to build four tracks rather than the planned two on the
Second Avenue subway should that ill-starred line ever be built.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister, Margaret Vander Veer of Charlotte,
N.C.  &QL;

FINDING A ROOMMATE USING A BUS-STOP NOTE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They're all over Manhattan, taped to bus shelters,
tacked to bulletin boards in Laundromats, their multiple telephone
numbers hanging from the bottom like so many paper legs, trying to
make matches in a city of millions. ``Wanted: Nanny for adorable
child'' or ``Nonsmoking neat male needed'' or ``Moving sale:
Everything must go.''
</P>
<P>
   Maya Perkins, who moved to New York nearly three years ago after
she graduated from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.,
was paying more attention than usual to the signs because the
apartment she was sharing in Washington Heights was being reclaimed
by its owner.
</P>
<P>
   One day last July, after fruitlessly answering newspaper ads,
she noticed a piece of paper at a bus stop near Columbia University
offering a room in a two-bedroom apartment on Broadway near 125th
Street for $550 a month. She took down the number. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   She called the woman, and they had a good conversation, an
instant rapport. A day later, when she rang the bell, she was
buzzed right in. Climbing the stairs to the sixth-floor walkup,
anticipating their meeting, she was hopeful. The woman, a
26-year-old music student and temp worker, had even included the
dimensions of the room, a bit of honesty in advertising that
appealed to her.
</P>
<P>
   She got to the top of the stairs and rang the bell. ``I said,
`I'm here to see the apartment,''' she remembered. A furious voice
on the other side told her to go away. A crazed, hysterical voice.
``She just totally flipped out and said, `I'm going to call the
police,''' Perkins said. Completely bewildered, she went back down
the six flights of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom, she told her story to a woman who was entering
the building, who in turn asked whether she was sure she had the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't. And so she went to the building next door, rang the
bell and repeated the process. This time, at the top, she was
greeted by Melissa Bennett, as cheerful and warm as she would have
expected from their phone call. ``I was just so happy she let me
in,'' Perkins said. In a strange way, it made their introduction
even easier.
</P>
<P>
   The two women have been sharing the apartment ever since, in
that loose big-city way that agrees to no commitments and no rules.
If Perkins, 25, wants to leave, she need only give a month's notice
to Bennett, 26, whose name is on the lease and who has lived in the
apartment for five years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic railroad flat, sunny and clean, with the rooms
laid out in a line, linoleum flooring and a kitchen large enough to
hold a table and two chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both women seem grateful to have found a roommate who doesn't
seem really strange. Perkins decided to move in even though she is
allergic to cats, and Bennett has Rajah, a sleek and sinewy
creature. ``It's hard to find a place without a cat,'' Perkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both have used telephone conversations to get a sense of
prospects. Bennett said she screened several dozen people on the
phone before she found Perkins. ``With some, it's right away
bye-bye,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others reveal themselves more gradually. ``One guy said, `I'm
going to need to take over part of the living room.' Another guy
wanted to bring his bike and build something for it in the
bedroom.'' With Perkins, she said, ``We totally clicked right away.
We had a great conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, being the original tenant, has the larger bedroom, with
swirls of blue sponge painting and an empty fish tank. ``I had a
Jack Dempsey, but it ate all the others, and then he got a
fungus,'' she explained. Perkins has the small bedroom at the
front, where she has hung the head and arm pieces from the Wonder
Woman costume she wore in last fall's Greenwich Village Halloween
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Both women work downtown, but western Harlem is where they want
to live. Perkins, who has friends living near Columbia, works at
the Center for Urban Justice, a 15-year-old nonprofit group based
in NoHo that helps homeless people, or nearly homeless people, cope
with welfare problems. The center's workers introduce themselves to
people at soup kitchens and food pantries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks we're lawyers,'' she said. ``They call me
`lady lawyer.''' And in fact, she recently took the law school
admission test. She may become a lawyer, she said, or a teacher.
Whatever she does, she said, she has one clear goal: ``I feel like
my life's work is to stop people from going to prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett originally moved to the neighborhood to study oboe at
the Manhattan School of Music. Now, though, she is working as an
administrative assistant in a financial-services firm, getting
ready to apply to graduate school in social work at Columbia. The
life of a musician is too financially precarious, she said, and the
instability was ruining her joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was making me hate my art,'' she said. She decided on
graduate school, she said, ``to preserve the fire'' that music
gives her.

$1 BILLION IN PROJECTS FOR JOHNS HOPKINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES BELFOURE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Johns Hopkins is known for its medical center and
university, but its impact on its hometown is more concrete.
Together the Johns Hopkins University and its medical center, with
the help of their own development company, are the biggest builders
in Baltimore. Over the next five years they plan to complete or
begin work on $1 billion worth of buildings to expand and update
their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   This would have pleased the founder, Johns Hopkins, a merchant
remembered for his dedication to the economic prosperity of his
city. In the fall of 1873 he single-handedly averted a major
financial crisis in Baltimore like those that were sweeping New
York and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   By using his own money and his reputation, Hopkins guaranteed
the stability of investments held by local businesses. When he died
a few months later he left $7 million, a huge sum in its day, to
create a university and a hospital to serve the people of
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the university and the Johns Hopkins Health
System cannot be overstated. In addition to being Maryland's
largest private employers, with 37,900 jobs, together they spent a
total of $176 million for construction last year, the most of any
business or institution in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Both entities will replace outdated academic and medical
facilities and build new space for research, creating an estimated
4,500 construction-related jobs by the year 2004. Most of the
planned construction is expected to be completed in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopkins is considered a top customer of the Baltimore
Development Corp. for economic development in the city,'' said Jay
Brodie, president of the quasi-governmental entity that promotes
development.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel that Baltimore, a city that has lost a third of its
population since 1970, would be in far worst straits if it didn't
have Hopkins as an employer and builder.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins has its own full-service real estate development
subsidiary called Dome Corp. The name is inspired by the famous
dome of the original Johns Hopkins Hospital completed in 1889 that
still stands on its East Baltimore medical center.
</P>
<P>
   Dome Real Estate, a division of the corporation, develops and
builds for Hopkins, but mainly for tenants of its research
facilities _ private biomedical companies and federally financed
laboratories. ``We offer a complete range of development
expertise,'' said Lester Conley, president of Dome Real Estate,
``including programming, land planning, financing, construction,
and property management.'' Development has been concentrated mainly
within Baltimore City.
</P>
<P>
   A for-profit entity, Dome was created in 1984 when Hopkins
bought the Baltimore City Hospital, a money-losing municipal health
center. Its first job was to create a master plan for the 130-acre
parcel, renamed Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus, which included new
research facilities for private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many private companies want to be identified with
Hopkins because of its reputation, they turn to Dome for its
expertise in helping to develop their own facilities ``while
offering institutional sensitivity to their research needs,''
according to Conley.
</P>
<P>
   Dome's biggest client at Bayview is the Institutes on Aging and
Drug Abuse Addiction, part of the National Institutes of Health.
The agency has a total of 276,000 square feet of laboratory and
research space at Bayview.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Dome built the 100,000-square-foot Triad Technology
Center at Bayview, which provides space for biomedical firms,
government and academic laboratories. A year later, Dome completed
the 25,000-square-foot Alpha Center, a biomedical incubator
building that offers inexpensive lab space for startup biotech
firms.
</P>
<P>
   When tenants such as the National Institutes of Health need to
expand or renovate their facilities, they usually come to Dome for
design and construction services. On most of the projects it
develops, Dome stays on as property manager.
</P>
<P>
   Dome builds directly for Hopkins at Bayview as well. It
constructed the Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy Center in 1989 and
its Behavioral Biology Research Center in 1991. Dome is currently
revising the master plan to increase the total campus development
from 3.5 million to 5 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Dome's largest project is the $17 million renovation
of the former Eastern High School in north central Baltimore. Built
in 1936, the 200,000-square-foot Collegiate Gothic building will be
used primarily for university administrative and academic
functions, but will have space for tenants. ``We'll be trying to
attract businesses that relate to high technology and sciences, but
not necessarily medical,'' explained Conley.
</P>
<P>
   The school is on a 26-acre site on East 33rd Street, a major
thoroughfare that connects with Homewood, the university's main
campus less than a half mile away. It is hoped that the project
will stimulate new development along this linkage. The size of the
parcel also lends itself to future development of more buildings,
Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all buildings for Hopkins are done by Dome. The facilities
for the hospital, the university and the medical school, which is a
part of the university, are done by the entities themselves using a
traditional method of hiring an architect and putting the project
out to bid.
</P>
<P>
   The two newest buildings on the East Baltimore medical campus
are prime examples of how this is done. The $125 million,
540,000-square-foot Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Building will house
cancer patients as well as facilities for their surgery and
treatment, explained Sally MacConnell, vice president of facilities
for the Johns Hopkins Health System.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got extensive input from nurses, doctors, and families of
patients to see how we could design it to be supportive and not
look institutional,'' she added. The Weinberg Building is built
next to the original hospital and was designed to harmonize with
the building's Queen Anne style.
</P>
<P>
   The $59 million Bunting-Blaustein Research Building, completed
last December, houses all cancer research, which had been scattered
in five buildings. It emphasizes bench-to-bedside research,
bringing the latest treatment protocols from the laboratory to the
patients as quickly as possible, said MacConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Projects totaling more than $400 million on the East Baltimore
medical campus in the next five years will include the 292-bed
Women's and Children's Hospital; the 196-bed Critical Care Tower,
which has its own heliport; the 300,000-square-foot Broadway
Research Building and the 1,500-car Caroline Garage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are currently under way to acquire an eight-acre
parcel adjacent to the medical campus to construct a parking garage
that may include a hotel with retail space and more medical
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The university is expanding its presence in downtown Baltimore
by renovating a 38,000-square-foot building leased from Peter
Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles. It will become the School
of Professional Studies, whose main offerings will be graduate
degrees in business and education. Most of the $6.1 million cost of
renovating the building, which is expected to be completed in
December, is being borne by Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Hopkins looked beyond Baltimore to suburban Washington
to create a new campus. The university broke ground this past fall
for its second building on the 38-acre site in Rockville, Md., in
Montgomery County. The 50,000-square-foot building will add needed
space for its part-time graduate programs. With course registration
projected to increase 30 percent in each of the next five years,
three more buildings are being planned.
</P>
<P>
   Homewood, the university's main campus, will continue to grow
with $173 million of construction including a new student arts
center, a dorm, a recreation center, and a renovation of its
original building, Gilman Hall. A new master plan to be completed
this spring will probably identify the need for more improvements,
said James McGill, senior vice president for administration.

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON INTERVIEW
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from Hillary Rodham Clinton's interview
on Thursday with The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   THE REASONS TO RUN
</P>
<P>
   Why the Senate? And why here? I'm running for the Senate because
of the issues that I think are most important to the future of New
York and America. And they happen to be concerns of mine that go
back more than 30 years. And I find that those concerns are the
concerns of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that I believe that it matters who is in the
Senate for New York. We do not need to go back to policies that
undermined the prosperity and the future of New Yorkers. We need to
build on what's been accomplished, and go further.
</P>
<P>
   So I will be speaking throughout this campaign about experiences
that I've had before I moved to New York, and experiences I've had
since I've been out listening to New Yorkers. And whether it's
improving the upstate economy, or improving education, or improving
health care, or dealing with the challenges that families face, I
believe that my experience is experience that will benefit issues
that New Yorkers care about. ...
</P>
<P>
   We have too many families, and too many children in New York
that are not doing as well as we need them to do and that they need
to do themselves. Whether it is lack of economic activity for their
parents, or crumbling and inadequate schools with poorly prepared
teachers, or inaccessible, unaffordable child care, or health care,
or too many guns and too much media violence.
</P>
<P>
   We now have an opportunity in our society to look at these
fundamental issues because our economy is doing so well. ...
</P>
<P>
   When the presidential campaign started, and I traveled all
through New York for the New York primary, there was such a sense
of, well, disappointment about what was happening in the economy.
That it just didn't seem to be working for everybody. ...
</P>
<P>
   We know a lot more about how to make sure that this economy
stays on track. And that will be one of my primary objectives, is
to keep to the fiscal discipline, the balanced budget approach,
using these surpluses to deal with our continuing structural and
entitlement challenges. ...
</P>
<P>
   There are not government solutions for most of these issues. But
there are ways you can have public-private partnerships. Ways in
which government can encourage families to be responsible. Ways in
which government can help to create conditions for schools to be
better. So there's a lot that we can do. And I think that's the
unfinished business that we need to turn our attention to. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now when I think about the upcoming race, I think that New York
will have a choice between two very different visions of the world,
and how we solve problems together. The role of the federal
government. The use of the budget surplus. There will be a very
strong contrast. And I look forward to making that contrast. ...
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   I agree with those who believe that we should take this moment
in time to deal with the problems of Social Security, Medicare and
paying down the national debt. Therefore I would not support the
kind of very large tax cuts that the Republicans are endorsing, and
will make the case to the people of New York that that is not in
our short-term or long-term interest.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that we know a lot about what it takes to fix public
education. So I do not support draining away public resources for
vouchers. I've been involved in reforming public education for 17
years. I was probably one of the very first people in public life
who called for high standards and called for teacher testing, but
also called for additional resources, where appropriate. So I have
a long experience in seeing what works in public education and
knowing that with the kind of positive leadership that I've seen at
work in other cities and states, there's a lot we can do to turn
around failing schools. And hold schools and teachers and students
to high standards. And I don't think vouchers is the way to get
things done. So on a number of issues, we're going to have some
very different visions and ideas of what will work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ON REPRESENTING NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the Republicans need any more votes to block
campaign finance reform, or turn back the clock on our budget and
deficit policies, or to side with the majority of Republican
leadership on issues ranging from school vouchers to whether or not
we deal with health care in a step-by-step way to try to eventually
reach a goal of providing quality affordable health care for
everybody. And certainly as I have watched both Sens. Schumer and
Moynihan lead the fight on behalf of New York's needs, we've seen
that two strong Democratic members _ especially if we take back the
Senate, which I think is possible _ would be in the best interest
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ON GIULIANI  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do think the mayor and I have some issues in common. But you
wouldn't know it from his mailings. I am very curious about whether
he's giving full disclosure to all of these people he's sending
letters to, calling me all these names, as to where he stands on
some of the issues that he and I share. What he doesn't tell the
readers of his letters is I supported welfare reforms. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   I support the balanced budget and the continuation of those
fiscal policies. He has supported very large tax cuts that would
undermine the capacity to continue the paying down of the debt and
dealing with Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   I support a real patients' bill of rights. He's gone along with
Republicans. I support the death penalty. I support a lot of the
positions that I think the majority of New Yorkers support.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm always amused when I read these accounts of his mailings
trying to get people all agitated about the possibility of my
running. There ought to be a big-print disclosure on the bottom
that he agrees with many of the positions that I've advocated. And
where he disagrees, I think he should be very clear.
</P>
<P>
   INTRODUCING HERSELF
</P>
<P>
   I'm certainly well known, for better or worse. People know my
name and my face and my many changing hairdos. What I have found is
that people don't know anything, really, about the work that I did
before Bill was elected president. And know very little _ except
about health care _ about the work that I've done in the White
House. It became so apparent to me that in order to introduce
myself to the voters of New York, I was going to have to go back
and really share a lot of my lifestyle. Which is what I intend to
do, starting on Sunday, with the brochure and with my campaign. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think it is perfectly understandable that New Yorkers would
say to themselves, ``Prove it: show me why I should vote for you.''
And I can only say, I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm not
new to the concerns of New Yorkers. And in the small groups I've
been meeting with _ primarily of women _ a lot of women come very
skeptical, because they have an idea in their mind of what I am
going to be like.
</P>
<P>
   They think I must kind of be carried around in some kind of a
chariot, with liveried servants, or something _ so when they meet
me, and we start talking about what life is like, and what my
experiences have been like, we have an immediate bond. Because I've
been there. I mean, I've been the harried, pressured working mom.
I've been the concerned, anguished parent about everything from
ballet recitals to school curriculum. I've lived through the death
of one of my parents and my mother-in-law. I have all the
experiences that women today face. The more we are able to talk
about that and to share those experiences, the more common ground I
find we have.
</P>
<P>
   I went grocery shopping for the first time in years the other
day. And I felt like I was sort of back home. Because before the
White House, even though we lived in the Governor's Mansion, I
drove my own car most of the time. I picked my daughter up. I would
take her to run errands. I would go to visit my friends. I would go
shopping. I would cook on weekends. I did all of that.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE CAMPAIGN  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I meant what I said when I started on Sen. Moynihan's farm: I
was going to go listen and at some point make up my mind about
whether thought this would be the right thing for me and the right
thing for New York. So I did not have a full-fledged campaign. ...
</P>
<P>
   And I really worked hard from July into the fall, to test
myself, to ask myself, am I doing this for the right reasons? Do I
really want to make the commitment to this campaign? Am I willing
to go through the fire that I know is waiting for me? Do I think I
could make a difference in the Senate? Do I get up every day and
know I'm going to make some mistakes and keep going, because I know
that's part of learning about how to do it and not get deterred
about what may come my way.
</P>
<P>
   I had to go through that whole process. I've never done this
before. I knew it would be rough, but I didn't know how I would
respond to it. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think a professional political observer is going to watch me
evolve as a candidate. I think that's fair. I hope I'm better now
than I was in July or August, and I hope that I'll be better still
in May or June. I know I have the qualities and the commitment and
the temperament and the experience to be a good senator.

BUSH TO STEP UP CAMPAIGN PACE, HIS AIDES SAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ When Texas Governor George W. Bush arrives
Monday in Dover, Del., it will be as a sharper, more aggressive
presidential candidate, aides promised.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase will follow a weekend of talks in Austin, Texas,
among Bush and his senior campaign advisers. But Ari Fleischer, a
Bush spokesman, said Saturday's discussions were not out of the
ordinary. There will be no major policy shifts and no change in
message, Fleischer said. And despite a low-level buzz about ``heads
rolling'' following Bush's dismal showing in New Hampshire,
Fleischer said no firings are in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person close to the campaign, Bush plans to step
up his campaign schedule and attack Arizona Senator John McCain,
his chief GOP rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're moving towards making it a real campaign instead of a
pillow fight,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began toughening his rhetoric Friday, accusing McCain of
``Washington double-talk'' for attacking special interests while
currying support and raising money from lobbyists. The Bush
campaign also launched a advertising blitz in South Carolina that
accuses McCain of misrepresenting Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Saturday that more attack ads have been filmed or
are being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist who is sympathetic to Bush said he
expects to see a more energetic candidate with a more rigorous
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bush frequently found time to work out at
health clubs, and his days were marked by long stretches of down
time. Just before the primary, Bush skipped a planned trip to
Exeter, citing the presence of protesters there. And on election
day, he visited four polling places, then cut the campaigning short
to watch a movie at his hotel with his wife and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to toughen up,'' said the strategist, who has donated
to Bush's campaign and plans to vote for him. ``He's a strong
candidate. We've got to let Bush be Bush, and let him get out there
and mix it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But ahead of Delaware's primary on Tuesday, Bush's schedule
Monday is not much heavier than it was in New Hampshire. He will
attend the Kent County GOP luncheon in Dover; talk to veterans at
the American Legion, also in Dover; and travel to Wilmington for a
question-and-answer session at an arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the McCain camp, there is nervousness about the coming
days and the Bush promise to increase the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have millions of dollars, they're desperate and they have
the entire Republican Party establishment and all of its allies at
their disposal,'' said Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster. ``The
Bush people will outspend by two or three or four to one. It's
going to get very ugly. It's a testimony to how desperate they are
that they feel it will be required to stop the momentum of what's
happening in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said, ``We're not going
to be attacking Senator McCain. We're going to be setting the
record straight on his attacks on us.''
</P>
<P>
   A new Time/CNN poll of likely Republican voters in South
Carolina showed that McCain has rallied from 20 points behind Bush,
to a statistical dead heat. McCain had 44 percent of the vote
compared with 40 percent for Bush, with a 4.5-percentage-point
margin of error. The state holds its primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a controversy in South Carolina threatened to
continue distracting the Bush campaign. Seven former Prisoners Of
War visited Bush's Columbia and Greenville headquarters, calling on
Bush to apologize for standing by silently while a supporter
assailed McCain's record on veterans' issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home and forgot us,'' said J. Thomas Burch, chairman
of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Committee, who
introduced Bush at a rally last week.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign described Burch as ``a Washington,
D.C.-based special interest lawyer and longtime McCain hater.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel George ``Bud'' Day, who served in World War II, Korea
and Vietnam, said Saturday that Bush should be held responsible for
Burch's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just bad judgment and it reflects the fact he doesn't
know the veteran scene at all or he wouldn't put this guy up to be
speaking for him,'' said Day, who shared a prison cell with McCain,
nursing him back to health after he was shot down over Hanoi and
beaten by the North Vietnamese.

MCCAIN RAPS FOE ON ``NEGATIVE ADS AND PERSONAL ATTACKS''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ Emboldened by his successes in New
Hampshire and beyond last week, and facing a barrage of criticism
from the campaign of George W. Bush, John McCain Saturday displayed
his most combative attitude yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to my friend Governor Bush that we do not need petty,
negative ads and personal attacks,'' said McCain, referring to his
opponent, who was not present at this weekend's California GOP
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the tactics of Clinton and Gore, candidates that we
should defeat and not imitate,'' McCain told an audience of several
hundred at the convention. ``A campaign for the great office of the
presidency should be about far bigger things, and if you can't
compete in the arena of ideas and leadership, you're not ready for
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   These comments were as direct a criticism of Bush as McCain has
offered. Until now, McCain has alluded to Bush's preparedness for
the presidency only obliquely, saying, for example, that ``some
people say Bush is not ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's lopsided victory Tuesday in New Hampshire, the
Texas governor launched an advertisement in South Carolina accusing
McCain of knowingly misrepresenting his position on Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   McCain frequently says Bush would set aside ``not one penny''
for Social Security under his tax plan. Bush says he fully intends
to devote the Social Security surplus to the future of the
retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has also released a statement citing a comment
by a McCain supporter and adviser, former US representative Vin
Weber of Minnesota, saying he would support Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign has stooped to a new low by twisting my
words to mislead voters,'' Weber said Saturday. ``Desperate
campaigns take desperate measures, and this one is as sad as it is
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Bush camp has incensed the McCain campaign, and
Weber, who said that his comments were taken out of context, said
he continues to support McCain's plan, which he helped formulate.
McCain's plan sets aside more of the surplus to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   In an indirect concession to Bush Saturday, McCain amended his
usual ``not one penny'' to ``not one new penny.'' But he ceded no
further ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``On reading this morning's newspapers, I am saddened that in an
act of desperation Governor Bush is running negative and misleading
ads in South Carolina,'' McCain said in his speech. ``Two days ago,
he charged that I don't care about our nation's veterans,''
referring to comments made by a Bush supporter at a rally on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the convention was loaded with Bush supporters, the
lunch audience, having paid $25 each to hear him speak, was wildly
enthusiastic for the Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done often in the last week, McCain repeatedly cited
President Ronald Reagan as his model, casting his push for campaign
finance as an extension of Reagan's 1976 pledge to do away with
``the Washington buddy system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent him to Washington to do battle with those forces who
stand between the American people and the American dream,'' McCain
said of Reagan. ``It's time to recover our heritage of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush, who has garnered enormous support from
politicians and party organizers in California, spent the day with
family and advisers in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In his place, he sent his brother Jeb Bush, the governor of
Florida, who sang the candidate's praises Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was something of a reversal for Bush, at the end of a week
stacked with them. On Tuesday, McCain defeated Bush soundly in New
Hampshire. Two days later, he topped him in a poll in South
Carolina, after the Arizona senator had trailed Bush by 20 points.
On Thursday, Bush and Governor George E. Pataki of New York dropped
their effort to exclude McCain from the New York primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to see Governor Bush can't be here today,'' McCain
told his audience. ``I understand he's back in Austin, finishing up
his new book, `A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to My Coronation.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters at the convention said they did not feel that
the governor's absence was a problem. Bush was busy, they said, and
they were confident they would see a lot more of him before the
March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is in Texas taking care of state business,''
said his spokesman, Scott McClellan. ``He is recharging, and
charging on to Delaware and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has campaigned 11 days in California, including
announcing a major education reform initiative before Latino
business leaders in Los Angeles on September 2d.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said McCain sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big mistake for Bush not to be here,'' said Susan
Dockter of Folsom, who was wearing an ``I miss President Reagan''
button. ``This is his party's convention, a big rally they're
having here before the primary in four weeks. The people who are
here are the people who are working really hard on the campaigns.
Maybe he thinks they don't need to hear from him personally.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent two weeks in California in the summer and will
spend a few more days there leading up to the primary. Aides say
his success in California will depend on expensive air time, and on
momentum coming out of New Hampshire and, they hope, South
Carolina, after its Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Whether most Republicans in California will warm to him when
Bush has much institutional support in the huge state, and after
McCain's provocative comments about the GOP establishment, is an
open question.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides say a win in South Carolina would seal his success
in the Golden State. After that, they say, McCain's electability
will be affirmed, and the party faithful will set aside all other
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five days, McCain and his aides have been
relentlessly pushing the senator's potential for a November
victory. If McCain can convince enough Republicans of that, goes
their argument, he can win, especially in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is desperate to win,'' said Ken Khachigian, a
veteran GOP strategist. Bush's many endorsements ``grew out of this
burning, yearning desire to win. There's the stench of defeat all
through California.''

 &HT;    Garth fans flock to Mets spring-training site for tickets
 &HT;    By Teresa Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ He's pudgy, balding and went 1-for-22 at
bat last spring, but make no mistake _ country music icon Garth
Brooks is drawing fans to spring baseball faster than
schoolchildren to a Pokemon critter.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who confirmed last week he'll work out with the New York
Mets during spring training in Port St. Lucie this year, is
expected to arrive with the other players on Feb. 20 and will go
everywhere the team goes. Fans hoping to get a close-up gander or
autograph should be in luck, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz says, since
Brooks was known for his devotion to fans during his first
major-league foray in Arizona last spring.
</P>
<P>
   At the Peoria, Ariz., spring-training stadium of the San Diego
Padres, observers say, the top-selling male vocalist of all time
(97 million albums sold) was often the first to enter and the last
to leave the stadium each day _ sometimes staying until 9 or 10
p.m. to sign autographs long after other players had departed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mets officials don't have an up-to-date count of ticket
sales this spring, one thing's for certain _ the Garth factor, as
one agent called it, is drawing 'em in like cowboys to a
10-gallon-hat giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's darling _ what a cutie,'' swooned Susan Bowne as she
waited in line to buy tickets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kinda swayed me to country music. I caught his concert in
Central Park on HBO and I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   A baseball player for his high school team in Yukon, Okla.,
Brooks _ who turns 38 Monday _ ran track in college but longed for
the crack of the major-league bat when he trained as a nonroster
player with the Padres. The Padres got plenty of exposure and
Brooks' reward was twofold: To live out a baseball fantasy and
raise money for his national children's charity, the Touch 'Em All
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mets third baseman Robin Ventura has been a major contributor to
the foundation and persuaded Brooks to consider training with the
Mets this spring, Horwitz said. In exchange for making a sizeable
contribution to the charity _ which Horwitz said will get exposure
in the New York market thanks to the Mets _ the team will bask in
the same limelight the Padres enjoyed last year. Fans couldn't be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter's a fan of Garth's, and she told her mother so her
mother told me, 'Get over there right away and buy tickets,'''
63-year-old Bill Jones of Port St. Lucie said Friday, less than 12
hours after the Garth news had been beamed into Amy Jones'
television set in Flemington, N.J. ``My daughter's going to make a
special trip down just to see Garth. She's followed him all over
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   According to county stadium manager Peter Keogh, Jones is not
alone. Since last Sunday, Mets phones and ticket booths _ which
typically have long lines only on the first day of sales _ were
jammed. Ticket agents said they haven't seen it so busy since the
stadium's debut in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phones have been tied up with calls from all over the
country, calls from people who are actually going to plan their
vacations around a ballgame,'' said Keogh, himself a devoted Brooks
fan. ``It's turned into quite a happening and we're very excited
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brooks was known to hold some impromptu concerts after
exhibition games in Arizona, Horwitz doesn't expect that to happen
in Port St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll just be playing ball like all the other players,''
Horwitz said. ``He takes ground balls and bus trips and he won't be
taking practice time away from any of the roster players. There's B
games and other ways of working him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and business leaders hope Brooks' presence will
inject life into a baseball stadium that could lose its
major-league team in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks arrived in Peoria in a rented Ford Explorer each morning
and had nary a bodyguard as he drove to and from the stadium, Keogh
said.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects Brooks will rent a home in the exclusive gated
community of The Reserve, where several Mets have winter homes and
is only a few minutes' drive from the Thomas J. White Stadium in
St. Lucie West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking for ways to make the Mets more fan-friendly
and here they are bringing in the most popular male singer in
history,'' Keogh said. ``That's a great gesture in my opinion.''

 &HT;    Olympic participation not certain
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wanted to assure
everybody Saturday that there has been no definite decision to send
players to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. But with
that, he confirmed that the biggest road blocks to the league's
participation have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   The owners want to go. The players want to go. The safe bet:
They're going.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, addressing the media before the skills competition
Saturday night at the Air Canada Centre, said, ``The Board of
Governors this morning authorized me to attempt to conclude
arrangements that might have us go to the Olympics. What it means
is I don't have to go to the board again. But, if you write the NHL
is going to the Olympics, you'd be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said there were ``unresolved issues,'' mostly involving
the International Ice Hockey Federation, the IOC and the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee. It's believed the IIHF wants the NHL to take
a longer midseason break than the league wants. There also are
issues involving ticket availability.
</P>
<P>
   But the major obstacles to the NHL's participation in the Games
generally involved agreements between the league and the players
union and the league and the television networks. On the latter,
Bettman said, ``As far as the NHL and NHLPA goes, all issues have
been resolved.'' NBC officials have said they will not give the
league guarantees regarding airtime.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL sent players to the Olympics for the first time in
Nagano two years ago, and most considered the experiment a
disaster. Neither the United States nor Canada medaled, and
undisclosed U.S. players trashed two dormitories in the athletes
village.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman touched on a few other subjects, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Obstruction penalties and goaltender interference: A
conference call was held with referees this week in which they were
asked to be ``more vigilant'' in calling infractions, Bettman said.
League vice president Colin Campbell said, ``Players have figured
out ways (to interfere) with goalies. We felt we needed to bring it
to coaches' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Financially struggling Canadian franchises: The league has
approved extending its financial assistance program, which is close
to $10 million for the six teams, based on need. But there has been
no movement since the Canadian government pulled an aid proposal
off the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different issues involving the six clubs,'' he said.
``With some it's (devalued) currency, with some it's taxation. Some
need greater fan support. We have to look team by team, market by
market, to see what needs to be done to alleviate the (financial)
burdens. But we're not ready to be specific.''
</P>
<P>
   WINNER TAKE ALL
</P>
<P>
   The winning team today will get $250,000 to divide among
themselves. The losing team ``gets a warm handshake,'' said league
spokesman Frank Brown. World team coach Scotty Bowman said, ``I
told the players before practice, `I don't speak Russian or Czech
or Finnish or Swedish.' But if we win the game, we'll get paid in
U.S. money. So we'll take that.''

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ Congo and the nine nations around it sit on
what may be the richest patch of this planet: There are diamonds,
oil, uranium, gold, plentiful water, fertile land and exquisite
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   It is now also one of the biggest battlefields in Africa's
history, the object of a conflict that has been dubbed ``Africa's
first world war.''
</P>
<P>
   Six outside states are fighting inside Congo alone, with at
least 35,000 soldiers, men and boys, battling for a bewildering
number of reasons. Some armies are allied with rebel groups to oust
President Laurent Kabila of Congo. Others are protecting him. Nine
rebel groups in Congo are fighting to overthrow governments in
neighboring countries. Nearly everyone carts off Congo's riches.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicts are a series of related wars, fueled by ethnic
conflict, by a scramble for power and riches among people with very
little of either, and by leaders with little notion of
responsibility for those people. Rooted in the Rwandan genocide of
1994, the fighting has smoldered inconclusively for 18 months;
during this time rebels and invading armies have expanded their
reach to half of Congo's vast expanse, but the war remains largely
a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kabila nor the rebels have strong support in the
population. The foreign armies on both sides have been reluctant to
commit their men to all-out battles that could explode into even
greater warfare, perhaps beyond Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, into this chaos, the United Nations is considering the
deployment of the oddly precise number of 5,537 troops to monitor a
cease-fire signed last summer, but violated with impunity by all
sides ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, seven African presidents met at the United
Nations for a special Security Council session, convened by Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative, in an attempt to make the
cease-fire stick. They did little beyond reasserting the goals of
the agreement, and continuing negotiations at a lower level hold
out only minimal hope.
</P>
<P>
   The worries are clear, the solutions elusive. Experts say Africa
has not been so consumed by conflict since colonial days. Tens of
thousands have died. Hundreds of thousands have been uprooted from
their homes. Elephants and gorillas are poached for food.
Economies, already as diseased and undernourished as their people,
are dying.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts argue that the force contemplated by the United
Nations is far too small, considering the sheer size and terrain of
Congo _ a decomposed nation of thick jungle, poor communications
and ghost tracks that once were roads. But for some of the nations
that would pay for this peacekeeping force _ the United States
first among them _ any number of soldiers is too many unless the
warring nations and factions in Congo show they are serious about
peace. The peacekeepers, they argue, would simply not be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Practically, the proposed deployment would likely mean
battalions of soldiers placed in three strategic spots around an
area roughly as big as western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally inadequate,'' said Jakkie Potgieter, senior
researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies in South Africa.
After all, this is a conflict of unprecedented scale in Africa. On
the eastern borders, two nations that had helped to install Kabila
only three years ago, Rwanda and Uganda, are now fighting just as
fiercely to overthrow him. They are allied with three Congolese
rebel groups, which have also skirmished with one another.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia saved Kabila
from almost certain defeat when the war started in August 1998, and
Kabila has also allied himself with tens of thousands of Hutu
militiamen responsible for the Rwandan genocide, as well as with
indigenous warriors known as the Mayi-Mayi, who believe that water
has magical qualities that protect them from bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The motives are as tangled as the conflicts. For those arrayed
against Kabila, the keystone is the devastating Hutu-Tutsi rivalry
that has kept Rwanda and Burundi in convulsions for years. The
Tutsi-led government of Rwanda is there to curb the Hutu militia;
Uganda joined in the fray to support Rwanda and to curb its own
rebels based in Congo. Burundi has also sent forces into Congo to
fight Hutu rebels of its own.
</P>
<P>
   From the south, Angola needs Kabila to fight its own UNITA
rebels, based in southern Congo. Namibia is there to help Angola.
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, has come to Kabila's support
out of personal ambition to be a force in the region, and because
his generals are growing rich exploiting Congolese resources of
timber, gold, diamonds and metals.
</P>
<P>
   The participation of these nations, in turn, has sent shock
waves further afield, in the form of fleeing refugees or
opportunistic rebellions, to Zambia, Burundi, Tanzania, Sudan. What
further confuses matters is the rivalry for regional authority
between Mugabe and Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni _ and, on
all sides, the lure of Congo's riches.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises the question: Is now a time for a return of
pessimism about Africa? Will its unending problems merely give rich
nations yet another excuse to write off Africa, already largely
forgotten without the Cold War to keep the continent strategically
relevant?
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, President Clinton traveled here proclaiming
a ``renaissance'' of vital new leaders, vibrant economies and great
hopes. And optimists say there is still plenty of good: South
Africa and many southern nations are thriving, and Nigeria, where
one in six Africans lives, returned to democracy last May after
nearly 16 years of military rule. In 1975, only three heads of
state were chosen through elections. Last year, 32 of 54 leaders
were elected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of the leaders singled out as models by Clinton are
at war. Fighting burns in an unbroken line from the south Atlantic
to the Red Sea: Angola, Namibia, Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi,
Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea (not to mention a military coup
in Ivory Coast, a West African nation that was once the model of
stability).
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, yes, it's a very depressing time right now,''
said Adotei Akwei, a Ghanaian who is the African advocacy director
for Amnesty International, which monitors human rights abuses
around the continent. ``The optimism we get comes from the progress
that doesn't attract too much attention,'' he said, like increasing
efforts by women and other civilian groups to bring peace and order
to the region.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   It is virtually impossible for outsiders to witness the fighting
around Central Africa, often because it takes place far inside
jungles so dense that U.N. logisticians have debated whether
peacekeepers should bother to carry binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   It is a war both modern and primitive, fought with helicopter
gunships and aerial bombings, but more often by bands of men armed
with rifles and machetes darting in and out of forest that has
become as inaccessible as when King Leopold II of Belgium first
commissioned Henry Stanley to explore it in 1878.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the toll; the estimate most often cited is 100,000
combatants, refugees and civilians killed since fighting in Congo
flared in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But it is easy enough to assemble a collage of the devastation.
Recently a newspaper in Kinshasa carried a front-page photograph of
a decapitated corpse from fighting in eastern Congo. Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented
scores of cases of civilians being killed by combatants, for food
or money, or because they were merely in the way.
</P>
<P>
   At the main hospital in Kinshasa, the largest in Congo, an
injured soldier, Sipriant Ndaki, 27, hobbled from his bed to the
street, to beg for food. He managed to come up with a quarter of a
corncob, which he clutched in his hand as he described how he was
shot in the left leg in a battle in Boende in December.
</P>
<P>
   He said his battalion of 300 men was attacked by Ugandan
soldiers. Many died, some drowning when they tried to flee in the
river. ``I am prepared to die so that the people can be saved,'' he
insisted. Still, he said he was lying in a bed with no sheets or
mattress and had not been treated properly. He lifted up his pant
leg showing open sores that still bled every day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fabulous potential wealth, Congo itself was nearly
bled dry by the time this latest war broke out in August 1998.
Three decades of pillage by Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator who was
propped up by the country's riches and the Cold War patronage of
the United States, had ravaged the land that Mobutu had renamed
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three years after Mobutu was overthrown by Kabila _
with widespread hopes among locals, Congo's neighbors and more
distant foreign powers _ life here remains surreally broken down.
</P>
<P>
   What state hospitals there are must survive on their own. Only a
handful of private airlines connect the vast expanse; phones are
scarce in Kinshasa and nonexistent in many parts of the country;
the roads are terrible.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Kinshasa _ the Congo's capital and
westernmost major city, which has grown to 6 million people from
only 400,000 at independence from Belgium in 1960 _ one in 10
children and mothers are malnourished. Rituals as basic as family
meals have broken down, as the prices of certain staples like yams
have tripled since November.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world shares much of the blame for the plight of
Congo and its neighbors: European colonists divided the continent
up into nations that rarely bore a relation to geographic or ethnic
boundaries. During the Cold War, the superpowers picked their
proxies, overlooking corruption and abuse of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at a minimum, the West is often accused of lacking the
imagination to find solutions in Africa. At worst, the United
States in particular is accused of keeping the Congo war going by
failing to strongly condemn its allies, Rwanda and Uganda, who
entered Congo in August 1998, hiding behind rebel forces that they
financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since President Kabila came to power, we have received no
assistance from the United States, while Rwanda and Uganda have
continued to receive aid,'' said Uba Thassinda, the Congo vice
president for international cooperation. ``How can the United
States keep helping those countries?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have privately urged Rwanda and Uganda
to pull out of Congo, but the leaders of the two countries rank
among Washington's closest allies in Africa. Other factors have
motivated the Clinton administration: Rwanda, because Clinton has
acknowledged that the United States did not do enough to stop the
genocide; Uganda, because it stands as one of the bulwarks against
Sudan, whose Islamic extremist government has harbored
anti-American terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the wars rage on. In Kinshasa, the government
has erected billboards in recent months seemingly preparing the
Congolese for a long war: ``Peace has a price. Be prepared for any
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue that the war in Congo is actually three wars:
</P>
<P>
   The first is the battle between Kabila and the Congolese rebels
fighting to overthrow him. The second war is an ethnic war in the
eastern provinces of Congo, primarily against ethnic Congolese
Tutsi. The third war _ really a series of conflicts _ involves all
the outside countries: Rwanda and Uganda on the side of the rebels;
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on the side of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Following, country by country, is a look at these wars:
</P>
<P>
   Congo
</P>
<P>
   After pursuing a somewhat quixotic rebellion against Mobutu for
decades from eastern Congo (then Zaire), Kabila came to power in
1997, largely through the patronage of Rwanda and Uganda, which
needed someone Congolese to head an anti-Mobutu movement.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, Kabila was joined in the Kinshasa government by
many advisers from Rwanda. Their presence angered the Congolese,
and Kabila cut his ties with the Rwandans. They started a new war,
now against Kabila, in August 1998. Rebels now occupy about half of
Congo, roughly the east and northeast. What that usually means is
that they nominally hold pivotal towns, airstrips and roads, but
remain highly unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila inherited an army of about 70,000 when he seized power.
He has been joined by several thousand soldiers from the southern
province of Katanga, and the government has begun a major
recruitment drive. Although Kabila's own army has improved in the
last year, his forces remain poorly trained, and poorly paid. Many
are simply boys.
</P>
<P>
   But in many areas nominally under Kabila's control, it is Angola
and Zimbabwe that are the real power.
</P>
<P>
   Although Western diplomats generally acknowledge that Rwanda and
Uganda have invaded Congo, almost no one has publicly supported the
Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
   First, Kabila himself came to power in what could be described
as Rwanda and Uganda's first invasion of Congo in 1997; after that
war, he allowed his Rwanda-Tutsi allies to seek out and sometimes
slaughter Hutu responsible for the Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Kabila's government, after promising reforms, openness
and elections, has turned into a repressive regime that has
tolerated little or no political opposition, jailed journalists and
failed to respect basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Kabila, in his struggle to survive, has made dubious
alliances, most notably with the genocidal Hutu, who were largely
responsible for the Rwandan genocide and who have taken refuge in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Kabila signed the Lusaka accord, calling for a
cease-fire and peace talks, but his commitment has been in doubt.
Still, he is under increasing pressure to negotiate. Of his allies,
Angola has reduced its participation in the war, and Zimbabwe's
efforts are proving increasingly costly for the government of
President Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Congo is occupied by three rebel groups. With
some exceptions, the rebels hold all areas of northern and eastern
Congo bordering the Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda,
Rwanda, Burundi and most of Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the peace accord last summer, fighting has been intense
in several areas _ in the northwest corner of Congo around Gemena
and south across the Congo River, southwest of Kisangani, and in
the North and South Kivu provinces in the far east of Congo.
Mbuji-Mayi, the major diamond mining town, is held by the
government but surrounded on the north and east by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Since late in 1999, the rebel groups have tried to work
together, with limited success. The major groups are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Movement for the Liberation of Congo, headed by
Jean-Pierre Bemba, a cell-phone entrepreneur and son of an
influential Congolese businessman. Bemba is backed by Uganda, whose
soldiers occupy all the territory he holds. The group is believed
to have fewer than 10,000 guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma, the main branch of a
rebel group that later split into two. Based in Goma, it is headed
by a medical doctor, Emile Ilunga. This group has a fighting force
estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 men, headed by many disaffected
Congolese officers, many of them Congolese Tutsi. It is backed by
Rwanda, which has many thousands of troops in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement, headed
by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, a university professor once jailed by
Mobutu who was kicked out as president of the main movement last
summer. Its soldiers number fewer than 3,500. Ugandan troops occupy
most of the territory the movement vaguely claims.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of groups sometimes termed ``nonstate actors''
further complicates the situation in Congo. These are mostly
aligned with Kabila. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hutu militias, who carried out much of the killing in Rwanda
in 1994, and then escaped to Congo. Rwanda and Uganda claim that
Kabila and Zimbabwe have trained thousands of them, some in
Zimbabwe itself. They are said to be at the front around the
Mbuji-Mayi diamond mines in the thousands. They are also active in
the Kivus, crossing occasionally into Rwanda. Many of the Hutu
militias have also crossed into Burundi, linking up with other Hutu
rebels fighting against the Tutsi-led government there. Rwanda has
said it will not leave the Congo until it is convinced the Hutu
militias are under control.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Hutu militiamen vary widely; Rwanda
has cited figures between 5,000 and 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mayi-Mayi warriors: These are groups of indigenous
fighters with shifting loyalties in the eastern Congo, North and
South Kivu. Most of them work for Kabila and alongside the Hutu.
The Mayi-Mayi believe that water protects them from bullets, so
some of them go into battle wearing things like rubber tub
stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that eastern Congo has become ungovernable,
and that the Mayi-Mayi have emerged as the warlords of a
disintegrated land. Their numbers are unknown.

Calumet Farm has fallen from its lofty perch in horse racing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing is not only the Sport of Kings and legends, it's
also the sport of mystery and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   There was Eddie Arcaro winning the Triple Crown on Citation in
1948, after the horse's regular jockey had vanished during a
fishing trip off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   There was Forward Pass winning the 1968 Kentucky Derby after the
first-place finisher, Dancer's Image, failed his drug test.
</P>
<P>
   There was Alydar, the greatest sire of his day, dying in 1990
after suffering a broken leg that may not have been accidental.
</P>
<P>
   One stable was involved in all these incidents: Calumet Farm,
the most dominant of the blueblood/bluegrass dynasties of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   For five decades the red and blue silks of Calumet flew like a
pennant, announcing hegemony over the sport.
</P>
<P>
   From 1941 to 1958, the stable never went more than five years
without winning a Kentucky Derby. Calumet also won Grade 1 stakes
in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s and has won the Kentucky Derby
eight times overall. And it has bred nine Derby winners.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last 18 years the farm went from Camelot to the
auction block. Even as it was winning at the finish line, it was
losing on the bottom line. With his runaway spending and borrowing
practices, Calumet president J.T. Lundy plunged the farm into
bankruptcy in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy and his chief financial officer, Gary Matthews, are on
trial in a federal court in Houston. They're accused of offering
bribes and committing fraud involving loans from a defunct Houston
bank _ First City Bancorporation.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are expected Monday morning in the U.S.
District Court of Judge Sim Lake.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not the defendants are guilty of crimes, many
horsemen believe they're guilty of besmirching and all but
destroying one of the sport's greatest institutions.
</P>
<P>
   John Adger, racing manager of the nation's 13th-ranked stable,
Bob McNair's Stonerside, said of Lundy: ``The facts are he took
over a farm that had no debt and one of the two or three greatest
stallions in the world (Alydar). To go from there to where they
went, there had to be some gross mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that a farm with that stature had the problems
it's had. When I think of dynasties in sports, I think of the New
York Yankees, the Boston Celtics, and Calumet's in that group.''
</P>
<P>
   Calumet Farm was begun by William Monroe Wright, a Chicago
industrialist who in 1924 was 73 and seeking a retirement home. He
bought 407 acres near Lexington, Ky., and named the property after
the company he founded, Calumet Baking Powder.
</P>
<P>
   Wright built magnificent stables and stocked them not with
thoroughbreds but with trotting horses. After he died in 1931, his
son Warren brought in thoroughbreds. Within a year, Wright was
winning races. Within 10 years he was winning more than any other
thoroughbred owner in America.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Wright moves: acquiring one of the greatest stallions
in history, Bull Lea, to begin his bloodlines, and hiring the
sport's most esteemed trainer, Ben A. Jones, the year after he won
the 1938 Kentucky Derby. Jones and his son Jimmy would go on to win
the Derby seven times for Calumet.
</P>
<P>
   After Wright died in 1950, his widow, Lucille, provided
impeccable maintenance. She won the Kentucky Derby four times, the
same number as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But after 1961, as competition intensified, Calumet slumped. By
1964, the number of registered thoroughbred foals doubled from
1947's total of 7,705, and Calumet no longer dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lucille Wright, who remarried to become Markey, rallied
in 1968 to win the Kentucky Derby with Forward Pass, after the
disqualification of Dancer's Image.
</P>
<P>
   Then came eight years of disappointment before Mrs. Markey hired
a balding 30-year-old trainer, John Veitch, who brought the stable
back to prominence. In 1981, Calumet had its most profitable year,
earning $1.4 million from racing and breeding operations.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no more prosperity. The following year, Mrs.
Markey died at 93, and her heirs, whom she had disowned emotionally
if not legally, were not prepared to take over.
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1950s until her death, the Calumet matriarch had
little contact with her son, Warren Jr., and his wife, Bertha. Nor
had Mrs. Markey spent time imparting wisdom to her grandchildren,
Warren III, Thomas, Courtenay and Cindy, who would marry J.T.
Lundy.
</P>
<P>
   In Ann Hagedorn Auerbach's book, Wild Ride (Henry Holt and Co.,
1994), Cindy Wright Lundy is quoted warning her siblings in 1982
that Calumet would be more a curse than a blessing: ``We don't know
how to run it, and we'll end up falling out over it.''
</P>
<P>
   More prescient words have seldom been spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille and Warren Wright had only one child, Warren Jr., and he
was a disappointment to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   Although he showed some of the ingenuity of his remarkable
ancestors (he was one of the first Americans to install a mobile
phone in his car _ in 1960), Warren Jr. had some alarming habits,
such as drinking and spending heavily and forgetting to pay income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 he was sentenced to nine months in prison for tax
evasion, and his mother could never forgive the embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Since Warren Wright Jr. died in 1978 (of liver disease), his
widow, Bertha, and their children inherited Calumet upon the death
of Mrs. Markey. Because none of the heirs was familiar with
breeding and racing operations, they agreed to place the farm in
the eager hands of Cindy's husband, Lundy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of the rotund Lundy, Calumet appeared
successful. Alydar established himself as one of the most
productive stallions in history. And a Calumet runner, Criminal
Type, was Horse of the Year in 1990, while Lundy's stable was No. 1
in breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, a year later the farm was bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Warren and Lucille Wright were notoriously miserly (``I
made a fortune saving money,'' he said), Lundy spent lavishly and
wastefully.
</P>
<P>
   A few of his disastrous financial practices, as cited by
Auerbach:
</P>
<P>
   He overstated the value of Calumet's assets, in order to procure
bigger loans.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled extensively and expensively, using $30,000 per month
of Calumet funds to pay his own company (operated by Matthews) for
the use of a private jet.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his business deals (which included real estate, oil
wells and oil paintings, and A.J. Foyt racecars as well as
racehorses), Lundy often gave away breeding passes _ including
lifetime ones _ to Alydar and other stallions.
</P>
<P>
   In the boom-and-bust, wheeling-dealing 1980s, Lundy was
jet-setting across the nation and beyond and mortgaging the farm's
future to stay one step ahead of the creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the creditors caught up to him. And so did the law.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, the ``free'' passes to Alydar were outnumbering the
ones that were paid for with stud fees. Since Alydar was covered by
$36 million in insurance, the point was reached where the
15-year-old horse was worth more dead than alive.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an unusual situation in horse racing. Unfortunately,
the result too often is that an owner hires someone to kill the
horse during the night and make it appear accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lundy, 59, has not been charged with any offense
relating to Alydar's fatal injury on Nov. 13, 1990, the FBI is
still investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Alton Stone, Alydar's groom, was convicted in Houston of two
counts of lying to a federal grand jury probing the death of
Alydar, the most heavily insured thoroughbred ever.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors believed Stone had nothing to do with Alydar's death but
that he concocted contradictory stories, perhaps trying to cover up
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Jury foreman Sheila Donley of Houston said: ``They really felt
strongly that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it
doesn't matter. He willingly told a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks before Alydar suffered a broken leg in his
stall, First City threatened Lundy with foreclosure if he did not
deliver $15 million within three months. Lundy used Calumet's share
of the Alydar insurance _ $20.5 million _ to pay down the loan from
First City.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, Calumet remained $118 million in debt. There was
no escaping bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, members of the Wright family co-signed for loans
taken out by Calumet Farm, so they ended up in bankruptcy along
with Lundy and a Houston bank that was once the fourth-largest in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   First City Bancorp once had assets of $14 billion. But it made
so many ill-advised loans to owners of horses, oil wells and
Houston real estate that it landed in Chapter Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's vice chairman, Frank Cihak, was convicted in 1994 of
fraud and money laundering that brought him a 12-year prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   That case pointed prosecutors toward Lundy and Matthews, who are
accused of paying a $1 million bribe to obtain unsecured loans from
First City.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy was arrested in Miami last March as he flew there from
Venezuela, which does not have an extradition treaty with the
United States. Lundy was released after paying $1.2 million in
bond.
</P>
<P>
   Calumet, meanwhile, has made a comeback of sorts under the
ownership of Henryk de Kwiatkowski, who paid $17 million to buy the
farm, which had grown to 847 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farm looks fabulous,'' Adger says. ``The fences are
painted; every blade of grass is manicured. He's done a macWW7ibJ)Q
jbD]%Q! it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it's now a low-key racing operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They race some, but not like they used to,'' Adger says.
``They're mostly a commercial breeding operation now.''
</P>
<P>
   De Kwiatkowski has several prized stallions, headed by Danzig,
who carries a $3,000 stud fee.
</P>
<P>
   But while the farm itself has been tidied up, along with the
books, the lives of the people who once owned Calumet continue to
be blighted by litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Wright, wife of Warren Wright III, has seen the farm go
through five years of legal wranglings. She told the Lexington
Herald-Leader: ``It just goes on forever, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, many horsemen thought the Calumut racing dynasty
would go on forever. But since then, it's been the demise that
never ends. &QL;

 KINSHASA, Congo: are unknown. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rwanda
</P>
<P>
   The problems facing Rwanda are in many ways the driving force of
the Congo war. If Rwanda's security could be resolved, diplomats
believe it is at least possible that the conflict in Congo could be
settled.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began in 1994, when hundreds of thousands of Hutu
fled into what was then Zaire, fearing retribution after Hutu
extremists massacred at least 500,000 Tutsi in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Those extremists, allied with Mobutu, in turn began attacking
Rwanda from Zaire. In 1996, the new Tutsi-led government in Rwanda
and its ally and neighbor, Uganda, decided to put an end to these
attacks by putting their power behind Kabila. After Kabila came to
power, he began to distance himself from Rwanda, and Rwanda accused
him, like Mobutu, of allying himself with Hutu fighters.
</P>
<P>
   So in August 1998, Rwanda and Uganda teamed up again, behind
another rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, to start
another rebellion. Rwanda reportedly has about a quarter of its
40,000-strong army in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwanda government has not disclosed what the war is costing
in money terms, but there is no doubt it has been effective in
terms of security. Northwestern Rwanda _ a Hutu extremist
stronghold _ has largely been quiet since Rwanda invaded Congo.
Rwanda says it will leave Congo only if the safety of its borders
is guaranteed and the Hutu fighters are disarmed _ a task that most
experts believe is far too dangerous for the United Nations to take
on.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutsi now make up only 15 percent of Rwanda's population.
But they argue that it will take time to recover from the genocide
sufficiently to share power.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda
</P>
<P>
   Uganda is often accused of being involved in Congo largely for
opportunistic reasons, and it may be eager to get out now that the
war no longer serves the interests of Museveni, the Ugandan
president _ a man with a reputation as one of Africa's brightest
and most progressive leaders. But withdrawal might make Ugandans
question the worthiness of the adventure in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda reportedly has between 8,000 and 10,000 soldiers in
Congo, some as deep as 750 miles from the Ugandan border, at
Basankusu. Uganda backs two rebel groups, the Movement for the
Liberation of Congo, in the northwest, and the splinter group of
the Rally for Democracy headed by Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
   What is most contentious, Ugandan soldiers are reported to be
the most vigorous in cashing in on Congo's wealth, taking out
diamonds, gold, timber and ivory. Despite the looting, the war has
been a drain on the Ugandan economy and is thus increasingly
unpopular at home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rwanda, Uganda backed both the 1996 and 1998 rebellions in
Congo by arguing that it needed to protect its border from from
rebels in eastern Congo. Uganda also said it was siding with
Rwanda, a longtime ally, to prevent another genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors behind Uganda's involvement are Museveni's
ambition to be perceived as a major leader on the continent, and
his close personal ties with Paul Kagame, the vice president of
Rwanda who is considered the real power there. Kagame fled to
Uganda during anti-Tutsi riots in 1959 and became a star in the
Ugandan army, helping Museveni come to power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the war has also strained relations between Rwanda and
Uganda to the point that the nations fought a bloody battle in
Kisangani in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Uganda government faces two major rebel groups. One, the
Allied Democratic Forces, is fighting from bases in eastern Congo.
The second, the Lord's Resistance Army, is supported by Sudan and
attacks Uganda from the north. Uganda, in turn, has supported the
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi
</P>
<P>
   Burundi has also admitted to having soldiers in Congo. It claims
not to be allied with either side, but to be fighting Hutu rebels.
Burundi has the same ethnic division as Rwanda between Hutu and
Tutsi, who have been locked in civil war since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The war has sharply escalated, and the Burundi government has
herded 300,000 people, mostly poor Hutu farmers, into ``regroupment
camps'' in the hills surrounding the capital, Bujumbura. The
government has partly lost control over the nation's southeast,
where fighting is pushing some 1,000 refugees a day into
neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania's role in the war has been mostly that of a haven for
hundreds of thousands of Hutu who have fled there since 1994.
According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, there are
320,000 Burundians in camps in western Tanzania. Since October,
when the fighting in Burundi began to escalate, 50,000 more have
arrived. Refugees from Congo are also arriving at a steady, though
lower, rate.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has reportedly helped Kabila several times, providing
aircraft to bomb towns in rebel zones in northern Congo last year.
Sudan denies this, but Kabila is clearly on friendly terms with the
Sudanese government, apparently on the theory that the enemy of an
enemy _ in this case Uganda _ is a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Though Uganda and Sudan agreed late last year to end
hostilities, the Ugandan government supports the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has been fighting the Islamist Sudanese
government for 16 years. Fighting, disease and famine generated by
the conflict in Sudan have reportedly taken an estimated 2 million
lives since 1983.

 KINSHASA, Congo: since 1983. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angola
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of Mobutu in 1997, the Angolan government led by
Jose Eduardo dos Santos plunged into Congo, largely for its own
strategic reasons _ to attack the Congo bases of UNITA, the Angolan
insurgent movement led by Jonas Savimbi. The Mobutu government had
been helping UNITA for decades.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, is believed to command about 35,000
troops, and the Angolan government, about 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, the government has pulled off its most
successful offensive in a civil war that dates to Angola's
independence from Portugal in 1975. After spending nearly $900
million in oil revenues on new military equipment, the government
has routed UNITA from nearly every major population center.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA's military losses are closely tied to its loss of Congo as
an ally. The rebels, experts at financing war by mining Angolan
diamonds, no longer have a conduit for selling diamonds into the
international market or for military supply. UNITA's access to fuel
and spare parts has been seriously reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Although routed in the cities and much less capable of waging
conventional war, UNITA remains a formidable guerrilla force. In
the last month, in part to steal food and fuel, it has begun
striking at civilian targets in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Government soldiers are also overextended and undersupplied.
They, too, have been attacking civilians and stealing. All this has
caused a humanitarian mess. The World Food Program says more than 4
million people have been internally displaced out of a population
of about 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA, meanwhile, still has a few bases in Congo, near the
Angolan border. The Kinshasa government, focused on rebels in
eastern Congo, has been unwilling to flush UNITA out. UNITA uses
its bases to stage attacks against Angolan government forces.
Angolan troops, in response, give chase as if the border were not
there.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia
</P>
<P>
   Namibia joined the fighting in Congo almost a year and a half
ago, and in December began allowing the Angolans to fight from
Namibian soil. Namibia, which has often accused UNITA of helping a
Namibian insurgency, and apparently believed the Angolan government
was finally in a position to crush UNITA, reportedly has 2,000
soldiers in Congo _ anywhere from a third to half its army.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say that Namibia was persuaded to enter the
fighting in Congo by Zimbabwe. The two presidents, Sam Nujoma and
Robert Mugabe, are quite close and had supported each other during
the years when South Africa's apartheid government was busy trying
to stamp out their black liberation movements. Last year, Namibia,
Zimbabwe, Angola and Congo even formalized a mutual defense pact.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA has threatened retaliation against Namibia's involvement
and has already carried out several attacks. Namibia announced last
month that it would spend about $120 million on defense this fiscal
year, a 65 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers, meanwhile, have questioned Namibia's
involvement in both wars. The Namibian, in an editorial that ran on
Jan. 28, raised concerns about the growing cost of the wars, at a
time when the country needs money for social spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``While one would not argue with spending on the need to protect
our country's borders, one could certainly argue with the fact that
wars a long way from our borders are continuing to be a drain on
our state coffers,'' the editorial read.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe government of Mugabe has sent between 7,000 and
11,000 troops to Congo to support Kabila, according to varying
reports. The intervention is motivated in part by Mugabe's longing
to be a major player in southern Africa and his rivalry with the
leaders of Uganda and Rwanda. Zimbabwe has taken advantage of
access to diamond mines under the control of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimbabwe's military involvement in Congo is deeply unpopular
at home. The full cost of the deployment has been concealed from
international donors and, a Zimbabwean banker said, is seen by many
Zimbabweans as contributing to the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to
Zimbabwe last year because of suspicion that Mugabe misled it about
the cost of supporting Kabila. That suspension of aid, among other
things, has left Zimbabwe struggling to pay for fuel and with
inflation as high as 60 percent. So low are Zimbabwe's reserves of
dollars and other foreign currencies that the country can no longer
afford to import diesel, which is in scarce supply.
</P>
<P>
   Zambia
</P>
<P>
   Landlocked and abutted by several troubled lands, Zambia has
long sought to cast itself as an island of stability in central
Africa's turbulence. Like former President Kenneth D. Kaunda,
President Frederick Chiluba, in power since 1991, has acted as a
broker in the wars that have consumed the region from the
independence struggles of the 1970s to the present-day
conflagrations in Angola and Congo. That has led to peace deals in
Angola and Congo, though these have been undermined by the
combatants' refusal to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the statesmanlike stance of its first two leaders,
Zambia has invariably suffered from the wars around it. Little of
its potential _ in tourism, agriculture and mining _ has been
realized. In the 1970s, Kaunda supported liberation movements in
Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and the former Rhodesia. In exchange,
the white minority governments of the time in southern Africa
strangled Zambia's trade routes and attacked nationalist guerrillas
based in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Angolan war, the effect is more insidious. Over
the years, some 200,000 refugees _ 160,000 of them from Angola _
have flowed into Zambia. According to the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees, some 20,000 have crossed into the country in recent weeks
as the war in Angola has broadened. And Zambia has sent troops to
its border to prevent Angolan troops from entering in pursuit of
fleeing UNITA rebels. The easy availability of weapons in Angola
has fostered arms trade and an upsurge of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Angola last year accused Zambia of supporting UNITA by supplying
the group with arms and other logistical supports. Chiluba
vigorously denied this, but South African military experts suspect
that some officials in Zambia are still helping Savimbi.

 &HT;    New church at Mount Carmel nears completion
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The new church being built outside Waco for the
Branch Davidians is nearing completion, awaiting a few final
touches _ such as a fire-retardant treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it hard to burn the wood,'' said Alex Jones, the
right-wing radio host who used his talk show to organize volunteers
for the project. ``Just in case there's any arson problem ever
again from vandals and others, like our friends in the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the church, a 40-by-65 foot building smack on the
spot where the Davidians' old chapel sat, will be ready by April
19, the seventh anniversary of the fire that ended the government's
51-day siege of Mount Carmel and led to the deaths of David Koresh
and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been historic and it's been enjoyable,'' said Jones, who
lives in Austin and whose radio program is syndicated by Genesis
Communication Network in 60 cities nationally. ``We'll easily have
it done by the 19th. We're going to plant some shrubs and trees,
just like there were before the tanks ran over them, and we'll have
the Davidian flag back flapping high on a new flagpole.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidian Sheila Martin, who lost her husband, Wayne, a Waco
attorney, and four children in the 1993 fire, praised the
volunteers building the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the kind of people who believe if you lose your home,
you should have a place to live,'' Martin said, ``if you lose your
church, you should have a place to worship. Hopefully, thanks to
them, I won't have to always think of this as a sad place, but as a
place where people showed their love.''
</P>
<P>
   The only fighting at Mount Carmel recently has been over
ownership of the property.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the surviving Davidians, Amo Roden Bishop (the ex-wife
of the late George Roden, who lost a power struggle to Koresh) and
Douglas Mitchell, who was a Davidian before Koresh became the
group's leader, have staked claims to Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving Davidians, about 20 of whom live in the Waco area,
have won the most recent court skirmishes. They also pay the taxes
on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Construction started on the church last September. Early on a
Sunday morning, Jones led a convoy of about 50 vehicles from Austin
to Mount Carmel, which is about 10 miles east of Waco. About 100
men, women and children began work on the church's pier-and-beam
foundation. ``God Bless the Renegades'' blasted from stereo
speakers and several people wore buttons proclaiming, ``You burn
it, We build it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most weekends since, work has continued on the Davidian church.
</P>
<P>
   Jones _ who can quickly launch into a diatribe, then, just as
quickly, apologize politely for rambling _ admits the project began
half-way as a political statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't help but be one, when you think about it,'' Jones
said. ``But I was also disgusted no one was helping these people.
These people were abused, left out there with their whole community
destroyed. I'm about action. I don't like to watch bad things going

   About $60,000 has been spent so far building the Davidian
church, Jones said. Much of the outside of the building is
complete. The inside, however, is largely unfinished. Materials
like insulation, sheetrock, electrical supplies and paint are
needed for that. Concrete is also needed to build an outside
wheelchair ramp.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the materials needed can be found on Jones' Web
site, www.infowars.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only satisfaction these people are going to get is from
the community,'' Jones said. ``They're not going to get it from the
federal government or that judge, who keeps restricting the case
any way he can, or the state, which was derelict in its duty in
allowing the feds in there in the first place. ``The only ones who
are going to help are those sick of hearing all the propaganda and
know these are kind, decent people barely able to eke out a living.
Maybe this will give them hope.''

<P>
   There's been talk of rebuilding Mount Carmel to more closely
resemble what it used to look like, a rambling two-story structure
with a tower that dominated the horizon for miles.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin said those days are gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Like the group's informal leader, Clive Doyle, Martin would
rather see a series of homes built at Mount Carmel for the
remaining Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've all enjoyed our privacy,'' Martin said. ``We
know it can't be the way it was. The families, the people, the
different nationalities, all the things that made up Mount Carmel
won't come back until God brings us back to one place.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's top foreign policy adviser says
Washington's decision last week to impose diplomatic sanctions
against Austria was driven partly by a desire to send a message
that the United States would not stand by idly if other
anti-immigrant, far-right parties tried to join other coalition
governments in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concern about whether the extreme hateful right
could emerge in Europe,'' Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, said in an interview on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extreme small parties that exist in some
countries,'' he added, clearly referring to Germany and France,
though carefully not naming them. The United States, he said, had
to make it clear that ``democracy is about more than elections _ it
is also about shared values.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time a senior U.S. official had publicly
voiced fears that the inclusion of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party
in the new Austrian government could inspire similar groups
elsewhere in Europe. In private, some U.S. officials have expressed
particular concern about Germany, fearing that the troubles of the
scandal-ridden Christian Democrats could create a political vacuum
that far-right parties might try to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Berger peppered his remarks with praise for the swiftness with
which the European Union acted to downgrade diplomatic relations
with Austria, a formal step the United States has so far not
joined. Instead, it has temporarily recalled the U.S. ambassador,
Kathryn Walt-Hall, for ``consultations,'' and on Friday it barred
the Austrian defense attache from a relatively routine meeting of
U.S. and European officials here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Europeans themselves who have set the pace on this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Berger said, was deeply involved in the
decision to condemn the Austrian action, but he has yet to talk to
Austria's leaders, a step that was left to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. ``We had to send a signal, to say like the
Europeans that there will not be business as usual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the U.S. response, Berger acknowledged, was being carefully
measured in hopes of not inciting a greater nationalist backlash in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to walk a fine line here between expressing our
concern and not fueling'' Austrian passions, he said.
 &UR;  &LR; It is far from clear that this strategy is working. Chancellor
Wolfgang Schuessel defended the inclusion of the Freedom Party, led
by Joerg Haider, in the new government and said he ``sharply''
rejected what he called ``unjustified accusations'' from Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must defend myself against unacceptable comparisons,'' said
Schuessel, who heads the Austrian People's Party. ``There is no new
Hitler on the rise in Austria.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Washington's reaction broke from the Clinton administration's
usual playbook. Except in rare instances, the inclusion of
extremist minority parties or politicians in democratic foreign
governments is termed an ``internal affair'' in the State
Department's lexicon, a matter to be left to the voters of the
nation involved.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent years Washington has stood silent while Japanese
cabinet officials have expressed sympathy with the invasion of
China and Korea during World War II, for example, and while
far-left governments have come to power in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger made clear that he saw the events in Austria as
qualitatively different, and he seemed unimpressed by a declaration
issued by the new government that it would commit itself to
``understanding all human beings irrespective of their origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider seemed to backtrack on that statement almost as soon as
he had signed it, saying it was an ``affront'' that Austria had to
sign such statements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the verbal barrage unleashed here last week against
Austria, however, the Clinton administration still seems unwilling
to take actions that would truly hurt Austria or that could speed
the fall of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Berger argued that the European Union had passed some kind of
particularly difficult test last week. ``They have asserted here
that the EU is not just an economic concept, that it is a political
concept,'' he said. ``That reflects both their sense of history and
their sense of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, it does not appear to be examining any economic
sanc- tions, although the vocal criticism of the new government
could discour- age new American or European in- vestment in the
country. And it is unclear how Europe could economi- cally punish a
nation with which it will soon share a currency _ a diplo- matic
complication with no real precedent.

Marquette prevails as Houston falters at end
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MILWAUKEE _ Coming down to the final seconds with another chance to
win, the Houston Cougars again self-destructed in a65-61 loss to
Marquette.
</P>
<P>
   Poor shooting from the field and the free-throw line in the
second half took its toll as the Cougars failed to cash in on their
chances in the final 50 seconds Saturday before a Bradley Center
crowd of 10,833.
</P>
<P>
   Marquette, perhaps the most-improved team in Conference USA,
used a patient offense and diligent defense to give UH its fourth
consecutive C-USA loss, the last three by a total of 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winners make their shots and losers come close,'' Cougars
coach Clyde Drexler said after his team missed 22 of its final 33
field-goal attempts and seven of 15 free-throw tries in the second
half. ``We missed wide-open 3s and `and-ones' (free throw after a
made basket). We tried to speed up the game and had some success in
the first half, then it became tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its problems, Houston stayed close all the way, with
Oluoma Nnamaka finally ensuring the Golden Eagles' victory by
sinking two free throws with 2.6 seconds remaining after UH's Gee
Gervin missed the second of his two foul shots with 4.2 seconds to
go.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Chad Hendrick was the only Cougars player able to
hit a 3-pointer, making all of his team's four long-range shots,
Houston dropped to 2-7 in the conference and 8-14 overall after
losing its 10th game in its last 13 starts. Marquette, 14-15 last
season, improves to 13-8 overall and 6-4 in C-USA in Tom Crean's
first year.
</P>
<P>
   UH also could not overcome Brian Wardle's hot shooting streak
down the stretch as the 6-5 junior scored 11 of Marquette's 13
points during a five-minute span late in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick's 3-pointer from the left corner brought the Cougars
within 61-59 with 1:36 remaining. Marquette then lost the ball on a
shot-clock violation, but UH freshman George Williams (eight
points, five rebounds) missed a short jumper in the lane with 50
seconds left. Golden Eagles center John Mueller then was fouled and
added two free throws with 23 seconds to go for a 63-59 Marquette
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars brought the ball back down the court, and Gervin,
who scored 17 points with six assists and no turnovers in 37
minutes, flung his hands in disgust as his 3-point attempt rolled
around and off the rim. Kenny Younger (nine points, four rebounds),
fouled on a put-back attempt that failed to go in, made only one of
his two foul shots with 12.6 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin then was forced to foul Wardle on the inbounds play with
11 seconds remaining. Wardle, a 76 percent free-throw shooter,
missed the front of the one-and-one, but Brian Barone fouled Gervin
before the Cougars shooting guard could set up for a potential
game-tying 3-point try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make the second one and then foul quick enough
and hope they missed, and a good free-throw shooter (Wardle) did
miss,'' Gervin said. ``But it's not like us (70 percent as a team)
to miss free throws like that in the second half. We might have had
the lead, and they would have been the ones trying to come back.
Making free throws wins games.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the Cougars could shoot only 35.7 percent from
the field in the second half and 41.8 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Eagles, who frequently worked the shot clock into
single digits, were led in scoring by Wardle (19) and guard John
Cliff (14), while Gervin and Hendrick (14) were UH's only
double-figure scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Marquette won for the 11th time in 12 games when leading at the
half, taking the lead for good 29-27 on Cliff's shot with 5:43 left
before halftime on a four-point play after Torrence Botts'
intentional foul. Cordell Henry, flung down by Botts, made two free
throws before Cliff scored on the ensuing possession.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 36-31 at halftime, the Cougars failed to
capitalize on Marquette's inability to score to start the second
half, when the Golden Eagles missed their first eight shots and
scored one point in 5:20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense and rebounding won the game for us,'' said Crean,
whose team outrebounded Houston 32-31. ``Our defense got better as
the second half went along, and Wardle and Cliff passed the ball
very unselfishly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars, who previously had lost at home to
Alabama-Birmingham 90-87 after leading by 13 with 2:57 to play, and
78-75 at Tulane, play at Saint Louis next Saturday before playing
five of their last six regular-season games at home.

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Peacekeepers clashed with Kosovo
Albanians for a second day Saturday in this town, firing percussion
grenades and tear gas to push back angry crowds from the bridge
that divides the city.
</P>
<P>
   Two Albanians and eight soldiers were reported wounded in the
clash as Albanian youths threw bottles and stones at troops
guarding the bridge. Police in riot gear with helmets and shields
reacted forcefully, advancing in formation, backed up by four Dutch
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Youths ran stumbling through the thick white smoke to get away.
At the height of the clash at 3 p.m., grenades exploded in rapid
succession, rattling nearby windows.
</P>
<P>
   At least two people, apparently wounded, were carried off by
friends. A local commander of the peacekeepers appealed for the
Albanians to end the protest. ``Please go away. This has been too
much already,'' he said, adding that eight peacekeepers had been
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The clash came after news of more Albanian casualties from
Thursday's night of violence on the northern, Serbian-dominated
side of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   That night, groups of Serbian men went on the rampage,
threatening and killing Albanians who still live as a minority on
the north side of the town. A Serbian cafe was also at- tacked with
a grenade, and 17 Serbs were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Albanians died, U.N. officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One 46-year-old Albanian woman died in the hospital from her
wounds. Another Albanian woman was found by the U.N. police
Saturday morning, dead in her house, apparently as a result of the
Thursday night violence.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included an elderly couple, killed by gunshot wounds,
two women who were also shot dead, and three who died from grenade
attacks, one of them a 16-year-old youth. Six more are in the
hospital, two described as in serious condition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday night passed without incident, with the city under strict
curfew, said Mario Morcone, the U.N. administrator of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies of German troops had been brought up from the
south of Kosovo and positioned in the north side of the city to
keep the peace, Morcone said. Belgian and Dutch troops had already
been brought into the city from their positions in the north of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 250 U.N. police officers are also stationed
in the area, and are still evacuating Albanians from the north
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good working relationship now'' between the
peacekeepers and the U.N. police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morcone watched the crowds fleeing from the tear gas from his
office window just above the bridge and expressed frustration that
months of hard work trying to bring the two communities together
had exploded in one night. He blamed extremists on both sides for
causing the trouble, which began, he said, with the rocket attack
Wednesday on a U.N. bus carrying Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know if it is a problem of ethnicity,'' he said.
``There are a few people from each community who do not want to
find an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The police were pursuing their investigation but had not yet
arrested anyone for the violence committed Thursday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say the Albanians want to push them out and cleanse
all of Kosovo of Serbs, he explained. The Albanians in the south
say the Serbs want to force out all of the Albanians left on the
north side, intimidating them and breaking into their apartments,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way is to marginalize the extremists,'' he said. ``We
must ensure the security of the Albanians in the north and of the
Serbs in their enclaves, but at the same time we must do work on
the political side,'' he said.

STATE PAYS BILLIONS, GETS ONLY PART BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Californians paid $212 billion in federal taxes
last year and in return were shortchanged by Washington for the
12th year in a row, according to studies by two watchdog groups.
</P>
<P>
   The feds matched every tax dollar collected in California during
the 1998-99 fiscal year with just 89 cents worth of spending in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Californians were shortchanged $19.4 billion, or $595
for each man, woman and child in the Golden State, the studies
indicate. The imbalance is the biggest in history for any state,
shattering the previous year's record figure -- also set by
California.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to getting its money's worth out of Washington,
California ranks 39th out of 50 states based on return per tax
dollar paid. In first place, New Mexico raked in $1.94 for each tax
dollar spent by its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Last-place New Jersey saw a return of only 68 cents for each
federal tax dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, according to Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Lakewood, is a
prevalent and provincial attitude in Congress that he calls ``ABC:
Anywhere But California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Often we're fighting alone against other states,'' said Horn,
who noted that efforts to secure equitable funding by California's
House delegation -- Congress' largest with 52 members -- are often
dashed by coalitions of easterners and midwesterners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there's a population shift -- from, say, Pennsylvania
to California -- California doesn't get that share,'' said Rep.
Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, calling it a difficult task to
persuade Congress to transfer money from one state to another.
</P>
<P>
   The problem also troubles Rep. Howard ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa
Clarita, who has worked with other members of the state's
delegation to try to change federal funding formulas, his spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to change the federal highway fund formula last
year so the California share went from $1.6 billion to $2.4
billion,'' said McKeon spokesman David Foy.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, California -- home to 12.3 percent of the nation's
population -- paid 12.5 percent of the $1.69 trillion in 1997
federal taxes collected in 1998. In return, it received just 11.2
percent of federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies, conducted in December by the California
Institute and the Tax Foundation, used U.S. Census data, 1997 tax
obligations paid in 1998 and final audits of 1998 federal budget
outlays to document California's imbalance of payments. Both
reports noted that the state has been in the red with Washington
every year since 1987. The shortfall over that 12-year period
totals $123 billion.
</P>
<P>
   How did the nation's richest and most-populous state end up
being what is known in Washington as a donor state? Part of the
problem can be traced to California's demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Residents tend to be wealthier than the national average,
generating more income taxes. And Californians also tend to be
younger than the norm, meaning lower federal outlays to the elderly
for Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said California's problem is especially acute in the
Senate, where each state has only two members. A favorite ploy of
Congress' ABC faction, dominated by members from the Northeast the
Midwest, is the ``hold harmless provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to spending bills by lawmakers after total amounts have
been determined, hold harmless provisions mandate that no state
will have its share of funding cut from the previous year's level,
regardless of its needs. Horn cited Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, as masters of the hold harmless gambit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Institute study, hold harmless did
plenty of harm in 1998 to California schoolchildren from low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California's share
of Title I education funding, targeted at the needs of the poor,
was whittled down by her colleagues to $816 million, or 11.3
percent of the $7.2 billion program. Feinstein, D-Calif., argued
unsuccessfully that California was home to 15 percent of all
American children living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The state and local school districts have had to attempt to make
up the shortfall in Title I money, as well as dollars to meet the
needs of handicapped students.
</P>
<P>
   David Bartel, Horn's chief of staff, estimated that, based on
need, the Los Angeles Unified School District is currently being
shorted $60 million per year in funding to meet the requirements of
the Federal Individuals With Disabilities in Education Act. Long
Beach Unified School District's estimated loss for the same program
is $12 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   California has also taken a hit in the area of government
procurement, including spending by the Pentagon, which accounts for
two out of every three government dollars alloted for purchases. In
1998, California's share of procurement was $25.4 billion, down
from $26.2 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   California's share of total procurement dollars, which averaged
18 percent during President Ronald Reagan's 1982-86 peacetime arms
buildup, fell to 13.8 percent in 1998, the lowest level since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional staffer Bartel stressed that the state is also
still feeling the negative impact of two rounds of military base
closings in the 1990s that eliminated tens of thousands of military
and civilian jobs. California, home to 15 percent of the nation's
military installations, absorbed 60 percent of the closings,
including the Long Beach Naval Station and Shipyard, El Toro Marine
Corps Air Station and Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   The lone major area where California did plus business with
Washington in 1998 was welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The state received $3.7 billion, or 22.4 percent of the national
total, for the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program.
California houses 21.7 percent of the nation's adult welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ransdell, a Reseda native and attorney who is executive
director of the California Institute, a nonprofit, bipartisan
watchdog agency founded in 1991 to analyze and promote the state's
needs, said the Golden State is a latecomer when it comes to
fighting for its fair share of federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is a nation state with an economy that, by itself,
ranks among the world's major countries,'' said Ransdell. ``And our
economy had boomed for decades. A lot of Californians didn't really
see the need for federal money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ransdell said that a post-Cold War recession that was the
nation's deepest served as California's wakeup call. And Horn said
the state's lawmakers had to learn how to work smarter against the
ABC faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Congress in 1992, California had the most
backward delegation in Congress,'' said Horn. ``We were sharply
divided by party and regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, working smarter means weekly strategy meetings of House
Democrats, chaired by Rep. Sam Farr, D-Monterey; and Republicans,
led by Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Redlands. The delegation also does
bipartisan work on state issues with Sens. Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer and has an ongoing dialogue with Gov. Gray Davis and other
state officials.
</P>
<P>
   But California's funding rivals remain formidable, including
House and Senate members from 18 states -- from Maine to Minnesota
-- that have been networking since 1976 through a lobby called the
Northeast-Midwest Institute.
</P>
<P>
   On any given issue, Northeast-Midwest group, representing a
region that has been losing population, jobs and congressional
seats to California and other growing states for four decades, can
muster as many 36 votes in the Senate and 184 in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The California delegation needs to work in closer harmony, said
Sherman, who was elected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 29 Democrats and 23 Republicans and we're not always
working together,'' Sherman said, noting that members of the two
parties hold their own meetings and rarely sit down as a group to
work on California strategy. &QL;

RIOTS LEAVE 50 INJURED AS PROTESTS RISE IN VIENNA

<P>
   BERLIN _ Clashes overnight between the police and demonstrators
left more than 50 people injured in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday
after a coalition government including members of the
anti-immigration Freedom Party was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil, unusual in a habitually sedate city, reflected the
intense feelings stirred by the arrival in power of the party that
Joerg Haider has steered from a fringe group to a serious political
force over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 police officers, 11 demonstrators and several
bystanders were injured, none of them seriously, and dozens of
police vehicles were damaged, the police said. Ten people were
arrested, but all of them were subsequently released.
</P>
<P>
   The government, composed of the center-right People's Party and
the Freedom Party, immediately set about trying to calm the
international storm provoked by what is widely viewed as the
unacceptable legitimization of Haider, a man who has praised
aspects of Hitler's rule but more recently dismissed the Nazi
regime as barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must defend myself against unacceptable comparisons,''
Wolfgang Schuessel, the new chancellor and a member of the People's
Party, said. ``There is no new Hitler on the rise in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   His remark went to the heart of an international outcry over
Haider that has seen Austria's 14 European Union partners downgrade
diplomatic relations and the United States recall its ambassador
``for consultations.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel, who embraced a coalition with the Freedom Party after
protracted talks with the Social Democrats broke down, acknowledged
that in the short term Austria was certain to face difficulties,
but said he hoped that ``in the medium term it may be possible to
achieve a significant normalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, whose 14 other members have moved with
unusual rapidity and severity in their measures against Austria,
has halted bilateral political contacts with Austria, downgraded
relations with Austria's ambassadors, who will be received only at
``technical level,'' and said it would not support Austrian
candidates for positions at international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, who swore in the
government on Friday, appealed to the European Union to ease its
measures against Austria. A statement from the presidency said that
Klestil had contacted Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime
minister and current president of the European Union, to request
``an exception'' allowing bilateral contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear how the European Union would be able to
retreat from the steps it has taken as long as the Freedom Party
remains in government.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that Haider's party, which now has up to
33 percent support, has benefited from a widespread feeling that
the country is being unfairly punished.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview with an Austrian news agency, Haider, 50,
adopted the confident and unguarded tone that has appealed to many
Austrians who are tired of three decades of government by a Social
Democratic party that has continued an old practice of dividing
spoils among the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These European Union measures are nothing to get hysterical
about,'' Haider said, adding that other European ministers would
have to get used to talking to the government members from his
party because decisions in the 15-member bloc are taken by
unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has not made any move to prevent ministers of
the new government from attending European Union meetings, because
it has no legal basis to do so, and Haider appeared to be
suggesting that Austria could respond to the sanctions by blocking
European Union decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   But the People's Party quickly declared that no such action was
contemplated.

AN OUTCAST IN IRAN DARES TO TELL HIS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``regime'' to ``leadership'' in 8th graf.) 
 (jw) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ But for his battered brown brogues, Hossain
Khorram might never have told his story. But there was something in
the overstretched, heavily scuffed leather of his shoes, and the
back seams held together with string, that suggested that the
heavyset Khorram, quietly sipping tea in an artists' workshop in
old Tehran, was harshly down on his luck.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry about the shoes opened the way to a riches-to-rags
tale. Khorram, 53, said they were a hand-lasted pair that he had
bought for $400 more than 20 years ago in London and wore still
because his monthly income as a free-lance evaluator of paintings,
ancient scripts and other antiquities rarely exceeded $300, and in
many months amounted to nothing. On that, he said, he could barely
afford food for his family, much less new shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, the brogues were the only thing left from
his days of wealth, before the Islamic revolution in 1979 cast
power to the mullahs, or Muslim clerics, who remain Iran's rulers
today. In the blood bath that followed the overthrow of Shah
Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, before dawn on May 9, 1979, Khorram's
father, Rahim Ali Khorram, an immensely rich contractor who built
roads and airports for the government, and used his 2,000-man work
force as a political shock force in support of the shah, was
executed by firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening lengthened, Hossain Khorram's reminiscences
became, in a way, a parable of modern Iran. The story he told in
the workshop, and over supper later in his cramped three-room
apartment in a working-class district of south Tehran, was one of
Shakespearean proportions, of how Iran's once-powerful fell from
grace, and the once-powerless rose to supplant them. But it seemed,
just as much, a warning for the mullahs, who face a popular
challenge now that in many ways is as serious as the one that
toppled the shah.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, and in a second round of voting in March, the
clerical establishment will face its sternest challenge yet when
the country's 30 million voters go to the polls in a parliamentary
election. If the reformers, led by Muslim clerics, can overcome the
disqualification of hundreds of reform candidates and obtain a
majority in the 290-seat legislature, they could break the
hard-liners' stranglehold on power by passing new laws that would
move Iran toward greater democracy and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians, including Khorram, think that could be the
beginning of the end for clerical rule. ``The mullahs promised the
poor the world _ free electricity, free transportation, a dividend
for every family from the country's oil wealth _ and what did they
get? Nothing, in fact worse than nothing,'' he said. ``There are
millions who have no jobs, and those who do have to take two or
three jobs to survive. Is it any wonder people say the mullahs are
finished?''
</P>
<P>
   That Khorram dared to speak up, and allow a Western reporter to
quote him, is a measure of how Iran is changing. Not long ago,
anybody with his troubles would have been well advised to stay
silent. For more than 20 years, as one of Iran's new dispossessed,
he has been stripped of his civil rights, rebuffed by a bureaucracy
entrusted with restoring the assets of members of the old ruling
class, and barred from traveling outside Iran or getting a
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   But the winds of change are blowing through Iran, and the clergy
are bending with them. While the courts continue to imprison
dissident clerics, editors and other activists in an attempt to
blunt the popular clamor, many Iranians are speaking up, in ways
harshly uncomplimentary to the mullahs. Increasingly, too, there is
defiance of the social and moral rigidities imposed by the clerical
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class women think little of attending dinners in
figure-hugging dresses and fashionably streaked hair, covering
themselves with cloaks and head scarves only in public. Love
affairs outside marriage, in theory punishable by death, are
increasingly common in the wealthy suburbs of north Tehran. Alcohol
is widely available. A common theory is that the mullahs care less
about how Iranians behave privately since they are forced to care
more about holding on to power.
</P>
<P>
   In taking advantage of the new mood, Khorram is hardly
impartial. In 1979, the mullahs, declaring his father ``an enemy of
God'' and guilty of widespread corruption in his business dealings
with the shah, seized everything his family owned. This included
the construction company, a Tehran amusement park, several
mansions, dozens of bank accounts, and a collection of priceless
Persian carpets, old European furniture, paintings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   His father's execution was crueler by far. Khorram, quoting
prison guards, said Rahim Khorram, 56, suffered a fatal heart
attack when he was taken before the two mullahs acting as his
judges to hear his sentence after a five-minute trial, but was
dragged to the execution ground anyway. ``The mullahs said, `It
doesn't matter, the sentence must be carried out anyway,''' Khorram
recalled. ``So they dragged him out to the execution ground and
fired three shots into his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, the younger Khorram, in the first of several
periods in prison, was himself led out across the cobblestones,
blindfolded, and placed before a firing squad. But the fusillade
turned out to be blanks, the ``execution'' an amusement for the
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, tears well up in his eyes when he recalls
what he saw as he walked back to the cell. ``There were four other
men who were taken out there with me, and they weren't so lucky,''
he said. ``Their blood was flowing across the cobblestones.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Khorram said, Iranians had reasons to be disenchanted
with the shah, considering how the old ruling class lived. For 16
years, until he was 26 and returned to Iran to help run his
father's businesses, Khorram was educated at Swiss boarding
schools, and at a university in Zurich, where he earned an
engineering degree. He toured Europe with his brothers, Gholam
Reza, now 46, and Ali, now 42, spending part of a monthly allowance
of about $25,000 gambling _ and losing _ in the Monte Carlo casino.
Both brothers now in Tehran and are virtually penniless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rich man's boy, without any worries,'' he said. ``But
in the shah's time there were many who couldn't eat. Iranians
stopped loving him because he lost contact with them. In the end,
he cared so little for the people who supported him, like my father
and General Nassiri'' _ Nematollah Nassiri, the shah's childhood
friend who headed the secret police _ ``that he left without
ordering them released from prison, where he'd sent them to appease
the mobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Khorram speaks of his experiences without self-pity, but
his voice falters when he speaks of finding a way out of penury
that offers his wife, Mekhri, 38, herself the daughter of a once
well-connected family that came on hard times, and the couple's
daughter, Jayran, and son, Salar, 3, a better future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken away from me the smallest thing a man can hope
for, the chance to build a future for my children,'' he said, as
his daughter sat beside him on the arm of a sofa, her arm around
her father's neck. ``All I ask is a chance to build a future for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mullahs, Khorram believes that whatever happens in
the parliamentary election, their days in power were numbered from
early on in the revolution, when they, like the shah, lost their
connection to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, people have been comparing their lives under the
mullahs to life under the shah and saying, `The dictatorship of the
boots was better than the dictatorship of the slippers,''' he said.
``It's too late for me, but perhaps for my children's generation,
who will have learned not to mix politics and religion, there can
be a renaissance for Iran.''

INDIA TRIES TO PLUG A CASH DRAIN: ITS POWER SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 6th and 8th grafs for clarifications) 
 (jw) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Throughout India, billions of dollars worth
of electricity is stolen each year by consumers in league with
utility workers, bureaucrats and politicians, according to the
nation's ministry of power. Line workers are bribed. Meters are
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and one of its
poorest, more than 40 percent of the power generated is pilfered, a
recent independent audit says.
</P>
<P>
   Corrupt, politicized state power systems have turned into
sinkholes that are sucking down staggering sums of money that could
be used to educate the world's largest concentration of illiterate
people or to provide them with clean drinking water, economists
say. At the same time, these bankrupt systems routinely leave
people in darkness and factories idle during rampant power
failures, retarding economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these everyday facts of life have been common
knowledge, but only recently have government officials begun
seriously trying to reverse the dim reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power's not being sold, it's being stolen,'' the country's
minister of power, P.K. Kumaramangalam, declared in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the state of Uttar Pradesh won a crucial test case
when it refused to back down on its move to break up the State
Electricity Board despite a strike by 89,000 power workers. The
workers, rightly, saw the move as the first step toward privatizing
parts of the system and establishing a regulatory commission to set
rates that would help reduce the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Workers feared that a better-managed private system would
threaten their jobs and stop an unchecked flow of bribes, experts
said. But on Jan. 25, after an 11-day strike, workers gave up and
went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   In the workers' absence, a mere 1,100 substitute workers were
able to keep power humming to most cus- tomers in the state, which
has a population of 160 million. Kumaramangalam, a former trade
union leader who once battled privatization, said the state's whole
system could easily operate with 15,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and officials say the state's victory, with firm
backing from the central government, was a turning point. The state
electricity system will now be divided into separate units, for
generation and for transmission-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state had caved, it would have been the end of the
reform process in transport, roads, ports _ not just in the power
sector,'' said Kumaramangalam, a leader in the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the nation's governing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The process of change is slowly building. Last fall, the state
of Orissa became the first to award power distribution completely
to private companies. Two other states besides Uttar Pradesh are
moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1996, the World Bank, which has helped finance
India's power system, stopped lending for power projects. Theft,
huge subsidies for farmers and domestic consumers, and a bloated
bureaucracy had turned the state electricity boards into huge money
losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the hard conclusion that there was no way to reform
the state electricity boards from within,'' said Joelle Chassard,
the bank's coordinator for India. ``We tried and failed
miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank made further aid conditional on a state's
willingness to reform its power system. In states like Uttar
Pradesh, which are broke, bank officials felt there would be no
real money for education, health and poverty programs unless the
financial hemorrhaging for power could be stopped, nor could the
reliability and adequacy of the power supply be improved.
</P>
<P>
   The bankrupt power system had helped cripple anti-poverty
measures and economic growth in Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   If Uttar Pradesh goes forward with plans to privatize power
distribution, the World Bank is likely to loan the state billions
of dollars over the next five to 10 years for a wide variety of
development projects, bank officials say.
</P>
<P>
   And more states are showing an interest. In recent months, since
Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu _ known for
having taken politically unpopular steps to reform the power system
_ won re-election, other state leaders have gone to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few months, we have observed real competition
among states for going ahead with reforms,'' Chassard said. ``We
are facing a problem now of having to say no to some requests for
help because we have more than we can handle.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Change will not come without opposition. Over the years,
thievery has become entrenched because so many have benefited: the
consumer whose meter is slowed to give a lower reading, the worker
who collects bribes for tinkering with the meter, and the
politicians and bureaucrats who sell jobs to supervising engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big juice is in distribution,'' said Jairam Ramesh, a
Congress Party official who is an economist. ``A guy comes to me
and says: `I'll fix your meter. You'll pay 1,000 rupees instead of
2,000 rupees. You keep 800 and give me 200.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As power workers poured out of a jail in the town of Dasna in
western Uttar Pradesh, where they had been held recently for taking
part in a strike the state had declared illegal, the men bitterly
blamed the politicians for the corruption and insisted it could be
cleaned up if the political will were there.
</P>
<P>
   But their descriptions of the problem only underlined the
pervasiveness of the corruption, and how hard it would be for
anyone who is part of the system to root it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political interference in the electricity board leads to
theft by industrialists close to bureaucrats and ministers,'' said
Jagdish Singh Sisodia, who has worked as a clerk at the board for
32 years. ``They are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   And as other workers clustered around, seconding his opinions,
Sisodia related how government investigators who are supposed to
stop the bribery just wind up demanding their cut of the take.

</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``regime'' to ``government'' in 13th graf)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ After languishing for three decades in the
mountains of eastern Congo, a little-known rebel was picked by the
Rwandans to lead the overthrow of the 32-year dictatorship of
Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. So Laurent D. Kabila suddenly found
himself president of a country a third of the size of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, having angered his former patrons so much
that they are now trying to topple him, with half of his nation
occupied by foreign forces and all of it in economic ruin, Kabila
is, against the predictions of many people, still in power.
</P>
<P>
   The former puppet, who had survived over the years by reportedly
leading a small band of rebels who illegally mined gold and once
kidnapped some Western scientists studying gorillas, was even the
star guest at a special U.N. Security Council session two weeks
ago. Seven months after a cease-fire was signed _ and quickly
violated by all warring parties _ the United Nations is considering
sending a 5,500-member force to monitor the accord.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations and in several televised interviews,
Kabila forcefully made the point that he had been making since the
current war began in August 1998, but that had been falling on deaf
ears: The conflict in Congo is not a civil war, but an invasion by
two countries, Rwanda and Uganda, which happen to be among
Washington's closest allies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talk of a coup against Kabila, which had swirled
around Kinshasa a few months ago, seems to have quieted down for
now. Although the outbreak of the current war helped Kabila's
popularity at first, the deteriorating economic and social
conditions have caused a steady decline in his standing here.
</P>
<P>
   So low had his position apparently fallen that the government in
recent months began feeding a personality cult. Countless
billboards with Kabila's face now dot the capital alongside a few
older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Kabila here hoped that the trip to New York would
begin to change the outside perception of him. For them, he is a
liberator who began changing Congo for the better, but whose plans
were derailed by the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have already organized elections,'' said Delphin
Banza, a lawyer whom Kabila appointed vice president of a committee
to organize a national debate on Congo's future. ``Let's give him
the time to restore order in this country. Then he'll step down.''
</P>
<P>
   To his detractors, however, Kabila is a more brutal dictator
than Mobutu. Under his rule corruption and lawlessness are again
flourishing. Kabila, they say, is merely using the war as an excuse
to clamp down on freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila is governing the Congo as if it were an aquarium,''
said Joseph Olenghankoy, a well-known opposition figure here who
spent 18 months in prison for criticizing Kabila's government. ``He
controls the oxygen flow to the aquarium, and we, the Congolese
people, are the fish that are suffocating to death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a compatriot,'' Olenghankoy added. ``But he is utterly
incapable of governing a country. He is now the main obstacle to
peace. He's a man who is interested in nothing but his own hold on
power.''
</P>
<P>
   To fight the war, Kabila has sought and received help from,
among others, Libya, the hard-core Hutu militia that led the 1994
Rwandan genocide, and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila arrived here three years ago as a giant question mark.
The coalition that brought him to power, led by Rwanda but also
including Uganda and Angola, wanted a friendly power in Congo and
needed a Congolese face to head an otherwise foreign assault on
Mobutu's government. Initially, Kabila even received the praise of
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a visit here.
</P>
<P>
   What was known of Kabila, though, did not necessarily augur well
for the West. He was a follower of Patrice Lumumba,
post-independent Congo's first prime minister and a hero of African
nationalism, who believed that African nations must decide their
own course. Lumumba frightened Cold War American policy-makers; in
1961, he was assassinated with what is believed to have been the
participation of the CIA. The CIA then created Mobutu and supported
him for years until the end of the Cold War made him irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Kabila's rebel band made news when it kidnapped
Western scientists studying gorillas, but slipped into obscurity
after that episode, said Salih Booker, director of the Africa
Studies Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He awakened at the moment when a motivated coalition had the
power to overthrow Mobutu,'' Booker said. ``Kabila _ by now a sort
of commercial/political entrepreneur _ rode the wave to Kinshasa,
but he lacked a plan, a movement, and grew tired of some of his
allies and their more focused agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The agenda of Rwanda's Tutsi-led government was essentially to
install a Congolese leader willing to help it secure eastern Congo.
That area concealed Hutu militias responsible for the 1994 genocide
in which at least 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But Kabila's closeness to the Tutsi, who are despised in distant
Kinshasa, made him unpopular here. He eventually cut his ties with
them _ causing the Rwandans to organize a second rebellion, this
time against Kabila, in August 1998. Kabila's government was very
close to falling, but he persuaded the Angolans and Zimbabweans to
rescue him at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   At home, most of the reforms Kabila had undertaken during his
first year _ the successful introduction of a new currency, the
stabilization of the economy and a campaign against corruption _
ground to a halt. Today, the economy has collapsed and the
Congolese franc is losing value every week. Soldiers from Kabila's
presidential guard prey on Congolese and foreigners here, invading
private cars for no reason and demanding money.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat based here said the president ``did not get
sufficient credit for what he did during his first year.'' He
added, ``Kabila had, and for all I know still has, a genuine
ambition to improve the conditions in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But others _ especially political opponents who have been
ignored, intimidated or jailed in the last three years _ say Kabila
is indistinguishable from other African despots who are willing to
sacrifice anything to remain in power
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila likes power,'' said Christophe Gbenye, a Lumumba
follower who knew Kabila in the early 1960s and who is now an
opposition figure here. ``He wants this war to continue. That way
he remains in power. He has absolute control over the country's
finances. Money is spent all in the name of war.''

GOP _ That stock sure looked promising when you bought a ton of
shares last summer, but now its price is starting to plummet.
That's the dilemma facing hundreds of elected Republican officials:
Has the GOP invested too much in presidential candidate George W.
Bush to turn back now? By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AMWEST _ A feud with FAA safety watchdogs in Phoenix has added a
new hurdle to America West's recovery from a year plagued by flight
delays and cancellations. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the
``A'' and ``F'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DELWEBB _ Del Webb Corp., the company that defined retirement for
millions of seniors, has hit its own middle age. The Sun City
developer's crisis is whether the children and grandchildren of its
original buyers will pay to spend their golden years at Webb
communities. By CATHERINE REAGOR. Story will move in the ``A'' and
`F'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Phoenix) Those who prefer the term ``firearms
enthusiast'' to ``gun nut'' say we never put stories like this in
the paper. But here it is, in the paper. Apparently, leaders of the
left-wing media conspiracy to keep stories involving ``positive''
gun use from seeing the light of day forgot to send out a memo. By
EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY-GAMES (Undated) - We're a game-show nation, with no signs

to Be a Millionaire _ ``Is that your final answer?'' is already
fixed in the pop-culture lexicon _ has spawned imitators,
competitors and revivals, with more on the way. Which begs the
question: How much of this can we take? How many game shows are
viewers willing to watch? And why are we watching anyway? By BILL
GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY-MARYRHODA (Undated) - Mary and Rhoda is the kind of
project you really, really want to be good. We root for Mary Tyler
Moore. How many laughs did her old show give us? How many
comforting Saturday nights as part of CBS' once-powerful Saturday
night lineup? How much of an influence was. . . . Oh, forget it.
Mary and Rhoda is just plain awful, and there's no way to dance
around it. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL;

GATHERS' DEATH CHANGED LIVES FOREVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First comes the shock of time.
</P>
<P>
   So much of it has passed, yet there is the sad realization how
ineffective it's been at blurring the images.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Hank Gathers remains a memory sharply in focus.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years have passed since Gathers, the charismatic
forward who had led the nation in scoring and rebounding the
previous season, collapsed on the floor at Loyola Marymount in a
West Coast Conference tournament semifinal and was pronounced dead
an hour and 41 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   For family, friends, teammates, school officials, and those who
watched from afar, sadly at first and then with numbing amazement
as the Lions went on a surreal postseason run, Gathers' passing
remains vivid and close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never out of my mind,'' said Brian Quinn, the former LMU
athletic director and now the department's main fund-raiser. He's
in his office, looking up at pictures he keeps of Gathers and Bo
Kimble on his wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it all the time. It's still there. It'll never
go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimble was the other half of the ``Bo and Hank Show'' that first
rocked Dobbins Tech High in Philadelphia. Together they moved west
to USC, and when coach Stan Morrison was let go after their
freshman season, they both transferred to LMU.
</P>
<P>
   When Gathers collapsed with his heart condition near center
court on March 4, 1990, Kimble stood a few feet away. Despite the
shock and shroud of emotion, the Lions elected to play in the NCAA
Tournament. There the small Jesuit-run school both stunned and
captured the hearts of the collegiate basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble led the Lions on an amazing run. Using coach Paul
Westhead's frenetic fastbreak, full-court press ``system,'' LMU
upset defending champion Michigan in the second round and blew into
the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   To honor Gathers, so horrid a free-throw shooter he switched
hands and tried shooting them left-handed, Kimble attempted his
first free throw of all three tournament games left-handed. And
made every one.
</P>
<P>
   Grief empowered the whole team.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about that time to me pretty much every day,''
Kimble said. ``I'm so accustomed to talking about it, it really
does feel as if were yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lives forever changed
</P>
<P>
   LMU is retiring the jerseys of Gathers and Kimble on Feb. 19 at
halftime of a home game against Pepperdine. Kimble plans to return
for the ceremony. Gathers' mother, Lucille, will be there.
Westhead, Morrison and Dobbins coach Rich Yankowitz have been
invited.
</P>
<P>
   If memories have left the events fresh, much has changed since
that season 10 years ago. Not all that followed was as heartwarming
as the Lions' storybook postseason run.
</P>
<P>
   The Gathers family filed a $32.5 million lawsuit that named
seven doctors, Westhead, Quinn, the team trainer, the university
and three medical practices. The family, apparently resentful over
how Kimble had emerged as a national hero, stopped speaking to him.
Fearful schools began asking athletes to sign waivers before
playing, even at the intramural level.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille was so upset with Kimble that when Dobbins wanted to
retire the jerseys of Gathers and Kimble in 1990, she demanded
separate ceremonies. Kimble said things weren't patched up with
Lucille until last fall when he played in the ninth annual Hank
Gathers Game at Dobbins.
</P>
<P>
   David Spencer, who as an assistant coach for Morrison had
recruited Gathers and Kimble to USC, remained a mentor to the two
players after they transferred. Later, for a time, he became
Kimble's agent, but was also close to Lucille.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just such a painful thing,'' Spencer said. ``She had
lost her son, and here's Bo doing all these things. I don't even
want to think about what it must have been like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo's attitude about that was, whatever it took Lucille
time-wise, nobody should really question it - she lost her son. He
never held any ill feelings towards the family and just always
hoped it was going to work itself out with the passage of time. And
that's what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, LMU had no trouble arranging to retire their jerseys
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship had been strained for years,'' Kimble said.
``There was just been a lot of miscommunication, but all that's in
the past. We're back together, and that's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hank were here today, he would want that. We love Hank
Gathers' family, they love us, and I look forward to sharing more
positive moments with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' family includes a son, Aaron Crump, who lives with his
mother, Marva, in Philadelphia. She and Gathers never married.
Aaron Crump is now 16 and a reserve point guard at Cheltenham High
School, a suburb just northwest of Philadelphia and light years
from the projects where Gathers grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his powerfully built, 6-foot-7 father, Crump is a
still-growing 5-11 and 155 pounds. His basketball bloodlines, while
not secret, are not known to all at his high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good percentage of people who are unaware of it,''
said Cheltenham coach Scott Eveslage. ``He doesn't promote it. But
most of the staff and faculty are aware. I think both he and his
mom wanted to keep it kind of low key. There are going to be great
expectations for him. He's real proud of his dad, but he's into
trying to do his own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eveslage said his mother has Crump undergo annual heart checks.
At one time there was a concern he might have a slight irregular
heartbeat, but it is currently undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   While Crump may lack his father's frame, Eveslage said his
personality would sound familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a kid a lot of people pull for,'' Eveslage said. ``He is
a driven kid, as far as basketball goes. He's an intense player,
yet adds a fun-loving nature to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gathers touch
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all, of course, was Gathers. Affable and
dynamic in personality, intense and highly competitive as a player.
Gathers was someone who created an impact, in the class room, on
the court, in private, or in front of a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   He could lapse into his Ali imitation, surprise some by speaking
Russian, be the prankster or flex a bicep and declare, ``I'm the
strongest man in the world!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank had a great ear for mimicking people,'' said Morrison,
now the athletic director at UC Riverside. ``One time I came into
the room and my team burst out in hysterics - because Hank had been
up at the board imitating me in a pregame voice. He was bigger than
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He came from one of the roughest areas in Philadelphia, from the
slums he vowed to take his family away from. There he honed his
game, a largely self-made player. The gentleness about him was no
veneer, but it concealed his street-tough interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how tough a school that was at Dobbins Tech? I called
one time and was talking to the principal,'' Morrison said. ``In
the middle of our conversation, we're talking about how Hank and Bo
are doing on their English, and he says, `Stan, I'm going to have
to call you back.' I asked what was up. He said, `Somebody just got
shot in the neck out in the hall.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his demeanor, Gathers' background and drive to succeed
served him well on the court. At 6-7 he was short for a power
forward, but his game was huge.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer recalls when LMU went up against Louisiana State in
Gathers' senior season. LSU had 7-footers Shaquille O'Neal and
Stanley Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first seven times Hank shoots the ball in the game on
network TV, either Shaq or Roberts blocks his shot,'' Spencer said.
``Seven times against the player who had led the nation in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what he finished up with for the game? Forty-eight. That
tells you everything you need to know about Hank Gathers. That was
his personality. Just to be nails. I'm coming at you. I don't care.
Oh yeah, you blocked that one? How 'bout this one? That was him in
a nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Shaefer was LMU's trainer and strength coach. Shaefer was
one of the first by Gathers' side when he collapsed in that
conference game against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think back on that time, the first thing I think of is
just what a great person he was,'' said Shaefer, now the Lakers'
athletic performance coordinator. ``Just a wonderful personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played so hard and with so much heart. He was a privilege
to watch. There was some question whether he had enough ability to
play in the NBA, but I wouldn't put anything past him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' outgoing personality was such that those closest to him
reflect less on his tragic end and the emotions that swirled around
his death, than on simply Gathers the person.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when people come up to me they're a little
hesitant, because they don't want to bring up a sad moment,''
Kimble said. ``But when I think of Hank, I really don't think of
the sad part of him not being here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone wanted me to reminisce, that's OK with me, because
I'm in tune with one of the greatest memories of my life. I
actually embrace and love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The postseason run
</P>
<P>
   After Gathers died at age 23 of a heart condition that remained
disputed years later, there was the ugly aftermath of lawsuits,
opportunists, accusations, betrayal and controversy that threatened
to taint his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately after his death came a postseason run by LMU
that was as dramatic as it was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was actually Kimble who led the nation in scoring that
season, Gathers was considered their leader and best player.
Without him, few gave the small Catholic school hidden near the Los
Angeles airport much chance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Westhead, who had coached the Lakers to their first
championship with Magic Johnson 10 years earlier, already had
brought an unfamiliar spotlight to LMU with his all-out pressing,
running style that blew by opponents. The Lions became the
highest-scoring team in the country. During the Gathers-Kimble
years, Loyola scored more than 100 points in 73 of its 95 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was a unique system, run by a unique group of players that
included Jeff Fryer, Terrell Lowery, Chris Knight, Tom Peabody and
Tony Walker. A group that bought into Westhead's approach and
played at full speed the entire game, an unrelenting tornado on
hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exhilarating, it was wild and it was fun,'' Morrison
said. ``It was just amazing to watch it unfold. It electrified the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was certain if the Lions would be emotionally devastated
or inspired when they opened the NCAA Tournament at the Long Beach
Arena against New Mexico State. Or anticipated Kimble stepping to
the line for he first time, and letting fly a left-handed free
throw to honor Gathers that drew only net.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day in Long Beach, I'm telling you there were grown men
sitting there crying openly,'' Spencer said. ``Just couldn't
contain the emotions. I get shivers just thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a decided underdog against Michigan, the Lions not only
upset the defending champions, they swamped them 149-115. They were
a team playing almost outside themselves. A nation was captivated.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions next defeated Alabama by two to advance to the Elite
Eight, before their talent finally caught up to their desire and
purpose and they lost 131-101 to eventual NCAA champion UNLV, a
team that also beat them in their season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a decade later, the mark LMU left on college basketball is
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the most remarkable sports stories we've
ever had in this nation,'' Quinn said. ``I'm appalled when they
pick the greatest sports moments and there will be some stupid NBA
game or some dumb pro football game. I don't think any of those
even begin to hold a candle to what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really special - the emotion, kids pulling together,
spirit and friendship. I just can't think of a more uplifting
sports story than what happened after his death.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later
</P>
<P>
   Bill Husak is the athletic director at LMU now, though there are
times he must wonder if he was here all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotional impact that year had is relived here every
day,'' Husak said. ``More days than not, something is mentioned
about 1990 - that team, Bo, Hank. It left such an emotional anchor
to people who were here at that time, that it's constantly brought
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimble spent three years in the NBA and last fall started a
non-profit foundation to refurbish abandoned homes in the
Philadelphia area, beginning with those back in his old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   From the two lawsuits that were settled, Aaron Crump grossed
$1.5 million that was placed in a trust. The first $100,000 he was
allowed to spend was to buy a house out of the Rayond Rosen
Projects.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers' mother, Lucille, grossed $895,000 from the settlements
and also moved out of the dilapidated row houses of Rosen and has
since remarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gathers was a guy whose full dream was to play in the NBA,
make his fortune and take his loved ones out of the abject poverty
they lived in North Philadelphia through his talent in
basketball,'' Schaefer said. ``That was his determination.''
</P>
<P>
   His full dream was cut much too short, of course, but in the
end, he did get them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for that,'' Quinn said. ``If there's any positive or
good news from anything, it's that.''

 &HT;    Majestic memorial service held for gorilla Willie B.
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big fella's soul may rest in heaven, but there was
plenty of evidence Saturday that an enduring piece of it will never
leave Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorial service as majestic as he, Atlanta's most famous
gorilla, Willie B., was fondly remembered for his legacy to Zoo
Atlanta and the city.
</P>
<P>
   The service, in a tent filled to overflowing by an estimated
2,500 _ many others watched the service on remote televisions
around the zoo _ was dignified and joyful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people around Atlanta, around the South, around
America, maybe even the entire world and the universe loved this
creature,'' Zoo Atlanta Director Terry Maple said of Willie B., who
died in his sleep Wednesday at age 41 of heart failure after a bout
with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   In his 38 years of living at the zoo, Willie B., named after
former Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield, became its most famous,
even regal, inhabitant, known for his stoic presence and curious
gaze that implied he knew more about visitors than they knew about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said the 6-foot, 400-pound
lowland gorilla left a legacy of compassion, and, oddly, human
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   During Young's administration, the zoo was refurbished and
Willie B. finally was allowed to roam an outdoor habitat after 28
years of being cooped up in a cage with a television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moved to set him free, and perhaps in so doing we set
ourselves free,'' Young said. ``And could learn that we can all
live together with all the animals that God created.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, and several of the eight speakers at the service, retold
funny stories about the gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Young saw Willie, he said, ``He made eyes at my
wife, and I was so glad there was a (cage) partition there, because
I didn't want to have to slug him.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Nan Grogan Orrock said a resolution commemorating
Willie B. was read in the state House of Representatives on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part of the interconnected web of life,'' said Orrock.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Petty, vice chairman of the Zoo Atlanta board, quipped
that Willie B. had profoundly influenced the zoo, especially Maple,
its robust director.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to a striking physical resemblance,'' said Petty,
``Terry was inspired by Willie B.'s leadership qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   After the approximately hourlong service, members of the Atlanta
Youth Chorus led attendees outside the zoo's gates while singing an
African march song.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo started a fund-raising drive to commission a life-sized
bronze statue of Willie B. that will be erected outside the gorilla
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Maple said plans are to sprinkle Willie B.'s ashes over his home
country of Cameroon, probably in June, if the Zoo can raise the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We borrowed him from Africa 39 years ago, and he will be
returned there,'' Maple said.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Black, 43, a Stone Mountain nurse, said she had visited
Willie B. many times in her 11 years of living in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of missing his funeral was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's an ape,'' she said after the service. ``But Lord
knows he felt like a family member.''

COWBOYS SHOW CHANGE POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a couple of football seasons ago when a topical joke
around town went like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys' record this year will be 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen-and-3?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. Thirteen arrests. Three convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have definitely changed. And in one area, for the worse.
Mention the Cowboys and a 13-3 record in the same sentence, and,
football-wise, the joke is on you for uttering such foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   But then comes that other thing. That image thing. How ironic
that as the NFL] tries to brace itself against a tidal wave of
off-the-field image disasters, the former Valley Ranch bad boys are
coming up squeaky clean.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nonstop shock for the NFL. The warm glow the league
was experiencing over Sunday's Super Bowl was quickly erased when a
couple of bodies were placed in cold storage at the Atlanta morgue.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-paid linebacker in the league, Baltimore's Ray
Lewis, now wears a jailhouse jumpsuit. The charge is murder, the
same as Carolina receiver Rae Carruth faces in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   All else pales in comparison, but there was so much more in the
1999 season, from Cecil Collins in Miami, to Steve Muhammad in
Indy, to Rod Smith in Denver to the possibility of federal drug
trafficking charges against at least two, and maybe four members of
the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Ranch, however, all is quiet in any area involving
unsavory conduct, and has been since training camp. There are many
fans, maybe even a majority, who would gladly trade records. As in
more victories for more arrests or drug suspensions. That's just
the fans for you.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, Jerry Jones made a vow to clean up the
Cowboys. He was serious, as serious as Jones is about his team
returning to Super Bowls. Oh, well, Jerry can't necessarily have
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, there was a reluctance yesterday at Valley
Ranch to even discuss this positive side, meaning the image
reversal. There's no lack of pride involved, but there is reality.
Meaning it can all change with one phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, wasn't good. A former player, Mark
Tuinei, died of a heroin overdose in May, and the Cowboys' image
took a hit. Leon Lett also was suspended again for substance abuse
violations in June. Jones, himself, was arrested in August after he
left the scene of a police traffic stop while on his way to church.
</P>
<P>
   There are never any guarantees, but who would have dreamed three
years ago that instead of Jones, it would be commissioner Paul
Tagliabue facing the hot glare of the media spotlight. Tags is
trying to explain that despite the way it looks, a criminal element
doesn't exist in the NFL. And that players aren't out of control.
And that the league isn't doing a soft-shoe on the issue. Jones, of
course, has been there, and he doesn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Calvin Hill, who three years ago was hired by Jones and
given the title of director of player assistance and development.
Hill is a Yale graduate, a former Cowboys player, and the father of
a high-profile son in the jock kingdom, Grant Hill of the NBA's
Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   How well has Hill done his job here? Well, other NFL teams have
attempted to hire him, based on his work with the Cowboys. To those
clubs, he offers advice, but his loyalty is to Valley Ranch and
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all started with Jerry, because Jerry wanted change,''
Hill said yesterday from Hawaii, where he will attend the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us have all the answers, and none of us are
proclaiming success,'' Hill added. ``It's an everyday process. What
we try to do is give the players an understanding of what the
high-profile life can mean when you are in the NFL, and
particularly when you play for the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hill's job is being prepared to deal with and react to
the disappointments. For example, Lett last summer. But murder
charges? ``That goes beyond belief,'' said Hill of the Lewis and
Carruth cases. ``Of everything that can go wrong, you don't have
that in the mix. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Hill arrived, the Cowboys have placed a higher
standard on character when it comes to the draft. Hill is the
background checker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain cases, I've believed the risk is worth the reward
on a player,'' he said, ``but Jerry has stepped in and said we
simply can't take the chance. Countless other times we've passed on
good players because we've all been in agreement the risk was too
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't looking for Boy Scouts, but we do want good guys.
Again, that has been handed down from the top, meaning Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   With these guidelines, has the product on the field been hurt?
Definitely in the case of receiver Randy Moss. But should there be
praise for the Cowboys' effort, particularly based on this NFL
season? Certainly. Without question, Jones has walked his talk.

Mihm gives Texas a helping hand
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AMHERST, Mass. _ It appeared the only fight the Massachusetts
Minutemen would put up against No. 16 Texas would come from an
inebriated fan, who went after a sign a group of Houstonians held
up during the second half.
</P>
<P>
   How apropos that the sign read ``Texas Fight.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass finally made a game of it. But like the elderly gentleman
unceremoniously handcuffed by police and carried headfirst out of
the stadium in shame, the Minutemen did not do enough to overcome
the long arm of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Those long arms belonged to Chris Mihm, who had a game-high 18
points and 12 rebounds and set a school single-game record with
eight blocked shots as Texas ran past UMass 68-57 Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, a 7-foot junior, also established a school career mark
with 237 blocked shots, passing Albert Burditt (1991-94), who had
236.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a goal of mine coming in to the University of Texas,''
said Mihm, who recorded his 13th double double of the year. ``I
didn't even know I was close to the career record. I really wasn't
paying all that much attention to it. It's a great achievement for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through much of the game, the handful of Longhorns backers, the
unofficial fan club of reserve guard Yair Harari of Bellaire High
School, were the only ones among the 8,145 in attendance to think
anything was special, despite their harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But after falling behind by 20 points on a Gabe Muoneke dunk
early in the second half, UMass gave its fans something to cheer
about with a gutsy comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to make a run,'' Mihm said. ``They
really started getting hot from the perimeter. Sometimes you're not
just going to be able to continue to blow somebody out, but I think
we did a good job of holding on to the lead the whole time. It got
to within six (points) at one time, but we stayed in control of the
game throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen, who hit just six of 28 shots (21.4 percent) in
the first half, got very hot during one stretch after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke, who had 16 points, put Texas up 41-21 with a one-handed
slam with just over 17 minutes left, but UMass hit six 3-pointers
over the next eight minutes, outscoring the Longhorns 24-10, to
pull within 51-45.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Crooks, who was an ugly 0-for-9 from the field in the
first half but had 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting after the break,
sank three of the 3-pointers. Monty Mack, the Minutemen's leading
scorer with an average of 19.3 points per game, had two treys in
the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Mack was 6-of-14 from the field and finished with 16 points. But
he struggled to find open looks against a variety of UT defenses,
including a 1-3 zone with a chaser (usually Lawrence Williams), and
a box-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't practice (the trick defenses) that much, but
we did a great job of adjusting to what we had to do,'' said
Williams, who played a career-high 33 minutes in part because guard
William Clay was benched for the game after missing the team's
flight to Massachusetts on Friday. ``Basically, it was to slow
their best shooter down.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting to within six points, UMass blew a couple of
scoring opportunities following Texas turnovers before Muoneke went
to work to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   UT's Chris Owens missed two free throws, but Muoneke grabbed the
offensive rebound after the second one and scored, then got free
after breaking the UMass press for a layup to put Texas up 55-45.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wagner got a steal and fed Williams on the run. Williams
ducked under a defender and scooped in a reverse layup to give the
Longhorns a 12-point cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (15-6) controlled the game with free throw shooting the
rest of the way, hitting 11-of-12 from the line in the final 1:14
to clinch the win in its final non-conference game.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm looked like he might not get involved in the game in the
first half, as the Minutemen sagged into a 2-3 zone defense, trying
to force the Longhorns to beat them from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm didn't touch the ball on the offensive end for the first
time until the game was more than six minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming in that would happen,'' Mihm said. ``(Sagging
defenses) really don't bother me anymore. I can still get done what
I need to get done (against it). I can score my points and I can
rebound, I just need to play hard and figure out how to do it.''

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to repair a candidacy that she acknowledges
has stirred concern about her political skills and spirit, Hillary
Rodham Clinton says she is now prepared to press an aggressive
campaign against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the race for U.S.
Senate, drawing distinctions on issues ranging from school vouchers
to tax cuts, and arguing that Senate Republicans ``don't need any
more votes'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In her first extended interview devoted to her Senate candidacy,
just days before her official announcement Sunday afternoon,
Clinton took pains to present herself as a moderate Democrat. She
went out of her way to note her support for the death penalty,
welfare restrictions and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who unsuccessfully championed national health
care six years ago, asserted that ``there are no government
solutions'' to most problems facing the nation. And, sounding very
much like a new Westchester homeowner suffering from a case of
property-tax sticker shock, Clinton said she was stunned to
discover the tax burden faced by state residents.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would use her formal announcement speech _ in the
gymnasium at the State University of New York at Purchase _ to try
to offer voters an education about her personal background and
professional accomplishments. Her travels through New York since
last summer had convinced her, she said, that she had become
something of a caricature. That was partly because her own
accomplishments had been eclipsed by her husband's career, and by
her mostly self-imposed isolation in the White House, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, reprising what has been a recurrent theme in her public
life, Clinton also blamed conservative attacks _ ``the drum beat of
an ideology that is really being promoted at my expense,'' as she
put it _ for distorting the public's view of her.
</P>
<P>
   She made her remarks in an 80-minute interview with The New York
Times, conducted Thursday evening in her eighth-floor corner office
overlooking Madison Square Garden, accompanied by her press
secretary, Howard Wolfson. The interview came after what has proven
to be a difficult six-month introduction into electoral life and
New York politics for Clinton, who has been criticized for running
a clumsy, passive, unfocused and vague campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She did not quarrel with criticism of her campaign style. But in
outlining her plans as she moved into the next phase of the race,
she offered signs of a significant shift in her strategy. She said
she would be more aggressive in presenting her case while trying to
offer a fuller, and presumably more sympathetic, portrait of her
life and career.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, aides trucked in cartons filled with 400,000
eight-page leaflets, titled ``Hillary: The Real Story,'' that were
to be distributed across the state starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has probably been the biggest surprise to me in the last
six months,'' Clinton said. ``What I have found is that people
don't know anything, really, about the work that I did before Bill
was elected president. And know very little _ except about health
care _ about the work that I've done in the White House. It became
so apparent to me that in order to introduce myself to the voters
of New York, I was going to have to go back and really share a lot
of my life story.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview, she was relaxed and jaunty, laughing
even when asked whether she was concerned that her campaign might
be jeopardized by the impending report on her actions by an
independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, who is still investigating the
failed Whitewater land deal and her role in other matters, like the
firings of several employees in the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have hoped that this would have been concluded by now,
but apparently that is not the game plan,'' she said. ``And I guess
New Yorkers will have to judge that for what they think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to speculate on what Ray might find, or the subject
of the investigation, saying: ``It is hard to believe that after 6{
years, tens of thousands of documents, grand juries, testimonies,
committee hearings and everything that's gone on, that this could
not be brought to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's report is due to be issued in the middle of the campaign,
and since Clinton is promising now to be available more often in
news conferences and one-on-one interviews, it seems likely that
she will be forced to address these issues frequently in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, she also talked about her new life outside
the White House, though she still is not living full-time in her
$1.7 million house in Chappaqua. She described her first few weeks
as something of an adventure, noting that she had barely driven a
car, cooked a meal or gone shopping for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, pushing that cart through the supermarket, and
standing and talking to _ I had a long conversation about
clementines with the produce manager because it's been a long time
since I bought a crate of clementines,'' she said of a recent visit
to a Grand Union near her home on Old House Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, standing over in the dairy department trying to
decide what Skim Plus meant. Because, you know, I'd never seen Skim
Plus. And having a man come up to me and kind of do a double take
and kind of say, `Is that you?' and I said, `I guess so, it is me.'
It made me feel like I was re-entering the real world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After months of generally avoiding direct engagement with
Giuliani and not offering many specific proposals of her own,
Clinton asserted that there were clear differences between them,
notwithstanding their agreement on a number of issues that
typically divide Democrats and Republicans, including support for
abortion rights and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even though Clinton went out of her way to complain
about the tax burden faced by Westchester homeowners, like herself
_ a complaint that has historically reaped dividends for
politicians running for office in Westchester _ she criticized
Giuliani for supporting the large tax cut pushed by Republicans in
Washington. Democrats have instead endorsed small, targeted tax
reductions in order to use some of the surplus for Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that education would be the main issue in the
campaign, a reflection of a series of polls that suggest that the
topic is the top concern of New York voters and a vulnerable
subject for her opponent. Clinton criticized Giuliani for
supporting school vouchers, which she argued would drain money from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said that she supported some forms of competency
testing for teachers and school standards for children. Asked
whether she supported merit pay, Clinton said she favored ``pay for
performance,'' which she said she would elaborate on in a speech
devoted to education in Syracuse on Tuesday as part of her
statewide tour this week. Clinton has the backing of the teachers
union and a sizable bloc of labor support, which Giuliani's aides
have suggested could undermine any of her efforts to effect real
school reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated that she would take the advice of some
Democrats and, in effect, nationalize her contest against Giuliani
by characterizing a vote for the mayor as a vote for a Republican
majority in the Senate. She went so far as to suggest that she
believed the Democrats could capture the Senate this year, a view
that is not shared by most political professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republicans need any more votes to block
campaign finance reform, or turn back the clock on our budget and
deficit policies, or to side with the majority of Republican
leadership on issues ranging from school vouchers to whether or not
we deal with health care in a step-by-step way to try to eventually
reach a goal of providing quality affordable health care for
everybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton seemed eager to hold Giuliani accountable for
the actions of fellow Republicans in Washington, she seemed
reluctant to grant him too much credit for changes that have taken
place in New York under his watch. Clinton said that much of the
credit for the drop in crime in the city was due to federal funding
for new police officers, and the policies of the former police
commissioner, William Bratton, who was appointed by Giuliani,
though the mayor has since had a falling out with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find me trying to claim that nothing good
has happened in New York,'' she said. ``I love New York City. I
mean, if I weren't excited about living in New York City and
excited about the quality of life here, I wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Clinton has told friends in recent weeks that she
has been startled by what she sees as the ferocity of some of the
coverage of her, and by the speed with which some of her earliest
supporters have retreated as her campaign seemed to stumble. She
made no such observations in the interview, though, and instead
praised the state's Democratic leaders and presented herself as a
candidate who had fallen more than once while climbing an unusually
sharp learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a candidate, and being a candidate in the toughest
political environment in America, which I don't think there's any
doubt about, is a real challenge,'' Clinton said, playing with a
pair of reading glasses and sipping a cappuccino as she settled
into a couch in the office she shares with her campaign manager,
Bill de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, which begins with her speech Sunday, amounts to
reintroducing herself to voters. This comes after she has spent
most of her time in the White House in self-imposed isolation,
particular- ly since her failed campaign for na- tional health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, her aides regard her reintro- duction as perhaps the most
impor- tant task facing her in the speech and in the weeks ahead,
and it is remi- niscent of what her husband did in the spring of
1992. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Then, he and his chief political advisers, including Mrs.
Clinton and Mandy Grunwald, who is working for Mrs. Clinton in this
campaign, wanted to blunt negative portrayals of him as a
draft-dodger and womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   In remaking his image, they recruited Linda Bloodworth-Thomason,
the Hollywood television producer, to create a biographical film
introducing Bill Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. Ms.
Bloodworth-Thomason has prepared a similar film to introduce
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   She and her advisers hope the film will help to rehabilitate her
own image and try to establish that she has accomplishments, as a
lawyer and an advocate for children, that are not dependent on her
husband's record.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that has been obscured, she said, by attacks on her and
the president. Asked if she still believed they were a target of a
``right-wing conspiracy,'' as she first volunteered when the Monica
Lewinsky scandal erupted, she said: ``If you look at the mailings
that all of these groups are sending out _ I don't know if they're
part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. But they are certainly part
of a broad network of people who are all aiming their ammunition
against me because I don't believe what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said many voters, particularly women, had unfavorable
views of her merely because they had superficial information about
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the small groups I've been meeting with _ primarily of
women _ a lot of women become very skeptical, because they have an
idea in my mind of what I am going to be like,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
``They think I must kind of be carried around in some kind of a
chariot, with liveried servants, or something. So when they meet
me, and we start talking about what life is like, and what my
experiences have been like, we have an immediate bond.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not dispute the lament of her supporters that she has
run a timid and unadventurous campaign. She said she had made a
calculated decision to hold back until she learned the terrain of a
state where she had never lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural conclusion for some people to draw because I
deliberately set out to listen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring, she added: ``Look. I've had to learn how
to be a candidate. This is not something that, you know, I woke up
in July and went to Senator Moynihan's farm and said, `Here I am,
world, I'm a great candidate!' I've had to learn a lot.''

 McCAIN BASKS IN THE APPLAUSE, BUT THE WHISPERED PARTY LINE FAVORS (rk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ As long as the Republican of the Hour was
standing on a podium, the Republican Party of California was
standing right behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, after all, loves a winner. And Sen. John McCain of
Arizona was still glowing over his 19-point victory in the New
Hampshire primary on Tuesday, not to mention the $1.8 million his
campaign has raised over the Internet since then, as he gave the
keynote address at the California Republican Party convention here
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   So the state Republicans were mighty grateful hosts. They loudly
applauded his stump speech on campaign finance reform, laughed
heartily at his jokes about Arizona's water wars with California
and cheered his familiar nod to his fellow war veterans. They
described him as ``a great senator and a great man,'' as state
party chairman John McGraw did. They shook their heads in awe and
said the senator gives a mighty fine speech.
</P>
<P>
   But when McCain was out of earshot, the lobby gossip here at the
Hyatt Burlingame buzzed along the lines of how Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the presidential candidate of choice for most of the
state's party faithful, would put the upstart McCain in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is the size of San Jose,'' said Rhonda Brown,
president of the San Francisco Young Republicans. ``So I don't
think it says a lot about McCain that he won it. Almost everyone
here is for Gov. Bush. We've run out of buttons and bumper
stickers.''
</P>
<P>
   That McCain was the star attraction and that Steve Forbes also
made an appearance while Bush skipped the convention, was explained
with polite excuses and bent-over-backward understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tired; he had a rough couple of weeks,'' said Stephen
Fong, co-chairman of Bush's San Francisco campaign. ``We have to
keep it all in context. Bush plans many appearances here before
March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who sent his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, to speak
here for him on Friday night, was said to be resting, amid rumors
that his strategists were retooling his entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, who spoke to a room of about 600 delegates, less than
half of the convention, told the group that his brother ``was a
good man'' with bedrock conservative values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we have his brother here is huge,'' said Jon
Fleischman, the executive director of the California Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, saying the party would not offer him a prime
speaking slot, canceled his appearance at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a packed and energetic rally Saturday morning and McCain
posters and bumper stickers sprinkled throughout the audience at
the luncheon, McCain _ who described himself and his insurgent
campaign as ``just like Luke Skywalker, trying to get out of the
Death Star,'' still has his work cut out for him with California's
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 20 point lead in South Carolina, where the next primary
battle will be on Feb. 19, vanished after McCain's victory in New
Hampshire, and a new Time/CNN poll released Saturday has him ahead
of Bush in South Carolina by four points. But Bush has led McCain
in California by as much as 40 points, and the insistent party line
here among the card-carrying Republican faithful was that not only
would Bush win South Carolina, but he would also take California,
with the most delegates of any state in the nation, on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because he's lying low for a few days doesn't mean a
thing,'' said Georgia Bottoms of Orange County, who described
herself as a stalwart supporter of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few attendees professed to be both diehard Republicans
and supporters of McCain. ``I'm an independent and McCain is an
independent, the most independent candidate I've ever seen,'' said
John Bradley of San Mateo. ``That's why I'm here. The Republicans
here are all part of the party establishment. The McCain supporters
are not.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain sensed any resistance to his candidacy or his message,
it did not show.
</P>
<P>
   His address was a condensed version of the same speech sounding
the same themes he has sketched over several months _ close
corporate loopholes and corporate welfare, reform the tax code, end
soft money campaign contributions _ but he also used the occasion
to rib Bush for ``not being able to attend'' and scolded him for
releasing new negative ads that attack McCain's sincerity in
lobbying for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding the crowd of President Ronald Reagan's ``11th
commandment, thou shall not speak ill of fellow Republicans,''
McCain suggested a 12th commandment: ``It's wise to obey the 11th
commandment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cannot compete in the arena of ideas, you should not be
running for president,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a news conference, when asked how he could talk about
campaign finance reform when he attended two private fund-raisers
in San Francisco in the morning, McCain said his staff knew the
particulars of the fund-raisers. ``I just showed up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who spoke here Saturday morning, took credit for
McCain's New Hampshire primary win. He contended that many New
Hampshire voters supported him but voted for McCain to send a
clearer message to Bush that they wanted independent leaders. He
did not say why he thought those voters needed to vote for McCain
to send that message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain momentum came as a way of stopping George Bush,''
Forbes said. ``That has been done and now voters are taking a fresh
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Forbes' comments later, McCain said, ``I forgot to
thank Steve!''

   WASHINGTON _ It was just about this time three years ago that
John Weaver, a tall, terse Texan, dragged Sen. John McCain from a
Senate Commerce Committee hearing to tell him he should run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a Republican political consultant from San Antonio, had
worked with McCain as field director of Sen. Phil Gramm's
short-lived presidential campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided that McCain, with his compelling personal
biography and maverick stances, had just the right resume for the
post-Clinton years. And perhaps more important, he thought the
Republican Party had lost its way and let President Clinton emerge
as the one who understood the concerns of middle-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Weaver nor McCain knew what they were on their way to
creating that day: a seat-of-the pants populist candidacy that has
turned the Republican Party establishment on its head and is now
threatening its chosen candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Now Weaver, 40, the constant brooding presence on the campaign
bus _ McCain impishly calls him Sunny because he is not _ is one of
a small band of Republican insiders who are helping McCain mount a
campaign that often seems to run on instincts, impulse and wit.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCain acknowledges surprise that he might be creating a
populist reform message that is somehow larger than the sum of its
parts. His New Hampshire primary upset _ if replicated elsewhere _
suggests that he has an appeal that stretches broadly across the
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we knew what we were trying to do,'' McCain
said. ``But we didn't realize that it was catching on.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a hard road ahead of McCain, and many potential
pitfalls. The senator's appeal is built on intangibles that include
a public infatuation with his personality and his gripping
biography.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the luster could fade as voters focus more on his policy
positions. Bush is already trying to tar him as a hypocrite on
campaign finance reform because he has accepted campaign donations
from lobbyists. And it may still turn out that Bush's money and
organization will kick in.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success so far has been a combination of some early
planning, some risks that paid off and some clever off-the-cuff
decision making. His gamble to skip Iowa and concentrate on New
Hampshire paid off spectacularly, as did his certainty that he
could generate a bonanza of media coverage through his
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also benefited from the strangely ineffective
campaign that the front-runner has conducted. Bush has seemed
diffident, and he has kept piling on endorsements even after signs
that they were backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   For now the McCain candidacy has hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain set out to create an insurgency,'' said William
Kristol, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and
editor of The Weekly Standard, ``but as often happens in these
situations, it's almost bigger than him and bigger than any of the
proposals. And it goes beyond his personal ambitions or
intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the first one in his circle to notice what was
happening was Mark Salter, his speechwriter and longtime Senate
administrative assistant, who saw the excitement grow in McCain's
New Hampshire crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me three or four times, `Look at the look in these
people's eyes,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's themes were meticulously planned from the
beginning _ the emphasis on character, national security expertise,
campaign finance overhaul and the devotion of much of the budget
surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the populist tones of the campaign arose from snap
decisions made along the way, like McCain's antic appearance before
the Russian consulate accusing New York Republicans of acting like
apparatchiks seeking to preserve a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt was dreamed up the day before by Mike Murphy, McCain's
bomb-throwing senior strategist, as a way of fighting the party's
effort to keep McCain off the ballot for the state's primary. The
candidate loved it.
</P>
<P>
   And no one quite expected McCain's campaign bus, ``Straight Talk
Express,'' to become a symbol in itself of his live-off-the-land
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus just kind of evolved,'' Weaver said. ``I'm a big
believer in bus tours. John wanted to have the press with him, and
one thing led to another, and it became a tradition that
unfortunately I don't think we could ever stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, McCain's media consultant, said simply: ``We were
trying to win. We are creating a new party in the process of trying
to win.'' He said, ``There wasn't this overt decision on the part
of the campaign six months ago to try to create McCain
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   What is threatening to the Republican Party is that McCain in
many ways is running against its congressional leadership, against
its big-business wing and against some of its conservative allies,
groups like Americans for Tax Reform and the National Right to Life
Committee, which have both run advertisements against him. He tars
all of them as the Washington establishment that has lost touch
with the people.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unlikely group of battle-scarred veterans from
across the spectrum of the Republican Party who are helping McCain
do this. And they are hardly outsiders. Rick Davis, 42, the
campaign manager, is a Washington lobbyist and merchant banker
known as a fund-raising whiz, who has close ties to the same
business establishment that McCain likes to rail against.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 37, is known for some of the most rough-edged
commercials in the business and has worked for clients as diverse
as Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey and Oliver North. He did not
join the McCain campaign formally until Lamar Alexander had dropped
out of the race, because he had been with Alexander in 1996 and
remained loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 51, the media consultant, began his political career as
chief of staff to former Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey, and he worked
for the presidential campaign of Bob Dole. Bill McInturff, 46,
McCain's pollster, was Dole's pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Salter, 44, is the McCain loyalist who helped write McCain's
autobiography. Weaver was once the executive director of the Texas
Republican Party and has counted 11 senators as his political
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us came together for different reasons,'' Weaver said,
``but we're unified in thinking the party has to change its way.
We've lost two national elections and are in danger of losing
Congress.''

</P>
<P>
   McCain, 63, had been intrigued by the idea of running for
president, ever since he accompanied his friend Bob Dole on the
campaign trail in 1996, acting as what he calls Dole's designated
smiler. He says his role was to sit in front of Dole in audiences
and to grin as a way of trying to remind the candidate not to look
so dour.
</P>
<P>
   He made his decision to run in December 1998. From the start his
campaign emphasized his character and extraordinary experience as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, to distinguish him from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This laid the groundwork for what could have been a fairly
traditional Republican campaign, appealing to conservative voters
through the emphasis on a strong military and on military
traditions of honor and patriotism. Dole, who had been grievously
wounded in World War II, had himself sometimes emphasized his
biography and had certainly tried to run against Clinton's
character.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also had in his quiver of issues his Senate crusade
to overhaul the campaign finance law. His aides were concerned that
this would not resonate with the voters, and they hoped to persuade
him to play it down.
</P>
<P>
   But when they tested it in the polling they used to start the
campaign, they were surprised to find that in four critical primary
states, 60 percent of Republican voters said a change in the
finance system was important. Only 15 percent said it was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that John would talk about it,'' Weaver said. ``We
didn't think he should stress it. So we had to eat a lot of crow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also McCain himself, his aides say, who decided early on
that he wanted to depart from the tax-cutting wing of his party
that advocated supply-side economics and put more of an emphasis on
using the budget surplus for Social Security and debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   His plans to make this point last spring were disrupted when the
U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia began and McCain decided he would not
formally announce his candidacy during a military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain returned to the Social Security issue this winter, making
it a critical point of distinction between him and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nature of the McCain campaign was developed because
of his comparative lack of money, which forced some unorthodox
thinking. Murphy remembers gathering with McCain and a few aides in
1998 in his Senate office. He pulled out his laptop computer full
of slides and data and argued for 40 minutes that the senator
should save money by skipping the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who had also been courted sporadically by Elizabeth
Dole's campaign, then built an organization that was lean by
presidential standards, allowing as much money as possible to be
put into television advertising. The small number of his staff _
McCain has 65 full-time aides, compared with about 180 for Bush _
has been evident at times in the campaign's inability to turn out
polished position papers.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also made the campaign flexible and able to change
gears fast. Earlier this year, for example, after reading in a
newspaper that minority journalists felt insulted that Bush had
turned down an invitation to stop by their convention, McCain
decided to toss out his schedule and go to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's populist, establishment-bashing tones have come
in reaction to the Bush campaign and the establishment opposition
to him. He would not have been making gleeful attacks on the New
York Republican leaders if they had not tried to keep him off the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the establishment pushes, he pushes back,'' Murphy said.
``Weighing in as they have, they've created some of this. There's
poetic justice in all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a vindication of McCain's effort, a federal judge
put McCain on the ballot in all New York counties and ruled that
two requirements for circulating nominating petitions, the crux of
McCain's complaint, were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   At moments, members of McCain's inner circle have started to
fear the populism of their own campaign. On the stump, McCain began
skewering Bush's tax plan as too tilted to the rich after he read a
magazine article that made that analysis. But when the campaign
weighed whether to put that line of argument into a commercial,
aides say there was a debate about whether to go forward with a
class-warfare tactic that is usually more the province of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants in the discussion, Vin Weber, a
lobbyist who is a member of McCain's informal kitchen cabinet,
opposed the move. Davis wanted any decision to run the
advertisement to be made deliberately and carefully. Weaver, Murphy
and Stevens were all for it. The commercial was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   And as McCain's campaign goes on, its rebel spirit is only
growing stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Salter joined McCain's Senate staff after working for Jeane
Kirkpatrick, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He
does not have the profile of a rabble-rouser, but on the night of
the New Hampshire primary, when McCain promised to ``break the
Washington iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and legislation,''
Salter was in the audience shouting, ``Burn it down.''

ANALYSIS: PATTERNS HARD TO FIND IN AIRLINE ACCIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS statistics in 10th graf) 
(bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ The mechanical problem that led to the
crash of the Alaska Airlines jet here Jan. 31 was unusual to the
point of being unprecedented. But that is the problem with many
high-profile crashes lately: The pattern of recent accidents is
that there is no pattern.
</P>
<P>
   It may take months to find out exactly what happened to the
plane, an MD-83 carrying 88 passengers and crew members. But it is
already evident that the plane had some kind of failure, which
became progressively worse as it cruised from Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, until the crew could not control it. Crashes that begin in
the cruise phase of flight are very rare, as are mechanical
difficulties that cannot be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, airliner crashes themselves are very
rare. With years of progress in engines, navigation and control
systems, and with better training and procedures, many of the types
of crashes that were once common are now unusual. There was only
one airliner crash in 1999, in Little Rock, Ark., and the year
before there were none, meaning that the drive to and from the
airports was more risky than the flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a pile of accident risks, with the most risky at the
top, and the most remote at the bottom,'' said Anthony Broderick, a
former director of aircraft certification at the Federal Aviation
Administration. ``Obviously, everybody in the industry works at the
top first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of decades, we took the pile away,'' he
said, or at least the top of the pile, the high-risk part. What is
left, Broderick and others said, are the crashes that were rare to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Matthews, the chairman and president of the Flight Safety
Foundation, which publishes accident statistics and reports, said
that ``in North America, airline accidents tend to be rather
random,'' and when they do occur, they tend to be ``because of
something nobody ever thought about before.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800, for example, exploded in flight in an incident
that many experts did not think was possible until it happened. The
Boeing 747, which crashed off Long Island, N.Y., in July 1996, had
an explosive atmosphere in its center fuel tank that engineers did
not believe existed, combined with wiring problems that few had any
inkling of.
</P>
<P>
   Valujet Flight 592, which came down in the Florida Everglades
because of a fire in a cargo compartment, was well-protected
against such incidents, according to its designers, who made the
compartment air-tight and assumed that any fire would die when it
used up the available oxygen. But the airliner was carrying oxygen
generators, which were misdescribed and packaged incorrectly,
without safety caps to keep them from operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would ever have thought somebody would one day mislabel
the package, never put the safety caps on them, throw them into a
rough box and put them in to a hold full of things that would
burn?'' Matthews said. ``There are so many minute probabilities in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still some accidents involving familiar causes, like
pilot errors. Examples are those involving the American Airlines
jet that landed in a thunderstorm at Little Rock last June and ran
off the end of the runway and the American Airlines jet that hit a
mountain on its way to Cali, Colombia, in December 1994. And many
people have died in runway collisions, &UR;  &LR; including a total of 582 in
the crash of two Boeing 747s in the Canary Islands in 1977, with
the FAA reporting a worrisome level of cases in which planes
mistakenly taxied into the paths of others.
</P>
<P>
   But experts believe there will eventually be a solution to the
problem of collisions on the ground. And as technology and training
improve and other causes of airline accidents decline, the unusual
ones become a larger percentage of the total, like the crash of
EgyptAir Flight 900, in which an apparently sound Boeing 767
crashed into the Atlantic in what many investigators believe was a
pilot suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people like the FAA, the Safety Board and the airline
safety people do their job extremely well,'' said Charles N.
Eastlake, a professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University, in Daytona Beach, Fla., ``then the
possibility certainly exists that they will find and successfully
control most of the systemic causes.''
</P>
<P>
   And when that happens, Eastlake said, ``freak accidents will end
up being the predominant thing.'' And they will get more frequent,
he said, as the number of flights grows. With the airlines in this
country flying six billion miles a year, there are lots of chances
for the one-in-a-million event to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or two, the Safety Board will lay out the cause of
the Alaska Airlines crash in excruciating detail. Soon after, or
possibly even before the conclusions are drawn up, the FAA will
propose changes to eliminate the possibility of a repetition.
Months or years after that, the rules will take effect, and within
five years or so from now, all the companies that operate
MD-80-series airplanes, and possibly similar ones like the DC-9,
will make the required changes. A repetition will be extremely
unlikely. But the initial event was hardly likely, either.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a White House commission on aviation safety and security
set a goal of reducing the accident rate by 80 percent within 10
years. The idea did not come out of the FAA, where some experts
doubt it is achievable. But it is certainly more achievable than
the goal of zero accidents set by Federico F. Pena, in 1995, when
he was the secretary of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Airlines crash may turn out to have been preventable.
But it may be, Matthews said, that the aviation accident rate is
like the bar in a limbo dance. It can go lower and lower, but it
cannot touch the floor.

Oklahoma State gets revenge against Texas A&AMP;M
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
STILLWATER, Okla. _ You know what they say about payback. Well, it
was all that and then some for Texas A&AMP;M on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the Aggies upset Oklahoma State at College
Station, they were trounced 87-55 at Gallagher-Iba Arena. The
Cowboys didn't make the mistake of taking the Aggies lightly again.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (18-2 overall, 7-1 in the Big 12) more than
avenged its only conference loss. Several Cowboys said before the
game they would gain motivation from the way they said some of the
Aggies (6-14, 2-7) behaved during the 64-59 upset Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The two players who were quoted in Oklahoma papers about the
alleged Texas A&AMP;M attitude at Reed Arena hurt the Aggies the most
Saturday. Glendon Alexander led the Cowboys with 25 points on
8-of-9 shooting, including 6-of-7 from 3-point range. Desmond Mason
had 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   According to those two players, the Aggies and their fans, who
stormed the court after the stunning win two weeks ago, didn't show
proper respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out there talking mumbo jumbo,'' Alexander said of
last month's game. ``So they got their little victory. We respect
them, but they don't respect us. First of all, I thought it was a
disrespect to us, and it's too early in the season to jump up and
down like they won the national championship. They're far away from
winning a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mason: ``They ran their mouth the whole time, and they
call us overrated and all that jive.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 13-ranked Cowboys lived up to their billing Saturday.
They raced to a 7-0 lead and were ahead 24-6 seven minutes into the
game. Mason had 10 points and Alexander eight during the early
barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At breakfast this morning, (assistant) coach (Jimmy) Williams
told me that I'd have to back up my words I said in the
newspaper,'' Alexander said. ``We came out and played the way we
should have played down there. I don't think we played hard there.
Today, we came out and jumped on them from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies, meanwhile, lost their fourth straight game since
their win over Oklahoma State. Senior forward Aaron Jack scored the
Aggies' first six points and led the team with 14 points and 10
rebounds. In his last five games, Jack has hit 21 of 25 shots and
is averaging 15.3 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out with a great deal of emotion and fire,'' Jack
said. ``I'm sure they wanted a little bit of revenge on us. They're
as good _ if not better _ than anybody we've played, especially
when they hit their shots like they did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys connected on 51.6 percent from the field, including
12-of-23 from 3-point range. A&AMP;M, meanwhile, hit 33.8 percent
overall and was 4-of-21 from beyond the arc. Freshman guard Bernard
King, who had 17 points in the Aggies' win over OSU, had eight
points Saturday on a 3-of-20 effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really motivated to play these guys,'' Mason said.
``That loss really hurt us. We could have been undefeated (in the
Big 12) and in the Top 10 in the nation. We slipped up, but you
can't take anything away from them. They played their butts off
down there. We just took it to heart to come out and play better
than we did the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   By midway through the first half, the outcome wasn't in
question. Oklahoma State had a 35-13 lead and was on its way to a
48-25 halftime lead. One week ago, the Cowboys led Baylor by 21
points at halftime but let up in the second half, raising the ire
of coach Eddie Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Cowboys merely piled it on some more. They had a
10-2 run to start the second half o go ahead 58-27. After the
Aggies cut the lead to 60-38 with 11:45 left, Oklahoma State ripped
off a 20-2 run that turned this one into an unqualified rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they realized we blew a game down at A&AMP;M,'' Sutton
said. ``I think if you play that game 20 times, we'd win 19 times.
At this point, we could be 8-0 and have everybody chasing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys are tied with Missouri and Iowa State for
the conference lead. They begin a tough stretch of their schedule
when they host Kansas on Monday. After that, four of their next
five games are on the road _ at Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri and Iowa
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking anything away from the teams we've defeated,
but the difference in the schedule coming up is like night and
day,'' Alexander said. ``This is what it comes down to if we want
to be the Big 12 champs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Aggies, their season seems to be spinning out of
control. They miss the senior leadership of Jerald Brown, who
suffered a broken hand against Iowa State on Jan. 26 and will miss
at least three more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't played well since then (Jan. 22),'' said A&AMP;M
coach Melvin Watkins. ``Our rotation is off, and we have different
guys doing some different things. We just have to make it through
this season. These young kids are giving us the best they can do
right now. They won't be freshmen forever.''

EX-OFFICIAL KEEPS PENTAGON'S CLEARANCE AFTER LOSS OF CIA'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (DELETES ``classified'' from 9th graf) 
 (js) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the former director of central
intelligence, John Deutch, had his security clearances revoked by
the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency, he has kept a security
clearance at the Pentagon, a senior Defense Department official
says.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's intelligence clearances were revoked last year because
he had violated security rules by keeping classified information on
computers at his house that were connected to the Internet, making
them vulnerable to entry by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not taken similar action in part because it has
not been given the CIA's report that resulted in the action against
Deutch, the Defense Department official said. The Pentagon asked
for the report some time ago, the official said, but he added that
he did not know exactly when.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's case has received considerable attention since it was
revealed last week that the CIA's inspector general had concluded
that top officials impeded an internal investigation into Deutch's
case. In addition, members of Congress have questioned why Deutch
was treated differently from Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at a weapons
laboratory who has been accused of keeping nuclear secrets on an
unsecure computer.
</P>
<P>
   The current director of central intelligence, George Tenet, came
under heavy questioning about his handling of the matter in two
days of testimony last week. Tenet said Deutch's behavior was
different because there was no evidence that he had intended to aid
a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet acknowledged that his agency had been slow in notifying
Congress and the Justice Department about Deutch's case. But in two
days of congressional testimony, Tenet did not mention that Deutch
had been allowed to keep a Pentagon security clearance. The
Pentagon disclosed it in answer to questions by The Washington
Post, which reported it on Saturday.

   The clearance is a limited one, a Pentagon official said, what
he called an ``industrial clearance.'' It allows Deutch to work on
specific Defense Department contracts for Raytheon, SAIC Corp. and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Deutch teaches.
The Pentagon official said the clearance did not give Deutch access
to a wide range of intelligence information. Deutch was the deputy
secretary of defense, the No. 2 position at the Pentagon, from 1994
until May 1995, when he was confirmed as director of central
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to become secretary of defense in President Clinton's
second term, and when he did not get that post, he stepped down as
head of the CIA in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Under agency regulations, Deutch should have turned over the
computers he had at his home. He told the agency he wanted to keep
them to conduct personal banking, and he was allowed to keep them
only after he managed to be hired as a consultant to the agency. In
a visit to Deutch's home, in December 1996, CIA security officials
found classified documents on the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a follow-up investigation, Deutch's security clearances
were revoked by Tenet, denying him access to a wide range of
intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges and issues at hand were very serious,'' Tenet
testified on Thursday in explaining why he had revoked Deutch's
security clearances. ``I took a tough decision to indefinitely
suspend John's clearances.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of a reciprocal arrangement with the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Deutch also lost his security clearance there,
the Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutch kept the more limited security clearance. The
Pentagon official said a higher standard of proof was required
before this clearance could be revoked, partly, he said, because it
affected Deutch's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Pentagon had no evidence that Deutch had
violated any security regulations when he had been at the Pentagon,
and that the Pentagon had not seen the CIA's evidence. As a result,
he said, there was no basis for revoking Deutch's industrial
clearance.

<P>
   TORONTO _ They're not exactly dinosaurs, Ray Bourque and Steve
Yzerman, but in the new-age National Hockey League, where players
can change teams several times, Bourque and Yzerman are certainly
unusual in having had the same professional addresses for 21 and 17
years, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepared to participate in Sunday's 50th NHL All-Star
Game, both said they wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to me. Detroit has become my home,'' said
Yzerman. ``I've been fortunate to play in a city that's a pretty
good hockey city with a good background, and the team is supported
well. I've been fortunate to stay in a city like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think over the course of history there were that many
guys who stuck with their team, but every few years, there are one
or two guys who do. Once Ray and myself retire and (New Jersey
defenseman) Ken Daneyko, there will be a couple of other guys who
will stay with their team. A lot of it has to do with luck and
timing more so than anything you really do good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he and Yzerman have been the elder statesmen of
their respective clubs for some time now and that it has taken a
combination of commitment from the clubs and commitment from the
players to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll have the odd guy who will be able to hook up
and play with one team, but it's got to be both ways,'' said
Bourque. ``You've got the have the team that wants to keep you, and
the player has got to like the situation where he is. With free
agency and the business side of it now, it makes it a little easier
to move around.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players have watched the game change. There have been
alterations to the rules, an update of the All-Star format, an
evolution of styles, and an influx of talented players from
overseas who have helped redefine what the NHL is in 2000. All-Star
weekend also has changed from simply a showcase for the league's
best players to an extravaganza. The pomp and circumstance are
fine, said Yzerman, but the main event could be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten a lot more commercial and become more of an event
than just a game,'' said Yzerman. ``It's more of a promotional tool
for hockey. I think the festivities itself have gotten better, but
the game itself needs to improve. I think there are too many guys.
We've got five lines and eight defensemen and three goalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, there's not enough room on the bench for
everyone. We all complain about four lines _ not that I'm
complaining about ice time in the All-Star Game yet _ but with five
lines, it just makes it difficult to get the tempo of the game up.
I played my first one in 1984. I remember it wasn't a Stanley Cup
playoff game, but it was a pretty entertaining game and a pretty
competitive game for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman said overall the NHL now has become more
offensive-minded after a few seasons in which defense ruled. Back
in 1995, the Red Wings were smothered in four games during the
Stanley Cup finals by the stingy New Jersey Devils when the
neutral-zone trap was at its height. Yzerman is happy to see the
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become more _ I don't want to say wide open because it's
probably not wide open _ but the tempo of the game has picked up
from a couple of years ago,'' he said. ``Defensive-type hockey kind
of peaked or, depending on how you look at it, bottomed out, with
so many one-goal games. It's gone on the upswing and become more
offensive-minded. It reached a peak a few years ago where, man, it
was all defense. It was, `Don't worry about scoring but let's not
give up a scoring chance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Yzerman said, the strategy is to create offense, increase
the number of scoring chances, and encourage defensemen to get
involved in the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one or two teams start doing it, it's entertaining and it
catches on more and more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's festivities, Yzerman and Bourque will head back
to their home cities as the regular-season stretch run begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me _ and for Steve, I'm sure _ it's the same thing, it's
all we know,'' said Bourque of his long tenure in black and gold
and Yzerman's in red and white. ``It's the way we wanted it. I'd
like to have his two Stanley Cups, but it's what we wanted, and for
us it's been right. I know for me it's been right.''

NFL TACKLES IMAGE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Leno says the National Football League has a tough new
penalty for accused killers. ``Next time a player commits murder _
20 yards,'' Leno cracked recently on the ``Tonight'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's laughing at NFL headquarters, though, now that two
stars _ Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis and Carolina receiver Rae
Carruth _ have been charged with murder in the last seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They were merely the most recent additions to a growing rap
sheet of crimes ranging from vehicular homicide to assault to
burglary to drug trafficking that has produced a widespread
perception of NFL players as millionaire thugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely has presented an extraordinary image problem
for the NFL,'' said Richard Lapchick, executive director of
Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society.
``They have to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Lewis was accused of stabbing two men outside of an
Atlanta nightclub hours after last Sunday's Super Bowl, the league
was concerned about its players' off-field behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The first question put to commissioner Paul Tagliabue at his
annual state-of-the-league press conference concerned the recent
spate of violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is partly a product of society, but that is not where we
let it rest,'' said Tagliabue. ``We don't tolerate and we don't
condone misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the NFL announced a crackdown on off-field
violence. That came around the same time that ``Pros and Cons: The
Criminals Who Play in the NFL,'' an expose written by Jeff Benedict
and Don Yaeger, found that a fifth of the 500 players investigated
(roughly a third of the league) had criminal histories.
</P>
<P>
   While the NFL claimed that arrests for violent crimes had been
halved during the last two years, there has been an upsurge during
the past season.
</P>
<P>
   Two off-duty female Buffalo police officers claimed they were
roughed up by three present and former Bills players. New York Jets
tackle Jumbo Elliott was charged with assaulting two people in a
bar. Denver receiver Rod Smith was booked for assaulting his
common-law wife, and teammate Darrius Johnson with punching a
topless dancer. Miami running back Cecil Collins was jailed after
breaking into a woman's bedroom. Last week, Carolina running back
Fred Lane was arrested on drug and weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional football players are a segment of society,'' said
Charley Armey, general manager of the St. Louis Rams, the Super
Bowl champions. ``If you put 100 people on a curve between the very
best and very worst persons, you're going to have some of the
worst. If you looked up the percentage of players committing crimes
and that of everybody else, they'd probably be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to research by APBnews.com, a Web site
specializing in crime issues, the percentage of NFL players with
criminal histories is one-third less than the rate for adult males
under 30.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the charges against NFL players were later dropped,
league officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between being charged and found guilty,''
says George Young, the NFL's senior vice president for football
operations. ``A lot of times the players are charged because
they're identifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was supposed to start in Sunday's Pro Bowl,
reportedly was one of a group of eight people involved in a street
brawl in Atlanta that led to the deaths of two men. His lawyer
insisted that he was merely a ``horrified bystander'' and his
limousine driver reportedly said that Lewis was not the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, everyone from friends to league officials conceded that
Lewis had put himself in a precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong place, wrong time, wrong people,'' said Ed Reynolds, the
NFL's assistant director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   Though some players have been involved in violence against women
_ Carruth is charged with conspiring to have his pregnant
girlfriend killed by three other men in a drive-by shooting _ more
have been involved in incidents that appear to be byproducts of
money and celebrity showered on young men from unstable
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are like everyone else from a similar demographic
background,'' said Harry Edwards, a sociology professor at the
University of California-Berkeley. ``They have all of the same
problems, all of the same virtues, all of the same challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, he said, is that the players are
``uncredentialed millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else do you find a group of people like that with no
family financial history?'' said Edwards, who has worked on player
programs for the San Francisco 49ers for a dozen years. ``They have
a unique one-shot earning capability. We're talking about people
from working-class and lower-class backgrounds who are high-profile
celebrities by the age of 22 or 23.''
</P>
<P>
   The money and fame arrive virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no preparation for them to have that kind of
wealth,'' said Pete Carroll, the former Patriots coach who dealt
with multiple off-field incidents during his three years with the
club. ``With all the advice they get from the league, the clubs,
the agents, and everybody else, it's still a license to make big
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in college, where scholarship athletes are closely
monitored, required to attend classes and study halls, and usually
live in special dorms, NFL players are on their own as soon as
practices or games end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different in college, where a player has much more
structure and has to answer the school bell,'' said Young. ``In the
pros, there's a lot more free time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier day, when younger players were paid like
apprentices and treated that way, older players set the
disciplinary tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was playing, most teams had a core of veterans who had
been with them for 10, 12, 14 years,'' said Reynolds, who played
linebacker for the Patriots for nine seasons. ``They would educate
the new guys on the dos and don'ts. With free agency and the salary
cap, teams can't afford a core of those guys now.''
</P>
<P>
   Talented rookies now routinely become immediate starters with
movie-star contracts and visibility. But many find it difficult to
break ties to familiar neighborhoods, friends, and amusements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys have problems saying no to a lifestyle
that is no longer possible for them,'' said Ken Landphere, an
Atlanta agent who, with partner Ray Anderson, represents two dozen
NFLers.
</P>
<P>
   Cash and celebrity are magnets for a variety of followers, not
all of them savory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players attract a lot of hangers-on who say: I want to be
you,'' says Armey. ``There are a lot of Mini-Mes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like rappers and rock stars, more than a few NFL players live
the lifestyle of entertainers, dropping by night spots with a
coterie. Many of the recent criminal incidents involved assaults at
clubs and bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are high-strung athletes who are very competitive,''
said Armey. ``You put them at a party, mix in a few drinks and
somebody challenges them, and you're going to have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL and its clubs lecture players annually on everything
from drugs to alcohol to venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is pound away with information,'' says Carroll.
``But people still smoke cigarettes. People still do drugs. How
much can you bombard them?
</P>
<P>
   ``The league makes a statement by getting the rookies together
and giving them an indoctrination. But if a guy's going to do
something, he's going to do something. I don't think 20 years of
upbringing is going to be changed by a couple of seminars.''
</P>
<P>
   A seven-figure contract does not change a player's background,
his family or his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have examples in the league where one brother is on the
football field and another is on death row,'' said Edwards. ``One
brother is doing 25-30 years in prison, another is in the Pro Bowl.
That is a constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand that you just can't dismiss all of that.
You can't just say, how do these multimillionaires blow it all?
It's not that simple a world. How can you say, `Don't hang out with
the wrong people?' In many instances the wrong people are Mom, Dad,
a brother, a cousin, or a next-door neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   At the league's annual scouting combine, where potential
draftees are weighed, measured, drilled, and grilled, clubs also
check criminal records and do psychological testing to identify
likely troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can almost tell you there'll be six or eight guys a year we
won't touch because of their personal backgrounds,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL does its own background checks on players and will
furnish information to clubs when asked. But officials acknowledge
that they have no way to predict or control which of them will end
up on police blotters _ or charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not,''
Tagliabue said. ``Can we prepare when a player such as a Rae
Carruth is going to have a problem? Of course not. We can't prepare
that any more than others in society can prepare that students are
going to shoot other students, or that workers are going to shoot
other workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Carruth's background led NFL teams to believe he
would be a problem. If anything, they were concerned that Carruth
wouldn't be physical enough. ``Good blocking effort,'' one scout
wrote, ``but he's not a killer.''

SCARNECCHIA PASSES SURVIVAL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dante Scarnecchia should wear a life vest when he goes to work,
because he's a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where assistant coaches get fired before and after
the head coach, Scarnecchia has survived six regimes in New England
over 17 years, including the latest debacle under Pete Carroll. He
has survived the comings and the goings of Ron Meyer, Raymond
Berry, Dick MacPherson, Bill Parcells, and Carroll, and now the
ascendancy of Bill Belichick. Survived and more. Survived and
thrived.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, when Parcells first came to New England Scarnecchia
survived by the thinnest of margins when, unbeknownest to him,
three of Parcells's longtime assistants went to bat for him. He was
retained with the innocuous title of special assistant. It was a
job well below his qualifications and talents, but he accepted it
because he had kids in school and a wife who was happy here and
because, frankly, he was happy, too. He wanted to do a good job, a
fact that has impressed one boss after another.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he woke up last week to find himself assistant boss not
long after he figured he'd be joining about 100 other NFL coaches
scrambling to find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Parcells was very good to me,'' said Scarnecchia, the
Patriots' new assistant head coach. ``The job he gave me in 1993
was probably less than my qualifications demanded but he paid me
well for doing it. He was extremely fair to me and a year later he
changed the title even though the job was the same, probably to
make it sound better.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarnecchia was named defensive assistant/linebackers coach for
1995 and 1996 and spent one of those seasons sitting in the press
box next to Belichick, who last week not only retained Scarnecchia
from Carroll's staff but elevated him. His position is not quite
the same as being a heartbeat from the presidency, but for a guy
trying to survive in a business where unemployment and moving vans
are staples, it is a remarkable turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Scarnecchia recently talked to Paul Boudreau, the line coach who
was fired by Carroll and coincidentally replaced by Scarnecchia,
only to move on to Miami and a team that made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kidding him,'' said Scarnecchia, ``that supposedly he
got screwed up here and he sells his house for a huge profit, moves
into a bigger house, gets a raise, and goes to the playoffs while
I'm looking at getting fired. It's a funny business.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that. It is a business where good coaches get fired as
often as bad ones, a business where no one stays anywhere for long
and few stay in one spot for 17 years, as Scarnecchia has. Even
fewer go from special assistant to assistant head coach in seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened, and Belichick had good reasons for
making that move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see myself having a relationship with someone else
that would be better than with Dante,'' Belichick said. ``I didn't
have to interview 20 other guys to know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart football coach. He has good judgment. I like his
demeanor and his intensity but he also has a calmness about him.''
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he also has the eye, as Belichick learned
sitting next to him throughout the Patriots' 1996 Super Bowl
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the press box together that whole year,'' Belichick
said. ``Up there there's very little time. You see a play, get
information, and make a decision within seconds. He's the best I've
ever been with in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something would happen and I'd ask what it was and he'd say
and sometimes you go back on Monday and review the film and that
wasn't it. When Dante said something happened, that's what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dante is very well-respected by most everyone I've come in
contact with and he has such a wealth of experience with this team.
He will be a great resource for the other coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   While Scarnecchia will continue to coach the offensive line, he
also will have a new role. If things go as Belichick hopes, he will
be a mediator between player and head coach and even between
assistant coach and head coach. He will be a sounding board for
some, an advocate for others, and a bearer of bad news for a few.
That is all part of the job he's been handed, one Belichick decided
after his experiences in Cleveland is a necessity in this day of
compartmentalized, high-ego football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the experience of doing that job,'' Belichick said.
``I've had players and coaches come to me rather than go to Bill
(Parcells) and then I decided whether to take that to the head
coach or tell them there was another way to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the assistant head coach is a little more
approachable than the head coach, depending on his mood that day. I
value Dante's judgment in those situations and I'll give him the
authority to handle a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had it to do over again, I would have had someone in that
position in Cleveland. There are so many times the head coach is in
meetings or tied up with other things when decisions have to be
made. It slows down the rest of the staff not to have someone who
can make those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   That person in New England will be Dante Scarnecchia, survivor
for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Because he can coach.
</P>
<P>
   Swann dive
</P>
<P>
   Every year when ex-Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Lynn Swann
doesn't get voted into the Hall of Fame, people are surprised. Many
are surprised for the simplest reason: They assume he's already in
the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Swann was the best and most acrobatic receiver on a Steeler team
that won four Super Bowls and may well have been the greatest team
ever assembled. Although he played only nine seasons and was hardly
used in the first and last of those years, he was a devastating
game-breaker in Pittsburgh's glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Swann missed again this year for the same reason he has before:
Too many of the 38 voters don't understand that football is more
than a game of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Swann had 336 receptions and scored 51 touchdowns in 115 games,
an average of 2.6 catches per game. Those numbers are accurate but
they are not the real story of Lynn Swann.
</P>
<P>
   The real story is that he scored a league-high 11 touchdowns in
1975, the Steelers' first Super Bowl year, and was the Super Bowl
MVP. He once held a Super Bowl record with 364 career receiving
yards (surpassed by San Francisco's Jerry Rice), including 161 in
one game. Swann averaged 22.8 yards a catch in Super Bowls, third
all-time.
</P>
<P>
   In his five AFC title game appearances, Swann had 15 catches and
his team won four times. He was a little man who was biggest in the
biggest games, and he was one of the major reasons Terry Bradshaw,
Franco Harris, and several other Steelers are in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best evidence of his abilities, though, is that it
was Lynn Swann whom the Oakland Raiders' secondary kept trying to
knock out.
</P>
<P>
   Not John Stallworth (who also should be in the Hall of Fame, by
the way).
</P>
<P>
   Not Franco Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Swann.
</P>
<P>
   That they often succeeded _ including once when Swann was about
40 yards from the ball and still got assaulted by George Atkinson _
is why he played only nine years. It is also why he keeps failing
to get the 80 percent of the votes he needs, because those who
oppose him mention that he didn't play long enough (even though
Gale Sayers played less) or that he would have the second-fewest
number of receptions of any Hall of Fame receiver.
</P>
<P>
   When they say these things, they forget the larger picture. They
forget why his career was short and his numbers thin in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   The intransigent opposition of a few to Swann's candidacy
ultimately led longtime Steeler broadcaster Myron Cope to quit the
Hall board in disgust. Veteran NFL writer Vito Stellino, who
covered all of the great Steeler teams before moving on to
Baltimore, said last week, ``As great as Jerry Rice and Don Hutson
were _ and they were probably the two greatest receivers in history
_ I'd take Swann and Stallworth and let you have them and let's
play the game. They were such fierce competitors I'd like my team's
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders understood that. They understood Swann was the heart
of the Steeler offense, despite all the other weapons. They knew
the Steelers were a different team without him, and so they went
after him and got him enough times that he suffered enough
concussions to end his career prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a reason to keep him out of the Hall of Fame. It's an
advertisement for why he should be there with those other Steelers,
Steelers who wouldn't have gotten there without him.
</P>
<P>
   It takes two
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Swann, how do the voters keep him and Stallworth out
and put Bradshaw in on the first ballot? That's no knock on
Bradshaw, but whom do they think was catching all of those passes?
. . . Word is, Belichick believes Chris Slade was not used to his
best advantage the past three years and will return to more pass
rushing duties, spending less time dropping into pass coverage . .
. Belichick has yet to decide whether he will open the year in a
3-4 or 4-3 front but said the techniques of his system remain the
same regardless of the front, so the alignment may not be as
significant as some believe. ``In 1997 and 1998 in New York, we
started with the 4-3 but we played most of the season in a 3-4,''
Belichick said. ``Within the system there's enough flexibility that
you can play either front with good flexibility. After we signed
Roman Phifer, it made us commit to the 3-4 in New York because of
the depth we had at linebacker. A certain player we might acquire
here could push us over the edge (and into a 3-4).'' . . . Newly
hired Patriot defensive line coach Randy Melvin of Purdue is a
graduate of the minority coaches program established by the NFL a
few years ago. He is a perfect example of what that system was
designed to achieve. He worked with the Jets during two training
camps, learning techniques and studying their system. During that
time, Belichick became impressed with him . . . There is a
widely-held assumption that switching quarterbacks in a game is
different from replacing any other player. This is partly because
of the way some positions are regularly involved in rotations.
Asked about that, Belichick laughed and said, ``I'm not sure that's
true. I've been with players and when you take them out I've heard
a lot of things said so it's not always the case that it's accepted
at other positions but not quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Which way on Galloway?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL Management Council and representatives of the Players
Association will decide Tuesday whether Seattle receiver Joey
Galloway will become an unrestricted free agent. Other than a date
for the hearing, little else has been decided, with the union
wanting a special master appointed and the Management Council
favoring a non-injury grievance arbitrator. The reason the sides
have argued so long is that if the league gets its wish, any
decision would be final but if a special master is used, the union
could appeal on Galloway's behalf. The Seahawks and the league are
arguing about whether Galloway fulfilled the last year of his
contract by playing only the final eight games of the season after
a lengthy holdout. It will be a precedent-setting decision. Other
holdouts ended up being traded or signed to new, long-term deals.
Galloway is the first to be fighting for free agency. The Seahawks
have been trying to trade Galloway but would retain his services
for a mere $1.6 million if they win the arbitration. If Galloway
wins, he could be retained only if the team had named him its
franchise player and agreed to pay him the average of the top five
receivers in the league, somewhere around $3.5 million . . . If
linebacker Ray Lewis's legal problems prevent him from returning to
the Ravens next season, weak-side linebacker Jamie Sharper may be
moved inside if a free agent replacement cannot be found. Since
Lewis is considered one of the best young middle linebackers in the
NFL, finding a replacement will not be easy. He signed a four-year,
$26 million deal in 1998 and stands to make $4.75 million in base
pay next season. If he is unavailable, the Ravens might go after
free agent Hardy Nickerson or Dallas's Randall Godfrey . . .
Despite the fact that bettors got their money back on the Super
Bowl because it was a push (neither team covered the spread),
Nevada's 147 legal sports books reportedly made six cents on every
dollar bet on the game. Thus the books won $4.2 million on the game
overall, up from $2.9 million in 1998. That was the return on a
total of $71 million bet on the game . . . Titans defensive back
Denard Walker has been unable to shake the effects of having been
beaten for the game-winning touchdown in the Super Bowl by Isaac
Bruce. Although Walker was in position to make the play, the ball
was slightly underthrown. Bruce got it, got by Walker as he slipped
trying to recover, and got into the end zone. ``It was like I could
feel him, I could touch him, and I saw him in my eyes the whole
time,'' Walker said. ``I was thinking, `He's not going to throw it
in there because I've got him.' As I looked back I noticed he went
underneath me and made a great play.'' Titans defensive coordinator
Gregg Williams believes that if Rams quarterback Kurt Warner had
made a good throw, the ball would have been caught _ by Walker.
``If the ball was thrown well, he probably picks it,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to his guns
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy intends to use the Pro Bowl to test
out his own offense. Although the Bucs have been plagued with
offensive woes for several years, Dungy does not believe it's the
system, so he intends to use the cream of the NFC to prove his
offense can score given the right talent. He spent all week running
the NFC's top offensive players through the offense to see if it
was productive. Even if it is, it didn't save the job of offensive
coordinator Mike Shula, who was fired by ownership over the protest
of Dungy . . . When new offensive coordinator Chan Gailey came in
to take over the Dolphins' offense, he did not exactly give aging
quarterback Dan Marino a ringing endorsement. ``I haven't even
looked at him, watched him play,'' Gailey said. ``If he decides to
play, that's fine. I'll coach who's here.'' Sounds like that may
not include Marino . . . Despite all the struggles last season, the
Cleveland brass believes the Browns can be 8-8 or better this
season. ``We would like to think we can play near .500 ball,'' said
club president Carmen Policy. ``With some luck, 9-7, which might
give us the oppportunity under the right circumstances to squeeze
our way into the playoffs.'' What did they put in the water in
Cleveland? . . . Sitting in a federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.,
watching the Super Bowl was Darryl Henley, who under other
circumstances might have been playing in the game. The 33-year-old
Henley was a starting Rams cornerback until he was arrested in 1993
on cocaine trafficking charges and later pleaded guilty to trying
to arrange the murder of the trial judge and a key witness who was
a former Rams cheerleader. He is in jail without parole until March
28, 2031, but was watching his old team win the championship last
Sunday. ``I'd never heard of this place,'' Henley said of Marion.
``I had no idea where it was and I got here and all they show on TV
are the Rams. I remember saying to myself, `God, now you're really
punishing me.' ''

SOME LESSONS LEARNED AND SOME TAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Fed up with stories about athletes
getting in trouble? No one could blame you. But what if the guilty
athlete actually admitted he screwed up? Wouldn't that be
different?
</P>
<P>
   Then meet Notah Begay. He deserves recognition for doing
something that is done far too infrequently. He didn't try to beat
the system. So there he was last Monday, standing in front of
dozens of youngsters at a golf course in Seaside, Calif., telling
them they could learn from his mistake. Begay didn't have to be in
front of those kids; he could have been playing practice rounds for
the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, tuning up for an opportunity to win
tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt like I had a responsibility to my fans and Native
Americans,'' said Begay, a two-time winner last year on the PGA
Tour, on which he is the only Native American.
</P>
<P>
   That Begay's story received national attention is a sad
commentary on our society, because all he did was do the right
thing. He was arrested three weeks ago in New Mexico, charged with
drunk driving after backing into a parked car in a parking lot.
Begay, 27, who played at Stanford along with Tiger Woods, went to
court the next day and not only pleaded guilty but also brought to
the judge's attention the fact that he should have been charged as
a two-time offender. There had been a drunk driving arrest in
Arizona a few years earlier, Begay offered.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were stunned, as was the judge, but Begay doesn't
want to be treated like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stand in front of a judge and be a hypocrite and be
sentenced for a first offense, when I knew it was a second
offense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge sentenced Begay to 364 days in jail, all but seven of
them suspended, fined him $1,000, and demanded he perform 48 hours
of community service. After Pebble Beach, Begay is scheduled to
complete the California swing with the Buick Invitational in San
Diego, the Nissan Open in Los Angeles, and the World Match Play in
Carlsbad. Then, Begay will fly to New Mexico and begin his jail
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably when I am flying home on the 27th I'll be going, `Why
the heck did I do this to myself?' '' said Begay, who captivated
the young crowd at Bayonet and Black Horse Golf Course with his
honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Begay said he isn't sure whether or not he is an alcoholic, but
he will look into getting professional help for his drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it's going to be easy,'' he said, ``but
as long as I focus on winning golf tournaments and refocus on
getting the most out of my game I think it is very, very feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids aren't dumb, kids are very bright, very receptive. They
can play video games that none of us can play. They've got
computers that none of us adults can operate. So they are very
bright. This is the time when they are most open to influence and
willing to hear someone that they actually look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance at Bayonet involved golf, with Begay giving
lessons. But he strayed from golf at times and talked about life
and how to avoid the temptations that are out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to be sensible and say no,'' he said. ``It's as
simple as that. It's just as simple as for me to get up and say I
did this, this, and this. I took the medicine and was held
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, where have we not heard that before?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart remembered
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion at the weekly Tour stop is always a
story, and that is no different at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am. But the story here is tinged with sadness, for the death of
Payne Stewart is still a painful daily burden carried by his
colleagues. ``You can't have a tournament this year without
honoring Payne Stewart,'' said Davis Love. ``I think it's going to
be in front of us this year, which is going to be good. It's going
to be something we are going to miss for a long, long time.''
Marshals are honoring Stewart's memory by wearing plus-fours and
the kind of golf cap that was his trademark, and a youth center
here was dedicated to his memory the other day. For many here, the
emotion will be relived in June when another event in which his
name is listed as defending champion _ the US Open _ comes to
Pebble Beach . . . Stewart's longtime caddie, Mike Hicks, is
working for Bob Estes this year, but neither is here at the AT&AMP;T.
Estes elected to play at the Greg Norman International in Sydney.
John Daly also chose the warmer climate of Australia, as did
Patrick Burke, whose PGA Tour career went off course a few years
ago with a series of hand injuries. He is Down Under trying to tune
up for a season on the Buy.com Tour . . . Norman proved a gracious
host at his event, missing the cut with rounds of 76-75. Also
missing the cut was Michael Campbell, who had been on quite a roll
with a couple of victories the last two months . . . There was a
virtual Stanford golf team reunion this week, much to the joy of
longtime Cardinal coach Wally Goodwin. Woods and Begay were in the
AT&AMP;T field, as was another teammate, Casey Martin. Joel Kribel, who
played a few years later, made it four pros in the competition.
When Michael Jordan chose not to compete, Woods put in the call for
an amateur partner he is comfortable with: Jerry Chang, his
Stanford roommate who played No. 3 for Goodwin. ``He's a good
player, a grinder,'' said Woods of the 4-handicap Chang. When asked
if he could club off of Chang, Woods had all he could do to stop
laughing. ``No, I can't club off of him.'' . . . However, Ken
Griffey Jr., who was paired with Mark O'Meara, is able to keep up
with Woods off the tee, though his short game needs work. On the
par-5 10th hole at Poppy Hills Thursday, the blue and white tees
were at the same spot, so there was a good indication of how far
these gents move it. Woods's drive had to go 360-370 yards; he had
just a pitching wedge into the green on a 511-yard hole. But Woods
hit third in the group, as Griffey was even longer . . . And as
long as Griffey is, John Elway is just as impressive _ when he
keeps it straight. He did hit a couple of houses during the Bob
Hope Chrysler Classic a few weeks ago . . . Length is something
people love to talk about, and if there is any doubt that it is a
necessary commodity on Tour, listen to Love: ``Length is now not an
advantage, it's a given. You better have it. Or you better have
something else that's really, really good to go with the rest of
your game.'' Love said he played with Rory Sabbatini and couldn't
believe what he was seeing. ``He's 6 inches shorter than me and
doesn't look that big, but he is just blowing it by me. And Scottie
McCarron is missing it by me. The younger guys are killing it.'' If
these are the thoughts of a guy who can hit it from one ZIP code to
another, imagine what the bunters _ those who can rip it only 275
yards _ are thinking . . . Mike Schmidt, the Hall of Fame third
baseman, received a sponsor's exemption into this weekend's Senior
PGA Tour event in Key Biscayne, Fla. Schmidt failed to earn his
card at Senior Q School last fall but isn't in it for laughs. ``I
shouldn't even be here if I didn't think there was a chance,'' said
Schmidt. ``If I said I was just trying not to embarrass myself,
that would be a crummy attitude.'' . . . Blast from the past: Mac
O'Grady tried to earn a spot in the AT&AMP;T but came up short in a
Monday qualifier. Former Massachusetts Open champ Steve Jurgensen
did earn a spot in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Fast cash
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Love passed Norman as the career money leader in PGA
Tour history, his $12,548,297 a testament ``to the fact I've been
out here a long time,'' said Love. He is a sensible sort, though,
so while he takes pride in the fact that he has been a consistent
force, Love knows that the prize money is totally out of whack
these days. How so? Consider that if Woods were to win this week's
AT&AMP;T and Love were to miss the 54-hole cut, the 24-year-old phenom
would move in as the all-time money leader. By year's end, Woods
should own the top spot after just 3 1/2 years as a pro golfer . .
. The Orchards Golf Club in South Hadley, Mass., continues to take
on a higher profile, which is good news for golfers who have yet to
discover this Donald Ross gem. The club is now operated by Arnold
Palmer Golf Management, which is overseeing renovations and
extending membership opportunities. Now comes further word that the
club will host the 2001 State Amateur . . . Apologies for a
three-putt bogey last week on the date of the Ouimet Scholarship
Fund dinner featuring Curtis Strange as guest speaker. It will be
March 22. For information, call 781-891-6400 . . . It is rather
comical to watch people react to weather at the AT&AMP;T, as if rain,
wind, and cold were new phenomena on the Monterey Peninsula.
Longtime observers swear that they used to play through this stuff,
and they love to remind one and all of the great comment made by
celebrity golfer Johnny (Tarzan) Weissmuller in 1960. ``I've never
been so wet in my life,'' said one of the world's greatest swimmers
after a round of golf in ``Crosby Weather.''

DALLAS IN BLUNDERLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a thought for the NBA's Board of Governors when they vote
on Mark Cuban's all-but-done acquisition of the Dallas Mavericks:
Put a picture of Dennis Rodman on the table and ask yourselves if
this is the guy you really want to join your club.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear what Cuban wants. He wants buzz. He wants headlines.
He wants to throw his significant stash all over Dallas. He is
either incredibly delusional in thinking that Rodman really wants
to play, or he doesn't care about anything other than seeing his
name in print. Maybe it's both.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner doesn't care if Rodman attends practices. He
doesn't care if Rodman shows up for games 30 minutes before tipoff,
or decides to ride the exercise bike during games when he's not
playing. He doesn't care as long as Rodman is there, an attraction
that, the would-be owner figures, will lead to more people in the
seats. He's telling Rodman to make his own rules, which is like
telling Boris Yeltsin that it's an open bar. He's even having
Rodman live in his guest house on his expansive Dallas estate
through all this.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Cuban's at it, why not bring back Roy Tarpley?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Cuban told Sports Illustrated about Rodman: ``What's
the worst-case scenario? I'm called an idiot. People will say to
me, `You should have known.' In the meantime, who do the Mavericks
turn to when they need a defensive stop? Nobody. Who do the
Mavericks turn to when they absolutely need that big rebound?
Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks still have nobody even though they've signed
Rodman. They apparently couldn't cut into his set-in-concrete plans
to go to the All-Star Game or the Pro Bowl. Those are entertainment
gigs, after all, which is what Rodman is all about these days.
Cuban knows that, and to try to justify this signing as a
basketball matter is an insult to the intelligence of every fan in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Don Nelson is buying into this ridiculous shell game as
he heads, inevitably but justifiably, into the Maui sunset. He
could have made a stand and called this what it is. What's the
worst that could have happened to him? He could have noted that his
team is starting to play a lot better (eight wins in 11 games
heading into the weekend) and walked out the door at the first
sight of Rodman the reprobate.
</P>
<P>
   All Nellie needs to do now before he goes is acquire Isaiah
Rider _ don't laugh, he has always liked him _ and then the
Mavericks would have enough nuts to satisfy a squirrel convention.
They're already well on their way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Setting the pace
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird made conditioning a priority when he took over the
Indiana Pacers, and he still maintains that philosophy. It shows.
He has, in his three seasons, been unbelievably blessed by good
health among his top players. Reggie Miller, for instance, has not
missed a game with injury in Bird's entire coaching stint. (He
missed one because of a suspension.) Jalen Rose has missed one,
also because of a suspension. Mark Jackson has missed one, after
the death of his father. Through 44 games this season, none of
Bird's top eight players had missed a single game. In fact, in
Bird's two-plus years at Indiana, his top eight players have missed
a total of 15 games, nine of those by tenderfoot Rik Smits. And
these are not youngsters. These are 30-somethings who have learned
how to take care of themselves. ``A lot of it has to do with
Larry,'' team president Donnie Walsh said. ``He made sure they came
into camp in shape and they do an awful lot of running.'' Bird said
the key is that the veterans don't do what he did: go wild and
crazy over the summer. ``They come in and they're in shape and they
don't get hurt,'' he said. ``You get an injury in training camp, it
sticks around.'' The Pacers have told Rick Carlisle, one of Bird's
two assistants, that he will be considered for the head job next
season. Carlisle patched up his relationship with some of the
players over the summer, taking them out to dinner while at Pete
Newell's Big Man Camp . . . Guess who led the NBA in personal fouls
over the two-year period prior to this season? None other than the
Celtics' Danny Fortson. It was not even close. In his first two
seasons, Fortson was flagged for 526 personal fouls in 130 games.
``That's no surprise to me,'' Fortson said. Theo Ratliff and Ervin
Johnson were next with 472 apiece and Shawn Kemp weighed in with
469. If you went by minutes, Fortson committed a foul every 6.1
minutes, compared with Ratliff at 1 per 8.6 minutes and Johnson at
1 per 6.9 minutes. That still isn't close to Jim McIlvaine (1/4.9
minutes) or Travis Knight (1/5.6 minutes). It makes you understand
why Denver didn't mind parting with Fortson, but it does make you
wonder what the Celtics were thinking, especially with the new
rules. Rick Pitino notes that Fortson knocks people down in
practice, gets called for it, and then wonders what he did wrong.
``I don't think he'll be any worse than Vitaly (Potapenko) once he
starts playing,'' the coach said. But when will that be? Fortson is
a power forward, an undersized one at that. Power forward is where
Antoine Walker plays. Fortson can play center, particularly in the
East against a lot of teams. But then you're cutting into other
players' minutes. ``What a year I'm having,'' Fortson cracked
before a recent game. ``Just my luck. A broken foot. The new rules.
A contract year. But I didn't really worry about the rules because
I knew if I sat there and thought about them, I was really going to
be messed up. I think when I get out there, I feel so pumped up
that it's tough for me to stay out of foul trouble. I'm trying. I
know I put myself at a disadvantage when I do that. I want to play
aggressive, but at the same time, I don't want to worry about not
being too aggressive. Because as soon as I start worrying about not
playing aggressive, I might not be me out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wizardry didn't work
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened when Michael Jordan tried to pry Rod
Higgins away from the Warriors to coach the Wizards. If it had been
any of the other 27 teams, the switch may well have happened. But
the Warriors own Washington's first-round pick in June (from the
1994 Chris Webber/Tom Gugliotta trade) and how would it look for
them to allow Higgins to go to Washington and then turn around the
Wizards over the final 40 games? The draft pick, now a decent
lottery selection, wouldn't be as valuable and Golden State would
look silly. That was basically it. There is an unwritten rule that
allows an assistant to move up, but rarely, if ever, does it happen
in midseason. Higgins will be free to go at the end of the season .
. . The Rockets are not going to make the playoffs, but they have
turned into one of the most enjoyable teams to watch. And dangerous
to play. They just came off a stretch in which they beat the Trail
Blazers, the Lakers, the Heat, and the Hornets at home, and the
young talent (Steve Francis, Shandon Anderson, Kelvin Cato, Cuttino
Mobley) has given coach Rudy Tomjanovich a shot in the arm. ``I
feel very, very lucky,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's their time now.
We're retooling. The good thing about it is that we were in this
process of changing eras. Charles (Barkley) was going to be gone
and we were going to have go through the process that we're going
through now. I just feel fortunate for the young kids that they get
all this extra experience, all this extra time.'' Rudy T also
thinks this team has a chance to do some serious damage in the
conference. It still has Hakeem Olajuwon for another year but could
also have a lot of loot available in the summer of 2001. ``My dream
is to get back there and do it again,'' said Tomjanovich, who won
two titles with the Rockets. ``I know it can happen. You've got to
get the right guys and the belief system. Yes, the talent is the
most important thing, but that alone is not going to do it. If you
can't get on the same page, it ain't gonna happen.'' . . . So Ron
Mercer, now you have three more shots against the Celtics this
season, including two at the FleetCenter. ``Yeah, I noticed that,''
said the newest member of the Orlando Magic. ``But it won't be like
the first time back. That was all hype. Next time it will be about
basketball.'' All you Mercer-o-philes, circle March 5 and April 12;
those are Orlando's Boston appearances. This deal was a slam dunk
for the Magic, all but solidifying GM John Gabriel's status as
Executive of the Year. Mercer can be kept on the Magic's roster
while the team tries to lure in the big ones and then can be
re-signed for any amount up to the $9 million maximum. ``I really
like the situation here,'' Mercer said. ``I had a good time in
Denver, but that was not one of the places where I wanted to be
traded. This place is. I think it's going to work, like it was
meant to be.'' Mercer said his contract situation has made it hard
for him this season. ``Everyone brings it up but me. I just want to
play,'' he said. ``It's hard that way. It's been a problem,
especially because of what's been said about me wanting the maximum
or wanting so much money. All I ever said was that I wanted to be
treated fairly. The offer from Boston ($28 million, four years) I
didn't think was a fair one. But all I'm going to think about here
is playing. I'll let my agent handle that stuff.'' The agent, Andy
Miller, also denied that he was after the maximum, adding, ``Ron is
one of the top five or six free agents, but if I could forecast the
marketplace, I'd have retired by now,'' Miller said. The other half
of Pitino's `dream backcourt' of the future, Chauncey Billups, went
along to Orlando with Mercer and arrived in Hooterville Friday for
a checkup/evaluation. He underwent shoulder surgery in December and
likely is done for the season. The intent is to have him continue
rehabilitation in Orlando, rather than in Denver. (That shouldn't
be a hard sell at this time of year.) He, too, is a free agent and
no one will be surprised if he returns to the Nuggets. ``It's
what's around him in Denver that Chauncey really appreciates,''
Miller said. ``But he also understands he has to look at the bigger
picture and explore other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowens gets the call
</P>
<P>
   Warriors coach/general manager Garry St. Jean was an assistant
coach in Milwaukee under Nellie when Dave Cowens made his
ill-advised return to the NBA in 1982. Even prior to that, the two
were friends. Cowens would help out at Nelson's summer basketball
camp, where St. Jean also worked. So when St. Jean decided to add
an assistant, he picked up the phone and called Cowens: ``It was
snowing in Foxborough (where Cowens lives), and I asked his wife if
I could borrow him for 2 1/2 months.'' St. Jean said that everyone
is assuming that he will turn the team over to Cowens next season,
but he said there is no quid pro quo in this one . . . There will
be stars galore at next weekend's All-Star extravaganza in Oakland.
But did you ever think you'd be seeing the 76ers' Todd MacCulloch
representing the East in the Rookie Game? Part of it is the dearth
of big men. Part of it is MacCulloch's play. As the late John
Houseman would have said, he earned it, starting with his play at
last summer's Tournament of the Americas in Puerto Rico, where he
started for his native Canada. ``He just got better and better as
the summer went along and it's paying dividends right now,'' said
Jay Triano, the coach of the Canadian team. ``I think it helped
that Larry Brown got to see him play. He saw he could bang with the
big boys every day. It's a great story. This is a kid who was told
in high school that he wasn't good enough for Division 1. And now
look where he is.'' Triano will coach the Canadians this fall in
Sydney and is hoping that Rick Fox will consider joining the team.
The Canadians' practice schedule isn't quite as cushy as the United
States' (read: no training camp in Maui). They'll practice in
Vancouver and Toronto and play a stint in the California Summer
League before heading across the Pacific for some exhibitions in
Hong Kong prior to the Olympics. At least this time, Canada should
have some media following the team. In Puerto Rico, there was none.
Canada surprisingly edged the hosts for the second spot behind the
United States.

CELTICS FACE ROAD-TESTED BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ After last-minute losses to the best of the Central
(Indiana) and Atlantic (Indiana) divisions and a last-minute win
over the mediocre-at-best the state of New Jersey had to offer, the
Celtics now take on the winningest and one of the hottest teams in
the NBA, Portland, Sunday at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to concentrate every second against them. They're
the best team in the NBA, in my opinion,'' said Celtics swingman
Paul Pierce after Saturday's hourlong practice here at HealthPoint.
``We need everyone to step up if we're going to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The losses to the Pacers and Heat were perhaps a little easier
to swallow after the Celtics' comeback from a 17-point deficit
against the visiting Nets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out just how tough we can be,'' said Pierce. ``We got
down on a couple of occasions and we fought back. We know it's a
full 48-minute game, and that's what I expect against Portland.
They're a good team, but I expect us to come out and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Against a team that had won six in a row _ beating the Lakers
and holding the powerful Spurs to 67 points and Utah to 75 _ before
their streak was snapped Thursday against the Knicks. But Portland
got right back on track Friday by pulling away from Atlanta down
the stretch, with a Scottie Pippen trey the big hoop in the final
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be drawing Scottie or Steve Smith,'' said Adrian
Griffin, one of the key men in the comeback against the Nets.
``It'll be a challenge. They have a great team, but they have to
come into our place, and we'll come ready to compete and to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was the way they won Friday, with the second unit of Tony
Battie, Doug Overton, Dana Barros, Walter McCarty, and the combo of
Griffin and Cal Cheaney, that most pleased coach Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it wasn't like the first unit was dogging it,'' analyzed
Pitino. ``Every single layup they had would go around the rim and
out. Every jump shot would not go in.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we needed to press. We needed intensity, and
the guys we had on the floor were not necessarily going to strike
fear in the hearts of the Nets psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``So (the second unit) came back on the court and played with
absolutely no fear and intimidation and got after it. They got
every loose ball in the backcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   That contribution wasn't lost on Pierce, who, along with Antoine
Walker, Kenny Anderson, and Vitaly Potapenko, had a great seat for
a huge stretch of the second half before reentering the game in
crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's satisfying to me, because although we didn't have our
best performance, we still came away with a win, a team win, and
guys just stepped up,'' said Pierce. ``That took a lot of pressure
off of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have easily folded,'' said Griffin. ``Every game is a
big game, and every win makes it a bigger game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game marks the third stop on the Blazers'
four-games-in-five-days journey as they criss-cross the Eastern
seaboard. Walker is hoping the travel catches up with the them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they're a very difficult team to match up with,'' said
Walker, ``and we're going to have to press a little bit. But we're
confident. We know they're beatable. It's going to be their third
game in four nights, so maybe we can take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's miss of an uncontested dunk in the third quarter of
Friday's game, he said, ``had never happened to me before. I was
kind of embarrassed. All I could do was run back downcourt. It was
pretty typical of how the night was going, but I'm glad we turned
it around. That would have been preying on my mind all night.'' . .
. Forward Rasheed Wallace, the Blazers' leading scorer and
second-leading rebounder, has been selected by the coaches for the
Western roster for the All-Star Game. He is the first Portland
All-Star since Clyde Drexler and Cliff Robinson played in '94.
Pippen, the third-highest fan vote-getter at forward and an
All-Star in seven previous seasons, was not a coaches' selection .
. . Old friend Joe Kleine, now in his 14th NBA season, has been
plagued by tendinitis in his left knee and is seeing very little
playing time with Portland.

BRUINS HALF EMPTY, OR HALF FULL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The All-Star break is the time most NHL clubs ask, ``Where
now?''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Hub, the mood of the day is, ``What next?''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Murphy got the gate Thursday, shot down in a hail of his own
expletives that he would have been wise to delete. Last weekend,
Jeremy Jacobs, well known for his expertise in dollars and cents,
slapped Pat Burns upside the head, criticizing the veteran coach's
X's and O's. A couple of weeks prior to that, assistant GM Mike
O'Connell flatly stated, ``We are not a team.''
</P>
<P>
   If turmoil is the key ingredient in brewing success, then the
concoction bubbling up on Causeway Street could be the prelude to a
16-0 romp through the Stanley Cup playoffs. Just don't count on
that.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's next? The bet here is that everything simmers down
'round the rink in the remaining weeks of the regular season, even
though O'Connell departed for a European scouting trip this weekend
hinting of a possible change in player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for help,'' said O'Connell, noting that his
boss, Harry Sinden, would attend All-Star festivities in Toronto, a
traditional swap meet at this time of year. ``We're looking at
every position, really, anything that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 need is scoring, which is what made turfing Murphy an
even more unsavory move. He had only seven goals, but for a club
handicapped around the net, the 7-10 he might have scored over the
remaining nine weeks could be a significant loss. Much of that
could be mitigated, of course, if the likes of Cameron Mann can
remain in place long enough and bang in a few more, as he did
Thursday night when he took Murphy's spot on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The second-greatest need, as Coach Jacobs noted, is gaining back
some respectability on the penalty-killing unit. Yes, Tim Taylor is
gone. But it's time for everyone, players and coaching staff
included, to get over it. Removing him from the unit should not be
the equivalent of, say, taking Mike Bossy out of the Islander power
play in the early '80s. It takes intelligence, anticipation, legs,
and grit to be an accomplished penalty killer, but the most
cherished of all hockey skills, touch, isn't a prerequisite.
Penalty-killing units are fixable through hard work and
determination. Power plays are as easily made right.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on either Sinden or O'Connell coming home with a guy
who promises 15 or 20 goals between now and April 9. They're just
not out there. Notice how the Penguins took yet another stab at Pat
Falloon, waived by Edmonton, on Friday? Scorers are rarely
available and historically the cost has been far too rich for
management's taste.
</P>
<P>
   The better bet would be for Sinden and O'Connell to land a savvy
veteran forward, ideally a center, who can plug into the moth-eaten
penalty-kill and prevent 15 or 20 goals. In the end, that could
translate into a handful of wins down the stretch, and possibly _
although this sounds like a real reach _ a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran penalty killer doesn't get you excited? Well, turn the
calendar back some 20 years and review what the March 10, 1980,
acquisition of Butch Goring meant for the Islanders. Then 30 years
old with 10 years of experience with the Kings, Goring was
reinvented as a checker by coach Al Arbour. He was Tim Taylor times
10, the missing piece found, and the Islanders stepped up and won
four consecutive Stanley Cups with the gritty, opportunistic
Goring.
</P>
<P>
   All of Boston's woes wouldn't be erased by a latter-day Goring,
because a dynamic checker (not an oxymoron) isn't going to heal
Jason Allison's hands, make Ray Bourque younger, find Sergei
Samsonov a compass with both north and south readings, or lead Hal
Gill to the lost-and-found department to see if that's where his
game went.
</P>
<P>
   However, we know this much with 28 games to go:
</P>
<P>
   1. It isn't scoring that will lead these Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   2. It isn't goaltending, although Byron Dafoe 2000 looks a lot
more like Lord Byron than Lord Bygone.
</P>
<P>
   3. The penalty killing has to come up with numbers slightly
better than those posted by Steve Forbes in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Here in a season headed nowhere, the Bruins at least have made
for interesting copy since the new year. Management clearly isn't
happy with the way the team is coached. If you weren't wondering
before about the vote of confidence (kiss of death) Sinden gave
Burns before the new year, you have to wonder now after the Jacobs
thunderclap last weekend. O'Connell said late last week that there
have been signs of optimism of late, but he has yet to see his club
play at its best some five months into the season. On top of all
that, the front office had to take an embarrassing hit on l'affaire
Murphy, hiring out for help in November and then forced to tow away
the wrent-a-wreck because he popped off one too many times at the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps here in the final weeks the hockey will run as hot as
the copy. Maybe hotter. Wouldn't that be a welcome relief?
</P>
<P>
   One for the books
</P>
<P>
   One element of the Boston coaching staff will change
dramatically next season, no matter what. Assistant coach Ken
Baumgartner, hired to work with Burns after being bought out last
summer, recently was accepted into Harvard Business School,
following the scholarly ruts of ex-Boston defenseman Gord Kluzak.
``It happened about three weeks ago, but I didn't want to say
anything at the time, because of everything that's been going on
with the club,'' said Baumgartner . . . Idle thought: Wouldn't Cam
Neely make an interesting choice as an assistant here? No. 8 has
turned down prior out-of-town feelers and he still remains active
with his charity work . . . Dominik Hasek returned to the Sabres
Tuesday night and immediately showed Vezina form, turning in a
handful of spectacular stops in a 2-2 tie with the Ducks. Provided
Hasek stays healthy _ always a question after a torn groin _ the
Sabres now have to figure out what to do with fellow netminders
Dwayne Roloson and Martin Biron for the rest of this season. The
easiest move would be to push Biron back to Rochester (AHL) rather
than risk losing Roloson, ex- of UMass-Lowell, on waivers. But then
there's the dicey prospect of the June expansion draft that will
stock Columbus and Minnesota. Roloson is the obvious candidate to
be exposed. Confusing matters: Hasek recently has been hedging on
his earlier announcement to make this his last season . . .
Frightening sight, ex-Bruin Trent McCleary diving to block a shot
and taking a Chris Therien slapper to the throat last Saturday in
Montreal. McCleary needed a tracheotomy to save his life. Doctors
performed surgery 48 hours later to repair a complex fracture of
his larynx. No more hockey this season for the 27-year-old forward.
It is expected he will need extensive speech therapy and also time
to build up his weight. He was being fed intravenously last week .
. . Remember Clint Malarchuk? The ex-Buffalo goalie survived
perhaps the goriest on-ice accident, his throat sliced and an
artery severed while protecting the Sabres net. Asked about
McLeary's accident, Malarchuk said, ``How come nobody ever asks me
about my 12 NHL shutouts? Sure (McCleary's accident) reminded me of
what happened to me. And I remember thinking at the time, as they
carried me off, `If I pass out, I know I'm never waking up again.'
I thought I was a goner.'' These days, Malarchuk is coach of the
Idaho Steelheads in the West Coast Hockey League . . . The Capitals
visit the Vault Monday night, a different club after a recent
11-game unbeaten streak (could the Michael Jordan influence in
Washington be that pervasive?). The hotter they get, the more
unlikely it is that they'll dish Adam Oates, on target to be a free
agent this summer, at the March 14 deadline. But can you imagine
what the Ducks would look like with Oates between Paul Kariya and
Teemu Selanne?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A C-note note
</P>
<P>
   A total of 13 NHL rinks top out their ticket prices with a seat
that costs $100 or more. The top single ticket price: $700. Where
else but Madison Square Garden? . . . Anyone else out there find it
hard to believe this is Dave Poulin's fifth year as head coach at
Notre Dame? . . . Waived by the Leafs last week, veteran forward
Kris King opted not to report to the AHL and likely will hook up
with the IHL Chicago Wolves. Explained King: ``A lot of raw kids
would like to make names for themselves, knocking on a guy who's
done it his whole career. I don't need that after 850 NHL games.''
. . . The Red Wings, who earlier backed off giving Igor Larionov a
two-year extension, recently offered him one more year at $1.7
million. Sorry, he said, not interested . . . Panthers netminder
Mike Vernon didn't win friends on the club when his remark, ``We
need defensemen,'' turned up in print. To which GM Bryan Murray
responded: ``Mike should just play net.'' . . . The Beanpot kicks
off Monday night at the Vault. Think anyone can put in the full 60
minutes on the blue line, the way Tom ``Red'' Martin did for Boston
College back in '61, when he was tournament MVP? Martin's number
will be retired at The Heights this week . . . Headed into the
All-Star break, no fewer than 36 NHLers were sidelined with
concussion-related injuries. It's gone from nuisance to epidemic .
. . Devils defenseman Lyle Odelein, a spare part at Exit 16W, has
at least three clubs _ Detroit, Dallas, and San Jose _ hot after
his services . . . It looks like Fred Brathwaite's magic has run
its course in the Calgary net. Given the talent of the Western
Conference, Brian Sutter's bunch could be knocked out of playoff
contention in a stretch of, say, five games. Makes you wonder
whether they'd give up a kid like Marc Savard for goalie prospect
John Grahame . . . Jaromir Jagr is hoping to cut a CD. Wonder if it
will sell like Jim Schoenfeld's two LPs, the unforgettable ``Key to
Love'' and the equally-unforgettable ``Schoeny.'' Must be something
about living in Pittsburgh and Buffalo that makes a man want to
sing . . . O'Connell's scouting trip will take him to a pro
tournament in Sweden and a junior tournament in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing the whistle
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kordic, after seeing action in only two games with
Philadelphia last season, traded his stick for a whistle and is now
living in suburban Toronto, eyeing a return to the NHL as a
linesman. Bryan Lewis, the NHL's supervisor of officials, says
Kordic has been busy calling junior games and his first-half
reports this season were impressive. ``We get letters to our office
almost every day, kids telling us where they're working, and asking
us to come watch 'em,'' said Lewis . . . The Hurricanes announced
plans to drop ticket prices by an average of $3 next season,
leaving almost half the tickets in the building under $30 per game.
More than 2,000 tickets per game will cost only $12. The Hurricanes
are averaging only slightly better than 12,000 per game this season
and the scaling back is aimed at bringing in more families and
growing the fan base. Think about it. A guy in Manhattan could turn
in one $700 seat to the Rangers for almost 60 games of the cheap
seats in Raleigh . . . Another country heard from: Ex-Soviet
netminding legend Vladislav Tretiak chimed in with his opinion
regarding Alexei Yashin's refusal to honor his contract with the
Senators. To wit: ``You should renegotiate contracts only afer they
expire,'' he told Sport-Express in Moscow. ``Yashin was Ottawa's
favorite player, and if the truth was on his side, people in Ottawa
never would have burned his jersey.'' . . . Senators owner Rod
Bryden has a news conference set for Friday and will provide an
update regarding his plea for stronger financial commitment from
the fan base. Last Monday, he posted a 7 percent increase in ticket
prices and assessed a 10 percent charge on luxury boxes, as well as
outlining increased prices for sideboard advertising and the need
to boost season-ticket sales. The bet here: fans grow tired of
shakedowns and threats, and the Senators will be in Ottawa for only
one more season, at most . . . The Swiss Elite League recently held
a banquet for its 1998-99 major award winners and ex-Bruin Todd
Elik was the league's player of the year. Elik is finishing up a
second year in Bern and will play 2000-01 for Zug. A recent wire
story from overseas referred to the 33-year-old center as
``hot-tempered and highly controversial.'' Something had to be lost
in the translation.

TRAINING IS LOW-PROFILE, HIGH-IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Julio Santana takes off his
shirt, revealing a back as broad as a blacksmith's anvil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like training in the States,'' says Santana, a
pitcher who missed almost all of last season because of tendinitis
in his right shoulder but who recently signed a minor league
contract with the Red Sox. ``This is Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana is standing in the Estadio Centro Olimpico, where
extensive renovations are under way to replace the track on which
some of the Dominican Republic's top athletes hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Here, underneath the stands, Santana is awaiting the arrival of
Presinao Done _ or ``Nao'' _ a stocky Puerto Rican who once
competed in the decathlon and is the personal trainer of slugger
Juan Gonzalez, a two-time American League MVP, and Red Sox pitcher
Pedro Martinez, a two-time Cy Young Award winner. As an ad for
Presinao's services, those are two mighty big names to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is here this morning, in fact, having come from Puerto
Rico to train with Nao. So is Mariners relief pitcher Jose Mesa,
Sox rookie pitcher Juan Pena, Nelson Lara, the towering pitching
prospect for the Florida Marlins, and several dozen other players
prepared to work out for three hours in the morning, then another
session in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is not here, though when Nao arrives a few
minutes later, he says he expects to see him pull up any time in
his beige Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez does not show up this day. Nao makes a call on his
cellular phone and reports that he was told by Pedro's cousin that
the Sox pitcher is in Hato Mayor, a rural village about an hour
away, visiting his mother in the home he and his brother Ramon had
built for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have to hide,'' Martinez said in Boston last
month, when he came to town for the team's annual publicity
caravan. ``Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to rehab my
shoulder. People wouldn't take no for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that for all the speaking he did in schools and at
the charity dinners he attended, there were many more opportunities
he turned down. He said he refused all endorsement offers, too. The
only ad in which he pops up regularly is a spot he did for the
Dominican tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing anything whatsoever to mess up my time,'' he
said. ``I need to train.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez would prove this week that he had refined his
disappearing act. The newspapers were full of reports that he had
gone to Venezuela for the charity game staged by Cleveland
shortstop Omar Vizquel for flood victims there. There were even
stories after the fact stating that Martinez had attended, when in
fact he never went.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he go to Jaracaboa, a mountain village two hours north
of the capital city, Santo Domingo, for a promised appearance at a
camp for hemophiliacs sponsored by a Boston-based organization that
had put Martinez on its promotional brochures. He never called to
say he wasn't coming, either.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the next couple of days of training with Nao, who said
he wasn't sure but thought Martinez might have gone to one of the
island's beach resorts for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, though, Martinez showed up on the beach at Boca
Chica, where he worked out with Nao, did an interview for Spanish
television, and posed for a photographer from Gear, the men's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Nao said that because of the shoulder injury and a workload of
more than 200 innings, he advised Martinez to take off more than
two months before beginning his training program. But once Martinez
began working out, Nao said, he was as dedicated as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked out six days a week with me,'' Nao says. ``He
gives 100 percent above 100 percent, always. His condition is
magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez hurt his shoulder after the All-Star Game last
July and went on the disabled list, he summoned Nao to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an excess of inflammation right behind his shoulder
blade,'' Nao says. ``There was a lot of black blood there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nao was deeply involved with Martinez's therapy as he recovered
from the injury. On the day Martinez showed up late at Fenway Park
and was scratched from his scheduled start by manager Jimy
Williams, he said he was being given a massage by Nao.
</P>
<P>
   Nao also took charge this winter of Martinez's rehabilitation
from the injury he suffered to the back of his shoulder during the
playoffs. His program consisted of a variety of stretching
exercises, a good deal of swimming, lots of running, and some
weight work.
</P>
<P>
   ``His condition is magnificent,'' says Nao, who also helped Pena
recover from a shoulder injury and believes that Pena has a great
shot at being Rookie of the Year this season. ``He is ahead of
where he was at this time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   At 181 pounds, Martinez says, he is 10 pounds heavier than he
was last year, which he thinks will help him withstand the grueling
demands of his third season with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Nao makes no promises that Martinez will duplicate what he did
in 1999, a season that ranks among the greatest ever by a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Nao says, ``he will be ready.''

   PROVIDENCE _ The words of advice to Jerry DiGregorio came in a
hoarse whisper after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try and recruit some players,'' Temple coach John Chaney told
the first-year University of Rhode Island coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that,'' said DiGregorio, ``is what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Help can't come too soon for the Rams. Saturday's 74-40 loss to

   All of this two seasons after the Rams were seconds away from a
trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   No one is pointing fingers over the decline. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   When former coach Jim Harrick made his escape to Georgia last
spring, a URI administration and booster group, already with an
inferiority complex in a state dominated by Providence College
basketball, went to DiGregorio for a simple reason _ it felt he
could convince superstar Lamar Odom to stay for at least one more
season.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen and DiGregorio, who was coaching high school
and teaching history three years ago, was left with a program of
some players, some prospects, and some bodies.
</P>
<P>
   With Odom gone, along with a season-ending injury to starter
Tiger Womack and a series of injuries and illnesses that sidelined
Tavorris Bell, Zach Marbury, and Luther Clay, the Rams have gone
through this season undermanned, overmatched, and outclassed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a quality team like Temple, on one of its better
afternoons, simply accentuated the problem, particularly in the
first half when the Rams were a horrendous 2 of 20 from the floor,
the main reason they trailed, 36-9, at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to beat anyone shooting 10 percent,'' said
DiGregorio, who was hired for his ability as a recruiter more than
as an X's and O's coach.
</P>
<P>
   John Wooden couldn't win with a team that makes 2 of 20 shots in
the first 20 minutes and now has scored less than 50 points five
times this season, with Saturday's total the lowest by a URI team
in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was so bad that DiGregorio didn't even bother calling any
timeouts when his team was being outscored, 18-2, in the first 11
minutes, letting the built-in television timeouts serve as speed
bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island fans _ and they are diminishing quickly _ have seen
this before. In the Rams' first meeting with Temple last month, the
Owls raced to a 15-0 lead. Against Tulsa, the Rams were also
outscored, 15-0, at the start; against UTEP, 26-7; against UMass,
18-3.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it was 40-13 before the Owls put it in cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game like this you have to play against yourself,'' said
Chaney, who has seen his share of bad times at Temple, but who has
a potential Final Four team this season. His Owls have not allowed
more than 50 points in their last seven games. ``I know what it's
like to go through losing. It's not good. It's very difficult. But
it's a great time to teach. The answer is not a simple answer. The
answer is to work your tail off.''
</P>
<P>
   URI didn't do that. At least not at the start, when it mattered
most.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams may not do that the rest of the season, although
DiGregorio and assistant Jeff Jones will get on their players if
they choose that response to adversity.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future? It is murky at best. URI is scheduled to
break ground on a new on-campus arena this summer, although some
say they'll believe it when they see it. And there are a few
recruits lined up for next season.
</P>
<P>
   But the big picture is bleak. And if there is a lingering
question following the two-year tenure of Harrick, it is this: Is
the program better now than when he arrived in 1997? The answer,
quite simply, is no.

MCCAIN PUTS GOP, BUSH IN TIGHT SPOT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That stock sure looked promising when you bought a ton of shares
last summer, but prices are starting to plummet, and you're getting
edgy.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do? Sell?
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of creeping dilemma facing hundreds of elected
Republican officials: Has the GOP invested too much in presidential
candidate George W. Bush to turn back now?
</P>
<P>
   With the decisive victory of Sen. John McCain in New Hamp shire,
that's the question some Republican leaders are asking themselves
with the South Caro lina primary looming on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to say Bush is in real trouble, but it's not
prema ture now to say John McCain is a real threat,'' said GOP
pollster Frank Luntz, who maintains a close relationship with
Capitol Hill Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised a record amount of campaign funds and pocketed
the endorsements of more than half of all the nation's governors,
including Arizona's Jane Hull, and most of the Re publicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, site of the next big primary on Feb. 19, Bush
has locked up the House speaker and the attorney general as well as
U.S. Sen. Strom Thur mond and dozens of mayors, state lawmakers and
council members. &QL; 
MCCAIN HOT CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   If Bush continues to tumble, it could be a predicament for the
party's establishment wing, for whom the Texas governor re mains
the overwhelming favor ite. Politicians like to be associated with
winners, and right now, McCain is the hot candidate after routing
Bush in Tuesday's New Hampshire pri mary.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many Re publican leaders like Bush and
wouldn't want to abandon him lest they appear poll-driven. Or worse
_ disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, a front-runner like this rarely loses. Bush has
every advantage imaginable, ex cept speaking style and that streak
of independence,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they grow increasingly frustrated with Bush, congres
sional Republicans are likely to stick with him because so many are
uncomfortable with McCain. Most disapprove of his plan to reduce
the role of big money in campaigns because they believe it would
hamstring the GOP at election time.
</P>
<P>
   In the party's social-conserva tive wing, there are concerns
that McCain wouldn't work to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
Supreme Court decision that le galized abortion, and that he
wouldn't appoint anti-abortion justices.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has embarrassed his GOP colleagues by accusing them,
at least indirectly, of ap proving wasteful ``pork-barrel''
spending and of being tied to special interests such as the oil and
gas industries.
</P>
<P>
   `NEED STEADY HAND'
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a proven executive rather than a maverick
legislator, and that, to me, de fines the difference,'' said former
U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., who is part of the army of current
and former legislators who have endorsed Bush in South Carolina.
It's one thing to be a maverick among 100 senators, but presi dents
need a steady hand, Inglis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go left one day and right the next when there is
just one hand on the wheel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis, now practicing law in Greenville, is a good case study
for the concern afflicting Bush's best-known backers. He said it
felt like getting whacked with a ``two-by-four'' when a poll a few
days ago had McCain pulling ahead of Bush in South Carolina,
following the New Hampshire win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're hit with a blow, you naturally go inward as you
try to figure out how much water you've taken on. Yes, there's
every reason for Bush support ers to be very concerned, but also
very energized,'' Inglis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very critical for George W. Bush to come straight
to South Carolina without any former governors or former con
gressmen hanging on his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain both plan to devote most of their time to South
Carolina in the days lead ing up to the primary. The Ari zona and
Michigan primaries follow three days later, on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign isn't expecting any major defections from
the elected officials of the Bush army, but claims to sense their
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment will hang on (to Bush),'' McCain strategist
Mike Murphy said. ``But I think a lot of establishment people are
thinking, `You know, the party may be better off if McCain is the
nominee. We want to win, we want to hold the Congress. There's
clearly a tremendous at traction this candidate has.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership is saying, `Well, why are we for
Bush again?' '' &QL;

OZARK CHURCH, LIKE MANY OTHER RURAL ONES IN MISSOURI, IS AT
CROSSROADS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUGGINS, Mo. _ Early fog and freezing cold shrouded this part of
the Ozarks a couple of Sundays ago. By midmorning the trees and
pastures glistened white with frost.
</P>
<P>
   Slick roads. Snow in the forecast. Still, the newspapers were
put aside and the televisions were clicked off.
</P>
<P>
   Time for church.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot around the little Number One Freewill Baptist
Church three miles north of here filled up, first for Sunday school
and then for services.
</P>
<P>
   Just another one of those Ozark churches that travelers marvel
at for their quaintness, isolation, or how on Sundays and
Wednesdays the parking lots fill up as if by magic.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But the church here is more. It also
represents a hardly noticed push and pull that Missouri's small
rural churches have faced over the past several years: whether to
grow, die or stay essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   Churches with fewer than 75 members constitute roughly 60
percent of the 7,517 churches in Missouri, said Granville Watson,
director of church and community relations at Southwest Baptist
University in Bolivar, Mo. Annually a handful simply fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a couple notices every year that such and such
Methodist church has closed,'' said Joy Dotson, reference librarian
at the United Methodist Church Archives at Central Methodist
College in Fayette, Mo. ``They're just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   At Number One Freewill Baptist that cold Sunday morning, 25 men,
women and children sang ``I'll Fly Away'' and ``He Set Me Free,''
Missouri hymns written by Albert E. Brumley, who hailed from Powell
in the state's southwest corner. Next came ``What a Friend We Have
in Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Rev. Tom Ratterree gave his sermon, telling
parishioners that it was time to get right with the Lord because he
is coming. No ifs, ands or buts.
</P>
<P>
   Ratterree, an admitted believer in ``muscular'' Christianity,
did not pose at his pulpit and couch his message in discreet terms.
Rather, he strode around the whole front of the church _
gesticulating, mopping his brow, going from hollers to murmurs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fine preaching.
</P>
<P>
   Number One, a white structure, is named for the community,
itself named for the adjacent Number One School, weathered and gray
but still standing. The school got its name because it was the best
in District 80 in the 1920s, a time when performance counted over
any possible hurt feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The church has 40-plus members. Sunday school and two services
are Sunday; another service is Wednesday. Every two weeks there is
a big ``sing.'' Plus regular Bible study sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary, 3 years old, is on the south side of the old
church, which was erected about 1925. It has a low ceiling, big
fans and nice pews. Congregants raised $30,000 for materials and
built most of the addition.
</P>
<P>
   Church closings, as a rule, have been more prevalent in northern
Missouri, with its low farm prices, small farms merging into big
ones, the resultant depopulation and thus a dwindling number of
adherents, said Mike Fuhrman, associate professor of Christian
studies at Southwest Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Missouri, with its retirement and tourist attractions
and a more diversified economy, has seen relatively fewer closings,
Fuhrman said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fuhrman said, ``there's a lot of kick left in these
little rural churches. I know of a little church south of
Huntsville in north Missouri. A few years ago you would have
written it off. Just one small building and almost no members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today they have four buildings. They've got 190 in Sunday
school. They've got a youth camp. I can't explain it by analyzing
demographics or socioeconomic trends. The people just decided they
wanted their church to survive and the Lord helped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said some smaller churches had lost attendance to the
megachurches that offer programs ranging from nurseries to youth
programs, education to singles groups, sports to seniors
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think Wal-Mart,'' Watson said. ``The same thing that's
happened to little businesses, in some ways, is happening to little
churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotson, the reference librarian, agreed. When she had her
children, she sought out a larger church where there was a baby
sitter during services.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Watson said, the superstore analogy only goes so far. What
some small churches offer can't be duplicated simply by size and a
multiplicity of programs. In smaller churches, the minister often
seems more accessible, most everyone in the sanctuary is usually an
old friend or acquaintance, and some parishioners think their
voices and literal muscle are absolutely vital to the future of the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   A possible downside to that, Watson added, is that many smaller
churches, because of their isolation over the years, have become
what are called ``family chapels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, in some of these smaller churches out in the
country, members married each other,'' Watson said, ``so a lot of
the membership is related. In fact, one or two or three families
may sort of run the church. The challenge is whether those churches
will open their arms to newcomers as the state changes and people
move in looking for a few acres and a rural way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hargrave of the state office of the Assemblies of God in
Springfield, said there had been an awakening among small rural
churches that they have to reach out.
</P>
<P>
   ``No place is isolated anymore,'' Hargrave said. ``Put in a
satellite dish and those people can attend meetings anywhere. Then
there's the Internet. There's cell phones. These little churches
are starting to put in all sorts of programs. Talk to them and
there's all sorts of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's also tradition. The little cemetery adjoining Number
One is neat as a pin, maintained assiduously by church members.
</P>
<P>
   The old-timers' names _ Maxwell, Massey, Hutsell, Ballard, and
McCoy _ dominate. Some of the markers are just plain stones. Max
Wade, a church member, said the uncarved and rough markers dated
from around the turn of the century and the founding of the church.
The first carved stones record deaths starting in 1918, testimony
to the great influenza pandemic that made its way into the
backwoods of western Texas County.
</P>
<P>
   Wade says folks moving into the area are welcome. And he's seen
some of that already. Here and there are people who left the area
years ago and are moving back, along with folks from nearby
Houston, Mountain View and Cabool, buying small acreages and
building houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming,'' said Wade, who is in his 70s. ``You know
how I know that? Just look at Route M here in front of the church.
When I was a young man, I could have gone to sleep right in the
middle of the road from 9 at night to 3 in the morning and had nary
a worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'd be squashed like a bug. There's traffic all hours.
That's how.''

MARTINEZ STILL AN ISLAND WONDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANOGUAYABO, Dominican Republic _ Someplace more familiar, where
there aren't papaya and higuero trees growing outside, this would
be called a mom-and-pop store, the neighborhood 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it's known as a ``colmado,'' and Alejo Jaime Abreu, the
man in the T-shirt that has Pedro Martinez's likeness stamped over
the Dominican flag, figures he has been minding the store for the
past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the counter, there's a bag of red beans and containers filled
with sweet cloves and cinnamon. There's rice, of course; a freshly
baked poundcake; shelves that contain cough drops; and a wall of
bottled rum. Two little boys, both the color of mocha and
unencumbered by clothing, stroll in and reach into the huge icebox
plastered with the logo of El Presidente beer. In a tropical
country where refrigeration is in short supply, El Presidente buys
loyalty by offering iceboxes on a generous installment plan, as
long as the shopkeepers and bar owners sell that brand only. The
older of the boys places a couple of liter bottles on the counter,
gives Senor Abreu a fistful of pesos, and heads out to complete his
errand.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman enters, wearing a baseball cap that reads
``Amable con Balaguer.'' That's her way of expressing support for
Juan Balaguer, the 93-year-old blind dictator who recently
announced he is running again for president, one more absurdity in
a poor country that exports some of the best baseball players in
the world but has to import just about everything else.
</P>
<P>
   During election season, it's impossible to go more than a block
or two in the capital of Santo Domingo without seeing billboards
and banners extolling Hipolito or Danilo, the two leading
candidates for president. But what has Abreu offering a toothless
grin to his visitors is a survey that has nothing to do with the
politicians and everything to do with this island nation's favorite
sons.
</P>
<P>
   So, Senor Abreu, who's more popular, Sammy Sosa or Pedro
Martinez?
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is,'' he cackles. ``There it is. A gancha (fishhook).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to take the gancha,'' he says. ``Let somebody
else answer that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that on this particular ``calle de suenos''
(street of dreams), Pedro enjoys a home-field advantage over Sammy,
who grew up a shoeshine boy in San Pedro de Macoris, the mill town
almost an hour east of here. Alejo Jaime Abreu is the brother of
Paolino Jaime Abreu, the former semipro pitcher and father of the
famous Martinez brothers, who go by their mother's name, as is the
custom in these parts. His colmado fronts the family compound where
Paolino Abreu lives and the brothers Martinez still come for family
gatherings. The father's house, though modest, has been
dramatically upgraded from the ``arrancho'' (tin shack) that the
Martinez brothers once called home. And the ballfield where Ramon
and Pedro played as children?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone,'' says Rafael Gonzalez, who is carrying a Red Sox
equipment bag upon his return from the team's academy, where he is
training with the other Dominican players signed by the Sox.
``There's a juice factory where the field used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who lives just down the street from where the Martinez
boys grew up, is a pitcher. At 18, he already is much bigger than
his skinnier predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good fastball,'' says Gonzalez, who will be attending
his first spring training in the United States next month. ``I
throw around 94.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the block, on the wall of the photo-developing shop, a
poster commemorates Pedro winning his second Cy Young Award and
proclaims him to be the ``Orguell Dominicano'' (pride of the
Dominican). Take that, Gary Cooper. Another poster calls him ``the
most valioso Dominicano'' (most valuable Dominican).
</P>
<P>
   Juan Marichal, the Hall of Fame pitcher who now serves as the
country's minister of sport, dedicated his golf tournament last
weekend to Martinez. The Caribbean Series, which opened Wednesday
night and matches the winter league champions of Mexico, Venezuela,
Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, also was dedicated to
Martinez, with full-page ads in the newspapers trumpeting that
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the ``salon de belleza'' (beauty salon), where Rosamaria
Jaime good-naturedly grumbles, ``I'm the slave here'' as she fusses
over the hair of a client, the women are attired in the fashion of
the day. They are wearing their Pedro T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always, his love is here,'' says Maria Herrera Jaime, who,
like fellow customers Lucita Jaime and Arletti Campusano, are part
of the Martinez clan, which might be proliferating faster than
Pedro's strikeout total, judging by all those who claim to be
family.
</P>
<P>
   But has Pedro met his love here? ``Ay-ay-ay,'' Maria says with a
laugh when asked if Manoguayabo's most eligible bachelor has any
plans to be married. ``There aren't even any rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Below the beauty salon, kids are playing baseball in a
washed-out gully, the one that doubles as a parking lot for the
cockfight arena next door. The tallest of the players is hedging
his bets. He is wearing a No. 45 jersey, but when he spots an
American with a camera, he pats his heart with two fingers, Sosa's
trademark gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro is a hero,'' says Kelvin de la Cruz, who fixes trucks
and tractors in a garage near the colmado. ``Here? No, everywhere.
The reality is, Sammy has more propaganda in the press; that's why
he may be more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   The night of the Martinez Milagro (miracle) _ when Pedro ignored
the pain in the back of his right shoulder and held the mighty
Cleveland Indians hitless for six innings in the deciding game of
the American League Division Series _ Alejo Jaime Abreu hauled his
small TV set from behind the counter of his colmado and onto the
street, where dozens gathered to watch the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more than 35 people out in the streets screaming,''
the old man says. ``The police came, but they took care of the
people who were celebrating. The police said, `We're with you.'
There were people on their motorbikes dragging stuff down the
street _ beds, sofas.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Modesto Cruz Delgado shows up a few minutes later
on his Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one pulling the sofa,'' he says. ``When he beat
Cleveland, it was heavy, hard, and good. I was afraid for him, but
I knew he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro and Ramon came back to the Dominican after the
playoffs, seven busloads of neighbors were at the airport to greet
them. It was to Manoguayabo they returned for a huge party in an
open field, where a cocoban played merengue and schoolchildren
spelled out Pedro's name with placards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you go in this country,'' says Juana Bienvenida de
Jaime Guzman, ``they talk about Pedro Martinez. This is where he
was born. We enjoy his triumphs, and we suffer his sorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman (the father of pitcher Juan Guzman is her cousin) is the
community coordinator for the Immaculada Concepcion church, the one
built as a gift from Pedro to the neighborhood after he signed his
six-year, $75 million contract with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He personally made the promise to me in front of my door,''
she says. ``He said, `If I ever get to the major leagues, I promise
I will build a church,' and he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about Pedro is the simplicity of his heart, for
what he is. A lot of people who have reached his status might not
have come back here, but he came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The church is not a cathedral. It is built to scale in the
neighborhood. But with its walls painted in bold pastels, lime
green and peach, it is an inviting place. Inside, there are 28
wooden benches, 14 on either side of the aisle, and a bouquet of
bright yellow flowers adorning the simple altar. The church opened
two years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had a church here before,'' Guzman says. ``We used to
gather in a school.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro has been here on several occasions, including the baptism
of a child for whom he was named godfather. He doesn't live in the
neighborhood. He lives about 20 minutes away in Santo Domingo, the
capital, in a comfortable but hardly flashy condo complex, just
behind the $5 million mansion Sosa recently had built for himself,
the one with the gold No. 21 on the gates and a replica of the
spiral staircase from the Titanic inside.
</P>
<P>
   But while Martinez is not a regular at his church, there are
many times when his name is invoked within its walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he is playing and he feels bad,'' Guzman says, ``he calls
here, to Manoguayabo. Some of his friends, they'll come here and
make prayers for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, for all the charitable work he has done in his community,
including the hurricane relief efforts directed by his foundation,
has been criticized publicly this winter for not doing more with
his millions. Guzman shakes her head when asked if people expect
more from Pedro, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very grateful for Pedro,'' she says. ``He doesn't
realize what he's done for this community. We hope that God
preserves him, helps him, and keeps him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from a very poor family, and there are a lot of
people who depend on him. We as a community are not unhappy with
him. He's just finished building two homes for people who really
needed homes. He gives to people who are really needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to build a school for the community. We already
have the grounds. We never had the land, and now we have the land
because he personally bought the land, just as he did for the
church. The plan is to build the school this year.''

   He is their neighbor, their son or cousin or nephew, their hero
and, yes, for some, their salvation.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to steady a candidacy that she acknowledges
has stirred concern about her political skills and spirit, Hillary
Rodham Clinton says she is now prepared to press an aggressive
campaign against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the race for U.S.
Senate, drawing distinctions on issues ranging from school vouchers
to tax cuts, and arguing that Senate Republicans ``don't need any
more votes'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In her first extended interview devoted to her Senate candidacy,
just days before her official announcement Sunday afternoon,
Clinton took pains to present herself as a moderate Democrat. She
went out of her way to note her support for the death penalty,
welfare restrictions and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who unsuccessfully championed national health
care six years ago, asserted that ``there are no government
solutions'' to most problems facing the nation. And, sounding very
much like a new Westchester homeowner suffering from a case of
property-tax sticker shock, Clinton said she was stunned to
discover the tax burden faced by state residents.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would use her formal announcement speech _ in the
gymnasium at the State University of New York at Purchase _ to try
to offer voters an education about her personal background and
professional accomplishments. Her travels through New York since
last summer had convinced her, she said, that she had become
something of a caricature. That was partly because her own
accomplishments had been eclipsed by her husband's career, and by
her mostly self-imposed isolation in the White House, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, reprising what has been a recurrent theme in her public
life, Clinton also blamed conservative attacks _ ``the drum beat of
an ideology that is really being promoted at my expense,'' as she
put it _ for distorting the public's view of her.
</P>
<P>
   She made her remarks in an 80-minute interview with The New York
Times, conducted Thursday evening in her eighth-floor corner office
overlooking Madison Square Garden, accompanied by her press
secretary, Howard Wolfson. The interview came after what has proven
to be a difficult six-month introduction into electoral life and
New York politics for Clinton, who has been criticized for running
a clumsy, passive, unfocused and vague campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She did not quarrel with criticism of her campaign style. But in
outlining her plans as she moved into the next phase of the race,
she offered signs of a significant shift in her strategy. She said
she would be more aggressive in presenting her case while trying to
offer a fuller, and presumably more sympathetic, portrait of her
life and career.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, aides trucked in cartons filled with 400,000
eight-page leaflets, titled ``Hillary: The Real Story,'' that were
to be distributed across the state starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has probably been the biggest surprise to me in the last
six months,'' Clinton said. ``What I have found is that people
don't know anything, really, about the work that I did before Bill
was elected president. And know very little _ except about health
care _ about the work that I've done in the White House. It became
so apparent to me that in order to introduce myself to the voters
of New York, I was going to have to go back and really share a lot
of my life story.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview, she was relaxed and jaunty, laughing
even when asked whether she was concerned that her campaign might
be jeopardized by the impending report on her actions by an
independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, who is still investigating the
failed Whitewater land deal and her role in other matters, like the
firings of several employees in the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have hoped that this would have been concluded by now,
but apparently that is not the game plan,'' she said. ``And I guess
New Yorkers will have to judge that for what they think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to speculate on what Ray might find, or the subject
of the investigation, saying: ``It is hard to believe that after 6{
years, tens of thousands of documents, grand juries, testimonies,
committee hearings and everything that's gone on, that this could
not be brought to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's report is due to be issued in the middle of the campaign,
and since Clinton is promising now to be available more often in
news conferences and one-on-one interviews, it seems likely that
she will be forced to address these issues frequently in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, she also talked about her new life outside
the White House, though she still is not living full-time in her
$1.7 million house in Chappaqua. She described her first few weeks
as something of an adventure, noting that she had barely driven a
car, cooked a meal or gone shopping for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, pushing that cart through the supermarket, and
standing and talking to _ I had a long conversation about
clementines with the produce manager because it's been a long time
since I bought a crate of clementines,'' she said of a recent visit
to a Grand Union near her home on Old House Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, standing over in the dairy department trying to
decide what Skim Plus meant. Because, you know, I'd never seen Skim
Plus. And having a man come up to me and kind of do a double take
and kind of say, `Is that you?' and I said, `I guess so, it is me.'
It made me feel like I was re-entering the real world.''

THIS PITCHER'S ACTIONS LOUDER THAN WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is one of the most disturbed relievers in baseball. His
specialty? Grief. That is, his wife knows how capable her husband
is of wielding it over her. So capable that he recently had her
dialing 911 because she thought he was going to kill her. His
resume features hate, cowardice, and an obsessive need to control.
And, no, his name is not John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Every few days there are wild arguments about Rocker. But how
many people have ever heard of Bobby Chouinard, a man who practiced
tyranny in his Phoenix home? More important, Bud Selig, why haven't
you suspended him, fined him, and ordered him to take sensitivity
training?
</P>
<P>
   Some people will take this the wrong way, but I've got to be
honest: Right now, I feel silly for all the energy I spent
analyzing and debating the hateful words of Rocker. On one hand, I
know the power of racist comments and the symbolism and subtext
that are packaged with them. Sometimes words have the ability to
vault into your soul and explode like verbal shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem I have with focused national outrage is that it
creates shadows in which too many people can hide. It becomes chic
to defend or bash the newsmaker of the hour. So some people wrapped
themselves in the First Amendment, exalting Rocker's right to speak
as if he were some athletic Salman Rushdie. Some dusted off their
Southern cliches, speaking of rebel flags and gun racks. Even the
group Twisted Sister _ Twisted Sister! _ said it didn't want Rocker
to use one of its songs as his personal soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happened during the time the sports nation was
transfixed on Atlanta? An Arizona pitcher declared war on his wife
and, indirectly, his infant son.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas night, the 27-year-old Chouinard was at a party
with his wife, Erica. He had already consumed a six-pack of beer,
but he told his wife that he wanted her to purchase additional
alcohol. She told police that she refused him because he sometimes
became violent when he drank. There were times when he had punched
her so hard that she thought her ribs were broken. Chouinard became
angry that his wife refused him in front of other people. So when
they left the party for their north Phoenix home, he told his wife
to call the hosts and apologize for her behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been bad enough if things had stopped there. It
got worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, as his 17-month-old son watched,
Chouinard grabbed Erica by the throat, threw her to a chair, and
began choking her. He held her down and began slapping her face. An
officer wrote: ``Bobby began yelling at her that he never knew his
father and that . . . he works so hard at baseball and saved to buy
her a ring. Erica said she was scared for her life.''
</P>
<P>
   She was scared enough to dial 911. But when Chouinard saw her
with the phone, he ripped it out of the wall and threatened her.
Please keep in mind that an impressionable child was absorbing all
of this. Chouinard grabbed a gun from his bedroom (he had five guns
in the house, including a .357 Magnum and an assault rifle), loaded
it, and pointed it at his head. He asked his wife if she wanted him
to kill himself. According to the officer, Erica said, ``Don't,
Bobby. Your son needs you. And I need you.''
</P>
<P>
   He then pointed the gun at his wife's head. Eventually, he
relented. He dropped the gun, picked up his son, and told his wife
to leave. As she prepared to leave the house, police arrived,
responding to a 911 hangup.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, how did the Rocker debate become bigger than this
story?
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard was charged with aggravated assault. If convicted, he
could spend as many as 15 years in prison. He was released by the
Diamondbacks last week. He said he is receiving counseling. But
there is nothing that prevents another team from signing him to a
contract and, if that team chooses, using him out of the bullpen on
Opening Day. Baseball fans know the state of pitching today, which
means someone will be tempted to pick up a righthanded reliever
with decent numbers (5-2, 2.68 ERA) who can throw strikes. What
will Selig say if Chouinard pitches before Rocker this season?
</P>
<P>
   And us. What should we say? Are we so superficial that even our
outrage is tied to celebrity? Most people remember the Braves'
Rocker running out of the bullpen and screaming on the mound.
During the playoffs, he was my favorite person to watch. But who
has heard of Chouinard, an unremarkable middle reliever who had 32
appearances with Arizona? The message seems to be that you can
escape national media judgment (and a suspension), even if you
pummel your wife and psychologically scar your child. The trick,
apparently, is that you can't be too famous.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple weeks, there have been waves of criticism for
Rocker and his words. There has been commentary about Ray Lewis, a
pro football player who has been accused of murder in a case that
is still, by most accounts, unclear. But there is no national rage
at Chouinard, whose actions are as clear as they are sick.
</P>
<P>
   As many battered women can tell you, Chouinard's deeds are the
type that can turn a home into a domestic gravesite. So, yes, there
is obviously something wrong with him. But if we don't give that
story equal treatment as we do with some of the others, there is
something wrong with us, too.

 NEW YORK: real world. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of generally avoiding direct engagement with
Giuliani and not offering many specific proposals of her own,
Clinton asserted that there were clear differences between them,
notwithstanding their agreement on a number of issues that
typically divide Democrats and Republicans, including support for
abortion rights and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even though Clinton went out of her way to complain
about the tax burden faced by Westchester homeowners, like herself
_ a complaint that has historically reaped dividends for
politicians running for office in Westchester _ she criticized
Giuliani for supporting the large tax cut pushed by Republicans in
Washington. Democrats have instead endorsed small, targeted tax
reductions in order to use some of the surplus for Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that education would be the main issue in the
campaign, a reflection of a series of polls that suggest that the
topic is the top concern of New York voters and a vulnerable
subject for her opponent. Clinton criticized Giuliani for
supporting school vouchers, which she argued would drain money from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said that she supported some forms of competency
testing for teachers and school standards for children. Asked
whether she supported merit pay, Clinton said she favored ``pay for
performance,'' which she said she would elaborate on in a speech
devoted to education in Syracuse on Tuesday as part of her
statewide tour this week. Clinton has the backing of the teachers
union and a sizable bloc of labor support, which Giuliani's aides
have suggested could undermine any of her efforts to effect real
school reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated that she would take the advice of some
Democrats and, in effect, nationalize her contest against Giuliani
by characterizing a vote for the mayor as a vote for a Republican
majority in the Senate. She went so far as to suggest that she
believed the Democrats could capture the Senate this year, a view
that is not shared by most political professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republicans need any more votes to block
campaign finance reform, or turn back the clock on our budget and
deficit policies, or to side with the majority of Republican
leadership on issues ranging from school vouchers to whether or not
we deal with health care in a step-by-step way to try to eventually
reach a goal of providing quality affordable health care for
everybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton seemed eager to hold Giuliani accountable for
the actions of fellow Republicans in Washington, she seemed
reluctant to grant him too much credit for changes that have taken
place in New York under his watch. Clinton said that much of the
credit for the drop in crime in the city was due to federal funding
for new police officers, and the policies of the former police
commissioner, William Bratton, who was appointed by Giuliani,
though the mayor has since had a falling out with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find me trying to claim that nothing good
has happened in New York,'' she said. ``I love New York City. I
mean, if I weren't excited about living in New York City and
excited about the quality of life here, I wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Clinton has told friends in recent weeks that she
has been startled by what she sees as the ferocity of some of the
coverage of her, and by the speed with which some of her earliest
supporters have retreated as her campaign seemed to stumble. She
made no such observations in the interview, though, and instead
praised the state's Democratic leaders and presented herself as a
candidate who had fallen more than once while climbing an unusually
sharp learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a candidate, and being a candidate in the toughest
political environment in America, which I don't think there's any
doubt about, is a real challenge,'' Clinton said, playing with a
pair of reading glasses and sipping a cappuccino as she settled
into a couch in the office she shares with her campaign manager,
Bill de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, which begins with her speech Sunday, amounts to
reintroducing herself to voters. This comes after she has spent
most of her time in the White House in self-imposed isolation,
particular- ly since her failed campaign for na- tional health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, her aides regard her reintro- duction as perhaps the most
impor- tant task facing her in the speech and in the weeks ahead,
and it is remi- niscent of what her husband did in the spring of
1992. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Then, he and his chief political advisers, including Mrs.
Clinton and Mandy Grunwald, who is working for Mrs. Clinton in this
campaign, wanted to blunt negative portrayals of him as a
draft-dodger and womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   In remaking his image, they recruited Linda Bloodworth-Thomason,
the Hollywood television producer, to create a biographical film
introducing Bill Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. Ms.
Bloodworth-Thomason has prepared a similar film to introduce
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   She and her advisers hope the film will help to rehabilitate her
own image and try to establish that she has accomplishments, as a
lawyer and an advocate for children, that are not dependent on her
husband's record.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that has been obscured, she said, by attacks on her and
the president. Asked if she still believed they were a target of a
``right-wing conspiracy,'' as she first volunteered when the Monica
Lewinsky scandal erupted, she said: ``If you look at the mailings
that all of these groups are sending out _ I don't know if they're
part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. But they are certainly part
of a broad network of people who are all aiming their ammunition
against me because I don't believe what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said many voters, particularly women, had unfavorable
views of her merely because they had superficial information about
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the small groups I've been meeting with _ primarily of
women _ a lot of women become very skeptical, because they have an
idea in my mind of what I am going to be like,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
``They think I must kind of be carried around in some kind of a
chariot, with liveried servants, or something. So when they meet
me, and we start talking about what life is like, and what my
experiences have been like, we have an immediate bond.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not dispute the lament of her supporters that she has
run a timid and unadventurous campaign. She said she had made a
calculated decision to hold back until she learned the terrain of a
state where she had never lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural conclusion for some people to draw because I
deliberately set out to listen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring, she added: ``Look. I've had to learn how
to be a candidate. This is not something that, you know, I woke up
in July and went to Senator Moynihan's farm and said, `Here I am,
world, I'm a great candidate!' I've had to learn a lot.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The US women's national soccer team
rapidly transformed itself from novelty act to serious business in
the 1990s. The team has walked a fine line between the identities
since winning the Women's World Cup in July, drawing big crowds for
a showcase tournament, then arranging a renegade indoor tour, and
going on strike against the US Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the next generation of players seems to have
spontaneously burst onto the scene. And coach April Heinrichs, who
was named to replace Tony DiCicco last month, is moving quickly to
update the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs, 35, who was one of the team's pioneering players from
1986-91, will have six teenagers available for Sunday's game
against Norway. She brought 12 players who were 20 years old or
younger to camp, and many of them will play Sunday or in a
closed-door scrimmage against the Norwegians Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be time to move on for Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly,
and Michelle Akers. But what about Brandi Chastain, Joy Fawcett,
and Carla Overbeck?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have starters, we don't have veterans,'' Heinrichs
said. ``We have players who are older and players who are younger.
I'm not making a statement. This is not a youth movement. But I
want to assess the younger players who are capable of competing.
There are bright young players coming up and they are going to
define themselves. In some ways we are still looking for the next
Pele.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of the newcomers appears to be 17-year-old Nandi Pryce,
a 5-foot-10-inch defender from Casselberry, Fla. Pryce, who will
start Sunday, capitalized on the player strike to make a strong
impression as the United States won the Australia Cup last month.
She shut down opposing strikers as the reconfigured defense
contained the Czech Republic (8-1), Sweden (0-0), and Australia
(3-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Nandi on the Under-20 team and she struggled,''
Heinrichs said. ``But you could see that if she could get a chance,
she could get better. And now she's starting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs knows about precociousness. She retired as a player at
26 after the United States won the first Women's World Cup in
China, but had actually started her coaching career the previous
year at Princeton. Heinrichs developed directly through the US
national team system under Anson Dorrance, who also coached her at
the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Heinrichs represents an evolution of that system. She has
made some difficult decisions, dropping the federation's young
player of the year (Lorrie Fair), and three World Cup starters
(Cindy Parlow, Tisha Venturini, and Sara Whalen). Plus Danielle
Fotopoulos, whose 11 goals in 26 games is the fourth-best strike
rate among active players, was not even invited to the 35-player
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   These are potentially controversial moves, though Heinrichs
seems prepared to confront criticism and the possibility of
unrealistically high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put April Heinrichs's name over the growth of the
team,'' she said. ``The growth of the team is far more important.
This week couldn't be a failure, because the goal is to evaluate.
It would be a tragedy if we didn't do that.''

WOODS IS SLOWED BY HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The birdie was the third in four holes,
and Tiger Woods could only shake his head, laughing. The charge was
on? Most certainly.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were his charge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it belonged to his amateur partner, Jerry Chang, who
was just one of the intriguing sidelights to a tournament that
supplies plenty of them. Chang, a 4-handicapper and Woods's former
roommate at Stanford, made four birdies going out at Spyglass Hill
and helped vault his team into the lead of the pro-am division.
That, of course, has nothing to do with the significant cause for
attention here at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am _ a possible sixth
straight tournament win by Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That chore remains Woods's, though he made things more difficult
for himself  &UR; yesterday &LR;  as a brilliant day of ball-striking was
thwarted by an indifferent putter. Starting the day two shots off
the lead, Woods shot 73_141 at Spyglass Hill and lost serious
ground to Vijay Singh (67_133) and Notah Begay (68_134), both of
whom took advantage of adequate conditions at Pebble Beach to take
over the top spots at the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded Matt Gogel, a Nike Tour graduate, shot 68_137 at
Poppy Hills and moved into third place. Rocco Mediate (69_138 at
Pebble Beach) and Mark Brooks (68_138 at Spyglass) are next, while
a four-player group at 139 includes Tom Lehman (70 at Pebble).
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 3 under and eight shots back, moves to Pebble Beach for
 &UR; today &LR; 's third round and would not mind putting up something as
sparkling as Singh's effort, a bogey-free tour that included a
holed-bunker shot for birdie at the par-3 fifth. When Singh made
another deuce, ``a 7-iron'' at Pebble's delicious 102-yard seventh
hole, Singh had it to 10-under, a score Woods certainly had to take
notice of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy out there,'' said Singh, despite the fact he
made it look so. ``I think with the wind blowing it's the hardest
golf course out of the three.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind always blows out here on the edge of the Pacific, the
question is whether it is howling. For Round 2, it wasn't, at least
not like it had been Thursday and Friday when tournament directors
needed both days to get in the first round. Instead, Singh
discovered a cross-wind that was testy, though negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Begay, two groups behind Singh, discovered answers blowing in
the wind, too. He played with Woods at Stanford and has a Nike Tour
round of 59 on his resume, but is gaining notoriety for his recent
decision to plead guilty to drunk driving charges and accept a
one-week jail term. More rounds like  &UR; yesterday &LR;  will remind folks
that he can play a little, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make eight birdies every day,'' said Begay, who,
like Singh, will play Spyglass Hill  &UR; today &LR; . ``I didn't play the
par 3s very well (three of his four bogeys), but all things
considered, I'm just very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment that will not be shared by David Duval, who
had shared the first-round lead with Singh and Begay. Like Woods,
he played the back nine at Spyglass first and when he made bogey at
the par-4 10th with a wedge in his hand, then failed to birdie the
reachable 528-yard 11th, there were sure signs it wasn't his day.
</P>
<P>
   Duval made the turn in 39, did not make a birdie, and shot 76 to
tumble nine strokes out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who missed a handful of legitimate birdie putts going out
on Spyglass's back nine, was hurt by an old nemesis _ putts in the
6- to 10-foot range. He missed a bushel of them, particularly early
when he could have set things in motion. But the only birdies he
did make going out were tap-ins at 11 (his 13-footer for eagle
stayed on the lip) and 18 (he nearly holed his wedge from fairway
rough).
</P>
<P>
   Though he got it to 6-under early on his second nine, Woods
bogeyed three holes down the stretch to end a streak of 13
consecutive rounds of par or better.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not the streak that people are interested in,
a streak that could very well end. How would Singh feel about
putting a stop to it? ``I'm not really worried about his streak,''
said the man from Fiji. ``Sooner or later somebody's going to break
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this week. But keep in mind as he prepares to tee off
two straight days at Pebble Beach that in 1997 Woods shot 63-64 on
his weekend rounds at Pebble, stormed from 10 shots back, and
finished just a shot out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also in the field is Steve Scott, the young man who had a chance
to alter golf history when he took on Woods in the 1996 US Amateur
at Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon. He had a five-hole cushion through the
 &UR; morning  &LR; 18, then was 2 up with three to play. We are no longer
amazed by Woods, but we were that day when he stormed back to stun
Scott and win a third straight US Amateur title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch (the tape) once in a while,'' said Scott, whose
first-round 68 was the biggest surprise here. He was two shots off
the lead, tied with, among others, his Amateur opponent from four
years ago. ``It was a great day. They estimated about 15,000 people
watched the match. It gives me chills just thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Woods's amateur finale, of course. A few weeks later he
made his pro debut, within nine weeks he had captured two PGA Tour
events, and eight months later he was a legend forever with an
incredible Masters triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Scott? He went back to the University of Florida, struggled with
his game, and became an answer to a trivia question. Now that he
has graduated and turned pro, he hopes to improve on that status,
though things have gone slowly. He failed to make it through
Qualifying School last fall and is destined for a year of Buy.com
Tour events and perhaps even a trip to the Hooters Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to take advantage of my opportunity that I've
got this week,'' said Scott, who received a sponsor's exemption. He
is one guy who won't complain about the 180-player field (normal
Tour events are 150).
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriend who caddied for him in 1996, Kristi, is now his
wife, and still his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really keeps me focused,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   As for his opponent in that memorable amateur match, Scott said
he renewed acquaintances with Woods before teeing off Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not buddy-buddy, talking to each other every night,''
said Scott. ``He's gone his own way and I have been doing amateur
golf. He has done some pretty phenomenal things, though.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Poppy Hills remains not only the easiest of the three courses
used in the rotation here, but also the least popular. Paul Azinger
once said the best thing about it was ``the 19th hole,'' and
O'Meara, who has made a career out of winning this event, is vocal
in his dislike. When a spectator asked him how he liked the course
now, just seconds after nearly making a hole-in-one at the 15th,
O'Meara snapped: ``I still don't.''

DUTCH GAIN GOOD FOOTING

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The Dutch fans showed up with a brass band and
wooden shoes and enough orange garb to outfit a forest full of deer
hunters. Before lunchtime on Friday, they were already roaming
around the Grand Avenue mall downtown. ``When can we begin to
drink?'' they inquired.
</P>
<P>
   The folks from the frozen canals invented long-track
speedskating and the annual world all-around championships are
their Super Bowl. And after dominating last year's Olympics in
Nagano on the clap skates they invented, the Dutch figure they
might as well start off another century on the same footing.
</P>
<P>
   So after Saturday's first day at the Pettit National Ice Center,
the Netherlands was sitting 1-2-3 in the men's standings with
Gianni Romme, Ids Postma, and three-time champion Rintje Ritsma,
and had a good chance for a women's medal with Tonny de Jong in
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a pretty good chance to be the champion,'' said
Romme, who's making his all-around debut after working on his
sprinting. ``But I have first to not fall down tomorrow. And I have
to do good races, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The German women, who've won 17 of the last 18 titles, were
having an intramural meet of their own. The only question after
Saturday was which skater would prevail. After Anni Friesinger
wiped out in the 500 and eight-time champ Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann
ran out of gas in the 3,000, the leader was Claudia Pechstein, last
year's runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, it will be a big thing if I can beat Gunda,'' said
Pechstein, who upset Niemann-Stirnemann for the gold medal in the
5,000 at Nagano. ``I think it is possible I can beat her, but she
can beat me, too. I can hope for a good time in the 5,000, but the
1,500 is before.''
</P>
<P>
   Niemann-Stirnemann, who has won the title the last five years,
figured she had to crank it up Saturday after placing eighth in the
500, four behind Pechstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have the same time as Claudia in the 3,000 and
maybe I start a little too fast,'' said Niemann-Stirnemann, who was
more than a second ahead of Pechstein halfway through. ``It took
more out of me than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesinger, who had beaten Niemann-Stirnemann by .26 points at
last month's European championships, was finished after barely a
dozen seconds once her left skate gave way in the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I know I was flying,'' said Friesinger, who
finished the race weeping nearly 50 seconds behind the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I was afraid of was that I would take Jen
(Rodriguez) with me. Luckily, that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the only American woman here, was taken out mentally,
though. ``Anni slid in front of her, there were (rubber lane)
blocks all over the place and Jen lost her momentum,'' said US
coach Bart Schouten.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez ended up 14th, placed a lifeless 18th in the 3,000,
and probably will miss the cut for Sunday's finale after placing
14th overall. Not that the Americans had much chance here anyway.
They haven't won an all-around world medal since Eric Flaim and
Dave Silk went 1-3 in 1988, and no woman has made the podium since
Sarah Docter in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of them even earned a ticket here at last month's
qualifier in Calgary and the men didn't fare dramatically better
than Rodriguez Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The all-around is the national hobby of the Dutch, who use the
long skates the way the rest of the world uses running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   They have speedskating magazines and speedskating chatrooms and
they carry around split times in their heads. These championships
are not only televised live back home, they are broadcast on the
radio. Only the Dutch and the Norwegians will listen to six
consecutive 10,000-meter races in the car.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be interrupting their supper from Amsterdam to
Maastricht Sunday night when Romme, Postma, and Ritsma have at each
other in the 6-mile finale.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as a Dutchman wins speedskating's Super Bowl, the
orange-clad hordes here will be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, in this town of churches and breweries is: How
late can you get a Heineken on a Sunday?

EVERYONE'S WORKING IN NODAWAY COUNTY _ AND SOME SEE THAT AS A
PROBLEM  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYVILLE, Mo. _ Nodaway County is Alan Greenspan's worst
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   With minuscule 0.7 percent unemployment in December, Nodaway
County had the second-lowest jobless rate in the nation. In theory
only 85 persons in the county did not have jobs that month.
</P>
<P>
   That came after Nodaway reported an unemployment rate of just
0.5 percent, the lowest in the nation, the month before.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the government released an early estimate that
unemployment nationwide had fallen to 4 percent in January, the
lowest in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers send shudders through inflation hawks such as
Greenspan. The Federal Reserve, nudged by its chairman, on
Wednesday raised interest rates one-quarter percentage point in an
effort to slow the economy and nip wage-driven inflation in the
bud.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the Nodaway County seat of Maryville, the Kawasaki
small-engine plant will add 50 jobs this year after adding 144 last
year. The Energizer battery plant is adding 50 persons as well. And
Wal-Mart will expand into a Super Center in mid-April, growing from
about 170 positions to about 300.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have pushed up wages and expanded benefits to
snag scarce workers. And enough such moves can kick-start
inflation, the bugaboo of the Federal Reserve, caretaker of U.S.
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   People in Nodaway County are betting that the latest rate
increase will not make much difference in their vibrant community,
even though the numbers suggest that there is no one left to hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Maryville we have an interesting problem,'' said Mark
Jelavich, professor of economics at Northwest Missouri State
University in Maryville. ``We already have relatively high housing
costs. We are not drawing people into town to live, but people are
commuting. Its economic good fortune is spilling over to outlying
areas.'' A farm town with factories
</P>
<P>
   Nodaway County is in northwest Missouri on the Iowa border.
Maryville is on U.S. 71, 100 miles north of Kansas City. It has a
permanent population of 10,660 and a university population of about
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is in a rural area, Maryville has a surprising
amount of manufacturing and a well-educated work force, said
Colleen Hastings, executive director of the Greater Maryville
Chamber of Commerce. A labor study last year found that 97 percent
of adults in a 12-county area had graduated from high school and
that 59 percent had attended college.
</P>
<P>
   Maryville's strength is that it has weaned itself from the farm
economy, Jelavich said. There is evidence that in the 1980s some
manufacturers sought cheaper labor and uncomplicated communities in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure what attracts firms here _ maybe because we are
not a unionized town,'' said Jelavich, who specializes in regional
and rural economics.
</P>
<P>
   Maryville's largest manufacturers are more closely tied to the
global economy than the farm economy. Energizer makes alkaline
batteries, and the Kawasaki plant makes small engines for
all-terrain vehicles and lawn and garden equipment, as well as a
few industrial robots for the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sutton came to Maryville a decade ago to open the Kawasaki
Motors Manufacturing operation in a tire plant abandoned in a 1980s
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   The plant runs three shifts, five days a week. Sutton is
overseeing its sixth expansion.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the plant will have 617,000 square feet and
employ close to 500 ``core workers'' and more than 200 seasonal
workers. With an $11-an-hour average wage plus benefits, it is at
the top of the employment food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, we never have a shortage of people,'' Sutton
said over the hum of assembly-line work and beeping forklifts. ``We
know we can no longer go out and find 50 people tomorrow. We have
to pace our hires and plan accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki and other companies have gotten creative in finding
employees in a tight labor market. Kawasaki's seasonal workers, for
example, come from Kelly Services, a temporary-help firm that
maintains a branch office at the plant. Most full-time hires are
temporary workers who have proved themselves, Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   By learning the art of flexible schedules, businesses have also
found a previously untapped pool of workers in the 6,000 students
at the university, said Mike Boudreau, plant manager at Nebs, a
business-form printer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of one full-time employee, I might hire two students
part time,'' Boudreau said. ``They are quick studies. You just have
to work with their school schedule.'' Commuters from Iowa
</P>
<P>
   Maryville has soaked up the work force from small towns in a
12-county area reaching into Nebraska and Iowa, its labor study
found.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-person job-service office in Maryville, Vonda
Thompson beams about the work they have done. ``Isn't it
wonderful?'' Thompson said about the nearly nonexistent
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   She and Annie Rutherford still see people who always seem to be
looking for work, Thompson said. Most clients, however, have jobs
but are interested in better opportunities. The office is helping
Energizer fill 50 openings and has taken more than 600
applications.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few persons to visit the job office one recent day
was Stacy Kenagy, who drove 25 miles from Braddyville, Iowa, to
apply for a job at Energizer. Kenagy, 31, does part-time home
repair and snow removal but would gladly commute for a good factory
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much opportunity in Braddyville,'' Kenagy said.
``There's a lot more jobs down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those seeking factory work come from lower-paying
positions in fast-food or nursing aide work, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Employers seeking to fill some of those lower-paying jobs have
expanded benefits or raised pay to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of finding and keeping good workers is not new to
Shirley Talmadge, administrator of the Nodaway Nursing Home. She
will hire a good applicant even if she does not have an immediate
opening.
</P>
<P>
   The regional nursing-home company has also added perks such as a
retirement plan, a credit union, paid birthdays off and free meals
for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Talmadge said, ``I don't know if those things will get
people to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   One Maryville fast-food restaurant took a more direct approach.
</P>
<P>
   Employers took notice, chamber executive Hastings said, when its
marquee advertised that it paid $7 an hour for night-shift
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies found they are competing with a segment of
business that they hadn't realized was paying those wages,''
Hastings said. ``They had to evaluate their pay scales.'' Fencing
with Greenspan
</P>
<P>
   Business managers do not see wages spiraling out of control in
Nodaway County. Somehow workers materialize to fill jobs without a
big bump in wages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they concede that the Federal Reserve's latest
interest-rate increase could lower the flame under their
pressure-cooker economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you start jacking up mortgage rates, it will have
some downward impact on housing sales and construction,'' Jelavich
said. ``It might show up with people buying a smaller house, rather
than no house. I suppose that might do what Greenspan wants.''

 REFORM IN FINE PRINT OF McCAIN BILL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act says all you need to know
about the state of the sport today. It has a clause in it that
makes bribery illegal.
</P>
<P>
   That such a section is necessary is bad enough. That such a
section is seen as a ``reform'' is unconscionable, and Arizona Sen.
John McCain, the bill's author, knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery, to the best of my knowledge, has been illegal in most
of the Western world for a long time. If the federal agents who
arrested International Boxing Federation president Bob Lee and
several of his cabal recently are right, however, people in boxing
still believe it's a business perk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the outlawing of bribery is only a small part of the bill
McCain has tried for three years to move into law. It is the part
that gets the most attention because it lends itself to the loudest
headlines, but if the bill ever passes Congress, the changes it
proposes will be far more significant than stopping someone on a
ratings committee from lining his pockets in exchange for rating a
kid No. 3 in the world when he wouldn't be rated No. 3 in a fight
at his own family dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these are Section 5 and Section 10, which address
``conflicts of interest'' and ``protection from coercive
contracts.'' For most boxers, those are the two most critical
things outside of health protection.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first section, promoters would be prevented from
having a financial interest in the management of a boxer. The same
restrictions would apply in reverse to managers. This would make
more secure the adversarial position that should exist between
fighters and managers but too often does not. Cases in point are
the family situations with Don King and his son Carl as promoter
and ``manager'' of fighters and Dan Duva and his father Lou, who
served the same purpose in reverse roles.
</P>
<P>
   There were few instances when Lou was battling his son over a
fighter's pay, and the same is true of Carl and his father. Such a
situation leaves the boxer vulnerable to the caprices of the
sport's businessmen. This is especially true for the majority of
fighters who have little or no star power to give them leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant is the Section 10 protection against
coercive contracts, which have been so much a part of boxing since
its inception. Under current contracts, challengers are denied
title shots if they refuse to sign over options on their future
fights to the champion's promoter. In some cases, those options are
extended even to the champion himself.
</P>
<P>
   Under McCain's plan, Section 10 would impose a limitation of one
year on options a challenger could be forced to give to the
champion's promoter. That boils down to about two fights in most
cases. The bill does not limit a voluntary contract between fighter
and promoter, however, because often a fighter wants to be with a
certain promoter for some reason, while a promoter deserves to be
protected from losing a fighter he has brought along to a bigger
promoter just as his career blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Ali Act addresses both issues shows that
McCain has an unusual understanding of the sport's inner workings,
both from the promoter's standpoint and from the fighters'.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also calls for reforms in the way fighters are ranked,
asking for ``guidelines for the ranking of boxers based upon
objective and consistent criteria.'' That is vastly different from
the way it is  &UR; today &LR; , when it seems fighters are ranked for every
reason but ones that are objective and consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Examples are rampant in every sanctioning organization and every
weight class.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Sections 13 and 14, the bribery laws, that first
caught the public's eye. Under those sections, promoters would have
to report all fees and charges assessed a boxer and disclose all
payments they make to any ratings organization. That also applies
to judges and referees, who historically have been paid not by the
state athletic commissions that license them but by the promoter of
the events they work. The conflict there is so obvious that it
needs to be stopped  &UR; yesterday &LR; , not  &UR; tomorrow &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, one cannot legislate honesty or morality,
which is often what is at issue in the business of boxing.
Legislating against the acceptance of bribes doesn't stop people
from taking them. Bribery requires not only a briber but also a
bribee. It requires a taker as well as a giver.
</P>
<P>
   So, as interesting as that portion of the Ali bill is, these are
the areas that attempt to control coercive contracts and conflicts
of interest that will, in the long run, begin the process of saving
boxing from itself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Ali Act needs to go further. It needs the teeth of a
federally sponsored commissioner to oversee the industry;
prizefighting is the only sport that lacks such a sheriff. While
there are state agencies that patrol the sport, they possess
varying amounts of power. In states like Nevada and California,
there is a good deal of control over the dealings of promoters and
managers, although not enough. But what of states like South
Carolina, where Stephan Johnson fought while still on suspension in
Canada for a brain problem that ultimately led to his death in a
New Jersey ring?
</P>
<P>
   The sport needs a commissioner with the authority to severely
punish managers, promoters, and the fighters themselves, and it
needs federal power to force foreign-based ratings organizations
doing the bulk of their business in the United States to comport
themselves in a way that would result in the elimination of the
word ``shameless'' from every other story written about them.
</P>
<P>
   Until such a commissioner is in place, the rest of the bill,
though well intended, will remain far less effective than it could
be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Prince Naseem Hamed's expected title defense vs. tough Junior
Jones went down the tubes when Hamed's brother and promoter, Riath,
was willing to offer the former super bantamweight champion only
$500,000 to challenge for the World Boxing Organization
featherweight title. Hamed is now set instead to fight former
International Boxing Federation super bantamweight champion Vuyani
Bungu of South Africa. According to Raith Hamed, Jones's people
were ``very abusive.'' According to Jones's people, they wanted to
get paid . . . Hamed will be making his first appearance in England
since 1997, and it will be his 14th title defense since he won the
title in 1995 from Steve Robinson . . . Jacqueline Frazier-Lyde's
pro debut is going from bad to worse. Her opponent will now be an
Eskimo from Alaska after a woman was dropped from the card because
her trainer said she didn't want to train hard enough. Promoter Don
Elbaum, who is hoping to match Frazier-Lyde, the daughter of Joe
Frazier, with Laila Ali, the daughter of Muhammad Ali, said, ``We
didn't want a rumble or a street fight. I don't want this fight to
turn into a circus. It's circus enough.'' You've got that right . .
. Here's World Boxing Association super welterweight champion David
Reid's position on his fight with Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad March 3
in Las Vegas. ``If I do my job, I'll know what to say to Tito,''
the 1996 Olympic gold medalist said. ``Buenos noches. Comprende?''
Guess he's confident . . . Reid said the absence of an entourage
around him is no accident. As a cousin of both Bobby ``Bugaloo''
Watts and Jimmy Young, Reid was warned early and often about the
pitfalls of surrounding yourself with sycophants. ``My main goal is
to stay out of trouble,'' Reid said. ``I'm a young, black man from
the ghetto. There's a lot of temptations out there for a young man
like me. I know all the dangers of not hanging back and not being
cool in the world. I know how dangerous it is. Boxers are known to
be troublemakers, right? A lot of people expect that from a young
fighter. They expect a guy with a big entourage. I've gone down a
different path. Jimmy talked to me a lot about entourages. He said
he'd win a fight and then say, `Round everybody up, the drinks are
on me.' Next thing he knew, he was broke. After he quit boxing, all
of a sudden no one was coming around to his house. They'd gone on
to the next dude. You've got to remember, when they're rolling out
the red carpet for you, when it's over they roll it right back
up.'' . . . Remember Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s refusal to sign what he
termed a ``slave contract'' with HBO last year? Well, he's on the
edge of signing a six-fight deal with the cable network that is
nearly identical to the one he so loudly rejected. Mayweather has
not fought since Sept. 11, not long before he turned down the $12.5
million deal. He is finally slated to fight March 18 on HBO against
Goyo Vargas at the MGM Grand. That would be the last fight of his
present deal, but he and new manager James Prince met with HBO
officials last Tuesday and all sides believe a new deal will be
signed by the time of the Vargas fight. Mayweather has yet to
appear on a pay-per-view show, but HBO intends to increase its
marketing of him to make that possible.

   The British tabloids can be tough. Here is the headline in the
Sunday People over a photo of poor Julius Francis flat on his face
with Mike Tyson standing over him: ``Clown Jules!'' What did they
expect, the battle of Dunkirk? Francis's manager, Frank Maloney,
certainly didn't. ``I'm very proud of Julius,'' Maloney said. ``A
lot of guys would have stayed on the floor. In reality, it was like
a lamb going to the slaughter. This was just an exercise to make
Tyson look good.'' . . . No one in Tyson's entourage, or the
fighter himself, thought he looked good enough to challenge
Maloney's other fighter, undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox
Lewis, however. ``What have Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Vitali
Klitschko, and Ike Ibeabuchi got in common?'' wrote Daily Sport
chief boxing writer Steve Lillis. ``They'd all batter Mike Tyson.''
Tyson may not agree with that, but he did say he wants no part of
Lewis at the moment. ``Mr. Lewis is champion of the world,'' Tyson
said. ``I have to have a few more fights before I'm ready to
challenge him.'' . . . Big loser in England last week was WBO super
middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe, who defended his title on the
Tyson undercard in hopes of looking formidable enough to force a
fight with Roy Jones Jr. After winning an ineffectual 12-round
decision from David Starie in which the crowd spent most of its
time booing, Calzaghe would be hard-pressed to get a fight with Roy
Jones Sr. . . . Lewis, by the way, was just named Fighter of the
Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America, and his
managers, Maloney and Panos Eliades, were named co-managers of the
year. Miguel Diaz was named trainer of the year for handling world
champions Steve Johnston and Erik Morales so adroitly.

TEXAS-SIZED FOOTBALL OUT OF PROPORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   T.J. Mills liked what he saw, and, really, who wouldn't be
impressed?
</P>
<P>
   A ride over on the private jet was nice, and that wasn't the
half of it. Why, there were people greeting him when the plane
landed. When he got to the school, the cheerleaders were all decked
out and put on a show that made ol' T.J. feel truly wanted. And who
wouldn't want a football coach coming off a five-year record of
84-5?
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the tried and true is always tough, especially when
you've been a man of true accomplishment. But sometimes a man needs
to examine new horizons. You don't want to get stale. Nothing keeps
the fire stoked in the belly like a good challenge, and a 4-6 team
that is clearly heading in the wrong direction is a certified
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   So T.J. decided to take the plunge. ``It boiled to: If I didn't
take this opportunity, it would be my last opportunity,'' he
informed reporters.
</P>
<P>
   So say hello to coach T.J. Mills. He'll get $78,000 a year.
He'll get a car. And he'll have a chance to restore the tarnished
glory of Permian High School down there in Odessa, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Permian rings a bell. ``Friday Night Lights''? National
bestseller a decade ago? ``Mojo''? The 1 a.m. coin flip to decide a
playoff spot that was held at a truck stop so as not to be
conducted in a circus atmosphere but was sniffed out and televised
live by a local TV station? ``The Pepettes''?
</P>
<P>
   In case you didn't read the book, H.G. Bissinger introduced many
thousands of dumbfounded readers to the strange West Texas culture
of Odessa, where high school football is not just a game but a way
of life. He spent a year delving inside the goings-on at Permian,
one of Odessa's two huge public high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Did he say $78,000 a year? Plus a car? To coach
high school football?
</P>
<P>
   Yup, and don't think Coach Mills is going to be burdened with
any classroom responsibilities. I mean, come on. Get a grip. This
is football we're talking about. Down there they know how to
separate church (i.e. football) and state (i.e. education).
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like any high school in Massachusetts, that's
for sure,'' said Brockton High mentor Armond Colombo, who presides
over as Texas-like a high school deal (e.g. a 10,000-seat stadium)
as anyone around here is ever likely to have. ``We like our
football, but I think that may be taking things a bit too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   You think?
</P>
<P>
   ``Overdone,'' agreed Boston College High School coach Jim
Cotter. ``There's no balance. It's almost like coaching in Division
2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A totally different world,'' said Norwood High's Tom Lamb.
``It's pretty tough to judge where they're coming from. But there
has to be a lot of negative fallout in a situation like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult for anyone immersed in a
professionally-oriented sports environment like ours to grasp the
importance of something like high school football in a place such
as Odessa, a city of 90,000 that is way, way, way out there in the
West Texas boonies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if someone can hop in the car and head over to Texas
Stadium to see the 'Boys bash the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   But it's even deeper than that. It is totally, totally cultural
in origin. High school football is a secular religion, period, just
as in Indiana the pecking order remains high school basketball,
college basketball, then the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in Odessa or rival Midland will read this and say, ``So,
what's your point?''
</P>
<P>
   They are who they are, and they like who they are. Wimpy Yanks
can just butt out.
</P>
<P>
   The 78K? Shoot, pardner, that's a bargain. Had Jerry Bomar taken
the job, he would have had to take a pay cut. Jerry's already
making $80,000 at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a few people are concerned about the escalating cost
of quality Texas high school football coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when people were making $50,000 a few years
ago,'' sighed Ector County school board member Tommy Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   What brought this all about was, well, what do you think it was?
The W's, baby. There just weren't enough of them. Once-proud
Permian has become a gimme game for its hated rivals. The Mojo boys
were 4-6 last year, and that, of course, meant no one would have to
sweat out a coin flip to see if there would be any playoff action.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Randy Mayes was 23-19. Sure, he's a terrifically
nice guy and he did right by the kids as human beings, but he was
spoiling all those Friday nights for a whole lot of people. Mayes
has been officially ``reassigned,'' and talk about humiliation.
He's been demoted to history teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Broadnax of the Odessa American got right to the point.
``Football is the cash cow,'' he pointed out, ``and has been for
decades in Odessa.''
</P>
<P>
   Things had gotten so bad that people were not even renewing
their season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it sure sounds as if they've gotten themselves the right
man in T.J. Mills. You want to talk W's, how about four consecutive
3A state titles (1994-97) at Sealy High (alma mater of Eric
Dickerson)? How about a four-year run of 63-1, that aforementioned
six-year gallop of 84-5, and a Sealy career record of 134-47? He's
probably big enough for the job, and we know he's properly
reverential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odessa was always like a mythical place to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing sounds mythical to the stunned Massachusetts
coaching crowd, who teach courses and happily accept whatever
financial scraps are thrown their way by local school boards for
their coaching endeavors. Our Massachusetts mentors are not naive.
They were well aware that things are different in Texas, but the
actual truth is almost incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the book, I assumed the author embellished it,''
said Colombo. ``I guess I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read `Friday Night Lights,' '' said Whitman-Hanson coach Bob
Babcroft. ``I would have thought they'd be embarrassed with the
spotlight on them like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, their reaction is just the opposite. This is
actually worse than the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on, coach, sober up. Permian missed the playoffs again. Any
damn fool knows they had to do something.

MOVEMENT TO RELAX ESTATE TAX GAINS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT KEVIN
MURPHY 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For about 2 percent of Americans, it is often Uncle
Sam's final goodbye: an inheritance tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now many people are saying enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   As the booming stock market and brisk economy boost the wealth
of more and more Americans, the tax bite of 37 percent to 55
percent on estates of more than $675,000 is under growing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans and Democrats are even pulling in the same
direction to ease the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, says the tax ``has a
big impact on Kansans, especially farmers and businesses.'' He is
the author of a bill to raise the estate tax threshold to $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Moore, a Kansas Democrat, agrees with Brownback,
although he would raise the threshold to $3 million. ``I
consistently hear from people that the estate tax is not fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `We've worked all our lives, we've paid taxes on our
earnings, and we've tried to accumulate some measure of wealth to
pass on to our children or other persons.' It's a matter of double
taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback calls it a ``tax on dying'' that is increasingly
resented. ``Why force the reorganization of farms into trusts and
corporations and limited partnerships and gifting programs?''
Brownback said. ``It takes the focus from farming, to the detriment
of that farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said families or others who inherited farms or
businesses sometimes had to sell them to pay the estate taxes.
Surviving spouses do not have to pay the tax, but their heirs
eventually will.
</P>
<P>
   One defender of the tax said the perceived effect is misleading
in that less than 1 percent of the amount of all assets in taxed
estates is from farms and less than 4 percent is from businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I object to using the family farm and small business as a
stalking horse to repeal the entire estate tax,'' said Iris J. Lav,
deputy director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
group sympathetic to low- and middle-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed in 1997 gave farms and businesses a break when
taxes were exempted on the first $1.3 million. The $675,000
exemption for other estates was put on a rising scale that reaches
$1 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people affected by the tax is small but growing.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that just less than 2
percent of all deaths in 1999 generated the estate tax, which
raised about $26 billion for the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Another study said the number of people affected would rise
markedly as wealth transferred to the baby-boom generation and then
when the baby boomers passed that on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Welfare Research Institute at Boston College said $12
trillion to $18 trillion in assets could be handed down in the next
two decades. That has to be a tempting pot of money to Uncle Sam,
one supporter of the tax said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think the country would be wise to forgo taxing
that?'' said Paul Ewing, who helps with estate planning for
Prosperity Advisory Group in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall President Clinton vetoed a tax cut bill Congress
passed that would have eliminated estate taxes by 2009. Clinton
said it would ``provide large benefits to a few'' and save $700,000
each to about 50,000 estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really feels inheritors are a class of people you have
need to feel bad about,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is an elite group, it is not a quiet one. Some of the
loudest applause presidential candidate George W. Bush gets on the
campaign trail comes when he says he wants to abolish the estate
tax, according to recent news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Not just the rich seem opposed to the tax. Middle-income people
eying growing portfolios and people who resent the Internal Revenue
Service anyway do not like the tax, observers said. That is
especially true among conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these folks feel that the income tax enforcement
people are the devil incarnate,'' said Gerald Le Van, founder of a
North Carolina company that counsels people on the legal and
emotional aspects of estate planning. ``Some people will go to
extraordinary lengths to avoid taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the estate tax does not really hit the rich as much as
people who favor the tax may think, said an opponent of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the estate tax is some great leveling tool that
forces billionaire robber barons to come to heel, and it really
doesn't,'' said Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union. ``The
superrich have ways to get around it, but those who want to be rich
or just struck it rich don't make out as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepp said the tax had ``spawned a gigantic industry of
avoidance'' and that people who did not use the time or resources
to hire lawyers and planners were hurt most.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to minimize the tax are best made before the person with
the estate dies, but that is often an awkward subject for children
who are to be the heirs, Le Van said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising with parents the question of the tax savings can sound
pretty insensitive, pretty technical and mathematical,'' he said.
Put another way, he said, ``it sounds greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the consequences can be costly, especially for children who
inherit businesses or farms and are sometimes forced to sell them
to pay the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adverse impact goes far beyond just those estates,'' said
Brian Reardon of the National Federation of Independent Business in
Washington. ``It affects employees and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Joint Economic Committee contended that up to
28 percent of small businesses subject to the tax were sold to pay
taxes. But some people say the effect of the estate tax on a
business is overplayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason businesses break up is kids just don't want to run
it anymore or one does and the other five don't, so they want to be
bought out,'' said Bob McIntyre, director of the Citizens for Tax
Justice in Washington. ``Taxes are the least of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   On the farm, the estate tax is increasingly a problem, said Stan
Ahlerich, president of the Kansas Farm Bureau. Aging farmers are
passing on more farms, and many of them exceed the $1.3 million lid
where taxes kick in.
</P>
<P>
   The tax burden can be greatly reduced if wills are written
stating that the farm will not be sold for commercial development,
which is an issue if the land is in the path of urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Support for eliminating or reducing the estate tax cuts across
party lines. For example, the four Republican senators representing
Missouri and Kansas back its virtual elimination, while Democratic
Reps. Karen McCarthy and Ike Skelton also would like to see some
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that is drawing the most attention is sponsored by Sen.
Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican. The bill would eliminate the estate
tax, although it eventually would tax large capital gains not taxed
now because of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the tax completely does not have support from Moore,
who said ``you have to draw the line someplace.'' But he is
optimistic some change will be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Democratic idea; this is not a Republican
idea,'' Moore said. ``I hope people will look at this and say,
`It's a good idea.' &UR; ''

REUNION OF RHODA, MARY FLOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary and Rhoda is the kind of project you really, really want to
be good.
</P>
<P>
   We root for Mary Tyler Moore. How many laughs did her old show
give us? How many comforting Saturday nights as part of CBS'
once-powerful Saturday night lineup? How much of an influence was.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Oh, forget it. Mary and Rhoda is just plain awful, and there's
no way to dance around it.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. The ABC movie is meant to bring us up to speed with Mary's
and Rhoda's lives, to show us what might have happened to two of
the great sit com characters.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary and Rhoda is more like the reunion of some classic-rock
dinosaur band. You recognize some of the hits, but the energy just
isn't the same. Gray-haired rockers squawking out 25-year-old hits
can be embarrassing; the same is true of this.
</P>
<P>
   Mary is now widowed and living in New York. The oversize letter
``M'' still hangs in her apartment, but the similarities end there.
Her late husband was some sort of political type, her rebellious
daughter a student at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda, the great Valerie Harper, is divorced, a vegetarian, New
Age would-be photographer who has been living in Paris. (Yeah,
right.) Her rebel lious daughter is a student at Barnard.
</P>
<P>
   Mary and Rhoda had a falling out, it seems, when Mary pointed
out Rhoda's soon-to-be husband's wandering eye (and hands). So,
will our gals get back together? Will their daughters meet as well?
Is there tension between the mothers and daugh ters?
</P>
<P>
   Clever devil. Nothing gets by you.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mary and Rhoda wind up living together. Mary takes a
job at a tabloid-TV network. (``No nice, no boring, no thinking,''
her boss tells her.) Rhoda finds work as a photographer's assistant
(translation: bagel-and-coffee fetcher). Naturally, as aging women
in youth-oriented fields, they struggle.
</P>
<P>
   At first. It gives nothing away to say that they work out their
problems in true made-for-TV fash ion. What to do when you're stuck
for a story line? Introduce a homeless mutt for Mary to take in! I
kept waiting for someone to contract a rare, incurable disease, but
alas, it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stronger now, more secure now, than I've ever been,'' Mary
says, and that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Mary Tyler Moore Show doesn't really hold up in a
politically correct way; although she was a producer of a news
show, Mary's job basically consisted of getting Lou (``Mr. Grant'')
coffee. Whenever she was given responsibility, she botched it.
</P>
<P>
   But the show was hilarious. Lou's bellowing, Ted's floundering,
Sue Ann's scheming; wonderful satel lites orbited Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Mary and Rhoda. Rhoda has a few funny lines _ a scene in
which a model pleads with her, terrified, ``I can't, I'm scared,
I've heard they're addictive'' only to have the camera pull back
and show Rhoda holding a muffin, is hilarious. But the laughs take
a back seat to movie-of-the-week drama.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that this is how Mary and Rho da's real lives
might have played out _ they would mature, discover other
interests, move on.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Mary and Rhoda, one could also ar gue that no one
needed to make a movie about it. &QL;

DOUBLES JEOPARDY FOR US

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Rick Leach paused at the baseline. He wanted
to make sure everything was right before he served again. The
frenzy in a madhouse called City Sports Centre paused, too, and
4,000 fervent witnesses were so quiet that you could hear an
American drop.
</P>
<P>
   How many million serves had this American struck in his life?
How many thousand second serves during 14 professional years?
Leach, a gangling, 6-foot-2-inch lefthander who had helped the
United States win the Davis Cup back in 1990, went into his motion
once more. The ball rose from his right hand, and he reached for it
and swung.
</P>
<P>
   It was on its way, flying like a yellow bird toward Wayne Black,
slower than usual _ 72 miles per hour _ but spinning ominously.
Flying, flying . . . as everyone watched . . . but dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it was going to be long, maybe 6 inches,'' said
Black, whose heart leaped _ along with that of compatriot Kevin
Ullyett _ at the sight of the yellow bird crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Double fault!
</P>
<P>
   End of a long  &UR; afternoon &LR; 's tense doubles scrap of five sets and
nearly 3 1/2 hours. Almost the end of their wits and possibilities
for the members of the US Davis Cup expeditionary force that has
plunged into Africa on a trek new captain John McEnroe had hoped
would lead to December and the final. Instead they have lost their
way, bushwhacked by the ``dwarfs'' of Zimbabwe, 2-1, in the
best-of-five first-round series that concludes  &UR; today &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the dwarfs against the giant United States,''
pronounced Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, the other day. But
the dwarfs have on their elevator sneakers and are standing very
tall after Black and Ullyett rebounded to nip Leach and Alex
O'Brien at the wire, 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 0-6, 7-5, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   As the most painful second serve of Leach's career touched the
green asphalt, uselessly, the tumult and shouting erupted as if
somebody had flicked a radio switch. Nevertheless, you could hear
Americans drop.
</P>
<P>
   People were singing _ ``Ole! Ole! Ole!'' _ the joyful if
unimaginative lyrics customarily associated with soccer, and
hugging one another at the good fortune of their country. Zimbabwe,
whose international-class tennis players can be counted on the the
extremities of a three-toed sloth (Wayne and Byron Black plus
Ullyett), is 1 point from a monumental capsizing of the US team.
</P>
<P>
   All isn't quite lost. The proposition for the United States:
wins  &UR; today &LR;  for Andre Agassi over Byron Black and for Chris
Woodruff over Wayne Black, and it's on to the second round against
either Great Britain or the Czech Republic. However, history
doesn't speak kindly of such a feat's probability. Only thrice has
the US recovered from 1-2 to win: 1934 over Australia, 1961 over
Mexico, and 1981 over Mexico as none other than McEnroe took the
decisive fifth match from Raul Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fancy meeting you here!'' seems to have been the theme for
these two blind-date teams. Neither the Americans nor the
Zimbabweans had cohabited a court in Cup play before, although
Ullyett and Black had played four previous matches (2-2) together.
</P>
<P>
   Could you have imagined that four such guys of such limited
marquee pizzazz would make the difference in this series? Or that
the anonymous but nimble Ullyett, a stocky 29-year-old in the right
court, would join the cavalcade of mystery guests tormenting the US
team over the years (Paraguay's Hugo Chapacu, Ecuador's Pancho
Guzman, Colombia's Jairo Velasco, Sweden's Henky Sundstrom, and
Germany's Charlie Steeb)?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to Americans who blended positively in
doubles? Leach himself and Jim Pugh a decade ago were the last
dependables; the US team is 10-14 since then. Nobody goes steady
any more. McEnroe, like his predecessor, Tom Gullikson, is a cook
with all the wrong ingredients. Throw 'em in a pot and see what
happens. It's seldom digestible.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these teams looked strong enough to beat the other.
But both ``fought their hearts out,'' to relay an accurate McEnroe
quote. ``John inspired us, got us going,'' said O'Brien regarding
the US revival that began late in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   When Black missed a routine forehand at set point against
O'Brien at 4-5, 30-40, Zimbabwe missed out on a two-set lead and
went into a discouraged decline. It lasted nine games (``a stretch
I'd rather forget,'' said Black) until the US players had built a
2-1 lead in sets.
</P>
<P>
   But Black and Ullyett were picked up by the drumming, tooting,
screaming, packed-house crowd from which forests of red, black,
green, and yellow Zimbabwean flags sprouted encouragingly. They
played the Americans tight until the 11th game of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we should have had them,'' said Leach. Black
double faulted, and Leach and O'Brien combined to win a point of
breathtaking exchanges. Love-30 at 5-6, and the Zimbabweans were 2
points from virtual defeat three times. But Black steadied and
served tough, and Ullyett got him to 40-30 with a flying poach.
</P>
<P>
   They jumped Leach in the next game to catch up. Now it was one
set for the bundle, and maybe a season. Ullyett was in 0-30 trouble
immediately, but volleyed his way clear. Each game was a squirm.
Leach aced his way out of a second break point to 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Black held to 6-5 and took a bathroom break that everybody in
the house felt in need of. It was Leach's turn at the line.
``Golly, we should have won that game. I had 40-15,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   But up stepped Ullyett for his game of fame. His mammoth
backhand return past O'Brien into the alley kept the game going.
Leach slipped on his way to the net, bungling a volley, and it was
deuce. Crash: Ullyett nailed a forehand return by O'Brien. The
audience members lifted the tin roof with their stomps and cries.
Match point.
</P>
<P>
   Fault. ``The noise made everything a blur,'' Leach said. He
looked across at Black, a guy he'd seen too much of over seven
days, even though they're friends and both were All-Americans at
Southern Cal, coached by Dick Leach, Rick's father. Rick and Ellis
Ferreira had defeated Black and Andrew Kratzmann for the Australian
title last Saturday in a monster clash of 4:21 (18-16 in the
fifth).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want another marathon like that,'' said Black, who
crouched to receive Leach's second serve. It was a slice charted
for Black's backhand that went astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for it,'' Leach sighed. ``It didn't work. I'll think
about that serve for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody double faults, of course, and the 35-year-old had
played quite well, with the Leach reach accounting for numerous
poaching points. But this could have been the most costly DF in US
Cup history, the closing point in a match that may have blighted a
Cup-snatching season.
</P>
<P>
   Rick would have loved to reach out and recall that ball, but it
flew away like a yellow bird, and with it the match.

THESE DAYS A HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS ISN'T ALWAYS A STRONG INVESTMENT

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For decades now a house in the suburbs has
symbolized the American dream, and it's where many Kansas Citians
still make their largest investment. But it's not necessarily the
most profitable place to live anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices in Kansas City's older, closer-in suburbs on both
sides of the state line typically grew slower than their county's
average from 1995 through 1999, according to sales compiled for the
first 10 months of those years by the local boards of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Grandview and Raytown are not keeping up with Jackson County's
average home appreciation. Neither are Gladstone and North Kansas
City with Clay County's home appreciation. And in Kansas neither
are eastern Lenexa and Shawnee with Johnson County's housing-price
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, homeowners near Loose Park are seeing higher home
appreciation than those near Shawnee Mission Park.
</P>
<P>
   Older suburbs are not aging gracefully. But a few are doing
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Roeland Park, Kan., Mayor Joan Wendel, for one, has become
downright militant about maintaining home values and staving off
blight. Keep your yard a mess, and she'll throw you in jail.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Mark Seever. He lives in a five-bedroom home on a
cul-de-sac on West 50th Terrace. On this property, according to
city records, the grass was knee high and the house needed paint.
Downed tree limbs lay in a heap. Broken glass littered the yard.
</P>
<P>
   After residents complained and grilled the mayor at a
neighborhood meeting, Seever was ordered by the municipal judge to
either clean up his property or spend eight consecutive weekends in
jail. He chose jail. He served time beginning in December 1998. Now
his house is repainted and fixed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're serious,'' said Wendel, who doubles as president of the
Development and Retention Council of Northeast Johnson County, a
public-private partnership to keep the aging part of the county
economically vibrant. ``Either keep your property up or you suffer
the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the exception, however. In most places the consequences
are borne by home sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star studied home resale prices, not new-home
construction values, for inner suburbs and outlying parts of Kansas
City surrounding the central city. Of 27 ZIP codes selected, 22
fell short of their county's average appreciation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of us, Douglas Gilliam bought a house a few years ago
thinking it would be an investment. After all, it had nice wide
hallways and a suburban address, in Grandview. But when he put the
three-bedroom split-level up for sale in 1998, it sat on the
market. And sat. And sat. Few prospective buyers even toured it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the house at 133rd Street and Corrington Avenue sold in
October 1999. Its $120,000 sale price amounted to an appreciation
rate of 3 percent per year, barely above inflation and hardly
enough to cover Gilliam's improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you own a home five or six years and you make money on
it,'' Gilliam said, ``but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, home prices have been hopping the last five years,
after almost two decades of appreciation that could not keep pace
with inflation. The switch has been good: To economists,
fast-rising prices mean the metropolis is a hot market. And Kansas
City is no longer the most affordable big city in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity, though, is not spreading evenly. Most urban-core
houses, for instance, have surged in price. Meanwhile, the few
inner suburbs where home values climbed faster than their county's
average were those next to the state line, like Fairway and the
Rosedale neighborhood of Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find this surprising,'' said David Warm, executive
director of the Mid-America Regional Council of governments. ``That
reflects something we've observed, and it defines the demographic
tension of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population movement from the urban core has pretty much
stabilized. The new tension is between the edge of the region and
the inner suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing age
</P>
<P>
   Lenexa, Kan., is not exactly the kind of place suburbanites
associate with urban-type instability. Its population is booming,
and its schools still rank among the best in the state. But it is
showing its age in unintended ways.
</P>
<P>
   This past fall, a for-sale sign went up in front of a seemingly
typical Johnson County ranch at West 100th and Monrovia streets. It
had three bedrooms, a finished basement, even a swimming pool. A
year and a half before, the house had sold for $132,500. This time
the price was $135,000 _ a gain of less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch was less than 30 years old _ old enough to need
repairs but not new enough to contain popular modern features like
an open floor plan or a master bedroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that part of town, those houses are reaching an age where
people aren't looking at them,'' said real estate agent Jim Nelson,
who handled the sale for J.D. Reece Realtors. ``They're in a
no-man's land in terms of age.''
</P>
<P>
   Another agent, Dolores Nixon from RE//MAX of Raytown, sees a
similar plight on the Missouri side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raytown is old, and a lot of people want to move out to newer
areas,'' said Nixon, a past president of the Metropolitan Kansas
City Board of Realtors. ``If you have older homes, they need more
renovation and decoration than in the newer suburbs, and that keeps
their appreciation at a lower level.''
</P>
<P>
   Home-sale data reflect that situation.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the suburbs along the state line, almost every other
ZIP code immediately surrounding Kansas City's center core has not
benefited from the late-1990s boom as much as the inner city and
outer suburbs.

   NEW YORK _ It was a tough scene of chewed lips and rapier minds,
working.
</P>
<P>
   Tatiana Cooley, the defending champion, mumbled, shamanlike, her
eyes half closed, her red high-heeled boots tapping.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Cho broke from the starting gate, neck thrust forward, a
stream of words flying by.
</P>
<P>
   Coral Parmar sought a moment of distraction _ blessed
distraction _ in the fine facets of his ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   All were contestants at the Memoriad, known formally as the
annual World Memory Championship. The 20 competitors from around
the nation who gathered at the Con Edison building at 4 Irving
Place Saturday were there to tag hundreds of words, faces, numbers
and playing cards, store them in mental file cabinets, and retrieve
them in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley, 28, a Manhattan resident who works at an advertising
agency, swept the first event, names and faces, by recalling 85 out
of 100 for a new national record. Yet the striking young woman
seemed distressed after the random-word event and strode from the
table.
</P>
<P>
   For that event, each contestant was given a list of 500 words
chosen at random, including ``prism,'' ``drink'' and ``impetigo.''
They had 15 minutes to stare at the words, then 20 minutes to write
them down in the order in which they were presented.
</P>
<P>
   And they were off, hands hooding their eyes, Post-it notes
beside them for scribbling, the maker of the sticky reminders
having stepped in to sponsor the event.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Surran, a restaurateur from Easton, Pa., gazed coolly into
space. Other contestants massaged their scalps or bobbed up and
down. Some seemed to have captured the technique of mentally
stapling words onto concepts to retain them; others seemed lost.
</P>
<P>
   As Surran later explained: ``I have a numbered space ready to
store the word. You have to know what you need to recall and you
have to know where you want to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lists were taken from the competitors and replaced with
blank paper, Surran wrote methodically, as though penning an
executive order to bomb the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley bogged down, brows furrowed and frowning. She performed
poorly, recalling only 25 of the 500. Cho came in third with 65,
while the quiet victor of that event, Christopher Turner, produced
78 words, for a U.S. record.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day, Cooley had recalled her way to an
astonishing feat, emerging as the three-time U.S. champion. She
will fly to London to compete against the world's most retentive
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Eric Chang, a New Jersey high school student, almost
became the world champion by memorizing a sequence of zeroes and
ones, 2,745 digits, in 30 minutes. He was trumped by Dominic
O'Brien of Britain, who memorized the order of a deck of cards in
60 seconds.

HERE'S OUR FINAL ANSWER: WE WANT THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're a game-show nation, with no signs of a change anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The whopping success of ABC's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire _
``Is that your final answer?'' is already fixed in the pop-culture
lexicon _ has spawned imitators, competitors and revivals, with
more on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Already, we can watch Greed, Winning Lines and a resurrected
Twenty-One. Stay tuned over the next few months for remakes of
What's My Line and The $64,000 Question. This summer, CBS launches
Survivor, in which con testants compete to survive on a remote
island _ Gilligan, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   (Be thankful we don't live in Peru, where a show recently
offered people money for licking a sweaty man's underarms and feet
and lying in frog urine. Even Regis Philbin couldn't make that look
good.)
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: How much of this can we take? How many
game shows are viewers willing to watch? And for how long?
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturation is always a danger in television,'' Ted Harbert,
presi dent of NBC Studios, said last month at a meeting of TV
critics. ``If Winning Lines and Greed and Twenty-One and
Millionaire all continue _ which I doubt _ is there a chance that
there is saturation and that this genre, (that) we might end it
quicker than it needs to be (ended)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. It happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Television, like all mass media, is a notoriously
cyclical beast. Westerns have had their day, as have comedies,
one-hour dramas _ even, way back in the dark (or at least
black-and-white) ages, game shows.
</P>
<P>
   But this round of game shows is different. Spruced up, dumbed
down and heavily promoted, these games are the future _ the near
future, anyway _ of TV.
</P>
<P>
   So, why are we watching, any way?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy to answer: Money, according to Bob Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's take the same show and make the top prize $10,000,''
says Stewart, who created such clas sic shows as Password and To
Tell the Truth. ``The endurance will be a lot less, the audience
will be a lot less and the interest in the show will be a lot less.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not the American audience today cares to partici
pate in an interesting game show is still yet to be proven without
big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times, Bob, as discouraging as that may sound. And
not just these times. Any times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our whole being _ get rich quick,'' says Don
Ranly, a journalism professor and self-de scribed mass-media total
nut at the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of no work, get rich quick and the overwhelming
admiration of wealth in this coun try, whether honestly acquired or
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous version of Twenty-One, as near as we can
tell the money won on Millionaire and its spawn is, indeed,
honestly acquired. It's also easily ac quired.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are easier questions,'' says Fred Silverman, executive
producer of the new Twenty-One, and that's by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, we said, `Let's do a show that has
enormous play-along (potential), where the average person could sit
at home and really participate in the game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That is, in fact, one reason often cited for Millionaire's suc
cess _ with easier questions, it's a show the whole family can
watch together, Gramps and Jun ior shouting answers at the screen
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an audience for game shows, but the audience is very
old _ and what Millionaire did was it converted the younger
audience,'' says Scott Sassa, pres ident of NBC West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But at what cost? Forget Beavis and Butt-head. If you want
evidence of the dumbing of America, just tune in to any of the
prime-time games.
</P>
<P>
   Show creator Stewart bemoans the use of multiple-choice and
true-or-false questions, something several games employ:
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the fact that if you never heard the question,
you'd be correct 50 percent of the time. . . . I watched Twenty-One
and saw somebody get $100,000 for showing up. I'm not going to
argue with that, but that kind of content is not going to make a
successful show.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not in the long term, but for right now, it's working
rather well, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   As for the long term, well, that's anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is a demand on the part of the audience, and
as long as the shows are well-pro duced, compelling, entertaining,
whatever, I think the shows will continue to proliferate on the
networks, or in syndication, and do well,'' says Wink Martindale, a
veteran game-show host.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment that shows on the air are no longer interesting to
the audience, they won't tune in. In droves. They'll go away in
droves. But if they're good shows, like a sitcom or a movie or a
drama, they'll be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Making good shows _ that's the age-old trick. Money-grubbing can
take you only so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is going to have to be how fascinating can you
make a game for the home audience so that they get their kicks, not
just from watching big money handed out for almost no reason at
all, but because what they're looking at is entertaining,
interesting and challenging,'' Stewart says.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, however, the answer is simpler than that. In fact,
it's not even an answer. It's a ques tion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, what else is going to come along?'' professor
Ranly says. ``What's next? And what's better? Until something comes
along that can step into that, it looks like they (game shows are)
going to be here for a while.'' &QL;

 2NDTAKE -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK and FINN BULLERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On the Missouri side, resales of Jackson
County homes averaged 31 percent more in the first 10 months of
1999 than they did in the same period of 1995, while Clay County
was up 29 percent. But ZIP codes in Independence, Grandview and
Gladstone registered home-value gains in the low 20 percents. Parts
of Raytown, Hickman Mills and North Kansas City barely kept up with
the period's 10 percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we've all had a marvelous time enjoying
this marketplace. Across the board, everything is appreciating,''
said Judy Comstock, an Independence real estate agent for RE//MAX
Hidden Creek. ``But those ZIP codes aren't some of the best in
terms of the public's perception.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``perception,'' she meant schools with so-so state test
scores and neighborhoods where not everyone kept up their home.
``While we try not to talk about that, it's there,'' Comstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sugar Creek on the Missouri side eclipsed its county's
appreciation rate _ and it had extenuating circumstances, with
Amoco buying up homes near the old refinery.
</P>
<P>
   On the Kansas side, Johnson County continues to lead the region
with a 32 percent rise in resale home prices in the last four
years. But inside the Interstate 435 loop, more ZIP codes
registered below-average gains than above average.
</P>
<P>
   Those above average adjoined the state line, encompassing such
places as Westwood, Roeland Park, Mission Hills, Prairie Village
and north Leawood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, you're close to the Country Club Plaza, close to
downtown, close to a lot of things, yet you're in Johnson County
and close to good schools,'' said Steve McVey, a real estate agent
for RE//MAX Today in the county.
</P>
<P>
   One or two miles away from the state line, however, appreciation
dropped and failed to keep up with the county's overall resale
growth. In fact, in ZIP code 66207, covering southern Prairie
Village and eastern Overland Park, appreciation nearly matched the
most under-performing parts of Independence and Raytown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's happening here is hardly unique across America.
Urban decay spreads
</P>
<P>
   Today's inner suburbs once were the high-growth, fringe suburbs.
After World War II, that is where families fleeing big cities first
landed, and that is where federal government-backed new housing
first was built.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, the inner suburbs are the first places where
neighborhood decay spreads from urban cores. This change,
coinciding with stagnant populations, is spawning studies and new
political coalitions in many metropolises.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota state legislator Myron Orfield led a coalition of
central-city and inner-suburb lawmakers three years ago to gain
more leverage in deciding where road and sewer improvements went.
In Ohio elected officials formed the Ohio First Suburbs Consortium
to fight state policies that provided tax breaks to outer suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere in the suburbs, the older ones are collapsing,''
said Orfield, also an author on the subject. ``The only places that
are not taking part in the growth of the American economy and
housing markets are the inner suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most places, there's not much awareness of this. It's just
emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Kansas City, several inner suburbs are taking steps to
keep blight from creeping in. Merriam, Kan., tore down houses for a
shopping center, hoping to raise revenue for neighborhood services.
North Kansas City has a new community center on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   But reasons often cited for sluggish housing appreciation are
out of a city's control: an aging housing stock; undistinguished
architecture; and the perception that their schools are not as good
those farther out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The optimistic view is that older suburbs recognize the market
forces they face and are taking aggressive actions in some cases to
ensure their neighborhoods remain stable,'' said Warm of the
Mid-America Regional Council.
</P>
<P>
   Roeland Park's Wendel knows what is at stake. ``If the

FAA FEUD NEW HURDLE FOR AMWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A feud with FAA safety watch dogs in Phoenix has added a new
hurdle to America West's recov ery from a year plagued by flight
delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened with fleet limits that would curtail planned growth,
the nation's ninth-largest airline fired back last week, blasting a
Phoenix FAA supervi sor while arguing that it is mak ing progress
in correcting maintenance deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the sniping, analysts say it is unlikely the FAA will
block America West's expansion. Only ValuJet has suffered such a
sanction in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And a 1999 air travel consumer report released last week shows
that America West has re bounded from a dismal summer when on-time
arrivals and other performance measures were far below industry
averages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the airline has ground to make up to reach the industry
standards, and that could put a squeeze on profits. America West is
already spending more on maintenance and could face higher bills
for labor agreements this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regional officials have already moved in to quell the
dispute between its Phoenix of fice and America West.
</P>
<P>
   Left unanswered after the two sides met was what it will take
for the company to satisfy regu lators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues raised by the FAA are routine issues raised when
the FAA reviews the growth plan of any growing airline,'' America
West spokeswoman Patty No wack said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have begun discussions about those issues, and we're
absolutely confident that at the conclusion of those discussions,
the FAA will determine there is no need to put any restrictions on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rosenhahn, FAA supervi sor in Phoenix, in a Jan. 25 letter
to the airline raised the issue of whether America West's mainte
nance infrastructure has kept pace with its growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Rosenhahn said, ``The FAA is advising America
West Airlines that serious consid eration is being given to
restrict ing the company's fleet growth. The FAA will authorize
additional aircraft if the necessary support ing infrastructure is
in place, and the Principal Inspectors feel con fident that the
company is able to safely conduct its operations with an increase
in fleet size.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West was last in on-time performance in 1999
among the top 10 airlines, had the highest complaint rate and
showed a sharp decline in baggage handling.
</P>
<P>
   After a miserable July in which four of 10 flights were late,
America West improved over the past five months of the year to
return to pre-July levels of on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to point out that despite maintenance concerns,
the FAA is emphatic that Amer ica West is safe to fly, FAA regional
spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to limit fleet growth, if it were carried out, would
hinder America West's plan to add flights out of its Phoenix hub
and cut into its profits, said Samuel Buttrick, an airline industry
analyst for PaineWebber. &QL; 
PUZZLED BY THREAT
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think the FAA will follow through on the threat,
based on the agency's track re cord. The only such move came after
ValuJet's fatal crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials ``don't like to be the tough coplike
enforcer,'' said Mary Schiavo, former in spector general of the
U.S. De partment of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Airline analyst James Higgins said he is puzzled by Rosenhahn's
threat and wonders if the local supervisor has a vendetta against
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy sounds like a rene gade'' whose actions aren't sup
ported by regional FAA officials and those in Washington, said
Higgins, of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Rosenhahn's letter last week, America West Chief
Operating Officer Gilbert D. Mook also questioned his mo tives.
</P>
<P>
   `We believe that your issues demonstrate your interest in con
tinuing to promote the conten tious environment between America
West and the FAA,'' Mook said in his written response to Rosenhahn.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenhahn has been silent and regional FAA officials have been
reluctant to talk about the dis pute. They were aware of the letter
to the airline, Dunn said, but Rosenhahn did not have to clear it
with them. &QL; 
MAINTENANCE IS KEY ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of motives, every one agrees and the airline ac
knowledges that improving maintenance is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The question for regulators and for the traveling public is how
quickly that can be ac complished.
</P>
<P>
   Can the airline demonstrate it should be allowed to add three
aircraft to its fleet of 124 this spring?
</P>
<P>
   In its response to Rosenhahn's letter, America West said it has
made significant progress in im proving maintenance and criti cized
the agency supervisor for burying America West with ``frivolous
requests'' for paper work.
</P>
<P>
   However, America West is not blameless and has struggled to
improve, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the needed fixes are increased spending on mainte nance
and competitive wages for workers, Buttrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft maintenance costs in creased 19 percent last year, to
$218 million, while salaries were up 11 percent, to $498 million.
Operating revenue was up 9.3 percent, to $2.2 billion. &QL; 
PILOT CONTRACT TALKS Labor costs are expected to con tinue rising.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots are heading into contract negotiations this spring. Ramp
workers, who service planes at the gates, say they can't attract
workers with the $7-per-hour starting wages. Their union is
negotiating a contract to increase pay, which could help attract
more workers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenhahn cited an acute shortage of properly trained ramp
personnel in his letter. That shortage, he said, has led to
collisions near the gates. In July, an America West aircraft
clipped a catering truck while taxiing. Two planes sustained minor
dam age when they were pushed back into a passenger bridge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the underlying issues is a corporate culture at America
West that Rosenhahn criticized last year as putting profits over
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some America West employ ees, from ramp workers to pilots,
agree. They say management is only paying lip service to im proving
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   `YOU DON'T TURN ON A DIME'
</P>
<P>
   Mook, who joined the company in May as chief operating officer,
has had nine months to overhaul maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't turn on a dime,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Mook has hired more manag ers, tightened oversight of out side
maintenance contractors and upgraded the company's technol ogy to
better manage spare parts inventory and improve staff scheduling,
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is watching _ Wall Street, the FAA and passengers _
for results from those changes, Buttrick said. The com pany's stock
closed Friday at a 52-week low of $16.31.
</P>
<P>
   If the changes don't pay off, the poor performance will begin to
hurt America West's profits, he said. ``Running a less than totally
safe airline is not good business.'' &QL;

BARKLEY DECLARED INELIGIBLE, ST. JOHN'S WINS AND JARVIS SLAMS NCAA
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ St. John's difficult season took a strange turn
Saturday when the Red Storm outlasted Boston College, 59-58,
without its star guard Erick Barkley, who was declared ineligible
by the university after the NCAA said he had violated one of its
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was in the locker room after the game and attended a
news conference at which the St. John's athletic director, Ed
Manetta Jr., and coach, Mike Jarvis criticized the NCAA, saying it
had unfairly singled out Barkley with an interpretation of a
regulation governing benefits for students who are athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The university has appealed the NCAA's ruling, and Manetta said
he expected the NCAA to rule in its favor as early as Monday,
allowing Barkley to play again. The next game for St. John's is on
Tuesday at Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Manetta said the university declared Barkley ineligible Saturday
``under strong protest.'' Manetta and Jarvis said the NCAA rules
interpretation defied common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very confident,'' Manetta said. ``We believe that we
have shown that there was no wrongdoing. The athletic department
stands behind Erick, the basketball program stands behind Erick and
St. John's University stands behind Erick.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis invoked Communist totalitarianism and the Gestapo to
describe the NCAA. He said he hoped and prayed to see the day when
``there is no NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man has done absolutely, positively nothing
wrong,'' Jarvis said. ``I hope that none of you feel the way I have
the last two days, as if someone had come into my house and raped
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Manetta and Jarvis, citing NCAA restrictions, refused to talk
about the specifics of the case. The NCAA, as policy, does not
confirm or deny whether its enforcement division is conducting an
investigation. The NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro was not available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to a university official and an associate of another
university official, the infraction cited was of NCAA bylaw
12.1.1.1.6, which is labeled, ``Preferential Treatment, Benefits or
Services.'' It bars ``preferential treatment, benefits or services
because of the individual's athletics reputation or skill or
pay-back potential as a professional athlete, unless such
treatment, benefits or services are specifically permitted under
NCAA legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged infraction involves a vehicle Barkley is driving.
Though Barkley usually drives a late-model Jeep Cherokee, he
recently traded with a family friend to drive an older but bigger
Ford Explorer, according to the official and the associate. They
said the unidentified friend had known Barkley since he was a boy _
long before he showed talent as a professional basketball prospect.
They also said no money had changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall in a similar case, the NCAA ruled that Jake Voskuhl of
Connecticut did not violate the improper benefits rule when he
borrowed a friend's car to drive to classes. Voskuhl did not miss
any games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. John's officials acknowledged that an NCAA investigator was
on campus last week. Manetta said he was notified by the NCAA of
the Barkley situation on Thursday but insisted that there was no
indication of a widespread investigation of the basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make this perfectly clear: I have never received a
letter or notice from the NCAA indicating that we have an official
inquiry or official investigation,'' Manetta said. ``Let's get that
right out on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The public address announcer broke the news about Barkley
minutes before tip-off Saturday to a subdued crowd of 6,008 at
Alumni Hall. It overshadowed what was supposed to be a joyous
occasion _ Senior Day _ and the Red Storm (14-6 overall, 6-3 Big
East) struggled with an outmanned but persistent Boston College
team that had a chance to deal St. John's its fifth loss in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those seniors, Bootsy Thornton, who made sure that
he and his fellow seniors Lavor Postell and Chudney Gray finished
their careers at the Queens campus with a victory. With 4.8 seconds
left, Thornton sank one of two free throws for his 15th point to
give St. John's a 59-58 lead. But the Eagles (9-12, 1-8) had time
for one more play.
</P>
<P>
   Their superb freshman guard, Troy Bell, dribbled the length of
the court and got off a 12-foot bank shot. It banged against the
glass, bounced softly on the front of the rim and finally skittered
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was good when it left my hand and I looked up
again and it still looked good, and then it just rolled out,'' said
Bell, who finished with 26 points. ``I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Barkley's 16.9 points and four assists a game, as well
as the cloud of uncertainty over the team, Jarvis acknowledged that
his team needed what amounted to a bad bounce for Boston College.
That was especially true after the way St. John's came out on the
losing end of close games with Ohio State and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say things balance out in the end,'' Jarvis said. ``No
matter how or who it's against, we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said he wanted Barkley at the news conference _ though he
did not take questions _ because he ``is getting a lesson in
education and an education in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be proven that he is innocent,'' Jarvis said. ``The
unfortunate thing is that a lot of people will now think he's done
something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the coach took direct aim at the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray I see the day when there is no NCAA, and when
we are guided by the values system with which we are brought up on,
that we fight for every day in this country,'' he said. ``Maybe St.
John's will be a leader in that move. Enough is enough. It's time
for a change.''

FAA FEUD NEW HURDLE FOR AMWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A feud with FAA safety watch dogs in Phoenix has added a new
hurdle to America West's recov ery from a year plagued by flight
delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened with fleet limits that would curtail planned growth,
the nation's ninth-largest airline fired back last week, blasting a
Phoenix FAA supervi sor while arguing that it is mak ing progress
in correcting maintenance deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the sniping, analysts say it is unlikely the FAA will
block America West's expansion. Only ValuJet has suffered such a
sanction in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And a 1999 air travel consumer report released last week shows
that America West has re bounded from a dismal summer when on-time
arrivals and other performance measures were far below industry
averages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the airline has ground to make up to reach the industry
standards, and that could put a squeeze on profits. America West is
already spending more on maintenance and could face higher bills
for labor agreements this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regional officials have already moved in to quell the
dispute between its Phoenix of fice and America West.
</P>
<P>
   Left unanswered after the two sides met was what it will take
for the company to satisfy regu lators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues raised by the FAA are routine issues raised when
the FAA reviews the growth plan of any growing airline,'' America
West spokeswoman Patty No wack said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have begun discussions about those issues, and we're
absolutely confident that at the conclusion of those discussions,
the FAA will determine there is no need to put any restrictions on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rosenhahn, FAA supervi sor in Phoenix, in a Jan. 25 letter
to the airline raised the issue of whether America West's mainte
nance infrastructure has kept pace with its growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Rosenhahn said, ``The FAA is advising America
West Airlines that serious consid eration is being given to
restrict ing the company's fleet growth. The FAA will authorize
additional aircraft if the necessary support ing infrastructure is
in place, and the Principal Inspectors feel con fident that the
company is able to safely conduct its operations with an increase
in fleet size.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West was last in on-time performance in 1999
among the top 10 airlines, had the highest complaint rate and
showed a sharp decline in baggage handling.
</P>
<P>
   After a miserable July in which four of 10 flights were late,
America West improved over the past five months of the year to
return to pre-July levels of on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to point out that despite maintenance concerns,
the FAA is emphatic that Amer ica West is safe to fly, FAA regional
spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to limit fleet growth, if it were carried out, would
hinder America West's plan to add flights out of its Phoenix hub
and cut into its profits, said Samuel Buttrick, an airline industry
analyst for PaineWebber. &QL; 
PUZZLED BY THREAT
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think the FAA will follow through on the threat,
based on the agency's track re cord. The only such move came after
ValuJet's fatal crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials ``don't like to be the tough coplike
enforcer,'' said Mary Schiavo, former in spector general of the
U.S. De partment of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Airline analyst James Higgins said he is puzzled by Rosenhahn's
threat and wonders if the local supervisor has a vendetta against
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy sounds like a rene gade'' whose actions aren't sup
ported by regional FAA officials and those in Washington, said
Higgins, of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Rosenhahn's letter last week, America West Chief
Operating Officer Gilbert D. Mook also questioned his mo tives.
</P>
<P>
   `We believe that your issues demonstrate your interest in con
tinuing to promote the conten tious environment between America
West and the FAA,'' Mook said in his written response to Rosenhahn.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenhahn has been silent and regional FAA officials have been
reluctant to talk about the dis pute. They were aware of the letter
to the airline, Dunn said, but Rosenhahn did not have to clear it
with them. &QL; 
MAINTENANCE IS KEY ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of motives, every one agrees and the airline ac
knowledges that improving maintenance is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The question for regulators and for the traveling public is how
quickly that can be ac complished.
</P>
<P>
   Can the airline demonstrate it should be allowed to add three
aircraft to its fleet of 124 this spring?
</P>
<P>
   In its response to Rosenhahn's letter, America West said it has
made significant progress in im proving maintenance and criti cized
the agency supervisor for burying America West with ``frivolous
requests'' for paper work.
</P>
<P>
   However, America West is not blameless and has struggled to
improve, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the needed fixes are increased spending on mainte nance
and competitive wages for workers, Buttrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft maintenance costs in creased 19 percent last year, to
$218 million, while salaries were up 11 percent, to $498 million.
Operating revenue was up 9.3 percent, to $2.2 billion. &QL; 
PILOT CONTRACT TALKS Labor costs are expected to con tinue rising.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots are heading into contract negotiations this spring. Ramp
workers, who service planes at the gates, say they can't attract
workers with the $7-per-hour starting wages. Their union is
negotiating a contract to increase pay, which could help attract
more workers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenhahn cited an acute shortage of properly trained ramp
personnel in his letter. That shortage, he said, has led to
collisions near the gates. In July, an America West aircraft
clipped a catering truck while taxiing. Two planes sustained minor
dam age when they were pushed back into a passenger bridge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the underlying issues is a corporate culture at America
West that Rosenhahn criticized last year as putting profits over
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some America West employ ees, from ramp workers to pilots,
agree. They say management is only paying lip service to im proving
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   `YOU DON'T TURN ON A DIME'
</P>
<P>
   Mook, who joined the company in May as chief operating officer,
has had nine months to overhaul maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't turn on a dime,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Mook has hired more manag ers, tightened oversight of out side
maintenance contractors and upgraded the company's technol ogy to
better manage spare parts inventory and improve staff scheduling,
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is watching _ Wall Street, the FAA and passengers _
for results from those changes, Buttrick said. The com pany's stock
closed Friday at a 52-week low of $16.31.
</P>
<P>
   If the changes don't pay off, the poor performance will begin to
hurt America West's profits, he said. ``Running a less than totally
safe airline is not good business.'' &QL;

MICHIGAN STATE LEAVES UCONN DOUBTING ITSELF
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ If the Connecticut Huskies were looking
for a break from the rigors of Big East Conference basketball, they
went to the wrong place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Big East foes St. John's and Syracuse over the
last three weeks, the formerly top-ranked Huskies were humbled,
85-66, by No. 8 Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate enough to play against some ranked teams
_ Duke, Arizona, Texas, Syracuse _ and clearly, that is the best
team we have played this year,'' said Connecticut coach Jim
Calhoun, whose seventh-ranked team had won its previous three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played with a terrific level of energy, a terrific level
of discipline in finding the open man. We got drilled on the fast
break and were beaten up on the backboards. They gave us no inches,
no space, they gave us nothing. That is a team that could beat any
team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired it; I hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State set a school record with its 24th consecutive
home victory, breaking the record set in the 1930s and matched in
the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans (17-5) won the opening tip and just about every
other battle. They needed only 2 minutes 25 seconds to build a 9-2
lead on rebounds and fast breaks, and kept it up the entire first
half. It ended with Michigan State ahead, 46-17.
</P>
<P>
   The key play, as such, occurred just 5:37 into the game, right
after the Huskies (16-5) closed to 11-8 on Kevin Freeman's 6-foot
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans started a fast break off the inbounds pass and
finished with a thunderous alley-oop from Morris Peterson to the
freshman Jason Richardson, who finished with 14 points. It ignited
the crowd of 14,659.
</P>
<P>
   On the Huskies' next possession, the Spartans stole the ball and
started another fast break, which ended in another alley-oop, this
one from Charlie Bell to Peterson, who dunked behind his head for
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Those baskets sparked a 20-2 run that gave Michigan State a
31-10 lead five minutes before the half ended. The only thing that
slowed the Spartans was a penchant for traveling.
</P>
<P>
   When Michigan State coach Tom Izzo saw the 46-17 halftime score,
he was ``amazed, just amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was just one of those storybook days,'' Izzo said.
``Everything went our way, and nothing went their way. But don't
read too much into it. That's not the Connecticut team you're going
to see next week or the week after. It was just one of those
days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half the Spartans outrebounded the Huskies by
24-10, dominating both ends. They scored 15 second-chance points to
Connecticut's two, and their bench outscored the Huskies' reserves,
15-0.
</P>
<P>
   Although Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin led all scorers
with 21 points, he managed only two in the first half. While his
Michigan State counterpart, Mateen Cleaves, scored only seven
points, he was content to dish off, finishing with eight assists
and helping four of his teammates score in double figures. Peterson
led the Spartans with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies played without two freshman reserves, Tony Robertson
and Doug Wrenn, who were suspended indefinitely Friday After
praising Izzo and his team, Calhoun was surprisingly philosophical.
``I can't tell you our team is a failure at 16-5, in the top 10,''
he said. ``Today was a test we failed, but this test is not the
ultimate test.''

 BEACH-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Course subdues Woods, Duval
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ It would be a sensational drama _ not to
mention a heaven-sent story line for the rivalry-starved PGA Tour _
if David Duval were the one to step in front of that speeding train
known as Tiger Woods and stop the five-tournament winning streak
Woods has.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to happen that way, however, because Duval is
failing to hold up his end of the bargain. The first-round
co-leader took a big dive Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As for Woods, he's doing his part to end his own streak.
</P>
<P>
   We will find out in the coming 36 holes just how much magic he
can muster. Woods, facing the first of two trips around windblown
Pebble Beach today, is set with a huge deficit (eight shots off the
lead) if he hopes to win his sixth consecutive tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, knocking down five birdies at Pebble Beach and
narrowly missing a sixth at the 18th, fired a bogey-free 67
Saturday to take a one-shot lead over Notah Begay III at the
midpoint of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Singh's
11-under-par 133 total gives him a luxury nobody has enjoyed in the
past six months _ a comfortable margin with which to work against
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who struggled with his putter at Spyglass Hill during the
second round, could do no better than 1-over-par 73 and was at
3-under 141 for the tournament. His round put an end to one streak.
It halted 13 consecutive under-par rounds for him. It also put his
winning streak in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's out of contention, of course. But he's staring at
an uphill climb, especially if the wind continues at Pebble Beach,
which becomes significantly tougher when Mother Nature blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he will get mad,'' said Begay of Woods, his former
Stanford teammate. ``He will come out and probably shoot 65 or 64
or something. It wouldn't surprise anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is a competitor. And not only does he have a real
strong competitive streak in him, he's the best player out here,
hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   But competitive fire and unquestioned ability sometimes are no
match for a putter that won't cooperate. Woods missed a six-foot
birdie putt on the par-3 15th at Spyglass and, aside from an 8-iron
approach on the 18th (his ninth hole) that nearly went in the cup
before stopping a foot away, Woods never got going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shoot myself out of the tournament yet,'' Woods said
after his misadventures. ``If there are two more rounds, I still
have a chance. If there is one more round, then I have to shoot low
and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, whose round took 6 hours, 17 minutes to complete, was
alluding to the fact that the weather is iffy, at best, for
Monday's finish to the tournament. Last year, the final round was
washed out, and that remains a possibility this year.
</P>
<P>
   But if there are 36 holes remaining, it's worth noting that
Woods has gone extremely low at Pebble Beach before. In 1997, he
finished 63-64, with both rounds on the Pebble Beach links, and
finished just a stroke behind good friend Mark O'Meara. It might
take a similar finish for Woods to draw even with Ben Hogan's 1948
streak of six consecutive PGA Tour wins.
</P>
<P>
   Given Woods' winning ways, nobody's jumping off his bandwagon
just yet, although Singh said he was paying little, if any,
attention to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about his streak,'' Singh said. ``I'm
just going to go out there and try to win the golf tournament. If
I'm the one to do it sooner or later, somebody's going to break
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, whose best finish in the first month of the season is a
tie for eighth at the Mercedes Championships, holed out a bunker
shot on the par-3 fifth hole to highlight his round, which Singh
was glad to get finished as the wind began to blow harder as the
day progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you get a little wind, Pebble becomes the hardest
of the three courses here,'' Singh said. ``If you go out there on a
nice day, you can't find a better place to play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Singh is rooting for a gale-force breeze since he'll
be in the relatively secluded forest at Spyglass Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As Begay said, playing at Pebble is a crapshoot at best. He too
was glad to have his round today scheduled for Spyglass Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're going to make some bogeys at Pebble,'' Begay
said. ``I knew standing on the tee that I was going to have two or
three of them because the wind was blowing so much. Unfortunately,
I had four.''
</P>
<P>
   But he offset them with eight birdies for his 4-under 68.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it will be Woods and other marquee pros and amateurs such
as Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Ken Griffey Jr., John Elway, Ray
Romano and Huey Lewis who must tackle Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Both Woods and Duval will start with much ground to make up
against Singh and Begay.
</P>
<P>
   Woods bogeyed three of his last seven holes. Earlier in his
round, he missed several putts in the 10- to 18-foot range that
could have gotten him off to a better start.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Woods was in better shape than Duval, who started the
second round tied with Singh and Begay.
</P>
<P>
   Duval didn't make a single birdie at Spyglass in shooting a 76,
and the four bogeys dropped him to 2-under 142 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Like Woods, Duval's putter was the culprit. He had a 12-foot
downhill putt for birdie on No. 11, his second hole of the round,
but left it more than a foot short. Duval has said early in the
season that his putting isn't as good as he would like it to be.

PRADA'S VICTORY MEANS NO AMERICANS IN AMERICA'S CUP FINAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ For the first time in the 149 years of
competition for sailing's oldest and most revered prize, there will
be no American boat in the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Prada Challenge Sunday sailed into the history books _
and into the 30th America's Cup match _ by disposing of San
Francisco's America One in the deciding race of the best-of-9 Louis
Vuitton challenger finals. The winning margin was 49 seconds. As
the winner of the challenger's series, Prada will now face Team New
Zealand for the America's Cup beginning on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the second time an Italian syndicate has challenged
for the cup.
</P>
<P>
   The race committee postponed the start of Sunday's deciding race
for about 50 minutes while waiting for a reluctant breeze to fill,
and for much of that spell there was a distinct possibility that
the day's action would be canceled for want of wind. But then a
14-knot southwesterly materialized, and the gun to sound the
starting sequence was sounded.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no reprieve for America One on this day.
</P>
<P>
   The Hauraki Gulf churned in the wakes of an estimated spectator
fleet of more than 1,400 vessels, adding bouncy seas to what would
surely be a day of significant wind shifts, fluctuating air
pressure and challenging sailing conditions. But a race of this
consequence required nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   The overhead view of the gulf was a patchwork of blue, the
lighter shades representing windless holes, the deeper hues
darkened by flowing wind. The day's trick would be to exploit the
latter and forsake the former.
</P>
<P>
   Prada and America One entered the starting area at the
five-minute gun and immediately engaged in a ballet for position.
Paul Cayard, the America One skipper, and his tactician, John
Kostecki, clearly wanted the right-hand side in belief that the
breeze would swing west.
</P>
<P>
   Muscling inside the Italian boat, the Americans got what they
wanted and hit the line sandwiched between Prada and the committee
boat, their early strategy unfolding to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans tacked to port soon after to work the
course's right-hand side, Prada immediately followed. The Italians
would not on this day abandon the fundamental rule of match racing
and allow the American boat to wander away unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   The breeze pumped up and down between 11 and 15 knots as the
boats continued to hold identical course headings to the right.
Then, America One tacked back toward the center of the course, and
on this first possible crossing it appeared Prada could not make it
past the U.S. boat.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this up-and-down series, it seemed neither team held
a perceptible edge in boat speed. But now, in Sunday afternoon's
moderate breeze and relatively flat water, Prada seemed to have a
slight advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Italians, the timing could not have been better. The
second time the two boats came together in an upwind crossing
situation, Prada made it across. Now, the Italians were clearly in
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went as the two boats began to engage in a spirited
tacking duel, the Americans probing to find a passing lane, the
Italians scrappily answering each maneuver in a bid to maintain
their lead.
</P>
<P>
   With each tack, the Italians pulled ever so slightly ahead. The
gains, measured in meters, were small but they were consistent. In
fact, the Prada tacks were like body blows in a boxing match. Each
one was taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing the mark, the Italians were headed by a radical
left-hand wind shift, and for a moment Prada came bolt upright as
helmsman Francesco de Angelis momentarily lost control of his
wheel. But he covered quickly, and the Italians rounded the mark
with a 34-second lead.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cayard had no way of knowing it at the time, the race,
his bid to return to the America's Cup finals that, ironically, he
sailed in as skipper of Italy's Il Moro de Venezia syndicate in
1992, was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians continued to extend their lead, slowly but surely,
on every consecutive leg, upping their margin at the following
turning marks and opening up a 1:06 gap with one leg to go.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in many ways, an ill-fitting conclusion to what had been
a remarkable back-and-forth regatta between two syndicates that had
collectively spent over $80 million on their campaigns, and which
had been favorites to advance to the challenger finals from the
outset of the trials, which began last October.
</P>
<P>
   In the deciding series, unlike so many America's Cup matchups in
recent memory, the outcome of most races came down to the sailors
themselves. Cayard's crew supposedly held the upper hand in
close-quarters tactical dueling, but Prada's team held their own
and even prevailed when the going got tough. In so doing, they
pulled out to a quick 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Cayard vowed he would rally, and he then made good at his
word. &QL;

   Those who prefer the term ``firearms enthusiast'' to ``gun nut''
say we never put stories like this in the paper. But here it was,
in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it one of those stories they say we never give a
prominent position in the paper. But here it was, on Page B1.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it one of those stories we never put on the front
page. Although, the story did make what amounts to Page 1 of The
Arizona Repub lic's Web site Tuesday, under the headline ``Woman
kills rape suspect in her home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it one of those stories about self-defense and
firearms that gets ``buried'' by the mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back here, to the actual paper, and the story of
an Apache Junction woman who came face to face with an intruder in
her home early Tuesday and wasted him.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several fol low-up stories on the shooting, both
in the newspaper and on television and radio. Appar ently, leaders
of the left-wing media conspiracy to keep stories involving
``positive'' gun use from seeing the light of day forgot to send
out a memo.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, a man named Erick Ramirez Fu entes
kidnapped a woman from a Chandler Wal-Mart, drove to the desert,
raped her, shot her and left her for dead. The woman survived,
however, and already is out of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes then allegedly broke into the Apache Junction home of
Bricie Tribble and her hus band, threatening to kill them. Instead,
Tribble took a pistol kept in the home for protection and shot
Fuentes dead. Apache Junction police told me that the investigation
into the shooting isn't concluded yet. For one thing, Fuentes
apparently once worked for Tribble's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the basic story proves a point often made by Charlton
Heston and associates:
</P>
<P>
   There are times when a hav ing a firearm handy could save your
life.
</P>
<P>
   It's true.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when having a gun could save your life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the gun holder is untrained or a lousy shot, it
won't help much. The victim might miss the bad guy and hit someone
else. Or the bad guy could take the gun away and use it himself.
But let's say that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, if everyone who was about to be attacked by a
criminal had a gun, crime rates would drop.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since we can't tell in advance who is going to be attacked, does
that mean everyone should carry a gun?
</P>
<P>
   And is one gun enough?
</P>
<P>
   If the family is all together, maybe, but what if Dad is at work
and Mom is shopping and the kids are at school? Does each member of
the family need a weapon?
</P>
<P>
   And since it's sometimes in convenient or illegal to carry a
weapon in a purse or a pocket or a school lunch box, should weapons
be positioned through out our homes and automobiles and places of
work, just in case?
</P>
<P>
   Or is that the kind of thinking that makes gunshot wounds one of
the leading causes of death for young people in America?
</P>
<P>
   And does that kind of attitude explain statistics that show that
guns kept in a home are 22 times more likely to kill a fam ily
member or friend?
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the secret anti-gun conspiracy actually have no
reason to hide stories about pos itive gun use.
</P>
<P>
   They're useful for compari son. For example, in 1997, there were
190 justifiable handgun homicides in the United States. That same
year, the overall number of men, women and children killed by guns
in mur ders, suicides and accidents was over 32,000. &QL;

EAST GERMAN SWIMMERS SEEK TO PROVE DAMAGES FROM STATE'S STEROIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 2nd graf to clarify name) 
 (jw) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In 1972, a committee from the swimming federation in
the East German town of Halberstadt went to the local primary
school looking for children who wanted to take part in a swimming
program. Six-year-old Martina Fehrecke loved to play in the water,
so she raised her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as she recounts her experiences with the East German
national swimming program, the girl who is now Martina Fehrecke
Gottschalt says she wishes she had sat still that day in school.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out, she grew up too fast and still carries the
bitter reminders of being one of the victims of a systematic East
German doping program that claimed dozens of casualties through the
unknowing wholesale use of anabolic steroids. Scores of swimmers,
most of whom never saw Olympic competition, have major medical
problems. Some, like Gottschalt, have children with birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Lothar Kipke, head doctor of the East German Swimming
Federation, who oversaw the drug program from 1975 to 1985, was
convicted last month on charges of doping and causing bodily harm
to 58 swimmers in the latest of a series of highly publicized court
cases. And in May, two other former high-ranking East German sports
officials will go on trial for their roles in doping in the
country's overall sports system.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in Kipke's case did not result in compensation for
swimmers who gave birth to handicapped children, but Dr. Werner
Franke, a German molecular biologist whose research on the subject
was the impetus for the first criminal inquiry into doping two
years ago, believes there is a link.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the taking of male hormones led to
gynecological changes,'' Franke said. ``One of the changes could
have been a shrinking of the uterus, which would have affected the
fetus. The fact that many of the birth defects are in first-born
children is significant. The longer these women were away from the
steroids, the longer their bodies had a chance to start producing
female hormones again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 trial, in which four East German coaches and two
doctors were accused of seriously injuring female athletes, 19
testified that their bodies took signs of masculinity _ deeper
voices or facial and body hair.
</P>
<P>
   According to secret files recovered from the Stasi, East
Germany's secret police, some women were ordered to abort fetuses
that might have been deformed by the drugs. Petra Kind-Schneider, a
gold-medal swimmer in the 1980 Olympics, now has liver and heart
problems. Rica Reinisch, another gold-medal swimmer, has said
publicly that she was given steroids at age 12 without knowing what
they were, and she now suffers from ovarian cysts.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems as well for these swimmers, who are now
in their 30s, said Giselher Spitzer, a sports psychologist at the
University of Potsdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychological implications of being doped are immense,''
the psychologist said. ``These women live with the fact that their
successes were a result of having cheated. Their identities are
still very much connected with swimming, and they now fear that
they are not able to accomplish anything on their own. Added to
that is the fact that these drugs were administered along with
birth control pills. That can have unbelievable psychological
consequences. Most disturbing is that these problems may not fully
manifest themselves until these women are well into middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 10, Gottschalt had so impressed local coaches that she
was invited to attend a boarding school for promising young
swimmers in Magdeburg, the state capital. ``I was a little kid off
to the big city,'' she said recently from her living room in
Halberstadt. ``They gave me a brand new bathing suit. It was all so
exciting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fun stopped the moment Gottschalt stepped off the train in
Magdeburg. Her new school made swimming her life, requiring nine
hours of training a day. By evening, she was exhausted and in
tears, she said, because of constant verbal abuse by coaches. Even
a nose broken in practice one day could not elicit sympathy or a
short break.
</P>
<P>
   She excelled, nonetheless, improving her performances until she
was at the top of her age group. The new routine had its benefits,
like being served bananas _ a rarity at the time in East Germany _
in the school cafeteria. But she also had to take 40 pills a day,
including little blue ones taken under strict supervision. Along
with the pills came orders to keep that fact secret from her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other girls got them, too,'' Gottschalt said. ``The doctors
told us they were vitamins, and we believed them. When you're 12
years old, you don't ask any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure to be the best began to take its toll. One
afternoon, she confessed to the school director that she was having
doubts about continuing with the program. The director calmly
explained that giving up swimming could have negative consequences
for her parents, both of whom worked at her former school in
Halberstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were summoned to the school for an emergency meeting
the next day. She never found out what threats were made, she said;
she only knows that her father said she would have to continue
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she won national championships for 13-year-olds in the
100- and 200-meter backstroke. Her times, 1 minute 8.41 seconds in
the 100 and 2:27.79 in the 200, were outstanding for her age and in
the top 20 among all East German female swimmers. More incredibly,
she beat her best previous time in the 200 by a full three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then I should have known something was wrong,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The files of the Stasi included a report from 1975 by Hans
Schuster, head of the Research Institute for Fitness in Sport in
Leipzig. Schuster wrote that anabolic steroids were prescribed in
both combination and pure form and that they led to a
``considerable improvement in performance.'' He added that the
drugs resulted in ``liver damage and changes in physical
appearance'' when taken by girls and young women.
</P>
<P>
   With women's swimming a government priority, an East German
swimming team that did not win a single gold medal at the 1972
Munich Olympics captured 11 gold medals four years later in
Montreal. Gottschalt, although a long shot, represented one of the
hopes for the Moscow Games in 1980 or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pills, injections, teas,'' Gottschalt said. ``I was always
getting something. They must have been experimenting with new ways
to administer the drugs at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottschalt never made it to Moscow for the 1980 Olympics. As a
junior champion, she was invited to take part in national
qualifications, but she did not improve on her times from the
previous year. The stress and the drugs were too much for her
physically and emotionally, she said. The federation promoted other
young swimmers, including Kristin Otto, whom Gottschalt had beaten
at the 1979 age-group meet. Otto went on to win six gold medals at
the Seoul Olympics in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expendable,'' Gottschalt said. ``We all were. They bred
us to be winners, and there was always someone to take your
place.''

 BERLIN: your place. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gottschalt recalled that in 1981, when she was 15, she left the
swimming school and returned home to hear friends and family remark
about how the little girl had developed into a muscle-bound woman
with a deep voice. Other problems ensued: liver ailments, a
hardening of back muscles. In 1984 she gave birth to a son with a
clubfoot. Gottschalt believes her baby's deformity was a result of
her being given drugs. As years passed and her anger grew, she
wondered exactly what the little blue pills had contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anyone cared enough about what happened to me
to take any interest,'' she said. ``I gave up thinking anything
might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope was restored last year when Gottschalt received a call from
Michael Lehner, a German lawyer who specializes in doping-related
lawsuits. Lehner brought the criminal case against Kipke, and with
the public prosecutor helped try it. Lehner represented Gottschalt
in this trial, along with eight other female swimmers who, he said,
also had children with birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Having read files kept by the swimming federation, Lehner
learned that Gottschalt was a member of the B group of swimmers,
young hopefuls who, according to the Stasi files, were to receive
``supporting means'' to improve their performance. ``Supporting
means'' was code for the drug Oral-Turinabol, an anabolic steroid
manufactured in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner embarked on a search for other former swimmers who had
also been administered the little blue pills and who would be
willing to testify. Court cases involving doping to that point had
involved only swimmers from programs in the former East Berlin.
Lehner widened the scope and found former members of teams in
Magdeburg, Erfurt, Potsdam, Chemnitz, Halle, Rostock, Leipzig and
Dresden who had been similarly doped.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner spoke to Ute Krause, also a product of the Magdeburg
program, and found that her experiences were nearly identical to
Gottschalt's. After Krause left the swimming school in 1981, her
voice was deeper, she had liver problems and she battled
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as the administrator of a nursing home in
Magdeburg, Krause learned more about Oral-Turinabol. Certain
patients were being prescribed the drug to help regain muscle loss
because of illness. In a medical textbook, she read of the link
between anabolic steroids and chronic depression. She made no
additional efforts to find out more about what had happened to her
until Lehner called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppressed what happened to me for so long,'' Krause said
recently in Magdeburg. ``I am still searching for my biography.''
</P>
<P>
   In early January, Gottschalt, 34, Krause, 37, and three other
former East German swimmers were present in a Berlin courtroom for
the trial of Lothar Kipke.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony, Kipke admitted that he had distributed
anabolic steroids to the swimmers but contended that he was unaware
that the drugs carried any adverse side effects other than a
deepening of the voice. According to Kipke, as research increased
in the 1980s, he began administering the steroids in lower dosages
and only in pill form.
</P>
<P>
   Ten feet from Kipke, Gottschalt listened to the doctor
rationalize his actions. When she heard his lawyer explain that
Kipke had only been following orders, Gottschalt exclaimed, ``Say
that to my son's face!'' Daniel, her 14-year-old disabled son, sat
beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Krause seized the chance to address Kipke directly near the end
of the trial. ``He avoided making a direct apology,'' Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner called Kipke a ``monster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives a doctor that right to treat young girls like
guinea pigs?'' Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the one-day trial, Judge Peter Faust ruled that
Kipke had acted with ``willful malevolence'' in overseeing doping
of the swimmers during his tenure as head doctor. Faust gave Kipke
a 15-month suspended jail sentence, the most severe doping-related
punishment meted out to a former East German official.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict provided little solace for Gottschalt, who had hoped
that the link between doping and birth defects would be addressed
at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Faust declined Lehner's motion that the women whose children had
birth defects receive financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to pursue this further,'' Lehner said. ``I am
representing nine clients who gave birth to children with birth
defects.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Berlin program, Barbara Krause, who won a gold
medal on the East German freestyle relay team in the 1980 Olympics,
has given birth to two children with clubfeet, according to Lehner.
She has been unwilling to testify at the doping trials, however,
because of her marriage to Lutz Wanja, a former swimming coach in
Potsdam. Since the Kipke trial, Lehner has learned that a former
swimmer in Leipzig has a 19-year-old daughter with a clubfoot.
</P>
<P>
   In the next trial, for which no date has been set, Lehner plans
to refer again to evidence yielded by the Stasi files, which show
that East German doctors ordered female athletes to take birth
control or have abortions because they feared Oral-Turinabol could
damage fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Kipke, 72, is the 26th East German sports official to be
convicted on charges of doping. They were involved in swimming as
well as other sports.
</P>
<P>
   In May, several months before the statute of limitations runs
out on the prosecution of middle-level East German criminals,
Manfred Ewald and Manfred Hoeppner will have their day in court.
Hoeppner, head doctor of the East German sports medicine service,
oversaw an unofficial group that the prosecution contends was the
committee for all doping programs. Ewald, former president of the
East German Athletics Association, wrote a book chronicling his
control over East German sports.
</P>
<P>
   Gottschalt said she would be in the courtroom once again. And to
current swimmers caught up in the latest controversy over the use
of dietary supplements like creatine to improve performance,
Gottschalt offers her own sobering advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just leave it,'' she said. ``It's not worth it. Let your body
perform on its own.''

SHOOTING A GUN MYTH FULL OF HOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 _Retransmitting to include dateline.

<P>
   (Phoenix) - Those who prefer the term ``firearms enthusiast'' to
``gun nut'' say we never put stories like this in the paper. But
here it was, in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it one of those stories they say we never give a
prominent position in the paper. But here it was, on Page B1.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it one of those stories we never put on the front
page. Although, the story did make what amounts to Page 1 of The
Arizona Repub lic's Web site Tuesday, under the headline ``Woman
kills rape suspect in her home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it one of those stories about self-defense and
firearms that gets ``buried'' by the mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back here, to the actual paper, and the story of
an Apache Junction woman who came face to face with an intruder in
her home early Tuesday and wasted him.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several fol low-up stories on the shooting, both
in the newspaper and on television and radio. Appar ently, leaders
of the left-wing media conspiracy to keep stories involving
``positive'' gun use from seeing the light of day forgot to send
out a memo.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, a man named Erick Ramirez Fu entes
kidnapped a woman from a Chandler Wal-Mart, drove to the desert,
raped her, shot her and left her for dead. The woman survived,
however, and already is out of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes then allegedly broke into the Apache Junction home of
Bricie Tribble and her hus band, threatening to kill them. Instead,
Tribble took a pistol kept in the home for protection and shot
Fuentes dead. Apache Junction police told me that the investigation
into the shooting isn't concluded yet. For one thing, Fuentes
apparently once worked for Tribble's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the basic story proves a point often made by Charlton
Heston and associates:
</P>
<P>
   There are times when a hav ing a firearm handy could save your
life.
</P>
<P>
   It's true.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when having a gun could save your life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the gun holder is untrained or a lousy shot, it
won't help much. The victim might miss the bad guy and hit someone
else. Or the bad guy could take the gun away and use it himself.
But let's say that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, if everyone who was about to be attacked by a
criminal had a gun, crime rates would drop.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since we can't tell in advance who is going to be attacked, does
that mean everyone should carry a gun?
</P>
<P>
   And is one gun enough?
</P>
<P>
   If the family is all together, maybe, but what if Dad is at work
and Mom is shopping and the kids are at school? Does each member of
the family need a weapon?
</P>
<P>
   And since it's sometimes in convenient or illegal to carry a
weapon in a purse or a pocket or a school lunch box, should weapons
be positioned through out our homes and automobiles and places of
work, just in case?
</P>
<P>
   Or is that the kind of thinking that makes gunshot wounds one of
the leading causes of death for young people in America?
</P>
<P>
   And does that kind of attitude explain statistics that show that
guns kept in a home are 22 times more likely to kill a fam ily
member or friend?
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the secret anti-gun conspiracy actually have no
reason to hide stories about pos itive gun use.
</P>
<P>
   They're useful for compari son. For example, in 1997, there were
190 justifiable handgun homicides in the United States. That same
year, the overall number of men, women and children killed by guns
in mur ders, suicides and accidents was over 32,000. &QL;

UCLA SUFFERS DAMAGING LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Better without Baron.... Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA coaches spent the preseason trying to convince anyone
who'd listen that the Bruins would be better without point guard
Baron Davis, the No. 3 pick in the 1999 NBA Draft. They were proved
wrong Saturd ay, when their spin unraveled into demoralizing
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by one point in the final minute of a game they had to
win, the Bruins needed a playmaker. They needed someone to erase
the mistakes and ineptitude of the previous 39 minutes and keep
them on course for an NCAA Tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   Without Davis to bail them out, the Bruins floundered to 73-70
loss to Cal before 9,596 unhappy fans in Pauley Pavilion - a loss
that severely damaged their Tournament hopes.
</P>
<P>
   At 12-8, the Bruins must win six of their last 10 to reach the
18-win plateau that probably would secure an at-large bid. Problem
is, only five games are at home. Their margin for error is
microscopic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win the home games and get a win on the road, that
combination...gets us towards 18 wins,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said. ``Less than a .500 record in this conference won't get you in
the Tournament. ''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Bruins failed to make the Tournament was 1988.
(They fired coach Walt Hazzard a few weeks later.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even worried about (the NCAAs),'' freshman Jason
Kapono said. ``We're just worried about the next game (USC), about
the next practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough to deal with. I don't know if we're demoralized.
I'd say we're frustrated, because we know how good we can be. We
just have to start playing better. We have to find ways to win.
That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for UCLA. The season unfurls, the opponents
improve, and the ignominy mounts:
</P>
<P>
   - The Bruins have lost three consecutive games for first time
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   - The losses to Cal and Stanford marked the first time the
Bruins have been swept at home since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   - Only a dramatic turnaround will prevent a losing record in
conference play (ital)for the first time since 1948(OFF) - the year
before John Wooden took over.
</P>
<P>
   Better without Baron.... Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to correct this situation, otherwise our three-game
losing streak will be four,'' guard Earl Watson said. ``This can't
happen. We (ital)have to(off) turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   So much to do, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had several chances to win Saturday; each time, they
found ways to lose.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 seconds left, Kapono's jumper was blocked by Brian
Wethers. Center Dan Gadzuric grabbed the rebound but missed from
close range.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins called two timeouts to organize their pressure
defense. They forced a turnover, then used two more timeouts -
their last two - to set up a play for Jerome Moiso. His runner in
the lane was blocked by Cal center Solomon Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game shouldn't have come down to that if we had taken care
of business in the first 39 minutes and 40 seconds,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA immediately fouled Wethers, who made two free throws for a
73-70 lead with seven seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Out of timeouts, the Bruins watched Watson charge upcourt, then
trip over Wethers' foot. He was called for traveling, and the Bears
celebrated their L.A. sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lavin blamed the loss on UCLA's defense. ``We didn't
get the stops we needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics disagreed. Cal shot 43.4 percent for the game,
committed 23 turnovers and scored (ital)four points in the last
3:38(off).
</P>
<P>
   No, UCLA's defense wasn't the problem. The problem was offensive
offense _ 40 minutes of bad shots, bad passes, poor deci sions and
one-on-one plays. The Bruins had four assists, 10 turnovers an d
shot 30.3 percent in the first half. For the game, they shot 37
percen t.
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't standing around, they were running into each
other. They wasted fast-break opportunities. They failed to convert
Cal turnovers into points. ``Shooting guards'' Ray Young and Billy
Knight were 2-of-14. Watson had five turnovers. Gadzuric was
ineffective yet again . They did not set good picks. They did not
make hard cuts.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it? Cal shot 39 percent and committed 18 turnovers
in the first half - 18 turnovers! - and still had a one-point
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made one basket in the last six minutes of the first
half and one basket in the last 3:27 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   No, the problem was not the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't execute, we're not going to beat anybody,'' Moiso
said.
</P>
<P>
   To save the season, the execution must start Monday.

LAKERS SEE LITTLE MEANING IN ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If a 46-point rout of the Utah Jazz cleansed the
Lakers' palate after a recent platter full of losses, it did little
to reassure anyone in uniform that all their problems are solved.
</P>
<P>
   With the blowout established early Friday night, in a 56-21
first half, the Lakers could once again take pride in their
defense. But the starters played short minutes, the game was never
in doubt and no one made any wild claims about the meaning of a
lopsided victory.
</P>
<P>
   So what, other than keeping pace with Portland, did the Lakers
take from the win?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing at all,'' said veteran Ron Harper. ``We've got two
more games left before the All-Star Game, and we have to go out
these last two games and have two big, big, strong games.''
</P>
<P>
   First up is a Monday night home game against the Denver Nuggets,
who the Lakers routed by 35 points on Jan. 10. The slate concludes
Wednesday at Staples Center with the Minnesota Timberwolves, who
the Lakers have beaten twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of wins would give the Lakers their best run since the
16-game winning streak ended and give them a shot at heading into
the break with the NBA's best record. They're tied with Portland,
but the Trail Blazers could take the lead by winning their three
remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want that,'' Harper said. ``It's a pride thing. We were off
to a fast start earlier this season, then we lost some games, so
now it's about going out and showing folks that we have a good
basketball team. ... We want everybody to know we're the team out
there that you have to chase.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, routing the Jazz might have eased the Lakers'
troubled minds after a 3-6 slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``It starts off with guys
being confident again about playing defense, about what we have to
do. We try and build on this. This is what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Easing up: Jackson, who benched Glen Rice during two recent
losses, has softened his criticism of Rice's play, attributing his
struggles to the Lakers' lack of proficiency in the triangle
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of everybody being comfortable in an
offensive system so that they know how to do it,'' he said.
``Glen's not going to behot every night. But he may be 2 for 10,
and then it's my responsibility to get him out and get somebody in
that can play. He's got a great replacement behind him in Rick Fox.
So if he's not going well, then I have to put somebody else out who
can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reality is that we have to make an effort to try and
go there and find a way to exploit the situations (when Rice has a
mismatch against smaller defenders). But he doesn't have to score
20 points a game for us to win, or 15. He just has to be out there
doing his job, and his job is to be a complete player.''

NEW NHRA RULE BRINGS CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA - Modern-day sports require certain organizations or
institutions to make sacrifices for the sake of television.
</P>
<P>
   It's why the National Football League trimmed halftime
intermissions to 10 minutes a few years ago and why the University
of Cincinnati men's basketball team agreed to a midnight tipoff
earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different for the National Hot Rod Association, which
beginning this year is trimming the interval between eliminations
from 90 to 75 minutes, all for the sake of TV.
</P>
<P>
   First-round winners in today's 40th Winternationals at Fairplex
will be required to be ready for the following round within 75
minutes or risk being disqualified. The 75 minutes is timed - from
the conclusion of the last two cars in a round to the first two
cars of the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is of one of three changes that teams are adapting to,
the others being a limit in nitromethane fuel and penalties and
fines for dropping oil on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to separate the men from the boys,'' said Cory
McClenathan, driver of the Joe Gibbs-owned MNBA Top Fuel dragster.
``Everybody's got be on their game and get things done right and
certainly we're going to have people not make it (within the 75
minutes). It's going to be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes how teams manage their time in the pits. In the
past, elimination-round winners would replace everything from
motors, clutches and camshafts. Now that procedure will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 75-minute rule is driven by television,'' said Ray Alley,
former crew chief for Bob Vandergriff and recently named NHRA
director of Top Fuel and Funny Car racing. ``I think the guys will
be OK. It will be very easy for the guys (to make up the loss of 15
minutes) by simply changing their procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year with Bob Vandergriff's team we changed entire
engines on race day. When we got back in the pits, we had entire
engines waiting for us. They had clutches, bellhousings,
ignitions... everything. When our race car reached the pit, in
three minutes we had the old motor off. The new engine was
installed within eight minutes and had it fired within 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, Bob Vandergriff had the money so that we could
afford to have spare engines sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whit Bazemore believes that's exactly what's wrong with the
new rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new rule changes the whole way we approach our business''
said Bazemore, driver of the Chuck Etchells-owned Kendall Oil Funny
Car. ``It's totally unfair to the smaller-funded teams. You can't
physically service the motor in a safe manner in that amount of
time. It's just (a loss of) 15 minutes, but that's a lot back in
the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Kendall's plan, like so many of the other high-financed
teams, is to follow Alley's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of thought has gone into it,'' Bazemore said. ``We've
added personnel and have added a lot of parts. That's where the
smaller teams have a problem. They just don't have four motors to
replace on race day and they don't have the budget to add more
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the competitors know we need a good TV package. The
oil-down rule is going to gain a lot of time during the day. I'm
just strongly opposed to this 75-minute rule.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Dan Olsen, crew chief for Top Fuel champion Tony
Schumacher. But Olsen's concern is with losing time getting from
the drag strip to the pit area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the 75-minute rule right now because at a lot of
the pit areas, we have trouble getting back to the pits,'' Olsen
said. ''That might be a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But most agree it's a necessary switch for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to make our sport more popular and packaged better
for television, we need to tightened it up,'' said Alan Johnson,
crew chief for the Team Winston Top Fuel dragster driven by Gary
Scelzi. ``The 75- minute rule is just something that we have to
adapt to, like the other new rules. We're all professionals here
and we need to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   And know one knows that better than Bazemore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of practice already,'' Bazemore said. ``Now we
just have to win in the first round to put all that work to good
use.''

SINGH IS 8 SHOTS AHEAD OF WOODS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ If Tiger Woods is to continue his winning
streak, he will have to overcome an eight-stroke deficit.
</P>
<P>
   With a 5-under-par 67 at Pebble Beach, Vijay Singh
(11-under-par, 133) held a one-stroke lead over Notah Begay III
(10-under-par, 66-68) after Saturday's second round of the AT&AMP;T
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Woods fell to eight strokes off the
lead (3-under-par) after Saturday's 1-over-par 73 at Spyglass Hill.
That will make it difficult for him to become the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six consecutive starts on the PGA
Tour. Woods' score Saturday snapped a string of 13 consecutive
rounds of par or better.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and Begay played at Pebble Beach, one of three courses on
the tournament rotation. Matt Gogel, a Tour rookie who finished
seventh on the 1999 Nike Tour, was in third place at 7-under-par
after shooting 69 at Poppy Hills, while Rocco Mediate was tied for
fourth place with Mark Brooks at 6-under-par after a 69 at Pebble
Beach. Brooks shot a 67 at Spyglass Hill.
</P>
<P>
   One of the game's best front-runners, Singh has won at least
once on the Tour every year since 1997, including the 1998 PGA
Championship. So the thought of being pursued by Woods was hardly
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about his streak,'' said Singh,
referring to Woods. ``I'm just going to try to win the golf
tournament. Sooner or later, somebody is going to break that.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain-delayed tournament, which is not scheduled to end until
Monday, got another weather break Saturday because it never rained
hard enough to interrupt play. It was a typical February day at
Pebble Beach _ unpredictable. The sun was shining brightly at
times, but at other times it rained. Winds of 10 to 20 mph made
club selection at all three courses difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the celebrity amateurs in the field sprayed shots to
remote parts of the courses, only adding to the length of play, and
to the distractions for the professionals. But Singh and Begay
posted solid scores, staying focused on their games and handling
one of the world's most picturesque and challenging courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with how I handled myself,'' said Begay, who
started the day tied for first place with Singh and David Duval at
6-under-par. ``With the conditions going from raining to sunny,
back to raining, to being windy, it's a real tough thing to
concentrate. Just standing on the first tee, you know you are going
to make two or three bogeys. Unfortunately, I made four, but I also
made some nice birdies as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval was not as fortunate, falling to 2-under-par after
Saturday's disappointing 76 at Spyglass Hill. And the day was also
a struggle for Woods, who never found a consistent rhythm after
starting his day on the back nine at Spyglass. Woods reached
6-under-par after making birdies at No. 18 and No. 1, but he
bogeyed Nos. 3, 6 and 8 to fall back to 3-under-par.
</P>
<P>
   After the club head on his driver broke during Friday's round,
Woods used a backup driver Saturday, and for a while it looked as
if he might shoot another low round. Woods nearly made an eagle on
No. 18, when his approach shot landed within a half-foot of the
cup, then spun back before coming to rest about a foot from the
hole. The crowd roared, and from where he was standing, Woods
thought the ball might have landed in the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has overcome eight-stroke deficits before, particularly
with 36 holes remaining. However, with the unpredictable weather at
Pebble Beach, nobody can be certain if 72 holes will be completed,
so Begay expected Woods to make a charge during Sunday's third
round, when Woods will play at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shoot myself out of the tournament yet,'' said Woods,
who closed with rounds of 63 and 64 at Pebble Beach in 1997. ``If
there are two more rounds, I still have a chance. If there's one
more round, I have to shoot low and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay, who played with Woods on Stanford's golf team, said: ``He
will get mad. He will come out and probably shoot 65 or 64 or
something. It wouldn't surprise me. It wouldn't surprise anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Singh has been the best player in the tournament so far,
showing the length off the tee he has possessed for years, coupled
with an improved short game that has taken his game to the next
level. Singh made 6-foot putts for birdie at No. 1, No. 4 and No.
14. He made a 15-foot putt for birdie at the par-3 No. 7, after
hitting a 7-iron tee shot into the wind from 107 yards.

 WHAT'S AHEAD FOR DEL WEBB?  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Del Webb Corp., the company that defined retirement for millions
of seniors, has hit its own middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun City developer's crisis is whether the children and
grandchildren of its original buy ers will pay to spend their
golden years at Webb communities.
</P>
<P>
   Those baby boomers will be the largest and wealthiest wave of
retirees in history, doubling the number of senior citizens in the
United States during the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers don't want to retire like their parents,'' said
Jay Pulis, a real estate analyst with Ernst &AMP; Young. ``They want a
whole lot more, so builders better be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb comes armed with reams of research, poll results from
100,000 seniors and aging boomers on how they want to retire, to
support a billion-dollar bet on a new vision of retirement living.
</P>
<P>
   The company is trading in its older-model Sun Cities, which
started in the northwest Valley 40 years ago, for racier,
Disney-esque senior developments. In stead of plain, block ranch
homes, tidy streets and churches lined up together, new communi
ties such as Sun City Grand have the pampered feel of resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb also is building Sun Cities where the sun rarely
shines, because many seniors, even those from cold climates, want
to stay close to home after they retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our finger on the pulse of the active-adult market,''
said LeRoy Hanneman Jr., 52, a Phoenix native and 28-year Del Webb
veteran who took over as chief executive officer two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the company is right, the impact could be felt by everyone
from shareholders to legions of grandchildren to whole communi ties
and even governments.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb investors have yet to see a Viagra-like boost for a
stock intimately connected to the graying of America.
</P>
<P>
   With its money and political connections, the company can build
almost anywhere it chooses. And, as the biggest company in its
field, Del Webb leads a parade of copycat builders who can create
whole cities where once sat just acres of land, creating a tax
base, a new de mand for services and even alter ing the social
makeup of a place. Large groups of seniors flocking to one
community can become political and economic forces, as they have in
Arizona and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hanneman's predeces sor as CEO, company Chairman Phil
Dion, who yanked the com pany out of the money-losing casino
business after taking over in 1987 and moved more aggres sively in
the core business of retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130,000 people live in new Sun Cities, and that number
could more than double in the next decade, especially with 40
million baby boomers expected to hit retirement age by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hanneman, who owns about 51,000 shares of the compa ny's
stock, worth nearly $1 mil lion, has to keep the boom going.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's basic formula isn't likely to change. Webb routinely
buys a huge piece of land on the fringe of a growing metro area and
pumps more than $100 mil lion into its infrastructure before the
first house is sold. It builds megahype for each project through
pricey advertising, lur ing buyers who camp out at its gates before
the first day of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Sun City has been an instant success. Sun City Hilton
Head, in South Carolina, was plagued with torrential rain when it
opened in late 1994, slowing sales while the company had to keep
putting cash into it.
</P>
<P>
   Sun City Palm Desert opened as California was still in the
throes of a recession during the early 1990s, and sales were dis
mal at first.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's model for development, dating from the first
Sun City, has boosted the company's revenue to $2 billion this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that Del Webb has invested so much into trying
to shape baby boomers' retire ment that its debt has risen as
quickly as its record home sales. But analysts say the company
should be spending more to cap ture the next generation of retir
ees.
</P>
<P>
   The developer mounted a $1 billion expansion last year with four
developments from Chicago to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest strat egy shift came after research showed
that most Americans on the cusp of Social Security don't want to
move to Arizona or Florida. They want to stay close to their family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   So Del Webb is going to them. Its first cold-weather Sun City
opened last year in Huntley, Ill., a suburb more than 40 miles from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment for the com pany paid off. Almost 200 homes were
sold in just the first few months that Huntley was open.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb is planning many more Sun Cities on the East Coast and
in the Midwest to draw the almost 90 percent of future retirees who
don't want to move far away. Amenities in the newer communities
include everything from rock climbing walls and in-line skating
paths to home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb's heady spending last year drove up the firm's leverage
_ a measure of how much money it's borrowing against shareholder
equity in the company _ to a 3-1 ratio. It's since dropped down to
about 2{-1, but the developer is still working on getting it back
to the 2-1 ratio that is considered the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   The company's spending spree caught the attention of Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great situation, but they are leveraged for good
rea son,'' said John Stanley of invest ment bank Warburg Dillon
Read, which has monitored the compa ny's debt levels closely since
last year. ``The company has posi tioned itself to cash in on a
huge new group of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Del Webb needs to grow even more, when it can afford to.
</P>
<P>
   But the builder's stock price hasn't reflected the growth. While
earnings have almost dou bled in the past five years, the stock
dropped to a 16-month low of $18.25 last week before recov ering
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Most home-building stocks have been in the tank since interest
rates started to go up last summer and home buying began to slow.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb has competition for the lucrative baby boomer mar ket.
Several big builders, such as U.S. Homes, Pulte and longtime
competitor Robson Communities, are nipping at its heels.
</P>
<P>
   Some builders even have at tempted to copy the Sun City model.
Ed Robson, a former Del Webb executive, has opened com peting
amenity-rich retirement communities next door to Sun Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Building for retirees is most of Del Webb's business; one-third
is just regular home building. The Anthem development on the
fringes of north Phoenix is its first Sun City-esque community for
families, and houses have sold at a rate of at least three a day
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that some sen iors don't want to live in age-re
stricted developments like Sun City, so the company is betting they
will opt for an Anthem or a home in one of its country club
projects, such as Terravita and Belasera in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Other aging baby boomers don't want big gated communities or
golf. They want walking trails and wine tasting, so Del Webb opened
a small project last year in California's Sonoma County for those
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The small projects are doing fine, but analysts say Del Webb's
expertise is in building big. Few other developers can manage so
many massive and expensive projects in different parts of the
country all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retirement housing is where the big money will be in the next
two decades,'' said Arizona econ omist Elliott Pollack, who has
tracked Sun City since early on. ``As baby boomers like me start to
take our teeth out at night, home builders will begin to drool.'' &QL;

RUTGERS COMES UP SHORT IN SEVERAL CATEGORIES, INCLUDING THE SCORE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ It was a game of ifs for Rutgers against the
University of Miami at the Louis Brown Athletic Center Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rutgers basketball team had managed a couple of defensive
rebounds during a stretch with just over four minutes to play while
Miami had six offensive rebounds in three possessions, maybe things
would have been different. If Todd Billet had not turned the ball
over while trying to pass to Jeff Greer for a 3-point attempt that
could have tied the score with 19 seconds to play, maybe things
would have been different. And if Rutgers had had a defensive
answer to Miami guard Johnny Hemsley, who scored 21 points, things
would definitely have been different.
</P>
<P>
   But Rutgers did not. Consequently, Miami (14-8 overall, 7-2 in
the Big East) defeated Rutgers, 58-52, handing the Scarlet Knights
(12-9, 4-5) their third loss in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the difference in the game was rebounding or the lack
of rebounding, and foul shooting or the lack of foul shooting in
the second half,'' Rutgers coach Kevin Bannon said. ``That's very
difficult for us to swallow, because for most of the night our kids
really scraped to do the things to beat a real good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami had a 43-26 advantage in rebounds, with 25 off the
offensive glass. ``That's where you lose ballgames,'' said Rutgers
forward Rashod Kent, who was saddled with foul trouble throughout
the second half and finished with two points and five rebounds.
``They had 25 offensive rebounds, and how do you top that? If they
would have been able to convert all of those, that would have been
50 points.''
</P>
<P>
   As wide as the rebounding gap was, the game really came down to
a sequence with 2 minutes 25 seconds to play and the Hurricanes
leading, 52-47. After Miami forward Elton Tyler missed two free
throws, Rutgers forward Joel Salvi controlled the rebound. Rutgers
center Eugene Dabney cut the lead to 52-49 on a layup with 1:58 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Miami center Mario Bland, who scored 13 points, then missed a
jumper, but his teammate John Salmons controlled the rebound.
Hemsley missed a 3-point attempt, and again Salmons controlled the
rebound. With 1:04 to play, Miami called a timeout, but Bland
turned the ball over with 43 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers then had a chance to tie the score on a 3-pointer, but
Salmons jumped in front of Billet's pass to Greer with 19 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed up on the pass, even though I did what I was supposed
to do,'' Billet said. ``I drew the man, and I got the defender to
turn his face. I should have taken the 3 on the skip pass. But
that's part of growing up in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmons was fouled and made two free throws to give Miami a
54-49 lead. Billet came back and hit a 3-pointer with 12 seconds to
play, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers guard Dahntay Jones struggled on the offensive end as he
tried to contain Hemsley on the defensive end. Jones, who leads the
team with an average of 16.3 points a game, was 3 of 13 from the
field and scored 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was another setback for Rutgers, which was coming off its
first Big East road victory of the season, against Boston College
on Wednesday. Bannon's futility against Miami continued: he is 0-4
against the Hurricanes. Miami has won five of its last six games,
the lone loss coming against Kentucky on Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first half, it looked as if Miami could beat
Rutgers in transition. The Hurricanes jumped out to an 11-7 lead on
seven quick points by Hemsley, who averages 18 points a game.
Hemsley, who had nine points in the first half, scored on
successive layups and hit a 3-pointer to give the Hurricanes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But that lead melted quickly as Rutgers went on a 12-4 run and
went ahead by 19-13 on a dunk off a steal by Greer, who finished
with a team-high 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers cooled off, and Greer went to the bench with 2:50 to
play in the first half with his third foul. Rutgers managed just
six more points in the half and Miami, with some good work around
the basket by Bland and Salmons, forced a 25-25 halftime tie.
</P>
<P>
   Miami came out hot at the beginning of the second half and went
up by 36-27 on a layup by Bland. But Rutgers crawled back and took
a 46-45 lead on two free throws by Greer with 5:58 to play. Then
things unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played at a high enough level to have a darn good chance,''
Bannon said. ``But not high enough to win.'' &QL;

THE STORY STILL CUTS RIGHT TO THE HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten years after Hank Gathers' death, it remains
true what his college coach Paul Westhead said at the time: ``It's
the unexpected moments when it hits you.''
</P>
<P>
   The awful reminder of what happened on the Gersten Pavilion
floor on March 4, 1990, ambushed me while I lay drifting off on the
couch, lulled to sleep's edges by Regis Philbin's voice on ``Do You
Want to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin asked the contestant if he could identify the device
used to restore a heart's rhythm and my eyes flew open. Suddenly I
was wide awake. Reflexively as a scream, the answer escaped my lips
before it popped upon the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A defibrillator. You know, the device that was supposed to be
Gathers' lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   For me, defibrillator will always be a word that restores my
heart's ache. I can't hear the word without thinking of Gathers'
death and all the grief and goodwill and guilt and gallantry it
triggered.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question, I'm wiser for having chronicled for another
newspaper the Greek tragedy that commenced when Gathers crumpled to
the ground near midcourt with 13:34 remaining in the first half of
a West Coast Conference tournament semifinal game against the
University of Portland, a game that Gathers' Loyola Marymount Lions
were leading 25-13.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and 40 minutes later, outside the emergency room at
Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, Gathers, a gargantuan talent, was
pronounced dead. Over the next few months, those of us assigned to
the story would get a crash course in medicine and law.
</P>
<P>
   We would learn much about cardiac arrhythmia and court
procedures; defibrillators and depositions; human nature and the
human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In death, so many life lessons were gleaned.
</P>
<P>
   From the player who couldn't outrun his own wildly racing heart,
Jeff Fryer learned to listen to his own heart, the better to follow
it.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer was the third-leading scorer on a 1989-90 Lions team that
led the nation in offense. He was to 3-pointers what Gathers was to
dunks: Money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   During the NCAA Tournament, which followed like a rainbow the
emotional storm of Gathers' death, Fryer played as though divinely
inspired. Along with Gathers' best friend Bo Kimble, Fryer helped
the Lions pick off New Mexico State and defending national champion
Michigan and Alabama before they were snuffed out by eventual
champion UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   After his graduation from LMU later that year, Fryer kicked
around in the European pro leagues before returning to his alma
mater to work in its summer camps program. He had moved on to UC
Irvine's fund-raising department when he had, not long ago, one of
those unexpected moments when it hits you.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer was pushing papers around on his desk, a slave of
convention working 9 to 5, when he realized he didn't need to be
chained to an office; not yet, anyway. A few weeks later he was on
his way to Dusseldorf, Germany, to play for the Neuwerk Lions (no
small irony there) of the German West Regional League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that God has blessed me with the ability to play
basketball so why not make the most of it?'' Fryer said by
telephone from Germany. ``What happened to Hank makes me want to be
in a way more adventurous. I want to see the world while I can
because you never know what's going to happen tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Fryer hadn't been back in Germany very long when he had another
one of those unexpected moments. A Dutch teammate invited Fryer and
a few other players to his apartment to watch a television movie
about Gathers and Kimble.
</P>
<P>
   It was surreal for Fryer, re-living the unspeakable in a
Dutch-subtitled film in the middle of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just brought back memories of (Gathers' death) and reminded
me of how full of energy Hank was,'' Fryer said. ``It was kind of
sad in a way, the way they made the story out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was sad, how lawyers retained by Gathers' family made good
people such as Westhead and LMU trainer Chip Schaefer out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer was one of the first to reach Gathers after he
collapsed. He began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation
immediately. Schaefer had been especially close to Gathers. And
yet, in one of the first multimillion-dollar lawsuits filed by
Beverly Hills attorney Bruce Fagel on behalf of Gathers' mother,
three brothers, aunt and son, he was among those deemed culpable in
the player's death.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer was accused of negligence because he didn't use a
defibrillator on Gathers until after the player had been
transported on a stretcher out of view of the 3,000 horrified
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Schaefer is nagged by guilt, though not for the
reasons outlined in the lawsuit that was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's made it hard for me is I had a
relationship with Hank on a personal level,'' said Schaefer, in his
first year on the Lakers' training staff after spending eight years
with the Chicago Bulls. ``One of the things I live with is that
perhaps he may have taken chances with his medication, thinking,
`If anything happens, Chip has my back.'''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy report on Gathers listed the cause of his death as
cardiomyopathy and showed sub-therapeutic levels of Inderal, the
heart-stabilizing drug the player's doctors had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that the autopsy indicated he had a dosage in him
below what had been prescribed, that's what made me feel like maybe
because of the level of trust we had built up he was taking chances
with his medication,'' Schaefer said before a recent Lakers game.
``That's one of the things that haunts me, that he may have been
doing things with his medication that I could have stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   It would come out after Gathers' death that he had blown off at
least one of his weekly treadmill tests in the days leading up to
the WCC tournament. It was no secret the Inderal made Gathers feel
sluggish and that he felt the medication was hampering his play.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys for the player's family would accuse Westhead of
leaning on Gathers' doctors to reduce his medication because it was
affecting the strapping senior forward's performance. All Westhead
said he did was ask Gathers' doctors if there were other
medications the player might be able to take that would leave him
less sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   That he was blamed for the death of a player he treated like a
son was devastating to Westhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the legal world, things get turned, twisted, chopped,
patched and re-patched,'' he said at the time by way of defending
himself. ``Suddenly what was done with caring and concern can be
twisted into something appearing uncaring and selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all Westhead would say to try to patch up his
wounded reputation. The years haven't loosened his tongue much.
Over the telephone last week Westhead said, ``I thought it was a
very indelicate situation involving Hank,'' and left it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to respond back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the sadness in his voice even before he articulates
it. ``I don't think my hurt for the loss of Hank will ever
diminish,'' he said. ``It certainly had a strong impact on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Westhead left LMU in the fall of 1990 to become the head coach
of the Denver Nuggets. After being forced out of Denver in 1992, he
coached four years at George Mason University. He assisted P.J.
Carlesimo at Golden State until the Warriors purged their coaching
staff in December. Westhead, who continues to do scouting for the
Warriors, is back in Southern California where he has been a
virtual stranger since leaving LMU and the lawsuits related to
Gathers' death in his rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Westhead says it's not the ghost of Gathers that has kept him
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some career decisions based on choices that were
available,'' Westhead said. ``I probably would have made the
decisions regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? For those bound by the tragedy, the ghosts will
always be there, whether or not we choose to acknowledge them.

 WHAT'S AHEAD FOR DEL WEBB?  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Del Webb Corp., the company that defined retirement for millions
of seniors, has hit its own middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun City developer's crisis is whether the children and
grandchildren of its original buy ers will pay to spend their
golden years at Webb communities.
</P>
<P>
   Those baby boomers will be the largest and wealthiest wave of
retirees in history, doubling the number of senior citizens in the
United States during the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers don't want to retire like their parents,'' said
Jay Pulis, a real estate analyst with Ernst &AMP; Young. ``They want a
whole lot more, so builders better be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb comes armed with reams of research, poll results from
100,000 seniors and aging boomers on how they want to retire, to
support a billion-dollar bet on a new vision of retirement living.
</P>
<P>
   The company is trading in its older-model Sun Cities, which
started in the northwest Valley 40 years ago, for racier,
Disney-esque senior developments. In stead of plain, block ranch
homes, tidy streets and churches lined up together, new communi
ties such as Sun City Grand have the pampered feel of resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb also is building Sun Cities where the sun rarely
shines, because many seniors, even those from cold climates, want
to stay close to home after they retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our finger on the pulse of the active-adult market,''
said LeRoy Hanneman Jr., 52, a Phoenix native and 28-year Del Webb
veteran who took over as chief executive officer two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the company is right, the impact could be felt by everyone
from shareholders to legions of grandchildren to whole communi ties
and even governments.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb investors have yet to see a Viagra-like boost for a
stock intimately connected to the graying of America.
</P>
<P>
   With its money and political connections, the company can build
almost anywhere it chooses. And, as the biggest company in its
field, Del Webb leads a parade of copycat builders who can create
whole cities where once sat just acres of land, creating a tax
base, a new de mand for services and even alter ing the social
makeup of a place. Large groups of seniors flocking to one
community can become political and economic forces, as they have in
Arizona and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hanneman's predeces sor as CEO, company Chairman Phil
Dion, who yanked the com pany out of the money-losing casino
business after taking over in 1987 and moved more aggres sively in
the core business of retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130,000 people live in new Sun Cities, and that number
could more than double in the next decade, especially with 40
million baby boomers expected to hit retirement age by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hanneman, who owns about 51,000 shares of the compa ny's
stock, worth nearly $1 mil lion, has to keep the boom going.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's basic formula isn't likely to change. Webb routinely
buys a huge piece of land on the fringe of a growing metro area and
pumps more than $100 mil lion into its infrastructure before the
first house is sold. It builds megahype for each project through
pricey advertising, lur ing buyers who camp out at its gates before
the first day of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Sun City has been an instant success. Sun City Hilton
Head, in South Carolina, was plagued with torrential rain when it
opened in late 1994, slowing sales while the company had to keep
putting cash into it.
</P>
<P>
   Sun City Palm Desert opened as California was still in the
throes of a recession during the early 1990s, and sales were dis
mal at first.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's model for development, dating from the first
Sun City, has boosted the company's revenue to $2 billion this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that Del Webb has invested so much into trying
to shape baby boomers' retire ment that its debt has risen as
quickly as its record home sales. But analysts say the company
should be spending more to cap ture the next generation of retir
ees.
</P>
<P>
   The developer mounted a $1 billion expansion last year with four
developments from Chicago to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest strat egy shift came after research showed
that most Americans on the cusp of Social Security don't want to
move to Arizona or Florida. They want to stay close to their family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   So Del Webb is going to them. Its first cold-weather Sun City
opened last year in Huntley, Ill., a suburb more than 40 miles from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment for the com pany paid off. Almost 200 homes were
sold in just the first few months that Huntley was open.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb is planning many more Sun Cities on the East Coast and
in the Midwest to draw the almost 90 percent of future retirees who
don't want to move far away. Amenities in the newer communities
include everything from rock climbing walls and in-line skating
paths to home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb's heady spending last year drove up the firm's leverage
_ a measure of how much money it's borrowing against shareholder
equity in the company _ to a 3-1 ratio. It's since dropped down to
about 2{-1, but the developer is still working on getting it back
to the 2-1 ratio that is considered the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   The company's spending spree caught the attention of Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great situation, but they are leveraged for good
rea son,'' said John Stanley of invest ment bank Warburg Dillon
Read, which has monitored the compa ny's debt levels closely since
last year. ``The company has posi tioned itself to cash in on a
huge new group of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Del Webb needs to grow even more, when it can afford to.
</P>
<P>
   But the builder's stock price hasn't reflected the growth. While
earnings have almost dou bled in the past five years, the stock
dropped to a 16-month low of $18.25 last week before recov ering
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Most home-building stocks have been in the tank since interest
rates started to go up last summer and home buying began to slow.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb has competition for the lucrative baby boomer mar ket.
Several big builders, such as U.S. Homes, Pulte and longtime
competitor Robson Communities, are nipping at its heels.
</P>
<P>
   Some builders even have at tempted to copy the Sun City model.
Ed Robson, a former Del Webb executive, has opened com peting
amenity-rich retirement communities next door to Sun Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Building for retirees is most of Del Webb's business; one-third
is just regular home building. The Anthem development on the
fringes of north Phoenix is its first Sun City-esque community for
families, and houses have sold at a rate of at least three a day
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that some sen iors don't want to live in age-re
stricted developments like Sun City, so the company is betting they
will opt for an Anthem or a home in one of its country club
projects, such as Terravita and Belasera in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Other aging baby boomers don't want big gated communities or
golf. They want walking trails and wine tasting, so Del Webb opened
a small project last year in California's Sonoma County for those
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The small projects are doing fine, but analysts say Del Webb's
expertise is in building big. Few other developers can manage so
many massive and expensive projects in different parts of the
country all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retirement housing is where the big money will be in the next
two decades,'' said Arizona econ omist Elliott Pollack, who has
tracked Sun City since early on. ``As baby boomers like me start to
take our teeth out at night, home builders will begin to drool.'' &QL;

   It was Hanneman's predeces sor as CEO, company Chairman Phil
Dion, who yanked the com pany out of the money-losing casino
business after taking over in 1987 and moved more aggres sively in
the core business of retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130,000 people live in new Sun Cities, and that number
could more than double in the next decade, especially with 40
million baby boomers expected to hit retirement age by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hanneman, who owns about 51,000 shares of the compa ny's
stock, worth nearly $1 mil lion, has to keep the boom going.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's basic formula isn't likely to change. Webb routinely
buys a huge piece of land on the fringe of a growing metro area and
pumps more than $100 mil lion into its infrastructure before the
first house is sold. It builds megahype for each project through
pricey advertising, lur ing buyers who camp out at its gates before
the first day of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Sun City has been an instant success. Sun City Hilton
Head, in South Carolina, was plagued with torrential rain when it
opened in late 1994, slowing sales while the company had to keep
putting cash into it.
</P>
<P>
   Sun City Palm Desert opened as California was still in the
throes of a recession during the early 1990s, and sales were dis
mal at first.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's model for development, dating from the first
Sun City, has boosted the company's revenue to $2 billion this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that Del Webb has invested so much into trying
to shape baby boomers' retire ment that its debt has risen as
quickly as its record home sales. But analysts say the company
should be spending more to cap ture the next generation of retir
ees.
</P>
<P>
   The developer mounted a $1 billion expansion last year with four
developments from Chicago to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest strat egy shift came after research showed
that most Americans on the cusp of Social Security don't want to
move to Arizona or Florida. They want to stay close to their family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   So Del Webb is going to them. Its first cold-weather Sun City
opened last year in Huntley, Ill., a suburb more than 40 miles from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment for the com pany paid off. Almost 200 homes were
sold in just the first few months that Huntley was open.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb is planning many more Sun Cities on the East Coast and
in the Midwest to draw the almost 90 percent of future retirees who
don't want to move far away. Amenities in the newer communities
include everything from rock climbing walls and in-line skating
paths to home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb's heady spending last year drove up the firm's leverage
_ a measure of how much money it's borrowing against shareholder
equity in the company _ to a 3-1 ratio. It's since dropped down to
about 2{-1, but the developer is still working on getting it back
to the 2-1 ratio that is considered the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   The company's spending spree caught the attention of Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great situation, but they are leveraged for good
rea son,'' said John Stanley of invest ment bank Warburg Dillon
Read, which has monitored the compa ny's debt levels closely since
last year. ``The company has posi tioned itself to cash in on a
huge new group of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Del Webb needs to grow even more, when it can afford to.
</P>
<P>
   But the builder's stock price hasn't reflected the growth. While
earnings have almost dou bled in the past five years, the stock
dropped to a 16-month low of $18.25 last week before recov ering
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Most home-building stocks have been in the tank since interest
rates started to go up last summer and home buying began to slow.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb has competition for the lucrative baby boomer mar ket.
Several big builders, such as U.S. Homes, Pulte and longtime
competitor Robson Communities, are nipping at its heels.
</P>
<P>
   Some builders even have at tempted to copy the Sun City model.
Ed Robson, a former Del Webb executive, has opened com peting
amenity-rich retirement communities next door to Sun Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Building for retirees is most of Del Webb's business; one-third
is just regular home building. The Anthem development on the
fringes of north Phoenix is its first Sun City-esque community for
families, and houses have sold at a rate of at least three a day
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that some sen iors don't want to live in age-re
stricted developments like Sun City, so the company is betting they
will opt for an Anthem or a home in one of its country club
projects, such as Terravita and Belasera in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Other aging baby boomers don't want big gated communities or
golf. They want walking trails and wine tasting, so Del Webb opened
a small project last year in California's Sonoma County for those
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The small projects are doing fine, but analysts say Del Webb's
expertise is in building big. Few other developers can manage so
many massive and expensive projects in different parts of the
country all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retirement housing is where the big money will be in the next
two decades,'' said Arizona econ omist Elliott Pollack, who has
tracked Sun City since early on. ``As baby boomers like me start to
take our teeth out at night, home builders will begin to drool.'' &QL;

COLUMBIA STUDENT IS SLAIN IN DORM, AND SUSPECT, AN EX-BOYFRIEND,
KILLS HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By   ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 19-year-old Columbia University student from Long
Island, a star of the women's varsity lacrosse team, was found
slashed to death Saturday afternoon in her dormitory room, and an
hour later a former boyfriend believed to be her killer leapt to
his death under a subway train in upper Manhattan, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent murder and suicide claimed the lives of Kathleen A.
Roskot, a popular sophomore athlete, and Thomas G. Nelford, a
troubled, 23-year-old former Columbia student and varsity wrestler
from Oxnard, Calif., who dropped out of school two years ago had
but continued to hang around fraternities, dormitories and his
other old haunts on the fringes of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths stunned the university's 22,000-student community in
Morningside Heights, turning a quiet winter afternoon into a
turmoil of flashing police car lights, detectives moving through
residence halls to question witnesses, swarms of news media filming
and asking questions, and, in countless rooms and meeting halls,
gatherings of students talking about the day's tragic events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus is shocked, deeply saddened and in mourning at the
death of this young woman, and the senior officers of the
university, on behalf of the whole university community, have
expressed the deepest sympathies to her family and friends,'' said
Virgil Renzulli, Columbia's associate vice president for public
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation was continuing, detectives said there
appeared to be little doubt that Nelford had slain Roskot. He and
Roskot had been videotaped by a lobby security camera entering her
dormitory, Ruggles Hall, at 508 W. 114th St., at 12:30 a.m., and a
student in her suite said she had heard a commotion in her room an
hour later.
</P>
<P>
   And after witnesses saw Nelford hurl himself onto the tracks
before an onrushing subway train at the St. Nicholas Avenue and
West 181st Street station at midafternoon, detectives found
Roskot's wallet, containing some of her personal papers and her
Social Security card, in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is believed to be responsible for this homicide,'' Joseph
Pentangelo, a police spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell and Columbia University counselors made themselves
available for distraught students, friends and coaches described
Roskot as a quiet, likeable young woman who had achieved high
grades in her coursework and a solid record of success as a
midfielder on the Bay Shore High School and Columbia University
lacrosse teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a real treasure,'' Scott Giardina, an assistant coach
of the Columbia Lions lacrosse team, said. Playing for Columbia
last March, Roskot was cited by the Intercollegiate Women's
Lacrosse Coaches Association for her outstanding play against the
University of Connecticut; she scored the game-winning goal in a
double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In her senior year, 1998, at Bay Shore High School, where she
had a 93 grade average, she won honorable mention as All American
of the U.S. Women's Lacrosse Association. She often scored
game-winning goals; she also played on the soccer team and was
remembered as outstanding on defense.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police and university officials, Roskot,
ordinarily punctual, failed to show up for practice with the
lacrosse team Saturday and one of her coaches called her at her
dormitory, which is just across 114th Street from the south edge of
the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to reach Roskot, the worried coach called a resident
adviser at the dormitory who, with a security guard, entered her
private fifth-floor room at 2:10 p.m. and found the body. Her room
was part of Suite 509, which she shared with five other students,
each with their own room.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was nude and her throat had been slashed, the police
said. The room was in disarray, and a kitchen carving knife
believed to be the murder weapon was found in a bathroom sink. It
was not immediately clear how long she had been dead, although
Lashauna Cutts, a Bronx sophomore who shared the suite, said she
had heard noises about 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the murder spread, sending shock waves through the
dormitory and across the campus, detectives questioned many of the
192 residents of Ruggles Hall and examined videotapes from a
security camera at the entrance in the hope of finding pictures of
anyone accompanying Roskot or checking in to visit her.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said they learned that Nelford had dated the
victim, starting last fall, although they had apparently broken up
recently. They also found on the lobby videotape pictures that
showed Nelford had arrived at the dorm about 12:30 a.m. with
Roskot. Residents also reported hearing loud noises from her room
about 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The police then began a search for Nelford. But by then, he was
already dead. At 3:05 p.m., witnesses told the police, a man later
identified as Nelford leaped in front of a northbound 1/9 train at
the St. Nicholas-West 181st Street station and was killed
instantly. Roskot's wallet was found in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The last murder of a Columbia student occurred less than two
years ago, only a block away from Saturday's slaying and under
somewhat similar circumstances. The victim, Lynda Hong, 26, a
Cornell University graduate who was in her third year at Columbia
Law School, was found dead, her throat cut, in her apartment at 548
W. 113th St. on March 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Edward Ko, a 23-year-old former boyfriend of
Hong's, was arrested and charged with her murder. He has pleaded
not guilty and is in custody at Rikers Island, still awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nelford, who had been an outstanding wrestler in high school in
Oxnard, had attended Columbia and been a member of its wrestling
team until 1998, when he dropped out. Acquaintances at fraternities
on campus said Saturday that he had been a talented artist and
musician, as well as an athlete, and that since leaving school he
had continued to frequent the dormitories and fraternity houses.
</P>
<P>
   Some students said he occasionally spent evenings or weekends in
Roskot's room. Some acquaintances said Nelford's life appeared to
have become troubled in recent months. He usually held jobs for
only short periods, long enough to buy paints or art supplies, and
had seemed unstable in the past year after frequently using
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Ruggles Hall said that security at the dormitory
was tight, with guards on duty at the front entrance 24 hours a day
and video cameras in the lobby and at a locked rear entrance to
record the comings and goings of everyone around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggles Hall residents and other Columbia students are required
to hand the guard a university-issued picture identity card, which
is then swiped through a machine to ensure its authenticity.
Nonresident visitors must also provide identification and must
either be accompanied by a resident or have a resident's approval
to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The dormitory, an eight-story prewar stone building that had
been built as a hotel and converted into a Columbia residence hall
in 1964, is occupied by a mix of sophomores, juniors and seniors,
male and female, most of whom share multiroom suites with kitchens
for four to seven students, who pay $5,460 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, university officials said that counselors were
being made available to troubled students who needed to talk about
the deaths. A meeting of residents at Ruggles Hall was held
Saturday night, partly for officials to separate fact from rumor,
and partly to give students time together to grieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is pretty surreal,'' Eduardo Delgado, a 22-year-old
senior from Rye, N.Y., said of his fellow Ruggles Hall residents.
``I guess nobody really believes it could actually happen here.''

<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' is an acclaimed motion picture. Denzel
Washington, who portrays the wrongly convicted boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, won the Golden Globe for best actor in a
drama and is expected to be nominated for an Academy Award; the
movie might also be nominated for an Oscar. It's advertised as the
``most inspiring film of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just not the most truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the scenario is distorted, if not blatantly false and
inaccurate, from what happened in Carter's struggle for freedom
after having served nearly 20 years in New Jersey prisons, along
with John Artis, for the 1966 murder of three people in the
Lafayette Grill in Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay is based on two books: Carter's autobiography
that he wrote in prison, ``The 16th Round'' (Viking, 1974), and
``Lazarus and The Hurricane'' (Viking, 1991), by Sam Chaiton and
Terry Swinton, members of the Canadian commune that the movie
credits with Carter's release.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadians, from whom Carter is now estranged, were
latecomers to his struggle by more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And shamefully, the movie never mentions Fred Hogan, then and
now an investigator in the New Jersey Public Defender's office.
More than any person, Hogan was responsible for Carter's conviction
eventually being overturned by Federal Judge H. Lee Sarokin in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Several years before the Canadians' involvement, Carter talked
about the ``one man'' who didn't forget him when he was imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one man is Fred Hogan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Fred Hogan, I'd be dead now,'' he added,
meaning that he would have died in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan had remembered Carter as a middleweight contender out of
Paterson best known for a first-round knockout of the welterweight
champion Emile Griffith. As a teen-age Police Athletic League boxer
in Bayonne, N.J., Hogan had first met Carter at his Summit, N.J.,
training camp. Hogan's father was a guard at the Hudson County jail
where Carter's manager, Pat Amato, was the warden.
</P>
<P>
   After his Army discharge, Hogan was a policeman in Atlantic
Highlands, N.J. On moving to the public defender's office, he often
visited inmates at the Rahway prison, where Carter was serving
three life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in my heart that there was no way that Rubin did
that,'' Hogan has often said, alluding to the triple murder. ``And
the more Rubin told me about the trial, the more I knew it stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was not a choir boy. As a 14-year-old involved in a
mugging incident, Carter had been sent to the Jamesburg State Home
for Boys before escaping. He was also convicted of assault and
robbery in 1957. But regarding the triple murders, he argued in a
1972 newspaper column that he had been ``cleared by a man wounded
by the killers,'' that he had passed a lie-detector test, and that
the description of the killers fit ``neither me nor John Artis,
convicted with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Two career criminals, Alfred P. Bello and Arthur D. Bradley, had
told the police that they had witnessed Carter and Artis leaving
the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Hogan, working on his own time, tracked down Bello and
Bradley, obtained their recantations and delivered them to Selwyn
Raab, a New York Times reporter. Raab confirmed the recantations
and wrote a story that appeared on Page 1 _ the first break in the
case that would drag through a second trial and conviction in 1976
(and the return of Carter and Artis to prison) before Judge Sarokin
let Carter walk free out of a Newark courtroom in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But in the movie, it's as if Hogan (and Raab) never existed, as
if the recantations of Bello and Bradley never happened except for
an oblique reference by one of Carter's lawyers to ``no witnesses,
except for admitted liars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 54, Hogan lives in Brielle, N.J., with his wife, Mary, and
their sons David and Matthew. Not long ago he and Carter were at a
Manhattan party introducing James S. Hirsch's truthful book,
``Hurricane, The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter'' (Viking,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin pointed to me,'' Hogan recalled, ``and said, `There must
be a beginning and the beginning is you.'''
</P>
<P>
   At that same party one of Carter's lawyers, Leon Friedman,
inscribed Hogan's copy of Hirsch's book. Hogan said proudly, ``This
is what Leon wrote: `To Fred Hogan, who started us all on the road
to freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, this public defender did not seem to resent being
ignored in the movie. ``I hope Rubin makes a trillion dollars,'' he
said, ``and I hope Denzel Washington wins the Academy Award; he's
terrific as Rubin.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to know the real Rubin Carter story, don't go to
the movie. Read Hirsch's book. Fred Hogan is in that.
