LINK BETWEEN ROUNDWORM STUDY AND CELL PHONE SAFETY IS DISPUTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: England, Texas, Calif.)   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   British scientists report that microwave radiation can
indirectly damage roundworms. Their data, the investigators say,
bear on the question of whether cellular telephones are safe.
</P>
<P>
   But several U.S. scientists questioned whether the worm
experiments had anything to do with cell phone safety.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by David de Pomerai of the University of Nottingham
and his colleagues, will appear in the May 25 issue of Nature, a
British science journal. The journal's editors decided to release
it Friday because they thought it might be important in discussions
of a report by a committee of scientists convened by the British
government to assess the safety of cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, that committee reported that while there was no
direct evidence of danger from the popular devices, there were some
worrisome findings, like the study with worms. To be on the safe
side, they said, children under age 16 should limit their use of
cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with positing dangers from the phones, scientists
say, is that the microwave radiation emitted by them is too weak to
break bonds in molecules. It has been hard to figure out how the
microwaves would produce damage other than by heating tissue, which
does not seem to occur. While microwave ovens can heat tissue, the
power from the phones is too low to produce heating.
</P>
<P>
   In their new report in Nature, the scientists say that the worms
exposed to microwaves produced a type of protein, called heat shock
proteins, that they and other species, including humans, make in
response to injuries, like heat or certain toxins. But, they say,
the microwave radiation did not heat the worms.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that there was no heating, the investigators
measured the temperature in the petri dishes where the minuscule
worms floated in liquid. Since temperature probes are larger than
these worms, it can be hard to know what the actual temperatures of
the worms are as they bounce around in the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   But, the researchers wrote, they compared the heat shock
proteins made by unexposed worms that served as controls, with
those made by worms that were bombarded with microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators kept the fluid in the petri dishes at various
temperatures and noted when the worms made heat shock proteins. At
a certain temperature, all the worms make the proteins. But those
exposed to microwaves made them when the fluid was slightly cooler
than those that were not exposed to microwaves, they reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists questioned how the results could be translated
to infer possible risks to human health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly I can't see what this has to do with children using
cell phones,'' said Dr. Eleanor Adair, who is a senior scientist at
Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, studying electromagnetic
radiation effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly difficult to make accurate measurements of
temperatures in petri dishes because the temperature varies all
over the place,'' Dr. Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Stevens, a neurologist at the Salk Institute in San
Diego, and a consultant to Motorola, said there had been many
dozens of studies that failed to show health effects of microwave
radiation like that emitted by cell phones, and he knew of no
studies that had been replicated that showed effects.  &QL;

NEW ALLEGATIONS MAY FORCE INDIANA TO ACT ON KNIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of new accusations about the volatile behavior of
Bob Knight, Indiana's basketball coach, a meeting of university
trustees scheduled for Sunday has taken on new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   John Walda and Frederick Eichhorn _ the trustees who were
assigned to investigate charges that Knight put his hand around the
neck of the former Hoosier player Neil Reid at a practice in 1997 _
are expected to report at the meeting about the progress of their
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But several other recently reported accusations about Knight's
behavior have created the sense that the nine trustees may decide
to expand the investigation of Knight or begin moves to force the
coach out. The most damaging new accusation is from Jeanette
Hartgraves, the athletic department secretary, who said Knight
threw a vase in her office 12 years ago, shattering it against a
wall, in an angry fit about not being able to see Ralph Floyd, who
was then the school's athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Simpson, Indiana's vice president, denied Friday
that trustees were already considering whether to ask Knight to
resign, and he disputed reports that the coach was scheduled to
meet with Myles Brand, the school's president, on Sunday. He said
Knight was on vacation and due to return late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who has spoken for Brand throughout the investigation,
said that if a meeting had been set up between the coach and the
school president ``I would think I'd be aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The quickened pace of the investigation, which was originally
intended to conclude by June, has prompted more public
demonstrations of support for Knight, as well as newly stated
opposition to the embattled coach. Todd Starowitz, an athletic
department spokesman, said many of the team's current players said
they would leave the program if Knight was forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players became very upset today, and told me they were
tired of being quiet,'' Starowitz said. ``They don't want to see
things tried in the media. To a man, everyone supports Coach
Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray Sperber, an Indiana professor who frequently writes
about college sports and has been a critic of Knight, said his
e-mail messages showed the coach was beginning to lose significant
support among Hoosier fans and alumni, largely because of the
vase-smashing accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone from a steady 3-to-1 for Knight and me shutting up
to a 3-to-1 for me speaking out and `Knight must go!''' he said.
``I think that the revelations really shocked some people and
silenced others.'' &QL;

MERCKER COULD HAVE SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Anaheim Angels pitcher Kent Mercker is in stable
condition in the intensive care unit at UC Irvine Medical Center
after being diagnosed with a sub-arachnoid hematoma in his brain,
also known as a cerebral hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   An arteriogram and CT scan were performed late Thursday night
after Mercker left the game complaining of a severe headache and
dizziness. The tests showed bleeding within space of the brain,
according to Dr. John Kusske, chair of neurologic surgery at UCI.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, 32, will remain in intensive care at least through the
weekend for further evaluation and tests before moving to a regular
room. Doctors are trying to determine the cause of the bleeding,
which has stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't localized it,'' said Angels team physician Dr.
Lewis Yocum. ''The bleeding settles in the lower part of the skull.
An injury of some sort prompted the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen it in baseball. I've seen it with concussions,
it's fairly common in hockey. But I haven't heard of active
bleeding in a baseball player. It's something that could occur with
the stress of pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Yocum said surgery is a possibility, but the course of treatment
will be based on the cause of the problem. It could be the result
of an aneurism, malformation or any number of medical conditions.
It also could be a one-time occurrence, but it remains a serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there's bleeding around the brain, it's a potentially
serious situation,'' Yocum said. ``He was very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker also was fortunate Yocum and team trainer Ned Bergert
decided to send Mercker to the hospital for tests Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw things not typical of a mild headache,'' Yocum said.
``The severity of the headache, other medical signs. Ned and I
didn't feel comfortable trying to take care of it at the
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman, Yocum and pitcher Kent
Bottenfield, a friend of Mercker's and teammate with the Cardinals,
visited Mercker at the hospital Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sleeping but woke up when we got in,'' Stoneman said.
``He recognized us immediately and had a smile on his face. He had
a lot of gadgets attached to him, but other than that he looked
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia and several players learned the severity
of Mercker's situation while in the clubhouse after Thursday's
game, and it took them by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to see him in the trainers' room a couple of minutes
after he came out of the game and it seemed like he was feeling
better,'' Scioscia said. ``But he still had a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia addressed the team during a midafternoon meeting on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We addressed the team, not only to give them an update but
also to set up a support group for Kent and his family,'' he said.
``You're talking about a guy in his early 30s. Having a condition
like this transcends anything happening on the baseball field. It
makes it trivial. It's very frightening to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker's wife Julie is flying to Orange County today from the
couple's home in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the medical department is very concerned, and when
they're concerned, it's something serious,'' Scioscia said. ``This
is real life, the real world. It's sobering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously our concern right now is for Kent's well-being. Our
thoughts and prayers are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was placed on the 15-day disabled list Friday.

WESTERN RESOURCES PAID CEO $8 MILLION IN 1999, PROXY STATEMENT
SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   TOPEKA, Kan. _ David Wittig, chief
executive officer of Western Resources Inc., got an $8 million
paycheck in 1999, including a one-time $5.4 million payment as
compensation for lost benefits and income from a previous employer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The compensation, which was disclosed in the company's proxy
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, came
in a year when the company struggled with its investment in
Protection One Inc., a monitored security company. The company also
tried to complete its merger with Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co., a
deal that ultimately fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig received no bonus for short-term performance of the
company in 1999. But the $5.4 million payment is raising eyebrows
because the company has struggled to conserve cash and has asked
shareholders to take stock instead of a cash dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded, '' said Walker Hendrix, counsel for the
Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board, a consumer group. ``I don't
understand why with everything else they picked this year'' to pay
the $5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Koupal Jr., a Western executive vice president, said the
$5.4 million was agreed to in 1995, when Wittig joined Western. He
left a higher-paying job at the Wall Street firm of Salomon
Brothers to come to Topeka. The payment, which was to be made in
1999, was meant to bridge the difference.
</P>
<P>
   In other compensation in 1999, Wittig took more of it in stock
than cash. He now has 450,000 shares of Western stock, not counting
stock options, and has an interest in seeing Western's stock price
recover, Koupal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His interests are clearly in line with shareholders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most utility stocks did poorly in 1999, Western performed
below average. If an investor had held $149 of Western stock on
Dec, 31, 1998, it would have been worth $83 a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Western closed Friday at 15.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy statement also disclosed Western has a life insurance
policy on Wittig and will recover the $5.4 million when he dies.
Wittig is 44.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Cafer, general counsel for the Kansas Corporation
Commission, said regulators would only consider the appropriateness
of the $5.4 million payment if the company asked to include it in
future rates. Current rates do not allow the payment to be
shouldered by consumers. &QL;

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT TESTIMONY ON KOREAN MASSACRE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Tenn.)  (CORRECTS ``foxhole'' to ``machine-gun emplacement'' in 21st graf
begin: ``And one soldier...'') 
By ELIZABETH BECKER and FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New evidence has been published that appears to undermine the
testimony of two witnesses who said that U.S. soldiers were ordered
to kill civilians during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Their charge was featured in a prominent and detailed news
report last September by the Associated Press, which concluded for
the first time that U.S. soldiers killed hundreds of Korean
civilians in June 1950. It also quoted veterans who said they were
at the scene, some of whom said they were given orders to shoot.
Other soldiers quoted by the wire service said they did not
remember such orders.
</P>
<P>
   Army documents retrieved by Stripes.com, an electronic edition
of The Stars and Stripes, which covers the military, and an
investigation by U.S. News &AMP; World Report, question the credibility
of Edward Daily, a witness in the original Associated Press
investigation of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The new reports state that he was not at the site, the No Gun Ri
bridge, when the refugees were killed, but instead was serving with
a maintenance unit miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Daily was among those who told the Associated Press that the
shootings of civilians at No Gun Ri were carried out under orders.
``The command looked at it as getting rid of the problem in the
easiest way,'' he said. ``That was to shoot them in a group.''
</P>
<P>
   A second of the dozen witnesses quoted in the original
Associated Press report, Delos Flint, also was not at the bridge on
July 26, 1950, when the shooting reportedly began, according to the
new reports; they found he had been wounded and was already ferried
off the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Friday, Flint stuck by what he told the AP.
``They told us to shoot,'' he said from his home in Clio, Mich. ``I
told the other guys you can shoot all you want but I didn't believe
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flint said he could not remember much of what happened after
he was seriously wounded in the fighting. ``I don't hardly remember
being sent to the hospital and I didn't remember anything for a
long time after the war,'' he said. ``I do remember spending 18
months in the hospital at Valley Forge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these discrepancies, senior Defense Department officials
said Friday that an Army investigation has confirmed the central
element of the AP report, that U.S. troops fired on refugees,
resulting in what the Pentagon calls the ``tragic death of hundreds
of civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon would not comment on the scope of the killings, nor
the duration of the shootings, while the investigation is under
way.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has concluded that as many as several hundred civilians
were killed at No Gun Ri and is focusing on the orders given to the
U.S. soldiers at the bridge, according to a senior Army official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the taking of innocent life,'' said the senior
Army official, who noted that over 1 million people died in that
war. ``What was unique in this situation was this notion that it
was intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official said the Army has interviewed
hundreds of witnesses, American and South Korean, and is examining
thousands of pages of documents to discover whether GIs killed
civilians accidentally in the heat of battle, whether they were
ordered to do so, or whether they thought they were under orders to
do so, as some of the A P witnesses asserted.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy AP investigation in September won two of
journalism's most prestigious awards, a Pulitzer and the Polk.
Numerous newspapers, including The New York Times, carried the
report on their front pages. And it prompted an investigation by
the Pentagon, concerned about the impact on relations with an
important Asian ally, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts about some sources are coming out just over a month
after the board of the Pulitzer Prizes awarded the AP its prize for
investigative reporting, ``for revealing, with extensive
documentation, the decades-old secret of how America soldiers early
in the Korean War killed hundreds of Korean civilians in a massacre
at No Gun Ri Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement this week and later interviews, AP officials
defended their work, saying that Daily's account was not central to
the original dispatch nor to subsequent accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And they said they do not question the ambiguous and sometimes
contradictory evidence of how the killings at No Gun Ri occurred _
rather, they say, their reports reflected that ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Smith Tunney, the director of corporate communications for
the wire service, said Friday, ``The first question is what
happened at the bridge. We have done extensive research and double
and triple-checked facts. And we're not apologetic about what we've
done. It was all dependent on distant records and there were many
ambiguities, all of which was in our original reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Former soldiers initially interviewed by the AP gave accounts
that contradict the new reports, and placed Daily at No Gun Ri,
according to one of the reporters. A copy of the memo was made
available Fridayto The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   One former soldier, an officer, described Daily's receipt of a
battlefield commission.
</P>
<P>
   And another soldier present, Jim Kerns, drew for the AP
reporters a diagram of his machine-gun emplacement and those on
either side, according to Martha Mendoza, one of the three
reporters who wrote the article. ``I was on the right-hand side,
Daily was on the left, and Harold Blanc, he was in the middle,''
Kerns said, according to the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Army refused to comment on the new evidence uncovered by the
news organizations this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to maintain the integrity of the No Gun Ri review, we
will not address the accuracy of any press reports,'' Charles L.
Cragin, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel, said in a
statement. ``It is premature to discuss our findings until the
review is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident at the railroad bridge near the village of No Gun
Ri took place in the early days of the Korean War. Army commanders
feared that North Korean infiltrators were part of the refugees
fleeing the fighting between the two Korean armies.
</P>
<P>
   The AP said their reporters had spoken to six veterans who said
they fired at the refugees and six others said they witnessed a
mass killing. Daily and Flint were two of the veterans who have
said they were at the bridge and were ordered to fire on civilians.
Following the first AP report, they were interviewed by other
newspapers, magazines and television networks, and expanded on
their original charges.
</P>
<P>
   However, the official Army records unearthed by Stripes.com
showing that neither man was at No Gun Ri when the refugees came
under fire. The evidence about Daily's presence at the scene is the
most sharply disputed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newly uncovered documents, Daily did not serve
in the unit, and did not receive the battlefield commission he
described to the AP. The documents also contradict other examples
that Daily has cited of his military record.
</P>
<P>
   In an autobiographical sketch for a history of his division's
Korean War experiences, Daily claimed to have been awarded the
Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star and three
Purple Heart medals, none of which appear in his official record,
according to the newly uncovered documents.
</P>
<P>
   Daily could not be reached for comment at his home in Tennessee,
but Mendoza, in an interview yesterday quoted from the text of
video tape interviews with Carroll. Mendoza quoted Carroll
describing Daily's battlefield commission, ``Daily was commissioned
as a 19-year old kid,'' he said. ``That's how short we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other documentary evidence contradicts the memories
of other principals, according to AP journalists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Hanley, another of the three AP reporters, said that
Eu- gene Hesselman, in an early inter- view, contradicted the daily
report for his unit.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's ``morning report'' indi- cates that he had been
wounded and evacuated on the day the killing be- gan. Hanley said
that Hessel-H man had explained to a reporter months before the
publication of the No Gun Ri report that he had re- ceived a
shrapnel wound to the hand, but had remained at the site after
being bandaged.
</P>
<P>
   According to several documents, Flint had been evacuated for
medical treatment the day before the incident , according to the
new reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that some guy isn't credible doesn't mean we don't
have a problem,'' said a senior Pentagon official. ``But it is a
warning that there is bad information floating around.''
</P>
<P>
   In those first months of the war, the Army was under-equipped
and poorly trained, according to Col. David R. Hughes, retired, who
as a lieutenant in the th Cavalry earned a distinguished cross and
two silver stars in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a seven-mile retreat just before No Gun Ri and the
first units got chewed up badly,'' said Hughes who arrived in Korea
a few months after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official said the investigation will be
completed in the fall, not in June as originally planned.

   The wire service began piecing together accounts of the massacre
after one of its Korea-based reporters, Sang Hun Choe, covered the
latest unsuccessful attempt of some of the victims to gain
reparations. Last September, the AP published the long account,
which is still posted on its Web site (www.ap.org),, complete with
videotapes containing sections of interviews with Daily and
Hesselman.
</P>
<P>
   The AP released an article early Friday on the Army's continuing
investigation into No Gun Ri. The article cited the documents
uncovered by Stripes.com that contradicted the AP investigation,
and noted that U.S. News was preparing a report on the matter.

MOVE TO REVIVE LAPD SENIOR LEAD OFFICER PROGRAM GETS BOOST
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ City Attorney James Hahn issued a legal opinion
Friday that the Police Commission has the authority to order Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks to revive the popular Senior Lead Officer
program.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn personally endorsed reinstating the program that was
dismantled by Parks who believes the SLOs should augment normal
patrols and that all officers should be effective community
relations officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been such an invaluable team member on our community
enforcement efforts working on quality of life issues,'' said Hahn,
who is running for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hasn't been the same since they had to return to
duties in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks was out of town Friday and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The council's Public Safety Committee asked for Hahn's opinion
whether the City Council can direct the Police Commission to
instruct Parks to reinstate the program, after it became clear
earlier this month that the chief would not budge on his position.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Parks altered the neighborhood liaison program launched
as part of Christopher Commission reforms after the Rodney King
scandal. He said that all of the Department's officers should be
trained in and carrying out community-based policing.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commission President Gerald Chaleff said the Rampart
Independent Review Panel already has a working group looking at the
SLO program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will rate the recommendations and the results of their
study,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Joel Wachs, also a mayoral candidate, who has
been pushing for the program, said he was delighted with Hahn's
ruling and that he personally will ask the Police Commission to
take up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is really imperative,'' Wachs said. ``If ever
there was a time when we had to restore public confidence in the
department and build police-community partnerships, it's now.''

ELECTION-FLAKE _ The state Democratic Party announced Friday that
it will file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission
accusing GOP congressional candidate Jeff Flake of violating
campaign-finance aw. The announcement came an Arizona Republic
story detailing Flake's $72,000consulting fee from the tax-exempt
Arizona School Choice Trust, which was made possible by a
tax-deductible, $50,000 donation from Flake's campaign-finance
chairman. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCHOOL-INSPECT _ The company in charge of a mammoth statewide
school inspection is financially troubled and dogged by lawsuits
from creditors, raising serious questions about its work. &UR; Arizona
is refusing to pay any &UR; more on the $2.6 million contract until
Ohio-based Flex-Tech Professional Services re-inspects 303 schools.
Reports from those schools were wrong, inadequate or could not be
produced. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FIRE (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ When local radio stations announced where
Los Alamos residents could discover whether their homes were still
standing, evacuees spilled from hotels and friends' homes, creating
a traffic jam on New Mexico 502 at the turnoff to Pojoaque High
School. There, they found Red Cross volunteer Marion Johnson
standing on a chair, yelling out the addresses of the 260 homes
destroyed by this week's ``Cerro Grande'' fire. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL;

GASOLINE PRICES EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH ALL SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Gasoline prices are
back up, and they're likely to stay there with summer vacations
just ahead.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now the full effect of OPEC's decision in March to sell more
crude oil was supposed to have brought gas prices down. In fact,
prices in the Kansas City area fell an average of nearly 20 cents
per gallon for unleaded gas in the month following the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But prices this week rose to an average of $1.40 cents per
gallon _ just 4 cents under the year's high. And with the heavy
travel season just beginning, the prices could go even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the looks of this at all,'' said Mike Right, a
spokesman for AAA Auto Club of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices also have jumped nationwide. According to AAA's
weekly surveys, the price of gasoline in the Kansas City area has
gone up 16 cents per gallon since April 28 to $1.40. Motorists in
St. Louis, who have to use reformulated gasoline because of air
quality, are now paying $1.49 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   And any relief in the near future appears unlikely, especially
with OPEC recently announcing that they didn't intend to make any
additional production increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some ominous signs on the horizon,'' Right said.
</P>
<P>
   When OPEC announced in March it would increase output, the
question was when _ and not if _ motorists would get some relief
from higher prices. Initially, prices declined. But it didn't last
long.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for crude oil are now hovering at $30 per barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, which is near their highs for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The federal Energy Information Administration
said OPEC's increased output is insufficient to build stockpiles of
gasoline through the third quarter of the year. That means low
inventories and little cushion to meet any unexpected demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still seeing low (gasoline) stockpiles,'' said Tancred
Lidderdale, a refinery industry analyst for the Energy Information
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that oil markets have become increasingly
skittish. When the International Energy Agency reported Thursday
that it was worried supplies could not keep up with demand by the
end of the year, the price of crude oil went up $1 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, the Energy Information Administration sees further
declines in gas prices. But don't hold your breath. That will come
in 2001, according to the agency's energy forecast. &QL;

A CHILD'S LIFE LOST IN TORNADO AFTERMATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE and JERRY BERRIOS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The danger to human
life appeared to be past. But nearly 12 hours after a tornado
touched down in southern Leavenworth County, Kan., a porch roof
collapsed about 10:30 a.m. Friday and killed a 4-year-old girl in
Tonganoxie.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The girl, whose name was not released Friday, was pronounced
dead at Children's Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only fatality _ and no one else was reported injured
_ as a result of at least two tornadoes and straight-line winds
that raked Tonganoxie and Kansas City, North.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night storm skipped and plundered its way over and
through parts of Leavenworth County and Clay County in Missouri,
catching many people sleeping or unawares. Trees were uprooted;
power was knocked out at several thousand homes; and material from
structures and fixtures became flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   At a car dealership, a Toyota Tundra pickup truck ended up on
the general sales manager's desk. The dealership was closed when
the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, North, J.D. Campbell marveled at the tornado's
randomness as he helped a neighbor clear tree limbs from her yard
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature moves in mysterious ways,'' said Campbell, who
lives in the Prather Hills neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive damage in the Northland was limited to a relatively
small area. Hardest hit were the Jay Wolfe Toyota dealership and
the John Chezik Honda dealership, both in the 3900 block of North
Oak Trafficway.
</P>
<P>
   In Leavenworth County, more than 200 structures were damaged,
including 125 homes and 25 businesses in Tonganoxie, a town of
about 3,000 people. An Assembly of God Church was destroyed, and
four of 17 buildings at the Leavenworth County Fairgrounds were
destroyed or badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said a tornado touched down in
Tonganoxie about 9:55 p.m. and stayed on or near the ground in
Leavenworth County until about 10:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado from the same system touched down about 11:25 p.m. on
North Oak Trafficway. That funnel cloud stayed on or near the
ground for about four miles, to Northeast Parvin Road and Chouteau
Trafficway.
</P>
<P>
   Some Northland residents reported hearing the sirens after the
tornado had passed. Others said they heard the sirens before the
storm. And others said they couldn't remember what came first _ the
tornado or the sirens.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor warning sirens in Kansas City were activated at
11:25 p.m., said Kansas City Emergency Preparedness Coordinator
Mike Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Karl acknowledged that some residents had complained about not
hearing the sirens, but he said the sirens are an outdoor warning
system only and can be difficult to hear indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has 54 outdoor warning sirens; most are placed on
poles near police and fire stations, schools and parks, Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tonganoxie, officials said, the sirens went off about 10
minutes before the tornado touched down. Tragedy
</P>
<P>
   In Tonganoxie, Dennis Stevens, the owner of a Kansas City tree
service, was trimming a storm-damaged tree in the 500 block of
Sixth Street Friday morning. Next door, he said, he saw a man on
the porch's small, flat roof clearing debris and cutting tree limbs
with a chain saw. Then, he saw the roof collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard all this screaming,'' Stevens said. ``I thought
somebody had to be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonganoxie Police Chief Ken Carpenter said he expected the
girl's name and city of residence to be released this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, most of the damage appeared to be caused by fallen
tree branches, which leaned against roofs Friday and littered the
front yards of most of the homes around downtown Tonganoxie.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Franiuk said keeping the town safe was a priority.
The National Guard is scheduled to come in today to help keep
traffic away from a one-square-mile section around downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate this thing did not touch down hard and
heavy, because we'd be in real trouble,'' Franiuk said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado stripped part of the roof from Tonganoxie Elementary
School and water soaked six classrooms. The damage: at least
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Classes were canceled at the school, as they were at the
Tonganoxie junior and senior high schools. The latter schools
escaped damaged but were closed in case temporary shelter was
needed, although it wasn't. The elementary school could reopen
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves issued a
declaration of disaster emergency. Spokesman Don Brown said the
declaration set in motion an assessment of the damage by state
agencies. That could result in federal assistance, including
low-interest loans for damage repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Kansas Adjutant General Greg Gardner was in
Tonganoxie Friday. Insurance Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius is to
survey the damage Monday. Cars smashed
</P>
<P>
   Steve Okenfuss, managing partner of the Jay Wolfe Toyota
dealership at 3920 North Oak Trafficway, stood outside police tape
Friday and surveyed piles of twisted metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just demolished the building and everything inside of it,''
Okenfuss said, referring to the tornado. ``It looks like a big foot
just smashed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Okenfuss said two Toyota Land Cruisers were holding up the front
of the building. Of the 300 vehicles on the lot, Okenfuss said,
about 100 were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Although damage was extensive, he said, the situation could have
been worse. ``Fortunately, the building was empty,'' Okenfuss said.
``If this had hit at 5 p.m., there would have been 40 people
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the dealership's future at the North Oak Trafficway
location might be decided next week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Chezik said he hoped to be selling cars on
Monday and have his dealership and 63 employees fully operational
by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chezik said he was amazed at the damage. Of 217 cars on the lot,
he said, 48 were damaged. Chezik said more than 700 memorabilia
items that he stored at the dealership were safe. Items include
baseballs, bats, shoes and jerseys autographed by baseball stars
such as Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting North Oak Trafficway, the storm headed east and
did damage in several neighborhoods between North Oak Trafficway,
Vivion Road, Chouteau Trafficway and the North Kansas City
boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Hit especially hard were the Sunset Hills, Sunset-Dixon, Prather
Hills and Cooley-Highlands neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry King, who lives on North Cherry Street, couldn't walk down
his front steps Friday because of the twisted pieces of metal.
``I'm just glad we are alive,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-foot-long steel beam, thought to be from the Jay Wolfe
dealership, sliced through Bernice and Tom Smiroldo's living room a
few blocks away on Northeast 39th Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bernice Smiroldo felt lucky. ``I would sure have hated
for it to come through the bedroom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, neighbor Denise Lanning agreed. ``This could
have been a tragedy for a lot of people,'' she said. Storms erupt
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bunting, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service
in Pleasant Hill, said the storm produced tornadoes and also
powerful, straight-line winds.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system brewed up west of Topeka, Kan.,when warm moist
air was able to rise into a cool air mass. The storm likely spawned
two or three funnel clouds at Tonganoxie with winds up to 112 mph,
a class F1 tornado, said Lynn Maximuk, chief meteorologist for the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service classifies tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F5
being the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Once past Tonganoxie, Maximuk said, the tornado lost strength
and moved east with wind speeds of 60 to 70 mph. Maximuk said it
ended about 10:15 near Basehor in Leavenworth County.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorm cell continued east at 25 mph, through
Wyandotte County, Kan., and then Platte County, Mo. Later, the
storm intensified rapidly over southern Clay County.
</P>
<P>
   There, a tornado developed and stayed on the ground for four
miles. Bunting said the funnel ended about 11:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A myth that has been repeated many times holds that
tornado-bearing storms approaching Kansas City from the west veer
south or north of the metro area as they approach outlying areas,
such as Tonganoxie, perhaps because of geography or temperature
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this kills the Tonganoxie split theory,'' Bunting
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, the last tornado recorded by the National
Weather Service in the metro area was in western Leavenworth County
in 1996. Other tornadoes were reported in Lee's Summit, Mo., in
1992 and in Pleasant Hill, Mo., in 1977, and some weaker tornadoes,
without large amounts of damage, have also been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The most infamous tornado to strike the area in recent decades
was in 1957. A tornado touched down near Williamsburg, Kan., and
roared northeast through the Missouri towns of Martin City,
Grandview, Hickman Mills and Ruskin Heights. On the ground for 71
miles, it killed 44 persons and injured 531. Hundreds of homes were
destroyed. &QL;

MORALE ERODING AMONG LAPD OFFICERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reacting to U.S. Justice Department claims that
Los Angeles police violate residents' civil rights, many patrol
officers say morale has hit a new low and it has damaged how they
do their jobs, in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any morale. Instead of helping out each other,
we're almost against each other. Everyone's paranoid,'' said a West
Valley Division officer and five-year veteran of the department.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bill Lann Lee, acting chief of the Justice
Department's Civil Rights Division, charged that lax supervision
has led officers to engage in ``a pattern or practice of excessive
force, false arrests and unreasonable searches and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former Los Angeles civil rights lawyer, also said the
city must accept a consent decree or defend itself in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several officers said they welcome a lawsuit to
exonerate the rank-and-file, but federal oversight could seriously
damage the Los Angeles Police Department's law enforcement effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought it was bad now? Wait till the feds come in,'' said
an officer, who like others asked for his identity to be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   One sergeant said he'd like to see the issue go to court so that
the allegations are detailed and defended. ``I'd like to know
specifically what we've done,'' said Sgt. Bob Weisz of the West
Valley Divison.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear generalities, but no specifics. I see the finest
officers in the world here. I'd like to see the city attorney fight
it, rather than run and hide,'' said Weisz, a 27-year LAPD veteran.
``I really don't think they're going to find viable facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer John Smith of the North Hollywood Division said federal
scrutiny would prove the rank-and-file officers are doing their
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the federal government's takeover and threatened
consent decree is a vindication of rank and file's assertion that
it's management's fault. Management got us where we're at. It gives
credibility to that belief,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not totally opposed to having the federal government come
in and take over _ taking it out of the hands of the City Council,
taking it out of the hands of the politicians and putting it in the
hands of the people it needs to be in, and that's legal experts,
judges and lawyers _ people who implement the law, not the
professional administrators and professional politicians. I think
it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officers said the extra scrutiny on the rank and file may
make them more apt to ``drive by and wave'' to people, rather than
stop and confront them.
</P>
<P>
   Several said rather than federal oversight, the Los Angeles
Police Department needs better-trained supervisors who properly
manage officers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   However, some officers welcomed the federal monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me. I have no fear for the feds to come
in,'' said one Foothill Division officer.
</P>
<P>
   One West Valley officer of 10 years agreed that he had no
problem with the federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody's doing their job right, they don't have anything
to worry about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers throughout the San Fernando Valley argue there's
plenty to be concerned about, including federal officials being
unfamiliar with department policies and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   And they worry that the prospect of being second-guessed will
cause them to hesitate when they should be acting instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's where you see that lack of proactive police
work,'' one West Valley officer said after joking with his fellow
officers by picking up the phone and identifying himself as the
``FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Valley officer with the department for five years cited
an example: A condominium complex was having problems with
prowlers, and police had no suspect descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The officer decided to do extra patrol there recently and ran
into three African-American men wearing gloves and coats on a warm
day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me being white and them black, I'm not going to deal with
the race problem here,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'm checking out the area, where there have been
burglaries, and if they see anything suspicious, please call the
police station and that I appreciated their help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makes you sick, huh?'' the officer said, knowing full well
that they were the potential suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like that before. Before, you'd tell them to turn
around and put their hands on their head and ask them, What the
hell are you doing wearing gloves in the summertime? You'd ask who
they are, where they live and pat them down for weapons and ID,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that, he said, could now potentially label him a ``problem
officer'' today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Foothill Division officer questioned the timeliness of
the federal authorities' four-year probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the feds have known the past couple years that something
was wrong, why didn't they step in long ago?''

 Missouri General Assembly ends session  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR and OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ A muddled
legislative session beset by partisan bickering lurched to an end
Friday with individual senators killing major bills and House
members rehashing issues from earlier in the year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Missouri General Assembly approved 83 bills this year,
compared with an average of 203 over the past 15 years. While each
party blamed the other for the paucity of legislation, both tried
to put the best spin on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, we've had a lot of achievements,'' said Senate
President pro tem Ed Quick, a Democrat from Liberty. ``We've had
some disappointments, but we ended up with a pretty fair session.
We'd prefer to talk about what we were able to do for citizens
instead of why we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Steve Ehlmann, a St. Charles Republican, said the GOP had
tried to follow the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, we could have,'' he said. ``There's nothing we
didn't do today that we can't wait to do next January.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan said the session was a good one considering
the overtly political environment of this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were fighting the election every day,'' he said.
``There are other things in life besides this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he was most proud of the passage of a plan to
issue $2.25 billion in bonds for road construction. to win approval
of a plan in his last year in office would have been a particular
disappointment, he said. ]
</P>
<P>
   He also cited legislation on fighting child abuse and
methamphetamine, expanding gun-free schools and funding education
as major accomplishments. Carnahan said failing to designate how
tobacco settlement funds would be used was bad public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take any imagination to know what will happen,''
Carnahan said. ``There will be urgent good needs, and we'll just
take it from the tobacco money. You saw that happen this session.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was disappointed that tougher drunken driving
legislation had failed. suspected drunken drivers. ]
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislative leaders complained that abortion managed
to worm its way into nearly every issue. House Speaker Steve Gaw, a
Democrat from Moberly, noted that abortion provisions were even
attached to bills regulating long-term nursing care and tanning
beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just doesn't make sense to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion also submarined a last-ditch effort to salvage a trust
fund to hold the proceeds of Missouri's tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan called for setting up a trust fund to hold the
payments from cigarette makers and ask voters to approve a plan to
spend them. That plan fell apart Wednesday when abortion opponents
insisted on sweeping language to prohibit the money from going to
any organization connected to any group that performs or refers
women for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who supports abortion rights, said the language was
unacceptable because it could have prevented the state from using
money to pay for health care at most hospitals and clinics in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents put together a plan to save the trust fund by
attaching it to a bill designed to reduce teen smoking. The added
section would have set up the account to receive the roughly $180
million a year in payments. It would have given lawmakers until
next April to submit a spending plan to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The added section made no mention of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. John Schneider of St. Louis County said he
intended to tack on the anti-abortion language.
</P>
<P>
   With only five hours left in the session, Quick reluctantly
pulled the issue from consideration and agreed to remove the trust
fund amendment from the bill. The Senate then approved the rest of
the bill, which requires much tougher laws on youth smoking. The
bill would have prohibited possession of cigarettes by youths under
18.
</P>
<P>
   However, the House killed the bill over a provision allowing the
use of children under 17 to conduct stings on tobacco retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But both chambers approved a child-protection bill inspired in
part by the torture and starvation deaths of two 8-year-old Kansas
City brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Gary Bass were found dead in October. Authorities said
reports of abuse had been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires social workers to contact police when they
open an investigation. Each county also must designate a chief
investigator who specializes in child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Social-service agencies will be required to enlist the help of
other organizations, including a public-school liaison, when
investigating abuse reports. State agencies also will provide
voluntary services for families of children thought to be at high
risk of abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Bonner, an Independence Democrat, added an amendment
to punish adults if a child left unattended in a vehicle caused an
injury or death. He said the legislation was unrelated to the death
of 6-year-old Jake Robel, who was dragged to death after being left
alone in a car that was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republican senators derailed a bill designed to
protect nursing home residents from abuse. Led by Sen. Sarah
Steelman of Rolla, the group held up a vote for two hours Friday by
insisting on including a provision that guaranteed a profit for
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would have sent up to $133 million in additional
tax money to nursing home operators who care for Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Democratic Sen. Harold Caskey of Butler,
expressed frustration at the extended debate as the clock was
winding down. He accused Steelman and Republican Sen. Bill Kenney
of Lee's Summit of trying to kill the reforms by filibustering it
to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not killing the bill,'' Steelman retorted. ``I'm trying to
help it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the government was demanding better care from nursing
homes without paying enough to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Craig Hosmer, a Springfield Democrat who handled the bill
in the House, said the bill grew out of a study committee that had
heard stories about abuse of nursing home patients from all parts
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Steelman offered an amendment that would have prohibited any of
the elderly abuse reforms from taking effect until the state
appropriated the extra money for nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Caskey was incensed. The bill's death, he said, would allow
nursing home workers to abuse and steal from residents in their
care with virtual immunity from prosecution. He said the reforms
would cost nursing homes nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're saying is to take care of your residents and check
to make sure your employees are not abusers,'' Caskey said. ``We're
not asking them to do anything more that what they already should
be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steelman and Kenney said something needed to be done to help
nursing home owners, who say Medicaid pays them $13 a day less that
it costs to care for each patient.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Goode, the St. Louis County Democrat who heads the
Budget Committee, said the proposal would precipitate a budget
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, which pays for health care for the poor, is an
entitlement program, Goode reminded his colleagues. Therefore, if a
provider performs the service, it is entitled to payment regardless
of budget constraints.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sent to the Budget Control Committee, which voted
6-2 to kill it. The extra provisions made it too expensive, members
said. (30)

KNICKS GO 1 DOWN TO HEAT AS HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE VANISHES
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a wild moment, the official Dan Crawford waved
off the basket. For a panicked few seconds, Pat Riley was coming
out of his Armani jacket, going out of his mind and coming unglued
with 2.2 seconds left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then the referees conferred and the decision was made, much to
the dismay of a distraught Jeff Van Gundy. The brave floater that
Anthony Carter sent up over the tips of Patrick Ewing's fingers
Friday night in overtime was not touched on the way down by Alonzo
Mourning. The basket was good, and the game-winner was in the
Heat's hands.
</P>
<P>
   With 2.2 seconds remaining, the New York Knicks had a chance to
win the game, but Charlie Ward's pass to Latrell Sprewell was
swiped away by Jamal Mashburn. Riley quickly exited as Madison
Square Garden fell silent. The Heat had done it: Miami had come
into the Knicks' home and stole back the home-court advantage by
taking Game 3, 77-76, Friday night. The Heat took a 2-1 advantage
in this best-of-7 second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 will be played Sunday afternoon at Madison Square Garden.
This one was a thriller. It ended with Carter guiding the Heat much
more ably than Hardaway. It ended with Mourning scoring 23 points
despite foul trouble. The Knicks were led by Allan Houston's 24
points, and 23 from Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks forced overtime when Patrick Ewing came up with his
first basket in 15 minutes as he released a game-tying 15-foot
jumper with 2.6 seconds left in regulation. Backpedaling down the
court with his wrist hanging in the air for effect, he seemed to be
waving goodbye to the Heat for the night.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if Ewing was prescient when Charlie Ward fired a
bullet pass to Marcus Camby for a dunk just a tick before the shot
clock went off to give the Knicks a 75-71 lead with 2 minutes 13
seconds left in overtime. But the Heat came back to tie the score
on two free throws from Carter, plus a jumper by Mourning with 1:17
left.
</P>
<P>
   After Ewing dribbled the ball off his own foot, the Heat had a
chance to take the lead, but Dan Majerle missed an open 3-pointer
with 30 seconds remaining. It was Ewing's turn again as he went to
the free-throw line with 13.7 seconds left. He hit one of two to
leave the Heat with a chance to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Carter drove to the basket, let go of a floater over Ewing and
watched it bounce into the basket with 2.2 seconds left. At first,
the referees ruled offensive interference. With Riley yelling, the
officials overruled the call. They did not have the benefit of
television, but the replay showed that Mourning did not touch the
ball on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   It was another episode in this rivalry that resembled a finger
painting stuck on the refrigerator _ a game only a mother could
find beauty in _ but it was not short of the kind of intense drama
that left everyone glad to witness the grinding glory of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat stayed in the game on the shooting of Clarence
Weatherspoon and P.J. Brown when Mourning was forced to sit down
for 12 minutes of the second half after picking up his fourth foul
midway in the third quarter. The Heat took a 60-57 lead with seven
minutes left in the game after Brown shook free for an open jumper
on a pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Knicks had scored just one point in the
fourth quarter. On the Knicks' next possession, Houston hit a
jumper for the team's first field goal of the fourth quarter with
6:47 left in the game. Mourning, who slipped back into the game
with eight minutes remaining, came up with a jump hook to give the
Heat a 62-59 lead. The Heat went back-and-forth with the Knicks
with plays like this: On a scramble for a loose ball, Brown dug it
out of Sprewell's hands, a play that led to a basket by Mashburn.
After Mourning lost the ball when he was trapped, he gathered it
and sent up a jumper that fell on the shot-clock buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks countered with Houston. He shook Majerle's hands-on
defense for five straight points. But Houston missed a free throw
with 2:48 left, and the Knicks trailed by 66-64. After a mindless
jumper by Mourning early on the shot clock that missed, Ward drove
the baseline and lofted up a floater right over Brown with 1:33 on
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The tension was palpable. On the Heat's next possession,
Mourning grabbed a rebound, was fouled by Ewing and went to the
free-throw line with 1:09 left. He hit both. The Knicks had a
chance to tie the score, but Houston's jumper missed, then Camby's
tap back fell off the rim. But with 24.6 seconds remaining, Carter
missed a flinging jumper as the shot-clock buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had time to line up either a game-winning 3-pointer
or a shot to tie the game. Unlike in Game 1, Camby was on the floor
instead of Larry Johnson. The Knicks ran a play to get Houston the
ball, but he missed his turnaround jumper. In a frantic scramble
for the ball, Camby tapped it to Sprewell, who sent the ball to
Ward, who missed an open 3-pointer. But the rebound went off the
Heat with 6.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went to Houston. And knowing the Heat would double him,
Houston directed the pass to Ewing, who hit his 15-footer to send
the game into an overtime that ultimately proved extremely
frustrating for the Knicks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks wanted to approach Game 3 more clear-headed. For two
days, Van Gundy preached assertiveness to a team that seemed easily
flustered in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing, when you do get open against Miami, you have to be
ready to shoot and you have to play without hesitation,'' Van Gundy
said before Game 3. ``You can't hesitate when you get it because
they're going to close hard. You can't pass up open shots.
Indecision and hesitation is hurting us right now offensively. You
have to shoot it, catch and pass it, or catch and drive it
immediately.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RILEY FINDING HIS TIME IS PASSING BY
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Riley is back in town, the venerable crunch-time
coach who brought you Showtime in Los Angeles, Short Time in New
York and now Zo Time in Miami. Friday night Riley pulled another
rabbit out of his hat with Alonzo Mourning saddled with fouls and
Tim Hardaway barely able to walk. The Miami Heat forced the New
York Knicks to play one of those nasty, head-butting, arm-wrestling
games that used to be New York's signature but now is just
something they do whenever they play Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing's jumper with 2.6 seconds left sent this brutal
Game 3 into overtime. But then the rookie Anthony Carter _ Miami's
rabbit in the hat _ threw up a shot from almost behind the basket
with 2.7 seconds left in overtime to give the Heat a 77-76 victory.
Thus, in one game the Heat managed to beat up the Knicks, retake
home-court advantage and take a 2-1 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, just when you were about to write off Riley, call
him a thing of the past, he gives himself another day.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the coaches who patrol the NBA sidelines, Riley has left
the most intriguing footprints. More intriguing than Lenny Wilkens,
though he has not coached as long, more intriguing than Phil
Jackson, though he has not won a recent championship.
</P>
<P>
   Riley represents a thick slice of history and evolution in the
NBA, from substance to style. He's part of the transition of an era
when the NBA leaped from the shadows and devoured college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The footprints leave a trail from Schenectady, N.Y., to
Lexington Ky., and Adolph Rupp's segregated world of basketball. To
a journeyman player's career through the NBA: San Diego, Los
Angeles, Phoenix. From there, to the Lakers' radio network, to the
Lakers' bench as an assistant coach, then as head coach, inheriting
one of the great teams in NBA history, anchored by Magic, Kareem
and Worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Riley fashioned the Knicks into his own image of a grinding,
nasty, mean team. Now Riley, at age 55, seems stuck. After nearly
20 seasons of coaching, four NBA championships, motivational books
and lectures, he seems stuck between gears. He pulls a rabbit out
of the hat every now and then, but no one thinks of him much as a
magician anymore. The Heat has not gone beyond the second round of
the playoffs since 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the Knicks swooped in on Miami and took away its
home-court advantage for the fourth consecutive year. The Knicks
have eliminated Miami the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's loss, Riley made an interesting point that goes
to the source of his and Miami's dilemma. He said the team worked
hard for 82 games to earn the home-court edge. ``We gave it all
back in one two-hour stand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That has become the Heat: tearing through the regular season,
going all out on a Wednesday night in December to win a meaningless
game. When the playoffs arrive, Miami is beaten down by the
intensity of its own heat.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is the coach and president of an empire he created. Like
so many icons and legends, Riley has lost track of time and a sense
of timing. One local talk-show host in Miami calls Riley ``Stand
Pat Pat'' because he has kept Miami's nucleus together so long. Too
long.
</P>
<P>
   Riley kept Hardaway one season too long even when all signals
pointed to the fact that the once-mercurial guard no longer
possessed the skills to take Miami close to the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird understands that success is dependent on players.
That's why he is getting out of coaching. No player can do what he
did in the clutch. So why bother? When Riley was in Los Angeles, he
was in awe of Kareem and Magic. With each successive head-coaching
job, he seems to have embraced a narcissism that puts him at the
center of every universe.
</P>
<P>
   Miami could come out these next two games and scorch the Knicks
and then go back to Miami and avenge the last two early exits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. The Heat is limited to a brawling, brutal style of
basketball that used to define the Knicks. But the Knicks have
added Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby while Miami stood pat.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is the last of the supercoach era, but his luster is
wearing thin, though there is always something captivating about
him. The Knicks-Heat soap opera has moved to New York for
Heat-inspired slugging and sloshing around.
</P>
<P>
   That phase of this drama is coming to a close. The other day
someone asked Hardaway how his injuries were affecting his play.
Hardaway said, ``I can see places I want to go, but I can't get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   A fitting portrait of the man who used to be the king of crunch
time.

ADAM PETTY KILLED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
 - PETTY-NYT   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam Petty, the only fourth-generation athlete in U.S. sports
and part of the famous NASCAR auto racing family, died Friday after
after a crash while practicing at New Hampshire International
Speedway. He was 19.
</P>
<P>
   Petty's car appeared to brush the wall on Turn 3 of the
1.058-mile track in Loudon, N.H., spin out and then slam into the
wall. Petty was preparing for Friday's qualifying for Saturday's
Busch 200.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of his red and blue No. 45 Sprint PCS Chevrolet had to
be cut open to remove him as the crowd looking on fell silent. He
was rushed to Concord Hospital, where he died of head trauma, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first driver's death at a NASCAR event since 1994,
when the Winston Cup drivers Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr each died
in separate crashes at Speedweek in Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Petty was the great-grandson of one of stock-car racing's early
stars, Lee Petty, who won three season titles; the grandson of the
sport's most successful driver, Richard Petty, with seven season
titles; and the son of Kyle Petty, at 39 a Winston Cup series
regular and the head of Petty Enterprises. Lee Petty, 86, died on
April 5 after complications from surgery for a stomach aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty was headed back from Europe Friday with his daughter
and was unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   One snapshot that will endure is of Adam at age 1, being hoisted
onto Richard Petty's shoulders in Victory Lane after his
grandfather won the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``As young as he was, I think that day he decided he had such a
good time that he was coming back,'' said Chip Williams, a veteran
NASCAR publicist. ``All he ever wanted to do was race cars. I've
never seen anyone happier to be racing. Really, I've never seen
anyone happier to be doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he could not remember crying around the racetrack,
but he admitted that he cried on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a girlfriend,'' Williams said of Petty. ``He
put everything into racing, and he was one of the happiest guys on
earth. He would hate to hear me say it, but he was truly a sweet
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty began racing Go Karts at age 6. He made his NASCAR debut
at 17 in the Nascar Weekly Racing Series, competing in 25 races.
The following year, 1998, he got his initial Busch Series start,
finishing 27th. Last year he started in 29 Busch races, with no
victories and a high finish of fourth.
</P>
<P>
   This year in the Busch Series, his best finish was 12th in 11
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Enterprises' tentative plan, after it signed a deal with
Dodge to drive two of its cars when the manufacturer returns to
Winston Cup Series racing next season, was to have Adam Petty drive
one of them and try to win the rookie of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Petty's death may raise questions about what age drivers
should be and how much experience they should have before being
allowed to compete in the sport's upper echelon, where speeds can
approach 200 mph. Some argue that a famous last name can sometimes
serve as a dangerous shortcut to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether the corners at the newer tracks _
New Hampshire International Speedway opened in 1993 _ are too wide,
creating more risk of cars spinning out of control, as Petty's
apparently did.
</P>
<P>
   But those are issues for another day. On Friday, there was too
much shock.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR president, Bill France, issued a statement of
condolence, in particular to Petty's parents, Kyle and Pattie, and
his grandparents Richard and Lynda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pettys are an integral part of the sport of NASCAR,''
France said. ``The entire NASCAR community will miss Adam Petty.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran driver Sterling Marlin said he thought of the trauma
gripping the Petty family, with Adam's death coming so close after
his great-grandfather's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really suffered some losses in the last few weeks,''
Marlin said. ``I know they are having a hard time right now.'' &QL;

HUNDLEY LIKES WHAT HE SEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ With catcher Todd Hundley coming off the brutal and
frustrating 1999 season, a few months ago it didn't seem to matter
he would be a free agent at the end of the season, a remnant of the
Los Angeles Dodgers buying out his option shortly after he was
acquired in a 1998 trade.
</P>
<P>
   But an offseason of incredible work has turned around Hundley's
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   If his output continues, Hundley's switch-hitting bat,
especially his power from the left side, could make him a coveted
player, because teams want that pop in the middle of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time in six games, Hundley homered, a two-run shot
in the first inning of the Dodgers' 13-0 win against St. Louis on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel normal again,'' said Hundley, who has nine homers and
25 RBI. ``I feel like I did a couple of years ago, before I got
hurt. The work I put in this winter is starting to pay off. That's
what I attribute it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Only left fielder Gary Sheffield has more homers (11) and RBI
(28) than Hundley, who's hitting .297. In his last seven games,
Hundley's hitting .304 (7 for 23) with five homers and 12 RBI. He
also has 20 RBI in his last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt this good in a while,'' said Hundley, whose 41
homers in 1996 set a major-league record for catchers. ``I go out
there and expect to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Knowing your Park: Chad Kreuter will catch right-hander Chan
Ho Park today. The two have quickly developed a strong rapport. The
results have been an ERA markedly less with Kreuter calling a game
instead of Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Park's ERA is 4.63 with Kreuter starting, as opposed to 7.31
with Hundley starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just how you deal with him,'' Kreuter said. ``Sometimes I
went out there and got mad at him. His first start in Montreal, I
yelled at him. He was letting it all slip away. I said, `If you
don't suck it up and get focused and get focused on me, you're out
of here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Other times I've told him that he had great stuff. The
situation dictates it. You have to be a little different.''

   __ Throwing problems: As talented as Dodgers third baseman
Adrian Beltre is offensively, what truly excites everyone about the
21-year-old is his ability to play defense just as well.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's been a rough six weeks for Beltre in the field.
The Dodgers attributed many of his 29 errors last season to
inexperience and figured this year would be better.
</P>
<P>
   But through 33 games, Beltre leads the National League with 10
errors and his .903 fielding percentage is third worst in the
league. And many of the errors have come either by errant throws or
bobbles after fielding the ball cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Beltre said. ``I was working at it
in spring training and it was getting better. It's one of those
things. I don't know. I'm trying to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Reliever Gregg Olson rejoined the team after
undergoing an MRI Thursday in Los Angeles and now has been
instructed not to pick up a ball or 10 to 14 days. The MRI was
negative, but it showed a muscle strain causing inflammation near
his right elbow. The right-hander, signed to a two-year, $3 million
free-agent deal in the offseason, hasn't pitched since April 8 in
New York. . . . Eric Karros extended his hitting streak to seven
games with a fifth-inning homer.

 A DAY WITH GORE IN L.A. _ BLUE-COLLAR DIGS TO GATED PALACES  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore woke up Thursday at dawn in the modest
home of an East Los Angeles-area principal. Within an hour, he was
greeting kids at the Elizabeth Learning Center in Cudahy, where the
mostly Latino students are so poor that their parents usually work
two jobs and make less than $6,000 a year. Every child qualifies
for a free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours later and a universe away, darkness was falling
as Gore's motorcade glided through the gated community of Bel Air,
past homes so expansive they could have housed entire classrooms of
kids.
</P>
<P>
   He was raising political money, lots of it. So much that the 50
well-heeled attendees, sitting by candlelight on the rose-covered
patio overlooking the jeweled city lights, could easily write a
check for $10,000 each to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math: Each check was more than enough to support an
average Latino family at that inner-city school for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential campaign provides plenty of contrasts, and the
vice president's agenda Thursday underscored that dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   At the Elizabeth Learning Center, Gore greeted the neatly
uniformed children when they arrived for school, and he was there
when they left. Besides putting big smiles on some cute faces, Gore
highlighted for the national press the successes of a school where,
despite enormous poverty and challenges, 95 percent of the kids go
on to college.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side is the evening fund-raisers at
multimillion-dollar homes grander than anything most Americans can
imagine. Lavish events such as the one Thursday night close out
many of the days in this campaign, on both the Republican and
Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bel Air estate, a gated palace, reporters were trooped in
poolside after dinner to record Gore's remarks to the guests, who
donated $500,000 to the DNC. (Until then, the usual drill calls for
parking the media in the garage, along with the Jags and the Secret
Service.)
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes are revealing about a candidate, but here there's a
contrast, too.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fund-raisers, Gore's campaign is far more open
than that of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. The Republican raised $4
million last week in two private homes, speaking to just 170
people. Do the math there.
</P>
<P>
   But, by Bush's own dictate, no reporter is allowed to see the
candidate in such exclusive settings, or to report on what he says
to those donors.
</P>
<P>
   They're off limits to the media.
</P>
<P>
   They say the press corps covering the political campaigns gets
jaded. How jaded? On the way out to California, Gore went to the
back of Air Force II to chat with reporters, who lately have been
complaining that he hasn't given press conferences. But the movie
``American Beauty'' was playing on the plane. And, hey, it won a
slew of Academy Awards, after all. Bottom line: Reporters, well,
just weren't interested. Gore returned to the front of the plane,
outpolled by Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest question Gore got on his trip came from a young,
hip reporter from Channel 1, a school cable operation, who didn't
pull any punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our audience, you're a pretty old guy,'' the kid started
out, diplomatically. ``You were a teen once yourself. ... Can you
tell any stories that show you are down with teens?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was expecting Gore to say he was the Mack Daddy of
politics, and that the economy is still Da Bomb. But it didn't go
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 17, and my youngest daughter is a senior in college.
Having been a parent to four children, I have remained pretty well
in touch with what I'm able to see going on,'' said the 52-year-old
Gore. ``This generation is absolutely terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Short answer for our teenage readers: ``No.''

FBI COMPUTER PROBLEM HALTS GUN SALES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Md)  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legal gun sales around the nation came to a halt
after a computer software malfunction at the FBI prevented instant
background checks of prospective buyers, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Thursday afternoon, gun store owners and the police
were unable to access the the FBI's Interstate Identification
Index, a database containing the criminal records of 36 million
people, said Steve Fischer, a spokesman for the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The problem involved a software malfunction at the bureau's
facility in Clarksburg, W.Va., and was not a result of computer
hacking, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said the current breakdown of the criminal records
database was the longest to date. Technicians believe that the
system cannot be repaired until Saturday evening at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The malfunction also knocked out the system by which law
enforcement officials around the country use fingerprints to access
criminal records, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun dealers in different parts of the country complained to the
FBI that it was costing them business, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're also calling their congressional offices across the
country, and we're hearing from them also,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal background check, which can take place within
seconds when the system is functioning properly, was mandated by
the 1993 Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   Named for President Ronald Reagan's former press secretary,
James Brady, the law bars felons, minors and those convicted of
domestic violence from buying guns.
</P>
<P>
   In November, President Clinton credited the Brady law with
blocking more than 470,000 gun sales to ``felons, fugitives,
stalkers and others prohibited from purchasing firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association vigorously opposed the law,
however, arguing that it would not stop criminals. The association
also denounced the law as onerous for law-abiding gun store
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of gun stores said they had failed to complete sales
Friday. Some said they continued to accept paperwork for gun
purchases, and would run the background checks when the database
was again accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly getting in the way of business,'' said Ronnie
Ball, the owner of Dawson's Small Arms of the World in Annandale,
Va. ``People are not happy about it, but if it's a legitimate
computer breakdown, what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gentleman Hunter in Bethesda, Md., the owner, Art Harris,
told The Associated Press, ``We haven't lost any deals yet, but
Saturday is our biggest day.''

 FOREST MANAGERS DEFEND `PRESCRIPTION' BURNS  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN and CHUCK SQUATRIGLIA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an accidental inferno raged in New Mexico and some
politicians demanded an end to controlled burns, forestry experts
maintained Friday that ``prescribed'' fires are the only way to
prevent more disastrous wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos blaze has destroyed 191 houses, including about
100 duplexes, and scorched 30,000 acres since May 4, ignited
controversy over the practice of setting small fires to prevent big
fires.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry experts argue that prescribed burns of the type that
spawned the New Mexico fire and another on the North Rim of the
Grand Canyon are vital to managing the nation's wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real alternative to prescription burning in the
intermountain West and the Sierra,'' said Jerry Franklin, a
professor of ecosystems studies at the University of Washington in
Seattle. ``When you don't use it, you increase the chance of
catastrophic ... fires significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Alamos may have an unfortunate effect on fire policy,'' he
said. ``But everything we do as a society involves some risk. There
are always probabilities of outcomes, and sometimes bad things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue there are other ways to thin the brush and scrub
that provide fuel for forest fires, and they want Uncle Sam to use
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's controlled burn policy is out of
control,'' said Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., who, like many
congressional critics of controlled burning, promotes logging as a
safer alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the controversy, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce
Babbitt and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman imposed a
30-day ban Friday on prescription burning in the western United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Though the moratorium can be construed as governmental
soul-searching, it is not expected to bring a significant policy
change.
</P>
<P>
   That's because prescription, or ``controlled,'' burning is
considered by forestry experts to be the only way to maintain the
health of America's woodlands. Decades of wildfire suppression,
they say, encouraged rampant growth and ultimately made the fires
that did occur far worse.
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradox that burning forests makes them stronger. Forest
managers view the practice as an environmentally sound way of
reducing fuels on forest floors and thinning thick stands of
second-growth trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, fire removes older vegetation, reducing surface
fuel accumulations and greatly reducing the chances of a crown
fire,'' a type of blaze that races through the tops of tress with
explosive force, said Michael Hilbruner, a U.S. Fire Service
ecologist.
</P>
<P>
   The fires also return nutrients to the soil, stimulate
biodiversity and help some tree species germinate, Hilbruner said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when prescription fires go wrong, they can go very wrong
indeed. Los Alamos isn't the only evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   A prescribed fire set April 25 to clear grass and brush from
1,500 acres from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon jumped its
borders Wednesday and has scorched 7,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, firefighters in Northern California lost control
of a prescription burn on U.S. Bureau of Land Management land near
the Trinity County hamlet of Lewiston; the fire blackened 2,000
acres and destroyed 23 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry experts said such accidents are no reason to end a
practice that is, by and large, beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the business who are very experienced never get
any credit,'' said John Fort, director of the National Interagency
Prescribed Fire Training Center in Tallahassee, Fla. ``They're
trying to do the right thing by the environment and the public, and
the weather gets them every now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Watson, the regional director for California and Nevada for
the Wilderness Society, said his organization remains bullish on
prescription burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Views on fire have changed radically over the years,'' he
said. ``We once saw it as destructive; now we see it as beneficial.
Fire has helped shape the landscapes of the West. Any problems we
now have with fire have grown out of our overly successful policies
of controlling it in the past, which allowed fuels to build up.''
</P>
<P>
   As valuable as prescription burning is, it is not always easy to
manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, you're playing with fire, and sometimes it gets out
of control,'' Watson said. ``A lot of the problems are
weather-related, and you can't control how or when the weather
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos blaze has induced some politicians to call for an
end to prescription burning. Instead, they say, logging should be
used to thin fire-prone stands of timber.
</P>
<P>
   But logging alone won't do it, said Wally Covington, director of
the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University
in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need both,'' burning and logging, he said. ``Under the
dense forest conditions we're now seeing in many areas, there's no
way you can burn without getting a crown fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to thin, rake the litter away from the old-growth
trees, burn the slash (dead trees and limbs on the ground), then
continue low-level prescription burning on a regular basis,'' he
said. ``And you have to do it in landscape-size units _ 200,000
acres or more instead of the the 1,000-acre units we're dealing
with now.''

A DANDY FOR DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Darren Dreifort found a way to give the Los Angeles
Dodgers' beleaguered bullpen a break. He gave them the night off.
</P>
<P>
   In his most commanding start of his career, Dreifort was staked
to a five-run lead before taking the mound and then overwhelmed the
most potent lineup in baseball, shutting out the St. Louis
Cardinals 13-0 on two hits Friday at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's third career shutout was the Dodgers' first complete
game of the season. It also ended a losing streak at four games,
and a losing streak on the road at seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's pounding that ball down and not overthrowing it, I
don't care what club is out there, they're going to have
problems,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson. ``He controlled the
game. We have some other guys on the staff that can do the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green had a three-run double and Todd Hundley hit his
ninth homer of the season to stake the Dodgers to a 5-0 lead. Green
finished with two doubles and four RBI and Todd Hollandsworth and
Alex Cora each had three hits. Eric Karros added his ninth homer of
the season in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, the early lead was more than enough for Dreifort,
who allowed a first-inning double to Eric Davis and a single to
Fernando Vina in the sixth. Dreifort (3-1) faced two batters over
the minimum, and faced the minimum of 24 batters over the final
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was outstanding and I had a great rhythm with
Hundley behind the plate,'' said Dreifort, who threw 110 pitches.
``We had (second baseman Mark Grudzielanek) in the right spot a
couple of times. Everybody was outstanding. You can't ask for
anything more than that of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Dreifort's first shutout since Aug. 18, 1999, when he
beat Florida 7-0. Kevin Brown threw the last two-hitter for the
Dodgers on Sept. 4, 1999, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``By far, it was his best outing of the year, obviously,''
Hundley said. ``But it was typical Dreifort. The first couple of
innings he was strong as a horse. Once he gets tired, then he has
control on his slider and changeup. It would be nice for him to go
down (to the bullpen) and throw for an hour before the game and
settle down. Once he gets tired, he settles down.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of his career, control's been a problem for
Dreifort. He has it mostly corrected, but now and again the
wildness will crop up. After the early lead, Dreifort experienced
those problems by walking Vina on four pitches. But the
right-hander's confidence was given a huge boost when Hundley threw
out Vina trying to steal. Vina was the second runner in 20 attempts
Hundley's caught.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed a two-out double to Davis, threw a wild pitch
and walked Mark McGwire before getting Jim Edmonds, the recipient
of a six-year, $57 million contract extension earlier in the day,
on a called third strike to get out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was as smooth an effort as Dreifort's had. He was
aided by double plays in the third, fifth and sixth innings, but
the Cardinals never threatened. No St. Louis runner made it past
first after the first inning, and Dreifort retired the last 10
batters he faced. He struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort's been throwing the ball well all year,'' Green said.
``It's nice to see him get that complete-game shutout. You don't
see that very much anymore. It's big for us, especially coming
after we lost four in a row.'' &QL;

SCHOOL INSPEC TIONS COMPANY ASSAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY ROBBIE SHERWOOD  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - The company in charge of a mammoth statewide school
inspection is financially troubled and dogged by lawsuits from
creditors, raising serious questions about its work.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is refusing to pay any more on the $2.6 million contract
until Ohio-based Flex-Tech Professional Services re-inspects 303
schools. Reports from those schools were wrong, inadequate or could
not be produced.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate inspections are vital. They will be used to determine
how much money it will cost to bring Arizona's dilapidated schools
up to minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance policy purchased by the state is helping Flex-Tech
pay its bills while it tries to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions were raised when Flex-Tech's bid was being
considered, but were overlooked in an effort to hurry the
already-behind-schedule project along, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Flex-Tech, it seemed, was telling the state what it wanted to
hear: that it could inspect every school in the Arizona in four
months, and for at least $3 million cheaper than any other bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a construction company, and when several bids
come in at one price and one comes in much, much lower, there's
something wrong with that bid,'' said Rep. Jean McGrath, who
questioned Flex-Tech's ability to pull off the job when the Joint
Legislative Budget Committee approved the contract in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that they are just incompetent,'' McGrath said. &QL; 
COMPANY TO STAY ON &QL; 
The School Facilities Board oversees Students First, the
court-mandated plan to pay for school construction. The Board has
no plans to fire Flex-Tech despite its repeated missed deadlines
and inability last week to produce the work listed in an $800,000
bill to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Flex-Tech CEO Cecil Weatherspoon met with Facilities Board
officials Thursday and agreed to re-inspect schools whose reports
were not properly done. Weatherspoon did not return calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flex-Tech assured us they will fully meet the requirements of
the contract,'' said Phil Geiger, executive director of the
Facilities Board. ``We've given them additional time to complete
that and established a plan to have (Weatherspoon) meet with us
weekly to update everything.''
</P>
<P>
   John Deere Insurance Co., which insured the $2.6 million
contract, is helping Flex-Tech pay its employees and will help keep
it afloat until the job is done, Geiger said. Weatherspoon had
initially resisted getting a bond, and nearly lost the contract in
January because he was a month late producing the insurance, public
records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the story here is we were pretty damn smart to get a
bond, or we'd be out $800,000,'' Geiger said. ``We took all the
appropriate precautions and then some.'' &QL; 
SHAKY FINANCES EARLY ON &QL; 
Before John Deere stepped in, Flex-Tech's fortunes appeared to be
shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Flex-Tech saleswoman Shiela Ingram said she was fired Tuesday
after asking about her paycheck, which was five days late.
</P>
<P>
   In her termination letter, Weatherspoon cited ``financial
difficulties the company is currently temporarily experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said everything was depending on the state of Arizona
because it didn't pay us on this $800,000 invoice,'' said Ingram,
28, who worked at Flex-Tech's Sandusky, Ohio, headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Flex-Tech is also being hounded by creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Comptrol Inc., an industrial-components distributor in Garfield
Heights, Ohio, sued Flex-Tech on March 10. An attorney for Comptrol
said Flex-Tech owes $91,988 for products it hasn't paid for.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Accutech Corp. of Fulton County, Ga., sued Flex-Tech
for $3,985 plus interest. W.W. Granger Inc. of Niles, Ill., won a
$5,423 judgment against Flex-Tech in February in its 2-year-old
suit, an award which Flex-Tech has yet to pay.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how Flex-Tech looked financially when it bid for
the schools contract in November. But at least one of the
creditors' lawsuits had been filed at the time. &QL; 
CREDIT REPORT STILL MYSTERY &QL; 
Flex-Tech came highly recommended by its six business references,
but the State Procurement Office won't release a credit report it
commissioned on Flex-Tech at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic requested the report under the federal
Freedom of Information Act. The state has refused to release it.
</P>
<P>
   The office did not even show the report to the JLBC staff _
simply reporting that the report was ``adequate'' _ according to an
internal memo in the Flex-Tech file.
</P>
<P>
   Facilities Board head Geiger did see the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember any lawsuits, but they were showing debt,''
Geiger said. ``There were comments about late payments to some
vendors but nothing that would rise to the level that would
preclude them from being a successful bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Another employee fired last week has little faith in Flex-Tech's
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Greer, a construction estimator who worked for Flex-Tech
in Phoenix from March until Wednesday, said the estimates to fix
many of the schools are inaccurate and based on speculation. He
said he was fired because he would not deliver estimates for what
he said were subpar inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional estimator and I couldn't ethically do what
they wanted me to do,'' Greer said. ``The assessors did such a
rotten job . . . I refused to put down bad numbers.'' &QL; 
OTHER RE-INSPECTION WOES &QL; 
Greer said the re-inspections ordered by the School Facilities
Board will be a tall order since many of the assessors were
retirees who have left for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger said he was aware of Greer's complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does not appear to be anything at this time that rises
to the point of impropriety or illegality,'' Geiger said. ``We know
there was vague and inadequate information in the reports. That's
why we're having Flex-Tech redo the estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   A random look at some of Flex-Tech's inspections reveals
problems even in assessments the Facilities Board considers
reasonably well done. Assessors must look into any problem
identified by the school as well as any problems they find.
</P>
<P>
   In some reports, serious problems identified by school officials
were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Cactus High in Phoenix listed problems with pooling rainwater
that has flooded buildings and ruined electrical circuits, as well
as malfunctioning bathrooms. The school's assessment does not say
if the problems are worthy of repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was dropped on this one,'' said Bob Reiss, a
technical advisor for the Facilities Board, referring to the Cactus
inspection. ``The school's concerns were ignored, so we're going to
have to send Flex-Tech back.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, Flex-Tech appeared to be headed for trouble from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Inspecting every school in the state and estimating a cost for
repairs would require a large workforce, plus expertise in
engineering, construction and architecture. Flex-Tech had little of
any. &QL; 
QUESTIONS RAISED AT START &QL; 
JLBC staff members questioned the use of Flex-Tech when the
contract came before the Legislature in December. But they
ultimately recommended approval because the state was months behind
schedule and the Legislature had set aside only $2 million to get
the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned about the size of the company and that they
didn't have substantial experience in this type of work,'' said
Richard Stavneak, JLBC staff director. ``What people are forgetting
is that, at the time, there was substantial pressure to begin the
process. Our only other alternative would have been to go back to
the Legislature to approve more money. This result is not
surprising, but we were hoping for better.''
</P>
<P>
   A bidder on the contract, Terracon of Tempe, contends that
Flex-Tech was able to low-ball its bid because it used
subcontractors almost exclusively to do the work. Jim Craven, the
firm's local manager, said he planned to use his people but did not
know until after the bid was awarded that he could have
subcontracted the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got outfoxed,'' he said. ``Flex-Tech is an employment
contractor and they hire as they go. They have no people . . .
working for them. It's not illegal, but we could have done that if
we thought those were the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven said his company, which bid $6 million to do the
inspections, is interested in finishing the job if Flex-Tech
defaults. &QL;

CRAIG STEVENS, THE SUAVE STAR OF `PETER GUNN,' DIES AT 81 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Kan., Calif., N.Y.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig Stevens, who created the title role of the suave but tough
private eye in ``Peter Gunn,'' a popular television series in the
late 1950s and early '60s, died Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was
81.
</P>
<P>
   When not chasing down evildoers and dazzling the women who
crossed his path, Craig's Peter Gunn spent his time at a jazz club
where his girlfriend, Edie (Lola Albright), worked as a singer.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz, including the show's theme song, which became a hit on
its own, was written by Henry Mancini and was also the basis of two
best-selling RCA recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn's friend and ally on the police force was Lt. Jacoby,
played by Herschel Bernardi, who often lent a helping hand when
Gunn bent the rules. The series ran on NBC from September 1958 to
September 1960 and then moved to ABC, where it ran for another
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' name was originally Gail Shikles Jr. He was born in
Liberty, Mo., and studied dentistry at the University of Kansas
before deciding he wanted to be an actor. He moved to California
and worked at the Pasadena Playhouse before signing a contract with
Warner Brothers in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he met his future wife, the actress Alexis
Smith. After serving in the Air Force during World War II, he went
on to make a score of movies before television came along. His film
credits include ``The Doughgirls,'' ``God Is My Co-Pilot,''
``Humoresque'' and ``Where the Sidewalk Ends.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, with ``Peter Gunn'' behind him, Stevens made his
Broadway debut opposite Janis Paige in ``Here's Love,'' a musical
by Meredith Willson based on the film ``Miracle on 34th Street.''
He returned to television the next year, appearing on CBS in the
short-lived series ``Mr. Broadway,'' in which he played a zealous
publicity agent.
</P>
<P>
   In later years he made guest appearances on shows like
``Dallas'' and ``Man of the World.'' He also appeared in the Blake
Edwards movie ``S.O.B.'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Smith died in 1993. The couple had no children.

JOHN W. CHRISTIAN JR., FORMER HEAD OF B. ALTMAN, DIES AT 74 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., N.Y., N.C., Ohio)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John W. Christian Jr., a former president of B. Altman &AMP; Co.,
died Sunday at his home in Richmond, Va. He was 74. The cause was a
heart aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Durham, N.C., Christian graduated from Duke University
in 1948 with a degree in business. He then began his retailing
career at Thalhimer's, a department store chain based in Richmond.
In 1960, he became senior vice president and general manager of
Thalhimer's.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Akron, Ohio, in 1969 to become president of the M.
O'Neil department store chain, where he remained until joining B.
Altman's in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very interested in upgrading our designer presence,''
said Lewis Kaufman, who worked with Christian as the general
merchandise manager, and succeeded him as president in 1982.
Kaufman added that the store was one of the first in America to
have a Versace boutique.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Christian became chairman and chief executive of La
Vogue Inc., a chain of women's specialty clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Christian is survived by his wife of 51 years, Pauline; a son,
John W. III &UR; , &LR;  of Richmond; a daughter, Anne C. Collins of St.
Louis; a sister, Mary Ann C. Rogers of Durham; and four
grandchildren.

GLOVES COME OFF IN N.J. GOP SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate
barely uttered an unneighborly word about one another in their
debate Monday. But with 24 days left until the June 6 primary, the
knives have come out.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. William L. Gormley, who has raised more money than
his three rivals but had spent little until this week, has begun a
direct-mail campaign assailing the record and character of United
States Representative Robert D. Franks. The other candidates are
James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, and Murray Sabrin,
a former candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In two full-color advertisements, Gormley portrays himself as a
tax-cutting conservative and Franks as an untrustworthy,
big-spending tax raiser in fiscal conservative's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The two ads seem lifted out of the pages of a supermarket
tabloid. In one, Franks is rendered as some sort of two-headed
alien. ``Doubly Dishonest,'' screams a headline.
</P>
<P>
   In another, a trim Gormley, shown head to toe, grins broadly
next to a headline proclaiming his support for ``37 tax cuts.'' It
brings to mind the kind of ad that might proclaim ``I lost 37
pounds!'' Among Gormley's specific claims about Franks are that the
congressman ``flip-flopped on impeachment,'' by first voting in the
House to impeach President Clinton and then signing a letter urging
the Senate to approve a deal to censure the president instead.
</P>
<P>
   In faxes to supporters and reporters, the Franks campaign is
responding by accusing Gormley of ``deceitful distortions and
lies.'' For example, Gormley also claims Franks ``missed 2,600
votes'' as a state assemblyman from 1980 to 1992, ``but showed up
to vote himself two pay raises.'' But Gormley voted for the same
pay raises, said Charlie Smith, Franks' campaign manager. ``I find
it inherently deceitful that someone would use against an opponent
issues that they held the same position on,'' Smith said. He added
that calling Franks cowardly and untrustworthy was ``over the line,
beyond the pale of debate that should be happening in a Republican
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   David J. Murray, a consultant for Gormley who specializes in
direct mail, defended the two mailings, saying, in effect, that
Franks had started the attacks. He referred to mailings that the
Franks campaign had sent to Bergen County Republicans weeks ago. In
those mailings, Franks was described as a ``real Republican,'' and
Gormley as a ``Florio Republican,'' insinuating that Gormley had
been cozy with Jim Florio, a Democrat, while Florio was governor in
the early 1990s. Florio is seeking the Democratic senatorial
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Murray also said that it was fair to fault Franks for raising
the national debt as a congressman, though Franks notes that he
later voted to reduce the debt by $1 trillion over five years.
``That's such hypocrisy, to say it's what I did last that
matters,'' Murray said. ``You don't get to determine the statute of
limitation on things.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Republican debate will be May 22, and Smith hinted that
it might be less congenial than Monday's initial encounter. ``I
imagine there will be an effort by all the candidates to draw
starker contrasts and engage their opponents in direct
comparisons,'' he said.

<P>
   Robert C. Bassett, a former lawyer, labor negotiator and
publisher who represented small-business interests on the councils
of two presidential administrations, died on May 2 in Las Vegas,
where he lived. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett was born in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., on March 2, 1911. He
graduated from the University of Wisconsin, earned a law degree
from Harvard and was a founding partner of the law firm of Minahan
&AMP; Bassett in Green Bay, Wis.
</P>
<P>

1954, he became publisher of The Milwaukee Sentinel. Nine years
later, he founded the Bassett Publishing Co., which produced
Chicagoland magazine and programs for the Chicago Bulls, the
Chicago Symphony and the Big 10 football conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett served on the Wage Stabilization Board in the Truman
administration and represented small-business interests on the Pay
Board of the Nixon administration. His third wife, the former Mary
Holmes, died two years ago after 51 years of marriage. He is
survived by three daughters, Jane Quinn of Orlando, Fla., Pamela
Welter of Las Vegas and Karen Freeman of Westport, Conn.; seven
grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.

JOHN P. ROBIN, 87; LED REDEVELOPMENT OF DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By ERIC V. COPAGE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John P. Robin, who played an influential role in the
transformation of Pittsburgh from a smoggy, grimy city into one of
gleaming skyscrapers and grassy promenades, died on Sunday at his
daughter's house in Pittsburgh. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Robin was the first executive director of the Urban
Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, which in the late 1940s and
1950s rebuilt much of Pittsburgh's downtown, a project called
Renaissance I. Robin returned to the agency in the late 1970s, to
lead another surge of construction and rejuvenation, Renaissance
II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have saved this city from becoming a Camden or a Gary,''
Robin said in a 1980 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robin was active in public life for 50 years, he never
held an elected office.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, Pittsburgh was known as the Smoky City
because of pollution from the steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, civic leaders feared that the city would be in
trouble if it did not reinvent itself,'' said David R. Grinnell, an
archivist at the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Gariti, general counsel with the redevelopment authority,
who worked closely with Robin on Renaissance II, said Robin ``had
the ability to work with politicians, civic leaders and corporate
leaders to get a consensus'' for the complex project.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Robin was born in Pittsburgh on Oct. 15, 1912.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Ansley J. Robin, said that at the age of 11 her
father decided his name was not grand enough and renamed himself
John P. Robin. When he was an adult, however, friends and close
associates called him Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Robin majored in zoology at the University of Pittsburgh but
dropped out to take a job as a reporter for The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. He was hired as a secretary for Cornelius Scully,
mayor of Pittsburgh, in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army in World War II, Robin became an
assistant to another Pittsburgh mayor, David L. Lawrence, who with
the philanthropist Richard King Mellon led Renaissance I.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Robin was appointed the first executive director of the
Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, the redevelopment arm
of the city; he worked there until 1954. In that time, Point State
Park and an office complex called Gateway Center were created where
dilapidated warehouses had stood.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the agency, Robin wore a variety of executive
hats: state secretary of commerce, the first executive officer of
the Regional Industrial Development Corp. and executive president
of the Old Philadelphia Development Corp. He was also an executive
with the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 he returned to the redevelopment authority as chairman,
a post he held simultaneously with that of chairman of the
Pittsburgh Port Authority. In his 17 years at the redevelopment
authority, Robin had an important role in creating the city rail
transit system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, Robin is survivd by a son, Peter
G., of Merion, Pa.

DEMS TO FILE FLAKE COMPLAINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - The state Democratic Party announced Friday, May 12,
that it will file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission
accusing GOP congressional candidate Jeff Flake of violating
campaign-finance law.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came in response to a story in The Arizona
Republic on Friday, May 12, detailing Flake's $72,000 consulting
fee from the tax-exempt Arizona School Choice Trust, which was made
possible by a tax-deductible, $50,000 donation from Flake's
campaign-finance chairman, Valley developer Ira Fulton.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon press conference that was interrupted by a
surprise appearance by Flake, Democratic Party officials described
the arrangement as money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what appears to be a well thought-out plan to take
money from an individual, run it through a tax-exempt organization
. . . and into the pockets of a candidate,'' said Marty Harper,
general counsel to the Arizona Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said they will also lodge a complaint with the
Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Charities are prevented under tax law from directly or
indirectly benefiting federal candidates and from providing
``sweetheart'' consulting fees to contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats made it clear that they believe Flake's biggest
mistake was tapping Fulton for the consulting fee. Fulton has a
long friendship with Flake and a penchant for charitable giving.
But he also has already contributed the legal limit to Flake's
campaign war chest and sits on the candidate's campaign
fund-raising committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we would be having this press conference if he
hadn't raised the money from his finance people,'' said Mark
Fleisher, state Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Flake squarely addressed questions from reporters about his
consulting arrangement, but sought to dismiss the matter as a flame
ignited by the news media and fanned by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it was silly of me to think the press would not be
cynical,'' Flake said. ``But the idea that we are trying to skirt
the law is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake said he has been working about 30 hours a week for the
trust, trying to network with large corporations to help establish
a new payroll-deduction program that could bring new contributions
into the trust.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Democrats of using his consulting fee as a
battering ram against school choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, and the reasons the Democrats are here today . .
. is because they are very much opposed to poor children being able
to go to the school of their choice,'' Flake said.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Democrats of making political hay over his job
rather than putting up a strong candidate to face the eventual
Republican contender in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats don't need an investigation, they need a
candidate,'' Flake said. ``It's as plain as day.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the board defended Flake's intentions, but said
the candidate erred in failing to be sensitive to appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Flake made a mistake in not anticipating that people
would perceive something wrong with the money for the payroll
deduction effort coming from an individual involved in the
campaign,'' said Jay Heiler, a board member of the School Choice
Trust. ``When you are running for office, you must pay attention to
appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Flake's opponents were less inclined than Flake to blame
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Liddy, a Republican contender for the 1st Congressional
District who took a leave of absence from his law firm to run for
the office, said that, ``at a minimum, there is a perception
problem (with Flake's consulting fee).''
</P>
<P>
   ``If my advisers had come to me with this idea, I would have
said, `No way,' '' Liddy said. ``It just doesn't pass the smell
test.'' &QL;

POLICE SAY ANGERED MOM LEFT CHILD, 8, AT MUSEUM FOR 6 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An 8-year-old Queens girl was abandoned by her mother
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Thursday and was found
wandering disoriented among the antiquities in the Egyptian wing,
police said Friday. The girl's mother was arrested when she
returned to pick her up six hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The child, Latisha Isaac, caught the attention of a guard
Thursday afternoon because she was alone and appeared anxious, a
museum spokesman, Harold Holzer, said Friday. The guard, Gregory
Monaco, asked the girl if she was alone, Holzer said, adding, ``She
said she was looking for her mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Paula Isaac, 40, of South Jamaica, Queens, had left
her daughter about 12:30 p.m., after the girl had gone to the
bathroom, according to a police report. ``Mrs. Isaac states she
left her child at the museum because she was mad at her for wanting
to go to the bathroom,'' the report said. Isaac wandered Manhattan
on foot for hours before returning to the museum about 6 p.m.,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Tall for her age and slim, Latisha appeared anxious but grew
more comfortable as guards walked her through the museum, trying to
find her mother, Holzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had been searching on her own for about an hour. ``She
spent the whole time looking for her mother,'' a police official
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the guards could not find the mother, they called the
police at the Central Park Precinct, Holzer said. Before the police
arrived, the girl spent her time with museum staff members, at one
point sitting with volunteers in the circular information booth in
the museum's cavernous lobby, where she drew pictures with crayons.
</P>
<P>
   Latisha seemed calm and relaxed once she was with museum staff
members, Holzer said. ``She was very articulate, very poised,'' he
said. After 45 minutes at the information desk, he said, she
announced that she was hungry and was taken to the museum staff's
cafeteria, where she had a bologna sandwich, a taco and some fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the museum staff could call her father, the girl said,
``He's not here,'' adding of her mother, ``She's a single mom,''
Holzer said. Isaac later told the police and prosecutors that her
husband died of cancer about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were drawing up a criminal complaint last night
charging Isaac with endangering the welfare of a child, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   When Isaac returned to the Metropolitan about 6 p.m., she asked
the guards at the front door whether a lost child was inside,
Holzer said. The guards referred her to the Central Park Precinct,
where she was questioned by detectives and arrested. Her daughter,
whom police had taken to Lenox Hill Hospital for a medical
evaluation, was pronounced in good health and placed in the care of
the city's Administration of Children's Services.

GUS FLEMING, A LINCOLN CENTER DIRECTOR, DIES AT 56 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Gus Fleming, the director of concert halls at Lincoln Center
since 1988, and before that the company manager of the Lincoln
Center Out-of-Doors Festival and a line producer of the JVC Jazz
Festival, died May 6 at his home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen McMahon, a spokeswoman for Lincoln Center, said the cause
was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As director of concert halls, Fleming oversaw the day-to-day
operation of Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall and was
involved in everything from the installation of new production
technology to marketing and box office systems.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, whose full name was John Payne Fleming, was born in
Chicago in July 1943. Both of his parents, John A. Fleming and
Helen Payne Fleming, were physicians, and his father was also an
alternate to Jesse Owens at the 1939 Olympics. He received a
bachelor's degree in history from the University of Rochester and a
master of fine arts from New York University.
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn to the arts first as an actor and performed in
several Broadway and Off &UR; - &LR; Broadway productions, including ``No
Place to Be Somebody,'' ``Jimmy Shine'' and ``Operation
Sidewinder.'' He also had roles in several films, including
``Serpico.'' From 1977 to 1983 Fleming was an adjunct professor of
speech and theater at John Jay College in Manhattan. During his
years at the college, he developed a program that took theater to
the inmates at Rikers Island. He also produced an off-Broadway
play, Dennis McIntyre's ``Split Second.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was also involved in several musical projects. As a
performer, he played bass and sang in the Wickers Creek Bluegrass
Band. And he was a producer of the Grande Parade du Jazz in Nice,
France.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Lincoln Center as the company manager for its free &UR;  &LR; 
multidisciplinary Out-of-Doors Festival. Among the events he
produced were a Folk Heritage Day and a Blues and Gospel Day. In
1984, he and Coleman Barkin started the Roots of American Music
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Kimberlee Kimes; three sons, John
Nicholas, Joshua and Samuel; a daughter, Helene Elizabeth; a
stepmother, Clara Fleming of Chicago; and a sister, Dorothy
Ohlendorf of Gales Ferry, Conn.

ANNALEE NEWMAN, MUSE AND SUPPORT FOR THE ARTIST, DIES AT 91 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Mass., N.Y.)   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annalee Newman, who spent 34 years as the wife and another 30 as
the widow of Barnett Newman, the Abstract Expressionist painter,
died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artist's wife'' is not a category widely used by art
historians, but Newman was among the great ones of 20th-century
American art, bringing an unusual combination of fierce loyalty and
independence to her calling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many American artists' wives, including Elaine de
Kooning, Lee Krasner, Sally Avery, Marguerite Zorach, Helen Torr
(wife of Arthur Dove) and Dorothy Dehner (wife of David Smith),
Newman had no artistic ambitions of her own, but she didn't exactly
shrink into the shadows, either. Instead, she provided her husband
with essential financial and moral support to a degree that makes
it difficult to imagine his accomplishment without her.
</P>
<P>
   Annalee Greenhouse was born in Jaffa, Palestine, in 1909. Her
parents were from Russia and on their way to the United States,
which they reached when Annalee was 9 months old. The family
settled in Akron, Ohio, and moved to Forest Hills in Queens when
she was a teen-ager. She attended Hunter College, where she majored
in French and studied to be a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   It was as a teacher, at a teachers' meeting in 1934, that she
met the erudite, loquacious Newman, who was four years her senior
and was working as a substitute art teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog to the retrospective of Newman's work at the
Museum of Modern Art in 1971, Thomas B. Hess described how the
artist got into a ``heated argument with a beautiful girl who was
defending Wagner's opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Newman was demolishing her case (he often used to prove a
point by singing an entire scene from Mozart, taking all the
voices), she ran out of the room and slammed the door,'' he
continued. ``Newman was very impressed. He found out her name,
Annalee Greenhouse, and he courted her with concerts, dancing and
poems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were married on June 30, 1936, and went on a trip to
Concord where they spent a week visiting Walden Pond, the Bridge,
Emerson's and Hawthorne's houses and Bronson Alcott's academy _ the
shrines of American culture and revolutionary thought. Their love
became the center of their lives; they were always together.''
</P>
<P>
   They made an urbane, voluble couple, living in apartments on the
Upper West Side or briefly in Brooklyn, rather than in lofts,
although Newman always had studios in lower Manhattan. Newman's
unshakable faith in her husband's talent saw him through periods of
low productivity and despair (in the early 1940s) and critical
isolation (like the 1950s), when many people in the art world,
including some prominent Abstract Expressionists, were put off by
the stringency of his abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   After Newman had an artistic breakthrough in 1948, the couple
decided that he should devote all his energy to his art. They lived
almost entirely off Newman's teaching salary until the late 1950s,
when Newman's paintings began to sell consistently. Low points
included visits to a pawnbroker and Newman's attempt to find work
as a tailor's fitter, which lasted until his wife canceled his
appointment for an interview. Throughout, she maintained a detailed
archive of his work that ultimately grew to 40 file cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who leaves no immediate survivors, retired from teaching
in 1964. After her husband's death in 1970 she moved to an
apartment in River House on East 51st Street. Until she suffered
severe smoke inhalation during a fire in her building several years
ago, she regularly attended parties and openings and was an avid
opera fan, often traveling through Europe and the United States to
attend rare performances. In the early 1980s she established the
Barnett Newman Foundation, which holds his archive and library, has
published several catalogs on aspects of his work and planned a
catalog raisonne, by the art historian Yves-Alain Bois, for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Newman devoted the bulk of her energy to placing her
husband's paintings in public and private collections in the United
States and Europe, an activity she likened to ``marrying our
children well.''

HOMER THOMPSON, 93, ARCHAEOLOGIST NOTED FOR ATHENS EXCAVATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Canada, Mich.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Homer A. Thompson, an archaeologist who for decades led the
sweeping and painstaking excavation of the Agora, the civic center
of ancient Athens, died May 7 at his home in Hightstown, N.J. He
was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson brought high intelligence, keen intuition and boundless
energy to reconstructing the life of a long-lost civilization by
examining evidence as slight as minute disturbances in piles of
tiny rocks. When the work began in 1931, no one was certain even of
where the Agora was. (The name is sometimes translated as market
but more closely means ``the coming together place.'')
</P>
<P>
   With the discovery of hundreds, then thousands and finally tens
of thousands of artifacts, the picture came into sharper and
sharper focus. But no evidence, no matter how extensive, is useful
without shrewd and informed interpretation, the kind Thompson
provided.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1962 he solved the puzzle of why a buried temple
had a foundation hundreds of years newer than the structure it
supported. The answer was that the Romans, who admired classical
Greek architecture, meticulously rebuilt the temple, an
accomplishment often called the first example of historic
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard H. Howland, an archaeologist who retired from the
Smithsonian Institution 15 years ago and who worked for years on
the Athens dig with Thompson, called him ``the outstanding
classical archaeologist of his generation, perhaps of two
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also displayed modesty, patience and a certain shyness
as he passed encouragement and knowledge to new generations of
archaeologists, his colleagues and former students said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told you, he didn't talk at you,'' said Doreen Canaday
Spitzer, an archaeologist who studied with Thompson when the Agora
dig began. ``There was a great human quality to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He met his future wife, Dorothy Burr, in Athens when she was the
first woman to be appointed a fellow of the Athenian Agora
excavations. They married two years later, and she became an
authority on Greek terra cotta and used her research on ancient
gardens to replant the Agora.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Armstrong Thompson was born on Sept. 7, 1906, in Devlin,
Ontario, and grew up in a farming community about 90 miles north of
Vancouver. ``Both my mother and father were sympathetic to the
classics and urged me gently in that direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He received undergraduate and master's degrees from the
University of British Columbia, majoring in the classics. He earned
his doctorate from the University of Michigan, where a faculty
member, Benjamin Dean Merritt, introduced him to the project that
would occupy him for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The American School of Classical Studies at Athens was about to
excavate the center of Athens, and Thompson was one of the first
two fellows selected to participate. For the 39 years that began on
May 25, 1931, he would be either acting deputy or field director of
the excavations.
</P>
<P>
   Though Greek and German teams had done some previous
archaeological work in the Agora, its location was only vaguely
known. ``The difficulties were appalling,'' Thompson said. More
than 400 modern houses had to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work on the Agora, Dr. Thompson explored the
Pnyx, where the assembly of Athenians met. He participated in the
digs mainly in the summer. The rest of the year, he was a professor
of classical archaeology at the University of Toronto and curator
of the Royal Ontario Museum's classical collection.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, when the Agora work was interrupted,
Thompson was an intelligence officer in the Royal Canadian Navy.
Mrs. Thompson taught his classes at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, he was appointed professor of classical archaeology at
the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where he spent
the rest of his scholarly life. He was named director of the Agora
excavations the same year. In 1949, with the end of Greece's civil
war, he returned to Athens to reopen the excavations.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous research allowed him to pinpoint the location of
major monuments, which were quickly uncovered. As thousands of
relics accumulated, it became clear that the old storage and study
areas were inadequate. There was also no museum space to display
the finds to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson decided to do an exact reconstruction of one of the
ancient buildings in the Agora. Through the use of ancient building
materials and a full floor plan that had been unearthed, a
two-story-tall stoa, a form of ancient Greek public building, was
erected. Financed by the Rockefeller family, the Ford Foundation
and others, the stoa, which now houses a museum, was the first step
in a continuing plan to make the exposed remains of the ancient
city into an archaeological park planted with the species used in
antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson oversaw the development of two series of publications
on the Agora, one aimed at a scholarly audience and the other for
the public but written by scholars. He wrote the definitive
analysis of Greek pottery from the end of the fourth century B.C.
to the end of the second century B.C. This was the period of the
red-figure style, used on the most famous of ancient potteries.
</P>
<P>
   His own books were often applauded by critics. Writing in the
American Journal of Archaeology in 1941, Oscar Broneer wrote that
Thompson's 1940 book ``The Tholos of Athens and its Predecessors''
exhibited ``the author's methodical observation and careful
recording of all the evidence bearing on the subject; and, on the
other, his ingenuity and the soundness of his judgment in the
interpretation of existing remains.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Thompson is survived by three
daughters, Hope T. Kerr of Cedar Grove, N.J., Hilary T. Kenyon of
West Hartford, Conn., and Pamela Sinkler-Todd of Philadelphia;
eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His work in Athens continues, as excavations are being done and
more are planned on the northern part of the site. Howland said
that archaeology had entered its ``post-Thompson era.''

HEARD THE ONE ABOUT NEWARK TURNING HIP? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK _ On a recent Thursday evening, at the grand opening of
Maize restaurant, a crowd of men in five-button suits and young
women wearing Prada and DKNY mingled over passed hors d'oeuvres of
tuna tartare, sipping glasses of Gray Goose vodka. As a jazz singer
in a spaghetti-strap dress sang ``La Vie en Rose,'' flashbulbs
captured the smiles of young artists and musicians, next to the
beaming mayor, two former governors and the ageless baseball icon
Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   It may have looked like the opening of the latest bistro on Park
Avenue South or Spring Street, but what made the gathering notable
was that it wasn't in Manhattan at all; it was in downtown Newark,
a city not much known for chichi restaurants and the clientele to
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this incredible energy of young artists and writers
and musicians coming here, drawn to the realness of the city,''
said Verushka Spirito, a young woman with a Sinead O'Connor
haircut, who stood at the bar with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of Maize, located at 50 Park Place, inside the
historic Robert Treat Hotel, was certainly a big event by Newark
standards; it is easily the most fashionable restaurant the city
has seen in years, with a sleek, airy dining room, cigar lounge and
tearoom, and an executive chef, Pat Kotsonis, whose resume includes
Le Bernardin and Bouley.
</P>
<P>
   It's another indication that a city long moribund, an easy
target of late-night monologuists (``First prize is one week in
Newark; second prize is two weeks in Newark'') is reawakening.
Besides an economic resurgence and ambitious real estate
developments, Newark is seeing a much less publicized flowering of
artists, writers and musicians _ honest-to-goodness bohemians. Hard
to believe, but it may be transforming itself into a cool city.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, Queen Latifah _ the rapper, actress, talk
show host and Newark native _ gave a record-release party for her
Flavor Unit Entertainment stable of hip-hop artists at Groove, a
local nightclub. She is negotiating to develop the Griffith
Building on Broad Street into luxury apartments, a restaurant and a
nightclub. Shaquille O'Neal, the National Basketball Association's
most valuable player, sneaks back to his native Newark from Los
Angeles for soul food at Je's Restaurant on Halsey Street, and he
is also looking to invest in the city, said Mayor Sharpe James.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have swirled that Robert De Niro is taking over a
waterfront restaurant, though De Niro's partner in the TriBeCa
Grill in Manhattan, Drew Nieporent, said he was unaware of any such
plans. Well then, maybe James Gandolfini should think of buying
into a riverfront bistro; after all, his Tony Soprano _ inarguably
the coolest character on television today _ came by his childhood
neuroses in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the Jersey chic of ``The Sopranos,'' however, that is
luring artistically inclined young people to inner Newark. Nor is
it the recent building boom that includes a new baseball park where
the minor-league Newark Bears play and a downtown arena that will
be home to the New Jersey Nets and the Devils by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, young transplants cite the reasonable rents and
15-minute trip to Manhattan by New Jersey Transit train; the
vibrant mix of Portuguese, Spanish and Brazilian restaurants and
bars in the Ironbound section, and a grass-roots fine arts and
music scene, which even draws New Yorkers on a reverse night-time
commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of friends that come out from Brooklyn and
Manhattan for Sounds of the City,'' said Elisabeth Ssenjovu, a
programmer of events at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, of
the free outdoor series she oversees. It begins June 1 and features
spoken word, rap, reggae, Latin jazz, Dominican and Haitian music.
``It's Sounds of the City, not sounds of the suburbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence P. Goldman, the president of the three-year-old
performing arts center, which normally books top national artists
like the Mark Morris Dance Group, pointed out that the home-grown
outdoor series has played an interesting role in the city's social
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge young middle-class now in Newark _ white,
African-American and Hispanic _ for which there had previously been
no civic gathering place,'' he said. ``Basically, what Newark
really needed was a good singles scene. That's what Sounds of the
City provides, and it doesn't require police or security guards,
all it requires is young people willing to meet each other and have
a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are skeptics. Many Manhattanites, familiar with
the stigma of crime and urban decay that has long hung over this,
New Jersey's largest city and still one of the poorest in the
state, refuse to believe there's a new Newark. ``Get out of here,''
said Chris Hulbert, a publicist, who has represented trendy New
York clubs like Hush and Ohm. ``There's no way Newark is cool.''
</P>
<P>
   But to spend an afternoon and evening with Ssenjovu and some of
her friends is to get an unmistakable taste of the East Village on
the Passaic River. There is a thriving literary movement, ranging
from the online Newark Review to a spoken-word series whose host is
Ras Baraka _ a son of Amiri Baraka, the former LeRoi Jones _ at the
Lama Lounge on Linden Street.
</P>
<P>
   There's the smoky, couch-filled Euphoria Cafe _ located in the
shadow of the Prudential Insurance Co.'s global headquarters at
Broad and Academy Streets _ that draws a dreadlocked collegiate
crowd (and even some of the suits from Prudential) to poetry slams.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Ssenjovu, 24, tall, lean and wildly energetic,
seems to embody the hip side of Newark. ``I grew up in the Jersey
suburbs, in Union County,'' she said. ``My family's originally from
the Ironbound. They're Italians who moved out to the suburbs, and I
guess I've come full circle now.'' She lives with her husband,
Patrick, a Ugandan-born actor and performer, in a renovated
chocolate factory in the Ironbound, which got its name from the
rail lines that encircle it.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Voulgaris, the owner of Maize, who was born and raised
in Kalamata, Greece, said she has waited years for the city's
long-trumpeted renaissance to finally take hold. ``I got excited
about three years ago in all the activities upcoming in Newark, and
I decided that's where I wanted to invest in and to stay,'' she
said. When the arts center opened, ``there was no doubt in my mind
that it was no longer just a dream _ it was a reality,'' she
continued. ``I'd say that the difference I've seen in three years
is breathtaking. There are streets where nobody ever wanted to be
around 6 p.m., and now people freely walk around at 10 or 11
o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, Harper's magazine called Newark, which never
fully recovered from the rioting of the 1960's, the ``worst city in
America.'' Its vast tracts of housing projects inspired the
nickname Brick City. Nowadays, violent crime is down more than 50
percent from 1995, and real estate values in the immigrant-heavy
Ironbound have risen 30 to 40 percent since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As they toured the streets of the working-class Ironbound,
Ssenjovue and her posse of friends, including Fernando Baptista,
born in Portugal, and Khabirah Myers, a native of Newark, jokingly
acknowledged that they have the look of a walking Benetton ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's just my generation, or my group of
friends, but everybody seems to be in an interracial
relationship,'' Ssenjovu said. ``My husband and I feel very
comfortable here, he being African, me being white. I've traveled a
lot, but this is the first place I feel is home. I lived in Berlin,
I lived in London. I certainly don't feel at home in the suburbs,
but it's weird, I really feel at home in Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori Barcliff, a young African-American who also works at the
performing arts center, said, ``My family came to Newark in the
'30s; my grandparents lived in the West Ward, near South Orange
Avenue.'' After attending college in California and living in
Florida, she returned to New Jersey to live in the Ironbound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the cafe culture that's on Ferry Street,'' she said.
``You go to the grocery store, the bakery, the Portuguese fish
market, and you can basically do all your shopping on Ferry Street
and not have to get in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about recent high-profile investment in the city,
including the 11-acre sports arena site that also calls for bars,
shops and restaurants, Ssenjovu said with mock horror: ``Just
please don't say we're the new Hoboken! That's my biggest fear in
the world.'' She sees Hoboken as a case of gentrification run amok.
``Newark's still got an urban flavor that I don't think will be
changed by that, it's still really edgy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spirito agreed. ``You don't want people moving in and all these
yuppie bars erupting and suddenly you're losing the Brazilian
flavor and the Portuguese flavor,'' she said. ``You'll lose the
Haitian community and the Cuban community. That's what makes
Newark, and we have to make sure it stays.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Newark has been known as a hip-hop and rhythm and
blues hotbed, spawning such artists as Redman, Canibus, Faith
Evans, Rah Digga and Lauryn Hill, whose remembrances of her
childhood there are captured in her song ``Every Ghetto, Every
City.'' (``Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've
been/Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem.'')
</P>
<P>
   At his desk in the Beaux-Arts City Hall, which has served as the
backdrop for Hollywood films like ``Presumed Innocent,'' James
said, ``Many of these up-and-coming rap artists have gained
strength through struggle, have stepped over a crack vial, stepped
over a hypodermic needle, and onto the stage of life.''

NEWARK: stage of life.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The city's greatest living cultural figure, however, is a Newark
expatriate. From his debut novel, ``Goodbye, Columbus,'' in 1959 to
his latest, ``The Human Stain,'' Philip Roth, a product of Newark's
Weequahic section, has ``turned his bleak part of Jersey and its
people into a kind of Jewish Yoknapatawpha County,'' Robert Stone
wrote in a review of an earlier novel.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's Newark is a spectral one; the lower- and middle-class
Jewish milieu has largely vanished, and his references to
contemporary Newark can be biting. ``My father was one of those
Prince Street guys who loved that city all his life,'' recounts
Swede Levov, the tragic hero of ``American Pastoral.'' ``What
happened to Newark broke his heart. It's the worst city in the
world ...'' He adds: ``Used to be the city where they manufactured
everything. Now it's the car-theft capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fictional reminiscences, circa 1995, are now out of date.
For one thing, Newark no longer leads the nation in car theft. Many
of the 19th-century factories that housed the city's leather,
garment and toy manufacturers are seeing a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as the temperature topped 90 degrees, Ben Polsky
paced around his fourth-floor loft in a factory building on New
Jersey Railroad Avenue, wearing shorts and flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   Polsky, 34, is a painter, who shares a 3,500-square-foot loft
with his wife, Holli Schworno, 35, also an artist. ``The scene here
is very organic,'' he said. ``The artists who have come to Newark
are a lot less interested in meeting a bunch of other artists down
at a cafe; they're interested in having enough space to work and
still have some semblance of a family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally from Miami, Polsky moved to Newark eight years ago
from New York's Lower East Side. He and Schworno came before the
economic boom, when it was still possible to rent 3,000 square feet
for $600. While rents have risen substantially since then, huge
artistic spaces in the Ironbound still cost a fraction of those in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, ``what they call artists' lofts all look like
multimillion-dollar Ikea ads,'' he said. His loft, across the
street from the elevated railroad tracks separating the downtown
from the Ironbound, is undeniably authentic: stiflingly hot,
paint-splattered, strewn with art-making debris. He smiled and
sopped the sweat from his forehead as a New Jersey Transit train
whirred past his window at eye level. ``We call that our toy
train.''
</P>
<P>
   Polsky still hears the skepticism from his Brooklyn and
Manhattan friends about Newark's newfound hipness. ``We get that
all the time,'' he said, ``and quite frankly I hope it continues.''

LOS ALAMOS: CINDERS, DESPAIR
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(SANTA FE, N.M.) _ It will be at least a week before the 11,000
displaced residents of Los Alamos will be allowed to return to
their fire-scarred town.
</P>
<P>
   So, when local radio stations announced where people could
discover whether their homes were still standing, evacuees spilled
from hotels and friends' homes, creating a traffic jam on New
Mexico 502 at the turnoff to Pojoaque High School.
</P>
<P>
   There, they found Red Cross volunteer Marion Johnson standing on
a chair, yelling out the addresses of the 260 homes destroyed by
this week's ``Cerro Grande'' fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Ridgeway! I'm still doing Ridgeway!'' Johnson shouted.
Then louder, ``I'm still on Ridgeway! I haven't gotten to another
street!''
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains above, the fire continued to grow across 32,000
acres, singeing the edges of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   One woman waited for the bad news, then stood shaking in the
crowd, holding her lunch: a salad with dressing that rippled as she
shook. Her husband stood next to her, stroking her hair. She walked
downstairs, away from the crowd and sat on an Army cot, head in her
hands, crying.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Blossom found her home was not on the list, though houses
on either side of hers were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the power of prayer,'' she said, bouncing up and down
and glowing. ``That's what it was. I asked him to put up a hedge or
some kind of protection, and I knew he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur Bergquist couldn't believe his house wasn't on the list.
He kept scouring the pages taped to the wall, fingering each line,
saying his address over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be totally gone,'' he said. ``Up
until now, I was thinking that I was going to have to rebuild
everything.'' &QL; 
FLOOD OF SUPPLIES &QL; 
They wiped out the underwear selection at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   They toted toiletries, hauled hay and carted canned goods until
the governor, of all people, had to stand up and publicly say, ``No
mas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross has asked me to make you aware that they can't
handle any more clothing or food,'' Gov. Gary Johnson said Friday
afternoon. ``Right now, we need some money.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexicans opened their hearts, wallets and truck beds to
bring supplies to victims of the Cerro Grande fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing things, and it's really making a devastating
time better,'' said Julie Pugsley, a Los Alamos evacuee.
</P>
<P>
   Julie and her husband, Robert, were staying at an Albuquerque
hotel, courtesy of her employer, US West. The company also picked
up their cleaning tab.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from throughout northern New Mexico pitched in to
round up animals stranded by the fire and house them in a makeshift
animal shelter at the Santa Fe Rodeo grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Pugsleys found their 3-year-old cat, Shasta, at the rodeo
shelter Friday, after searching two kennels for their lost pet. The
reunion was joyous, even though the couple were unsure of the fate
of their home.
</P>
<P>
   Robert was hopeful, saying he had seen the intact roof of their
home on a television news clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a spruce tree in front that's 30 feet tall, and the
grass is green,'' Pugsley said. ``You walk 50 feet to the right,
and the house is down to its foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Julie was pessimistic. She had just spied their neighbor's
address on a list of 191 Los Alamos homes destroyed by the
wind-whipped blaze. &QL; 
MARVEL AT GENEROSITY &QL; 
Throughout Santa Fe on Friday, fire victims marveled at the
generosity of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might all be a little crazy around here, but when there's a
problem, people here really come together,'' said Talina
Melenchenko, as she shushed a crowing rooster at the animal
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   She had traveled from Madrid to pitch in, giving Gatorade to
refugee rabbits and slicing up apples for the chickens. The shelter
overflowed with donations from area residents.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks of dog chow were piled high, rivaling the height of nearby
bags of cat litter. Rugs, blankets and sheets abounded for bedding.
Outside, Diann Mills was drying off one of the scores of animal
carriers that volunteers had donated.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who evacuated her Los Alamos home Wednesday, said
pitching in was better than sitting in her hotel room. Besides, she
said, working was a way to delay learning about the fate of her
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so impressed with everybody,'' Mills said. ``I heard
they estimated it would take 10 hours to get people out of town,
and it took four hours. I was just proud of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Law, Met Haynes and Ryan Boudrie are the pride of their
Los Alamos families and friends. The three young men drove through
the spreading Los Alamos fire Wednesday, ferrying out livestock and
pets. Their three trips rescued 15 horses, 11 bulls and two goats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could touch the windows on both sides of my truck and they
were hot,'' Law, 17, recalled. The flames rose up on both sides of
the road like a tidal wave, and smoke obscured all but a few feet
of road, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home after the animal rescue, Law said he had
no interest in watching television coverage of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been there, done that, driven through it, don't want to do
it again,'' Law said. &QL;

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-MASSACRE (Washington) _ New evidence has been published
that appears to undermine the testimony of two central witnesses
who said American soldiers were ordered to kill civilians near the
No Gun Ri bridge during the Korean War. Senior Defense Department
officials said that the new documents and testimony will not deter
the Army's own investigation of the July 26, 1950, incident that
led to what the Pentagon called the ``tragic death of hundreds of
civilians.'' The Army investigation was sparked by a series of
articles published by the Associated Press that won the Pulitzer
Prize this year. By Elizabeth Becker and Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   BANGLADESH-PAKISTANIS (Rangpur, Bangladesh) _ The world
ceaselessly churns out human tragedy. The newly conquered. Newly
dispossessed. Newly hungry. Newly diseased. Newly destitute. One
calamity overtakes another, and the 240,000 ``stranded Pakistanis
of Bangladesh'' know they are the leftover unfortunates of distant
yesterdays. For 29 years, they have been spread across this nation
in 66 squalid camps, each a tightly packed thatch firetrap. They
live as refugees, though theirs is a more peculiar predicament.
They did not leave their country; their country left them. By Barry
Bearak.

   COLO-DEFAMATION-SUIT (Denver) _ What began as a dispute over the
behavior of pet dogs has escalated into the biggest legal threat
ever to hit the Anti-Defamation League, a $10.5 million jury
verdict against the organization for comments that its Denver-area
director made defending a Jewish couple who claimed their Catholic
neighbors were anti-semitic conspirators, plotting to harm them and
their children. The case, now on appeal, raises issues of privacy,
defamation and the purpose of the ADL. By Michael Janofsky.

<P>
   PA-GUNS-POLITICS (Beaver County, Pa.) _ It has become
conventional wisdom among Democratic strategists that the Million
Moms March for gun control this Sunday will be good for Vice
President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency. But the
conventional wisdom does not apply in this Ohio River county.
Nestled in the shadows of shuttered steel mills 20 miles northwest
of Pittsburgh, Beaver County has been a Democratic bastion since
the New Deal. It is also a haven for hunters, Second Amendment
devotes and the National Rifle Association, Gore's sworn enemy. By

   MOMS-MURDER (Pine Bluff, Ark.) _ This weekend hundreds of
thousands of mothers will gather in Washington D.C. for the Million
Mom March, a protest against gun violence in America. We visit the
mothers of murder victims in this down-and-out little city that in
1997 and 1998 was the per capita murder capital of the nation. This
is murder in America at its most typical and extreme. Typical
because it is down and out, and in the South, the region that leads
the nation in murders. The mothers we talked to don't really know
about the march. But they know a lot about murder. By Jim Yardley.

   SPAIN-TELEFONICA (Madrid, Spain) _ In Spain's corporate world,
with its cozy relationships and closely knit elite, it might have
seemed that Juan Villalonga's greatest asset as head of the
national phone company was his boyhood friendship with the prime
minister, Jose Maria Aznar. But Villalonga, the 47-year-old
chairman of the company, Telefonica, has also made his way on his
own. In the process, Villalonga has made Telefonica a darling of

   FORD-SUVS (Dearborn, Mich.) _ Across the Detroit area and in
Washington, people were trying Friday to interpret Ford Motor Co.'s
bold acknowledgement that it faced a dilemma in balancing sales of
highly profitable sport utility vehicles with the company's desire
to be a good corporate citizen. In an industry with a long history

handful of scholars from the United States as both Washington and
Havana have eased restrictions on research in Cuba. The improved

By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's 550-foot news-and-views edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   News: Major League Baseball officials have finally responded to
the barrage of home runs by launching an investigation into the
juiced baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Views: This is like sending officials of Shell to study what
caused the Exxon Valdez oil spill. It's baseball's version of the
Warren Commission and single bullet theory.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the 2000 ball is wound tighter than Dick Vitale.
I knew it the first time I saw a hitter at Dodgers Stadium hit a
pop foul over the upper deck. Confirmation came a day later when
another foul soared in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with home runs, but baseball is pushing
its luck by laying it on so thick. The current rate of 2.6 home
runs (and 10.7 runs) will set new records if they hold up. Records
have already been set for most home runs in a day (57), week (262)
and the month of April (931).
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 5,528 home runs were a major league record, a year
after Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa blew up the single-season
records, which came a year after the Rockies (239) and Mariners
(261) set new N.L. and A.L. records for home runs by one team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have hit 74 home runs in 34 games, and I can
remember when Busch Stadium was considered a pitcher's park.
</P>
<P>
   It just cheapens the game. Baseball's zealous mission to convert
looky-loos into fans with a barrage of fireworks threatens to anger
the choir. News: Some critics suggest raising the pitching mound
from its current height of 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Views: It wouldn't bug me if that happened. Baseball lowered it
from 15 inches to 10 in 1969 and survived the change. But I can
offer a four-point plan that's easier to implement.
</P>
<P>
   1. Give the black of the plate back to the pitchers. Once upon a
time, umpires rewarded pitchers who could work the ball along the
edges. Now they squeeze it the other way.
</P>
<P>
   2. Enforce the strike zone as written in the rules. This would
return the high strike to the game, since the rules say the top of
the strike zone is the letters. As it's called now, any pitch an
inch higher than the belt is a ball.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove all body armor from hitters. Every time I see Barry
Bonds walk up to the plate with that kevlar on his arm, I wish a
pitcher would plunk him in the ribs. 4. Create a standard on the
height of the seams of the ball. Give pitchers something to dig
their fingers in to and it would compensate for the tightness of
the leather. The current balls are as smooth as a baby's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   News: Randy Johnson beats Kevin Brown 2-1 in an old-fashioned
pitcher's duel.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Anyone who watched the game and came away bored is
welcome to return to soccer. It was great baseball. I'll take the
sight of a masterful pitcher overwhelming big men with sticks over
450-foot lollipop fly balls any day.
</P>
<P>
   News: The NCAA announces plans for a Home Run Derby as part of
the opening festivities at the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Here's an example of the epidemic. Two years after
aluminum home runs became a mockery at the 1998 World Series,
leading to length-to-weight ratios for metal bats in 1999, college
baseball is again embracing Gorilla Ball. Stop the insanity!
</P>
<P>
   News: Padres pitcher Rodney Myers is out for the season after a
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Views: If you saw the video of Myers' foot sticking to the
astroturf in Cincinnati, then you will agree that artificial turf
must be banned immediately. With so many advances in synthetic
grass fields, there's no excuse for digging up every last stitch.
</P>
<P>
   News: NHL playoffs reach Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Views: And look who happens to be coaching in them -- Larry
Robinson. I'm certainly not going to criticize the Kings for moving
in another direction after Robinson's mild tenure . Andy Murray had
a good first season and Dave Taylor already has made some great
moves as G.M. But whatever ailed the Kings and Robinson isn't
affecting the New Jersey Devils with him as their coach. Maybe the
Kings didn't work hard enough for Robinson. Maybe his steady style
is more effective with teams on the east coast, where there are
fewer winter diversions. I'd like to see Robinson and the Devils
win the Stanley Cup, if only because he's a class act who readily
accepted all blame for the Kings' failures. There's all kinds of
redemption at work in the NHL playoffs. If the Philadelphia Flyers
make it to the finals without Eric Lindros, it will put Bobby
Clarke back atop the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' Hall of Famer and G.M. went on the power play when
it came time to take Lindros' captaincy away from him. Patrick Roy
and Ray Bourque are the redemption stories for the Colorado
Avalanche, and the Dallas Stars would be looking to prove last
year's win was more than a skate in the crease. Of course, based on
TV ratings, 99 out of 100 Americans think the Stanley Cup is what
Stanley wears when he's asked to play catcher.
</P>
<P>
   News: Tommy Lasorda is named head coach of the U.S. Olympic
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Views: I just want to be there when some reporter from South
Korea asks Tommy his opinion of Kim's performance.

condition is stable but doctors are still trying to determine the
cause of the bleeding in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia, though, said focusing on the game
would not be a problem for his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing happens when you play the game, how instincts
take over,'' Scioscia said. ``You're able to play through tough
things happening off the field. It's not an indication of not
caring or connecting with Kent. Your instincts take over and you
play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' problem, however, was that the Rangers batters were
focused at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   They had 14 hits in all, and they weren't cheap as eight went
for extra bases. The four homers were hit by Mike Lamb, Ruben
Mateo, Royce Clayton (grand slam) and Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also tied a club record with two triples in the game.
David Segui and Mateo each had a double.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers closer John Wetteland pitched the final 1 innings for
his fourth save of the season and No. 300 of his career, becoming
the 12th pitcher to reach the milestone in baseball history. At 33
years, 8 months and 21 days, Wetteland tied Lee Smith as the
youngest to reach 300.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't come easy.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland entered the game in the eighth inning with two out.
After giving up an RBI single to Darin Erstad, he retired Adam
Kennedy on a fly to deep center for the third out, the Rangers
maintaining an 11-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored twice in the top of the ninth off Angels
reliever Mike Fyhrie, and it turned out they needed the runs
because Wetteland struggled in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn led off the inning with a homer and Tim Salmon
doubled. Garret Anderson followed with a two-run homer and
suddenly, a 13-8 game was 13-11 with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus grounded out to third for the first out of the ninth,
but Orlando Palmeiro singled to center. Bengie Molina, who had a
career-high four hits including two home runs, this time popped out
for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio stuck out to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's two-run homer in the first inning (No. 9) and an RBI
single by Kennedy in the second staked Schoeneweis to a 3-0 lead.
But the Rangers bounced back quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A two-run homer by Lamb in the third inning made it 3-2. In the
fourth, Rodriguez tripled and scored on a groundout to tie the game
at 3, and two outs later Mateo homered to put the Rangers up, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels tied the game at 4 in the fourth on the first of
Molina's two homers, but the Rangers broke it open with five runs
in the sixth, four coming home on Clayton's first career grand
slam.
</P>
<P>
   Molina hit his second homer of the game in the sixth, and
doubled in a run in the eighth, his fourth hit of the game. But the
Angels bullpen, already tired from excessive use, couldn't hold the
Rangers down.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit the Rangers' fourth homer of the game off Fyhrie
in the seventh inning, and the Rangers added another run in the
eighth and two more in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   For Schoeneweis, Friday's game was his second rough outing in a
row, and his second loss in a row after a 4-0 start. Schoeneweis
gave up a season-worst nine runs and nine hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous start, he gave up six runs (five earned) and six
hits in five innings. His ERA was 3.43 before the past two starts,
but is up to 5.06 now. &QL;

NEXT ROUND GETS CLOSER FOR O'NEAL AND LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Los Angeles Lakers held off the Phoenix Suns with
free throws and spoiled a 31-point effort from Penny Hardaway to
take a 3-0 lead in their Western Conference semifinal series with a
105-99 victory Friday night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored 37 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, and
Kobe Bryant added 25 points. The Lakers hit 35 of 51 free throws
and can sweep the best-of-7 series if they win here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, Glen Rice and Brian Shaw combined for six straight free
throws that gave the Lakers a 102-97 lead with 37.5 seconds
remaining to finish off the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Baskets by Luc Longley and Shawn Marion gave the Suns a brief
95-94 lead, before O'Neal made a strong move inside to put the
Lakers back in front as the teams traded leads.
</P>
<P>
   Two clutch plays lifted the Lakers into position to beat the
Suns. With his team trailing by 91-90, Ron Harper of Los Angeles
missed two free throws, but O'Neal rose above the rim for a
left-handed tip-in to put the Lakers ahead by one. After Hardaway
missed a jump shot, Bryant hit a short jumper for a 93-90 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had pulled the Lakers into an 87-87 tie on a 3-point play
with 6 minutes 8 seconds left, putting his team into position to
close out the series with one more victory.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in Game 2, the Suns appeared in control late in the third
quarter, this time holding a 72-65 lead with three minutes
remaining. Then again, the Suns had not beaten the Lakers in two
playoff games and four regular-season meetings, so doubt still
lingered.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, the Lakers closed the gap to a single point at
76-75. Shaw finished the 11-3 rally with two free throws after
being fouled by Todd Day with two-tenths of a second to go.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two points at halftime, the Suns briefly rattled the
Lakers with an 11-2 run to start the third quarter, taking a 61-54
lead. From there, Longley scored three straight baskets, but the
Suns could not extend their lead past seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, the first half amounted to an O'Neal free-throw
exhibition. The Suns tried bearhugs from Oliver Miller, forearm
shivers from Longley and a flying tackle by Kevin Johnson, but
O'Neal made them pay every time. O'Neal, perhaps preparing himself
for some rough tactics from the Portland Trail Blazers in the
Western Conference finals, smoothly sank 8 of 10 free throws while
scoring 16 points and leading the Lakers to a 52-50 halftime lead.
He finished the game 9 for 15 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   With six minutes remaining in the second quarter, O'Neal's
driving bank shot sent Longley sprawling and capped a 17-6 run that
gave the Lakers their first lead at 35-33. The center had plenty of
help from the outside, too. After failing to hit a 3-pointer in the
first quarter, the Lakers drilled five of them in the second
quarter, getting two each from Robert Horry and Rick Fox and one
from Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Horry sparked the Lakers early in the second quarter, scoring
eight points in 90 seconds, including his two 3-pointers that cut
the Suns' lead to 30-26. Bryant also came alive, scoring 8 of his
12 first-half points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway and Cliff Robinson led the Suns with 14 points each.
The Suns, believing they could beat the Lakers on the fast break,
ran as much as possible in the first quarter, grabbing a 28-18 lead
behind Hardaway's eight points and Robinson's seven. Better defense
and the quicker pace helped neutralize O'Neal, who led the Lakers
with seven points but scored only one basket. He was 5 of 6 from
the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   With the Suns in their face from the start, the Lakers shot 27
percent in the quarter, making 6 of their 22 attempts. The Suns,
who opened with a 15-3 run and led by as many as 12 points, were 10
of 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers quickly regained their shooting touch, putting the
Suns back between O'Neal and a hard place. With Bryant, Rice and
Horry tuning up their jump shots, the Suns' early lead evaporated
like water in the desert heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All bets are off right now,'' Suns coach Scott Skiles said
before the game. ``We'll do whatever we can to stop Shaq, but not
at the expense of leaving guys open all over the place. They've
proven they can hit the big shots from anywhere.''

THIS CONSPIRACY REALLY RIDICULOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PHOENIX _ Pssst, did you hear? In defiance of the league's
trading moratorium, the Los Angeles Lakers reportedly have acquired
for their title run a sixth man more valuable than Rodney Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The proud, paranoid people of this city swear this late pickup
is the one killing the Suns, not Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry? A.C. Green? Neither has a thing on this Conspiracy
fellow. That's how he was identified in the local media Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Con-spir-a-cy.
</P>
<P>
   Guess he's so big, his surname is superfluous. You know, like
Michael or Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this major player, this series stealer, happens
to be invisible to everybody except Phoenix fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you wonder: Is that Oliver Miller or Oliver
Stone taking up all that space on the Phoenix bench?
</P>
<P>
   The description of this Conspiracy character that appeared in a
local newspaper profile Friday was of a monster spawned in David
Stern's laboratory expressly to destroy small-market teams like the
scrappy Suns in the name of higher ratings.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then Conspiracy is the one who has hounded
Luc Longley into 10-for-26 shooting and re-routed all 12 of Rodney
Rogers' three-point shots away from the basket in this
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   Following Phoenix's logic, Conspiracy also is the one with his
teeth inJason Kidd's left ankle. And he must have been the one who
stepped on Cliff Robinson's foot in the third quarter, thereby
forcing him to the bench with a twisted ankle on the heels of an
inspired performance.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3 at America West Arena, Conspiracy evidently was the
one clearing the perimeter of Phoenix players so Robert Horry had
an unobstructed view of the basket for the jumper and two
three-pointers he knocked down in the first 90 seconds of the
second quarter to shake the Lakers out of a stupor that induced a
10-point deficit after 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest while, it looked like perhaps Conspiracy was a
scratch on this evening. You know: DNP _ Commissioner's Decision
(same as in NewYork, where the smaller-market, scrappy team from
Miami beat the Knicksin overtime on the strength of Anthony
Carter's questionable basket).
</P>
<P>
   But on the strength of clutch free-throw shooting down the
stretch, theLakers prevailed 105-99 to take a commanding 3-0 series
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who put together winning streaks of 16, 19, and 11
games during the regular season en route to compiling the league's
best mark (67-15), had lost their previous four road games, dating
back to April 5.
</P>
<P>
   We guess Conspiracy only suited up for games at the Staples
Center before Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea that NBA officials tilt games in favor of
large-market teams to help the ratings is so ludicrous as to be
laughable. It certainlytickled the funny bone of Phil Jackson, who,
contrary to what the Phoenix fans would have you believe, did not
go to the NBA Finals all 11 yearshe played in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' Jackson said, sarcastically claiming
Conspiracy as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson understands where underdogs get these wild ideas. It's
the officiating, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball umpires may influence the outcome of a game by how they
frame the strike zone, but they call only balls and strikes, not
personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   With a few quick whistles, a basketball referee can put a player
on hisheels better than can the best defender.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case for O'Neal, who got caught a couple of times
in the paint standing as still as the figure on his league MVP
statuette. He picked up his fourth foul with 6:56 remaining and had
to tread lightly the rest of the way. That's not easy when you're
7-foot-1 and 335 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the eighth-year center finished with 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, all the Lakers did a lot of standing around on
offense, turning the triangle at times into a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   And yet they manufactured a victory anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Phoenix fans will start seeing clearly now. The plain
truth, even if they refuse to recognize it, is that consistency and
constancy have carried the Lakers this far, not any conspiracy. &QL;

LAKERS GET CLOSER TO SWEEP OF SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The heroics, this time, looked different.
Lessspectacular, less prepackaged and made-for-SportsCenter. But
the results were no less impressive, no less damaging to the
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting 47 minutes of a back-and-forth affair, the Los
Angeles Lakers finally inserted the dagger in the final minute and
15 seconds Friday night, making nothing but free throws to slowly,
surely push the Phoenix Sunsto the edge of elimination, turning a
one-point game into a 105-99 victory at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   That's three Laker victories and zero for the Suns in this
best-of- seven series, with the Lakers going for the sweep on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal once again led the way, with 37 points and 17
rebounds, and he came through at the foul line, hitting 9 of 15,
including 1 of2 with 26.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, the hero of Game 2, struggled from the field,
making 8 of20, but scored 25 points and contributed two free throws
of his own down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also got a boost off the bench, with Robert Horry
contributing 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway scored 31 points for the Suns, who also got 23
points from Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had a 12-point lead in the first quarter, but neither
team had firm control at any point after that. For most of the
fourth quarter, they simply exchanged 1- and 2-point leads.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two games of the series, the Suns were
essentially atwo-man team. But they finally found a few other
options to supplement Penny Hardaway and Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers, the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year, but an invisible
man in this series so far, reappeared when his team needed him
most. Though still without a 3-pointer in the series, Rogers found
other ways to help,scoring 9 points through the first three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Clipper paced the Suns in the fourth, scoring 6 of the
their first 13 points, but he fouled out with 26.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been one of our keys, is to slow him down,'' coach Phil
Jackson said. ``But as I've said before, benches come alive on the
homecourt.The bench, the road is not as easy for them. And
tonight's a measure ofwhether we can hold Rodney Rogers in check or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, the Lakers had not won on the road since
April 5, though that was a slightly misleading statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are numbers, but we've only played four (road) games in
five weeks,'' said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   All four were losses _ two in the final week of the regular
season, when the Lakers were just cruising to the finish, the
second two at Arco Arena, in the Lakers' first-round series with
the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'd like to win on the road,'' said Jackson, whose team
went 31-10 away from Staples Center this season. ``We know we have
to reach that point where we have that ability to win on the road.
It's important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the ability to win on the road that gives you a
measureof `us against them,' it's the idea of winning against odds,
it's playing your best for your team and all those things I think
create a good atmosphere for a basketball club.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Lakers who entered halftime with a slight lead,
52-50, but it was Phoenix that controlled the game for most of the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns blitzed the Lakers early, on the scoreboard and in the
paint.They aggressively double-teamed O'Neal, and he promptly
missed 5 of hisfirst 6 field-goal attempts under the duress.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the Suns to take an early 12-point lead, and with
the Lakers making just 6 of 22 from the field, Phoenix held a 28-18
advantage by the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Robert Horry changed the game almost single-handedly. Horry
started off the second quarter by scoring 8 quick points, including
back-to-back 3-pointers, to cut the lead to 30-26.
</P>
<P>
   With the Suns continuing to crowd O'Neal, long-distance shooting
suddenly became the Lakers' savior. Rick Fox also hit a pair of
3-pointers, and Glen Rice added one of his own as the Lakers took
the lead back and maintained control through the end of the half.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, in turn, got more room to operate and scored 7 points in
the final 3:18 of the second quarter, finishing with 16 points and
eight rebounds in the half. Half of his points came at the foul
line, where O'Neal_ shooting 44 percent in the postseason _ made 8
of 11 attempts. He made 3 of his last 4, after a pair of quick
intentional fouls from OliverMiller.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored 12 points in the half, making 4 of 10 shots.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ With the man who spanked him, Frank Robinson,
watching from a seat behind the plate and injured teammates Nomar
Garciaparra and Carl Everett confined to the visitors' dugout
Friday night, Pedro Martinez switched back from punishee to his
accustomed role of punisher.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor Baltimore Orioles, who never had a chance. A night
after completing his five-game suspension for hitting Cleveland's
Roberto Alomar after being forewarned that was a no-no, Martinez
set down the first dozen Orioles and last 14 Orioles in order,
struck out 15, and allowed just one runner to second base in a
two-hit, 9-0 demolition of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Was he making a point to F. Robby, the Hall of Famer who is
baseball's avenging angel _ the official title is vice president,
on-field operations _ because he slapped him with the suspension?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Martinez, who barely pitched inside all
night. ``He understands the way I am. He understands about
baseball. I don't have anything to say to him. What I have to say,
I say in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez tied an American League record for strikeouts in
consecutive games with 32. Martinez, who already did it last year,
shares the honor with Luis Tiant (Cleveland, 1968), Nolan Ryan
(California, 1974), and Randy Johnson (Seattle, 1997). The major
league record for whiffs in three consecutive games is 47, set by
Ryan in '74. Martinez's next start is scheduled for Wednesday night
in Toronto against the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox ace, who recorded his first shutout of the season, has
allowed just one run in his last 26 innings. He has not allowed
more than two earned runs in any of his seven starts, and has had
just one inning out of 53 1/3 this season in which he has given up
as many as two runs. And one of those runs was unearned, the result
of a second-inning error by first baseman Mike Stanley April 25 at
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's only hits Friday night came in the fifth inning on a
ground single through the right side by Albert Belle to start the
inning and a soft single to center by Jeff Conine. Belle had never
gotten a hit in 13 regular-season at-bats against Martinez until he
topped a 1-1 pitch between first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who did not walk a batter, struck out every Orioles
batter, getting catcher Greg Myers and Maine's Mike Bordick three
times apiece. He whiffed five in a row in a span that began with
the last out of the seventh and ended with Bordick's strikeout to
start the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan had advised another Hall of
Famer, former Orioles pitcher Jim Palmer, that he was in for
something special Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were pretty good,'' Kerrigan teased his former teammate,
``but watch this guy tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And what would he have told Palmer after the game? ``You were
pretty good,'' Kerrigan said, ``but this guy is on another
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 48,354 in Camden Yards was on its feet when
Martinez ended the night by striking out Delino DeShields, the man
for whom he was traded from the Dodgers to the Montreal Expos after
the 1993 season. DeShields made a feeble offering at the last of
Martinez's 113 pitches in a game that required just 137 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That gave him plenty of time, as he made his way back to the
dugout, to borrow a pen from a cop and sign a ball tossed to him by
a female fan.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, beaten, 1-0, by Tampa Bay in his last start despite
striking out 17 Devil Rays in a route-going performance, raised his
record to 6-1 while lowering his earned run average to a
microscopic 1.01. That's more than a run below the No. 2 man in the
league in ERA, James Baldwin of the White Sox (2.34), and four runs
below the league average of 5.12.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of support for Martinez despite the
absence of Garciaparra, who went on the 15-day disabled list with a
strained left hamstring, and Everett, who is day-to-day with a sore
right quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God Petey is pitching,'' closer Derek Lowe had said
before the game, ``but we've got good enough guys to pick up the
slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Good call. The Sox, winners of five of their last six and eight
of their last 11, banged out 16 hits in sending the Orioles to
their fifth straight loss. The Sox gave Martinez a 2-0 lead even
before he went to the mound and wrapped it up with a four-run ninth
that included a three-run home run by Brian Daubach, his seventh of
the season and second in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff man Jose Offerman had his first four-hit game of the
season, including a leadoff home run in the fifth. He also scored
three runs and knocked in two. Darren Lewis, playing center field
in place of Everett, had three hits, including a push-bunt single
in the first that served as catalyst to the Sox' two-run rally
against loser Sidney Ponson.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon had two hits and two RBIs, Mike Stanley had two
singles, and Daubach had a double and a run-scoring fielder's
choice, giving him four RBIs on the night.
</P>
<P>
   But the night, as it invariably does when he's pitching,
belonged to Martinez. ``That's as dominant as I've ever seen him,''
said Orioles manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, remember, was sitting in Cleveland's dugout last
October on the night of the Martinez Milagro (Miracle), when he did
not give up a hit over the last six innings in the deciding game of
the 1999 American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he keeps pitching like this, he'll win 30,'' said Hargrove,
echoing the same refrain Martinez heard at the All-Star break last
season, when he was 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Martinez has not made more than 33 starts in any
season, Hargrove's projection is far-fetched. But he's allowed.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson wasn't sitting among the paying spectators, he was
hopping from one broadcast booth to another while Martinez worked
his magic on the Orioles. Martinez was asked if Robinson had made
any attempt to contact him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What for?'' the Sox pitcher said.
</P>
<P>
   In case Robinson wanted to explain himself, was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over and said hello, like he usually does, and kept
walking,'' Martinez said. ``I just said hello and kept watching
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he was watching couldn't touch what came on later, live
and in prime time: The Pedro Martinez Show. Miss it at your own
peril.

STAIRS' HOMER IN NINTH SINKS SASAKI AS WELL AS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Kazuhiro Sasaki, closer.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki was scorched for a three-run, game-winning homer by Matt
Stairs in the ninth inning Friday night as the A's stole first
place in the AL West from Seattle with a 9-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that performance with the game-losing two-run homer
Sasaki gave up to Texas' David Segui on Wednesday, and Seattle
manager Lou Piniella had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sasaki earned the closer's job in spring training,'' Piniella
said. ``He just lost it tonight. From now on, we're going to have a
bullpen by committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to close with whoever I feel like closing with.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this year, the Mariners have lost three games
in a row. And in all three games, the Mariners have blown the lead
late in the game. Sandwiched between the two Sasaki losses was a
game-losing homer that lefty Arthur Rhodes gave up to Jason Giambi
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a 7-6 lead into the ninth with Jose Paniagua
having thrown two shutout innings in the wake of a go-ahead RBI
double by John Olerud in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Sasaki looked shaky from the start. He gave up a single to
rookie Terrence Long on a 1-1 pitch, then saw Randy Velarde bunt
Long into scoring position. Sasaki then missed with back-to-back
pitches to major league RBI leader Giambi, at which point Piniella
opted to walk Giambi intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   It goes against the book to put the go-ahead run on base, but
the thinking was sound. Stairs is limping around these days and
hasn't been hitting. Giambi is hitting everything. If Sasaki could
get Stairs to go after a forkball, a double play seemed likely.
</P>
<P>
   That was a big if.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs, hobbled by a left knee injury, hadn't driven in a run in
May. But the squat lefty is the master of the big homer in the late
going, and he did it again, launching a 1-0 pitch into a parking
orbit in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Of more significance to the Mariners was the fact that Sasaki
has done the same thing in his past two appearances. He's missed
with his forkball, then he's gotten hammered when he tries to come
back with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   This development could mean a return to closing status for
almost any of the Mariners relievers. Jose Mesa had 33 saves last
year and Rhodes did occasional ninth-inning work for Baltimore the
past few seasons. And Paniagua Friday gave the M's two of the most
clutch innings the club has gotten in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good out there,'' Paniagua said after having missed a
couple of games because of back spasms. ``But we'd all feel a lot
better if we hadn't lost that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Piniella and fellow manager Art Howe of Oakland
were talking baseball near the cage during batting practice. One of
the subjects of the conversation was how, in the American League
West this year, no lead was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Mariners and A's went out and put those words into
practice. Seattle took a 5-0 lead, squandered it all and went back
ahead on Olerud's double in the seventh before Stairs put the issue
to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The victory pushed the A's into the lead in the AL West by a
half game over Seattle, the Mariners falling out of the division
lead for the first time since April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez, perhaps inspired by a sign carried throughout
the Coliseum by a couple of young ladies reading, ``Alex Rodriguez
is a hottie,'' continued his hot-hitting ways. He drove in a run
with a sacrifice fly, another with a double and a third with an
infield single.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Rodriguez's flying feet that gave the M's their final
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After his infield single in the seventh tied the game, Rodriguez
scored all the way from first base on Olerud's double to get the
lead back for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Also making a huge contribution was DH Edgar Martinez, who
stretched his hitting streak to 11 games with a single and a
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   The loss couldn't be laid entirely at Sasaki's door.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had a chance to break the game open in the top of the
ninth when the Mariners loaded the bases with no outs. But the
middle of the M's order _ Olerud, Martinez and Jay Buhner _
couldn't get the ball out of the infield, and Sasaki had no margin
for error.
</P>
<P>
   And, earlier in the game, starter John Halama had a 5-0 lead but
gave most of it away in a five-batter stretch by walking four men
and hitting another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sailing along, and then that,'' Piniella said. ``I
don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Halama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you what happened, but I don't know,''
Halama said. ``All of a sudden, I couldn't throw a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours and five innings later, neither could Sasaki. When he
finally did, Stairs launched it for the stars.

A SNOWBALL'S CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ There was a pulse but not much. There was a lament,
but it was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns know what they have to do after their 105-99
Game 3 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night _ just beat
the team with the league's record four consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   So the Suns tried to hold their heads up, tried to talk brave,
but it was hard not to sense the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we can win,'' said Suns guard Penny Hardaway.
``Once we get one, we're going to try and make it a snowball
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to quit. It would be easy just to fold it in
and say, `Let's go home,' and let 'em have it. But we're going to
make 'em work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Suns know they have all that bad history facing them.
No team in NBA history has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel like we can beat them,'' said Suns center Luc
Longley. ``But tonight we had too many dumb plays, bad plays. I
really feel we can do a better job on Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the safest assumption of the night, since
Shaquille O'Neal scored 37 points and had 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the way O'Neal scored nine of them that was still
irking the Suns. O'Neal took 15 free throws, making nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the foul line kept them in the game in the fourth
quarter,'' Hardaway said. ``You shoot 20-some free throws in the
fourth quarter alone, that's going to keep you around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. It's a situation where you put yourself in
there, play tough defense and try to be physical, and this is the
playoffs _ and they get bailed out at the free-throw line. It's
already tough enough to stop these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot 51 free throws on the night _ 23 in the fourth
quarter. The Suns took 34 free throws overall, eight in the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been that way the whole series,'' said Suns forward
Rodney Rogers. ``There's nothing we can do about it. We go out
there and play our hearts out and leave everything on the floor,
and it's the same results all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley struggled terribly against O'Neal in the first two games
in L.A., started slowly Friday, but hit four field goals to give
the Suns the lead in the third quarter. Even if he did feel a bit
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an official tell me tonight not to lean on Shaq,''
Longley said. ``I really don't know what you're supposed to do. I
kept leaning on him. If you can't lean on him, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Like you're not, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Suns aren't in a very big way after Friday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix actually played well. Hardaway scored 31 points, Cliff
Robinson 23, and even Rogers showed improved play after two
miserable games in L.A., scoring 15 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were down 100-97 with less than 30 seconds to play,
when Hardaway missed a three-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to take a dribble and then fade away with it, and
you can't shoot it that way,'' Hardaway said. ``But if I was in
that situation again, I'd take it again. It hit the front of the
rim and just came off.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over, they were left down 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you play anybody when you're down three
games,'' Rogers said. ``No matter what we do or try, it seems like
we're not supposed to win. We just have to find a way right now.''

LAKERS NEARING SWEEP OF SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The heroics, this time, looked different. Less
sectacular, less spine-tingling, less tailored-for-SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive rebounds, offensive hounding and swished free throws
won't make too many highlight shows _they certainly lacked the
flair of Kobe Bryant's game-winning jumper in Game 2 _but those
ordinary plays carried the Lakers for the final two minutes of Game
3 Friday night as they slowly, methodically drained the life out of
the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   With a grind-it-out 105-99 victory at America West Arena, the
Lakers snatched a 3-0 lead in this best-of-seven conference
semifinal series and pushed the Suns to the brink of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers came here looking to win one of two, but getting that
victory immediately makes all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one means you've got a chance to end it. If they
would have had this game, they would have had hope that they could
tie this thing up,'' Ron Harper said. ``Now, since they're down
three games, they know they got a long hill now.''
</P>
<P>
   That uphill climb is a battle against the odds, and history. No
NBA team has ever come back from an 0-3 deficit to win a
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, the Suns will yet have to find a way to slow Shaquille
O'Neal, who hit his average in this series by scoring 37 points to
go with 17 rebounds. Bryant, in an encore to his Game 2 theatrics,
scored 10 of his 25 points in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they played extremely well, I think their confidence
was high,'' Bryant said of the Suns. ``I think we got a couple
lucky bounces here and there and they missed a couple big shots
late in the game, but other than that they were right there with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that's the toughest part for the Suns. For two
straight games, they had a victory in their hands, only to see it
disappear in the closing minutes, or seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desperate situation right now,'' said Phoenix guard
Penny Hardaway, ``but it's not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway led the Suns with 31 points, and Clifford Robinson
added 23, but no one could come through down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made all the key plays in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Down a point with 4:17 to go, Robert Horry missed two free
throws, but O'Neal sneaked in to tap in the second miss for a 92-91
lead. That seemed to give the Lakers a boost, though Phoenix took
one more lead, 95-94, on a Shawn Marion jumper with 2:50 to go.
</P>
<P>
   But then a penetrating Bryant found O'Neal for an easy dunk.
Harper blocked a Luc Longley attempt, leading to a 24-second
violation with 2:07 left. The rest was a blur of Suns fouls and
Laker free throws. Bryant made a pair, Rice made a pair and Brian
Shaw made a pair to stretch the lead to 102-97 with 37.5 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers and Robinson missed consecutive 3-point tries,
O'Neal corraled the rebound and made 1 of 2 free throws to help
seal it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good sign for the Lakers, who watched O'Neal make 9 of
15 from the line after hitting just 44 percent to date in the
playoffs. He also survived a few intentional fouls designed to
force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about the hack-a-Shaq,'' he said. ``I haven't
worried aboit it all year, so I'm not going to start worrying about
it now. I don't think I've really been struggling, I just haven't
been hitting them. I hit them when I need to hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had his own struggles and finished 8 of 20 from the
field. But he came through at the end, including a 3-point play
that tied the game midway through the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``A critical play, Kobe's play to tie the game,'' said coach
Phil Jackson. ``It put that game in a position where we could play
it to our level.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryant, ``I was just waiting for the fourth quarter.
Whenever you struggle like this, there's something about the fourth
quarter, there's something about the crowd on a road game behind
their team that just clicks, and you know you're going to bust
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's down to a one-game affair, Sunday at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long weekend for them, waiting for that Sunday game,''
Jackson said. ``This is the exciting part about it for us, that we
have this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But are the Suns already done?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' Harper said. ``They're a team who goes out and goes
hard. I don't think they're going to lose hope.''

   ``But Heisenberg, Heisenberg! You also have been deflected! If
people can see what's happened to you, to their piece of light,
then they can work out what must have happened to me! The trouble
is knowing what's happened to you! Because to understand how people
see you we have to treat you not just as a particle, but as a wave.
I have to use not only your particle mechanics, I have to use the
Schroedinger wave function.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Frayn's play ``Copenhagen'' arrived on
Broadway last month, a three-character drama about the
philosophical implications of quantum physics that Ben Brantley,
chief theater critic for The New York Times, called ``the most
invigorating and ingenious play of ideas in many a year.'' But does
anyone understand it?
</P>
<P>
   Frayn imagines the conversations that might have taken place
between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, on a night
in 1941 when the two scientists men met in German-occupied
Copenhagen. Bohr had developed the ``old quantum theory'' of atomic
matter; Heisenberg announced the famous uncertainty principle in
1927. These and 22 other dates and theorems are in a timeline
(written by Frayn) contained in a Playbill foldout. Sample entry:
``THE WAVE EQUATION. 1926 Schroedinger finds the mathematical
equation for the wave interpretation, and proves that wave and
matrix mechanics are mathematically equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh huh. Not since Tom Stoppard threw together James Joyce, Lenin
and Tristan Tzara in ``Travesties'' in 1975 have audience brows
been lifted quite so high.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn uses the Bohr-Heisenberg meeting, and the uncertainty
principle, to show the unknowability of all things. But what  &UR; is &LR; 
the uncertainty principle?
</P>
<P>
   We put that question to some members of the audience at a
performance of ``Copenhagen'' and to several people involved with
the production, as well as one genuine scientist. No Cliff Notes
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Grisiatis, freelance press agent: ``Oh, jeez. You're
talking to the wrong person.'' Grisiatis looked in panic at his
companion outside the Royale Theater during intermission at
Wednesday's matinee. Nonetheless, he bravely advanced a definition.
``You can never predict. You can only take an educated guess on
certain things. Is that about right? Science was never my strong
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Hodges, creative director: ``I understand what he's telling
me to understand, but I don't understand how a particle can be a
wave and a particle.'' Hodges works at SPOTco, the design studio
that produced the Playbill timeline. He recalled Jeff Goldblum in
the movie ``The Lost World,'' saying that the uncertainty principle
meant something like, ``You can't study a thing without changing
it.'' He said: ``It's like on Broadway there'll be someone someone
hates and someone someone loves, depending on your experience of
that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Vanarendonk, retired United Nations official: ``You
cannot identify a particle at the same time,'' he said, drawing
thoughtfully on a pipe at Wednesday's matinee. ``In other words,
the movement, if you want to freeze it in time, then it is a
particle. But, if you want to understand. . . . Let me put it this
way. . . . It's quite difficult to conceptualize. You can identify
you by placing you in time and place. The particle you cannot put
at the same time in the same time and place. And that is the
uncertain_'' he cut himself off.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous audience member: ``I'm very distracted by all the
noise here on the street,'' she said, struggling to explain
uncertainty. ``I don't understand it, no. Are you recording this?''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bosco, who plays Bohr: ``There is nothing explainable in

   ``But Heisenberg, Heisenberg! You also have been deflected! If
people can see what's happened to you, to their piece of light,
then they can work out what must have happened to me! The trouble
is knowing what's happened to you! Because to understand how people
see you we have to treat you not just as a particle, but as a wave.
I have to use not only your particle mechanics, I have to use the
Schroedinger wave function.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Frayn's play ``Copenhagen'' arrived on
Broadway last month, a three-character drama about the
philosophical implications of quantum physics that Ben Brantley,
chief theater critic for The New York Times, called ``the most
invigorating and ingenious play of ideas in many a year.'' But does
anyone understand it?
</P>
<P>
   Frayn imagines the conversations that might have taken place
between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, on a night
in 1941 when the two scientists men met in German-occupied
Copenhagen. Bohr had developed the ``old quantum theory'' of atomic
matter; Heisenberg announced the famous uncertainty principle in
1927. These and 22 other dates and theorems are in a timeline
(written by Frayn) contained in a Playbill foldout. Sample entry:
``THE WAVE EQUATION. 1926 Schroedinger finds the mathematical
equation for the wave interpretation, and proves that wave and
matrix mechanics are mathematically equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh huh. Not since Tom Stoppard threw together James Joyce, Lenin
and Tristan Tzara in ``Travesties'' in 1975 have audience brows
been lifted quite so high.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn uses the Bohr-Heisenberg meeting, and the uncertainty
principle, to show the unknowability of all things. But what  &UR; is &LR; 
the uncertainty principle?
</P>
<P>
   We put that question to some members of the audience at a
performance of ``Copenhagen'' and to several people involved with
the production, as well as one genuine scientist. No Cliff Notes
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Grisiatis, freelance press agent: ``Oh, jeez. You're
talking to the wrong person.'' Grisiatis looked in panic at his
companion outside the Royale Theater during intermission at
Wednesday's matinee. Nonetheless, he bravely advanced a definition.
``You can never predict. You can only take an educated guess on
certain things. Is that about right? Science was never my strong
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Hodges, creative director: ``I understand what he's telling
me to understand, but I don't understand how a particle can be a
wave and a particle.'' Hodges works at SPOTco, the design studio
that produced the Playbill timeline. He recalled Jeff Goldblum in
the movie ``The Lost World,'' saying that the uncertainty principle
meant something like, ``You can't study a thing without changing
it.'' He said: ``It's like on Broadway there'll be someone someone
hates and someone someone loves, depending on your experience of
that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Vanarendonk, retired United Nations official: ``You
cannot identify a particle at the same time,'' he said, drawing
thoughtfully on a pipe at Wednesday's matinee. ``In other words,
the movement, if you want to freeze it in time, then it is a
particle. But, if you want to understand. . . . Let me put it this
way. . . . It's quite difficult to conceptualize. You can identify
you by placing you in time and place. The particle you cannot put
at the same time in the same time and place. And that is the
uncertain_'' he cut himself off.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous audience member: ``I'm very distracted by all the
noise here on the street,'' she said, struggling to explain
uncertainty. ``I don't understand it, no. Are you recording this?''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bosco, who plays Bohr: ``There is nothing explainable in
the universe at the deepest level of science,'' he said. ``In the
quantum mechanics and the nuclear physics that we're talking about,
whatever you observe changes the nature of what you're observing.''
Bosco, let it be noted, confessed to some initial skepticism about

<P>
   Philosophy, the discipline for students intent on becoming
philosophers until their parents ask how much it pays, is now
within reach and available without the deep pain of tuition. For
the past few years, the writer Paul Strathern, who earned his own
philosophy degree at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, has been
distilling most of the world's best-known philosophers to 90
minutes, which, he said, is the length of a soccer game.

   A godsend in this era of the short attention span, his series,
published by Ivan R. Dee, begins with ``Socrates in 90 Minutes,''
wittily compressing his life and works, and proceeds to Locke, St.
Augustine, Descartes and Sartre, among others. New books on George
Berkeley and Paul-Michel Foucault are scheduled to be published
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Strathern wanted to write about the philosophers' lives, he
said, adding in a few of their ideas. ``If you fix it that way,
people do get it,'' he said. ``It gets to them, like garlic: It
sticks to them.''
</P>

   Socrates developed a method of negatively aggressive questioning
called dialectic (the forerunner of logic). This he used in
conversation to cut through the twaddle of his adversaries and
arrive at the truth. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Socrates went on to study under the philosopher Archelaus, ``by
whom he was beloved in the worse sense.'' . . . It wasn't long
before Socrates had demonstrated to his own satisfaction that the
so-called wise men of Athens in fact knew nothing _ just like him.
So he concluded that the Delphic Oracle had been right: He  &UR; was &LR; 
the wisest man _ because he  &UR; knew &LR;  that he knew nothing. . . . One
of his best-remembered remarks is, ``The unexamined life is not
worth living.''

   Plato explains that most human beings live as if in a dim cave .
. . In more philosophical terms, Plato believed that everything we
perceive around us _ the shoes and ships and sealing wax, and
cabbages and kings, of everyday experience _ is merely appearance.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   In Plato's ideal republic, there would be no possessions or
marriage (except among the lower orders, who were presumably the
only people fit for such things). Children would be removed from
their mothers soon after birth and educated communally. In this way
they would come to regard the state as their parents. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In Plato, eros is regarded as the soul's impulse toward good. In
its lowest form this is expressed in our passion for a beautiful
person and our wish for immortality by producing offspring with
that person. . . .

to dismiss the world around us as unreal. . . . Aristotle's most
significant achievement was in the field of logic. To all intents
he invented this subject. Aristotle came to see logic as the
foundation on which all learning was based. . . For example, if we
make the following two statements: All humans are mortal. All
Greeks are human. It can be inferred that: All Greeks are mortal. .

</P>
<P>
   Aristotle called his logic ``analytika,'' which means
unraveling. Every science or field of knowledge had to start from a
set of first principles, or axioms. From these its truths could be
deduced by logic (or unraveled).

   Confucius is the Latinized form of Kungfutzu (which means ``the
master Kung''). . . . Late in life, Confucius was to remember:
``When I was 15 I was only interested in studying.'' This was the
bedrock of his life, which he would later see as having been
divided into distinct stages: ``When I was 30 I began my life; at
40 I was self-assured; at 50 I understood my place in the vast
scheme of things; at 60 I learned to give up arguing; and now at 70
I can do whatever I like without disrupting my life.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Confucius was essentially a moral teacher. He was always sincere
and distrusted eloquence. . . . The key element of Confucius'
teachings was symbolized by the Chinese character  &UR; jen. &LR;  This stood
for a conceptual blend of magnanimity, virtue, and love of
humanity.

also introduced the idea of liberal democracy, which has become the
shibboleth of Western civilization. . . . This all makes Locke's

   ``The height of audacity in serving up pure nonsense, in
stringing together senseless and extravagant mazes of words, such
as had previously only been known in madhouses, was finally reached
in Hegel, and became the instrument of the most barefaced general
mystification that has ever taken place, with a result which will
appear fabulous to posterity, and will remain as a monument to
German stupidity.'' So wrote Schopenhauer, who was Hegel's
colleague at the University of Berlin. This remark is not intended
to prejudice but merely to warn. With Hegel, philosophy becomes a
matter of  &UR; extreme seriousness &LR; , so we'd best get any jokes out of
the way right at the start.

   With Nietzsche philosophy becomes dangerous again, this time
with a difference. In previous centuries philosophy had been
dangerous for philosophers; with Nietzsche it becomes dangerous for
everyone. Nietzsche ended up by going mad. . . . Nietzsche's larger
philosophical ideas are barely worthy of the name _ whether he's
talking about supermen, eternal recurrence (the idea that we live
our lives again and again throughout eternity), or the sole purpose
of civilization (to produce ``great men'' such as Goethe, Napoleon
and himself).

   ``The height of audacity in serving up pure nonsense, in
stringing together senseless and extravagant mazes of words, such
as had previously only been known in madhouses, was finally reached
in Hegel, and became the instrument of the most barefaced general
mystification that has ever taken place, with a result which will
appear fabulous to posterity, and will remain as a monument to
German stupidity.'' So wrote Schopenhauer, who was Hegel's
colleague at the University of Berlin. This remark is not intended
to prejudice but merely to warn. With Hegel, philosophy becomes a
matter of  &UR; extreme seriousness &LR; , so we'd best get any jokes out of
the way right at the start.

   With Nietzsche philosophy becomes dangerous again, this time
with a difference. In previous centuries philosophy had been
dangerous for philosophers; with Nietzsche it becomes dangerous for
everyone. Nietzsche ended up by going mad. . . . Nietzsche's larger
philosophical ideas are barely worthy of the name _ whether he's
talking about supermen, eternal recurrence (the idea that we live
our lives again and again throughout eternity), or the sole purpose
of civilization (to produce ``great men'' such as Goethe, Napoleon
and himself).

   CHINA-LABOR (Washington) _ The American labor movement is
mounting its biggest lobbying campaign ever on trade matters in
seeking to defeat the Clinton administration's effort to normalize
commerce with China. Unions are holding dozens of meetings on
Capitol Hill, putting intense pressure on individual legislators
back in their districts, staging rallies and writing huge numbers
of letters across the nation. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-INTERNET (Ina, Japan) _ The Internet is quietly
transforming Japan, making celebrities of small farmers, empowering
women, changing the way people apply for jobs and schools and
generally chipping away at traditional patterns of behavior. By
Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE-WARLORDISM (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ With the
apparent collapse of a nine-month-old peace accord, Sierra Leone is
on the verge of slipping back into warlordism. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE-SANKOH (Undated) _ In the wake of fighting among
rebel groups and government troops in the capital of Sierra Leone,
officials loyal to President Ahman Tejan Kabbah are beginning to
amass documents they say shows the extent to which the rebel leader
Foday Sankoh was systematically exploiting the country's diamonds
to pay for his rebellion and enrich himself. ``Terrible people in
history keep very good records,'' a high-ranking government
official said in a telephone interview Saturday. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-BORDER-EXECUTIONS (Mexico City) _ In 1995, after being
acquitted by a Texas jury of cocaine trafficking, Alberto Ochoa
Soto, a reputed member of a Colombian drug cartel, was released
into Mexico, where he was greeted by his lawyer, witnesses said. As
the two men met on a bridge, however, a Chevrolet Suburban drove up
and several men with Mexican Federal Judicial Police credentials
seized Ochoa and the lawyer. For five years, little news emerged to
clarify the men's fate _ until last week. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-WAR-CRIMES (Djakovica) _ With winter over, international
teams have resumed their digging in Kosovo, searching for bodies
and other clues that would back the indictment of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and four of his top allies in Serbia
on charges of genocide committed before and during NATO's bombing
of Yugoslavia last spring. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-FATIMA (Fatima, Portugal) _ Pope John Paul II goes to

</P>
<P>
   GERMAN-ENTREPRENEURS (Dortmund, Germany) _ Time was, in this
region, Grandpa worked for Krupp, Dad worked for Krupp, and if
Junior did not work for Krupp too, everyone was aghast. Here in the
heartland of German heavy industry, the big companies took care of
you, and employment was for life. Think again. By Roger Cohen.

   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-EXECUTIONS (Austin) _ Special Report: Gov. George W. Bush
is certain that the 127 people who have been executed in Texas
during his tenure were all guilty. But interviews with officials
who help administer the death penalty in the state, all of whom
believe in the death penalty and support Bush, reveal that the men
and women whose jobs involve reviewing case records, considering
inmates' appeal and weighing their final pleas for clemency are
less sanguine than Bush about both the fairness of the state's
judicial system and the risk Texas runs of executing innocent
people. By Sara Rimer and Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   With EXECUTIONS-CASES, sidebar on six cases.
</P>
<P>
   MOLECULAR-FARMING (Undated) _ The production of drugs in
genetically altered plants _ called molecular farming or
biopharming _ seems poised to represent the next wave in
agricultural biotechnology. Until now, efforts have mainly been
directed at protecting crops from pests and improving the taste and
nutrition of food. But just as the production of bioengineered
foods has been controversial, molecular farming is already raising
some safety and environmental concerns. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-ORLEANS-TERMITES (New Orleans) _ Formosan subterranean
termites with an insatiable taste for irreplaceable historic
structures have been devastating the French Quarter, drawn to its
moist, porous bricks and centuries-old wood, ravaging ancient live
oak trees. The Quarter is ground zero in the federal government's
$15 million effort to thwart the Formosan, the most destructive
species of termite in the world, capable of building colonies of up
to 10 million writhing white bugs, which devour an average of 1,000
pounds of wood a year. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   HEMMINGS-STREET (Charlottesville, Va.) _ Editor of local
Afro-American newspaper objects as city considers naming a street
after the family of Sally Hemmings, Thomas Jefferson's slave and
putative mother of his children. ``There's so much more history of
achievement among freed slaves, why honor her status as a
concubine?'' editor asks. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-DOCTORS (Miami) _ A decade-long dispute over the licensing
of a special group of Cuban doctors here is testing the power of
the Cuban American lobby in Florida against that of the state's
medical establishment and is about to involve the American Medical
Association. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   MINN-WILDFIRES (Gunflint Trail, Minn.) _ As foresters and resort
owners still struggle to clear trails and restore cabins devastated
by last year's firestorm, they face the legacy of the July 4, 1999,
blowdown: the prospect of large and destructive wildfires, made
more likely by the thick blanket of drying logs, leaves and needles
left behind. The fire last year left 25 million trees destroyed
along nearly half a million acres through the heart of Minnesota's
remote and treasured Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness near the
Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   ASIANS-MEDALS (Washington) More than a half-century since they
braved enemy fire after first enduring the contempt of their own
countrymen, 21 servicemen of Asian descent have been awarded the
nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for
heroism during World War II. By David Stout.

<P>
   SCOTUS-ENVIRO (Washington) _ As early as Monday, the Supreme
Court will announce whether it will hear an appeal from a ruling
last year that invalidated two new clean air standards issued in
1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency. While the case
concerned an important issue of environmental law, what set off
shockwaves last May was not so much the actual decision as its
rationale: The 2-1 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit held that the Clean Air Act, as
interpreted by the agency, ``effects an unconstitutional delegation
of legislative power.'' By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   UNIV-PHOENIX-AUDIT (Washington) _ The University of Phoenix, a
leader in providing college education to adults via the computer,
has improperly allowed students to obtain $50 million in federal
loans and grants, the inspector general for the Department of
Education has found. The agency's audit recommends the university,
which refutes the findings, pay back the money.

the face of political advertising: the increasing insertion of
special-interest groups into the process as masters of the attack.
By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMERS-RESPONSIBILITY (Los Angeles) _ After decades of
caricature as the most self-indulgent and permissive generation in
American history, baby boomers _ including Al Gore and George Bush
_ are realizing it is time to get with the program. Despite their
differences in political orientation, the two parties' presidential
candidates, both of whom were born into the vanguard of the boomer
generation, are delivering the same message on the campaign trail:
``responsibility.'' By Katharine Q. Seelye.

</P>
<P>
   BBO-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Baseball notes and news. Lead item:
It's beginning to smell a lot like 1994. That would be the aroma
coming from the American League West. When the 1994 season ended
prematurely, courtesy of a labor dispute between the players and
the owners, no AL West team had a winning record. None had even a
.500 record. The Texas Rangers were in first place, and their
record, 52-62, was far from .500. They are at it again. By Murray
Chass.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ NFL notes and news. Lead item: The
National Football League could soon face one of its most difficult
challenges, as an association made up of dozens of head coaches and
hundreds of assistants is preparing to file a lawsuit against the
league early next month seeking improved working conditions and
benefits. While there remains a solid chance the situation could
soon be settled without court action, several owners and members of
the association believe a legal battle may be imminent. By Mike
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ NBA notes and news. Lead item: About
the same time the Portland Trail Blazers were on their way to
postseason redemption, the Utah Jazz was writing its own obituary,
several years after most observers forecasted its demise. Their
second-round Western Conference semifinal has been rife with
symbolism the past week; the title-less, aging veterans who simply
don't have enough left versus the deeper, younger team who may
issue a sincere challenge to the Los Angeles Lakers. But the
Utah-Portland series goes beyond merely the players. By Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   KERMIT-WASHINGTON (Portland, Ore.) _ Kermit Washington, renowned
and still reviled for the fateful punch to the face of Rudy
Tomjanovich in an NBA game in 1977, talks about his side of the
story, at a time when other sports incidents keep bringing up
references to Washington.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: KEIZAI SHAMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week Japan's Nikkei _ the stock index that takes its name
from the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the country's leading financial
newspaper _ fell almost 9 percent. Now normally it's a mistake to
read too much meaning into the fluctuations of this or any other
market index (especially because the index was revised to include
more tech stocks just in time for the big tech slump). If the 30
percent rise in the Nikkei between June and April didn't foretell a
real turnaround in Japan _ which it didn't _ then the 15 percent
decline since April doesn't necessarily predict a new recession.
But in this case the stock plunge is telling us something: Namely,
that the economic strategy of Japan's government is falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, uniquely among the world's major nations, has managed to
recreate 1930s economics at the dawn of the 21st century. Much of
the nation's huge productive capacity remains unused because
consumers and businesses just don't spend enough. And the usual
answer to a demand-side slump, reducing interest rates, hasn't
worked: The Bank of Japan has cut the equivalent of the Fed funds
rate all the way to zero, and yet the economy remains depressed.
</P>
<P>
   True, Japan has avoided full-scale depression. Deficit spending,
on a scale no nation at peace has ever tried before, has kept the
economy afloat. But such huge budget deficits cannot be sustained
indefinitely; so the central question for Japanese policy is, What
will allow the economy to come off fiscal life support?
</P>
<P>
   Western economists, including me, have urged Japan to supplement
deficit spending with an aggressive monetary policy: The Bank of
Japan, on this view, should both pump money into markets and
promise that the grinding deflation of recent years will be
replaced with moderate inflation. But the BOJ has not only refused
to act; its governor has repeatedly indicated that he intends to
raise interest rates as soon as possible. So what's the plan?
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials _ unembarrassed by a long history of
prematurely declaring economic victory _ talk breezily about
``self-sustaining recovery.'' That's a hope, not a policy. All that
deficit spending could, in principle, ``jump start'' private
demand, producing a recovery of consumer and business confidence so
large that the economy would keep growing even when the government
spending ended; but that's a very speculative prospect, and a
steady drumbeat of adverse economic reports leaves no reason at all
to believe that it's happening. (One friend likens the
determination of Japanese officials and bullish investment analysts
to downplay the consistent bad news to that of the knight in
``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' who remains belligerent even as
one limb after another gets hacked off: ``Just a flesh wound!'')
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, Japan optimists have had a new answer to the
naysayers: technology! Any day now, they say, the new economy is
going to arrive in Japan, generating not just a surge in
productivity, but a surge in demand. Businesses will start spending
trillions of yen on new equipment; individual investors, made
wealthy by the soaring prices of technology companies, will start
spending on luxury goods; and the time of troubles will be over.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the falling Nikkei is such an ominous omen.
Mainly it reflects the ``Nasdaq effect'' _ the worldwide decline in
technology exuberance over the last two months. But whereas the
United States didn't need that exuberance _ in fact, the decline in
tech stocks has made the Fed's job easier, by turning down the
flame under our overheated economy _ Japan was counting on
technology to save it from stagnation. As good as Japanese
technology may be _ and much of it is very good indeed _ the
prospect that technology will rescue Japan's economy is now
receding. Instead, the country is right back where it started: with
an economic malaise that shows no sign of going into spontaneous
remission, whose symptoms are mitigated only by deficit spending
that cannot continue at these levels. Meanwhile another year has
gone by, and the mountain of government debt has gotten 30 trillion
yen or so higher.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad story, which carries a moral for us all: Technology
is not a magic elixir. The Internet, mobile phones and all that are
exciting and important, but those who count on them to solve all
their problems are likely to be disappointed.

COMMENTARY: GEISHA BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rudy Giuliani's personal life is not yet as weird
as Angelina Jolie's, but it's getting there.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's meltdown has been fast and furious and sad.
</P>
<P>
   The man who never hesitated to shame others has been shamed. The
righteous politician who saw the world in polarized black and white
has dissolved in a puddle of grays. The Senate candidate who sent
out a fund-raising letter two weeks ago warning that Hillary
Clinton would ``destroy our traditional values'' has been caught,
like so many other Republicans lately, with his values down.
</P>
<P>
   I know there are a lot of burning political questions here. But
I want to put them aside for a moment, and ask a more human
question: Why are men so beastly?
</P>
<P>
   The whole New York Senate race has been driven by the insatiable
need of powerful men to be adored by women other than their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary was propelled into the race after her husband was caught
cavorting with a young office aide (in addition to admitting
another liaison).
</P>
<P>
   Rudy may be propelled out of the race after his wife accused him
of cavorting with a young office aide (in addition to admitting
another liaison).
</P>
<P>
   So Bill humiliates Hillary and makes her sympathetic enough to
run against Rudy. Then Rudy humiliates Donna. Then Donna humiliates
Rudy and makes him too unsympathetic to run against Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   And Newt, the man who wanted to humiliate Bill with impeachment
for having an affair with a young office worker, was at the same
time humiliating his second wife, Marianne, with a young office
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gingrich and his soon-to-be third wife, Callista
Bisek, 34, registered online for wedding booty, listing more than
$14,000 in items, from a $298 Waterford decanter to a $2.50 chef's
spoon.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican definition of family values can be found at a
Web site where ``Macy's celebrates the wedding of Callista Bisek
and Newt Gingrich.'' Well-wishers can e-mail the happy couple.
(Felicitations, you roly-poly hypocrite ...)
</P>
<P>
   When Hillary, Donna and Marianne began using their marriages to
powerful men as a platform for striking out on their own, they did
not come home to husbands supportive of their new ventures. They
came home to find their husbands curled up with a good office
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   I asked a woman in New York politics who knows Giuliani well why
such a seeming straight arrow became a Lothario. Donna Hanover was
his trophy wife, a pretty woman with a career, a good mother, a
political asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed to be adored,'' my friend replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to look at him adoringly,'' I persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna was more of an equal,'' my friend explained patiently.
``He needed to be adored by women who were more in awe of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy has always been a charismatic, drink-the-Kool-Aid sort of a
leader. You're either with him or you're gone. And many are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Women have spent decades striving to be equal. And men, as we've
learned from the cascading sex scandals in D.C. and New York, still
have a hard time with equal.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids have been digging up pictures showing the mayor's
new girlfriend, Judi Nathan, walking five paces behind him at the
St. Patrick's Day parade and on New Year's Eve. Rudy actually looks
happy walking as Eastern potentates do, consort trailing
respectfully behind.
</P>
<P>
   Women have always feared that when they grow powerful, men lose
interest. Male power, of course, is an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   As women command businesses and dot-coms, many men in the public
eye seem to be reverting to a '50s fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a geisha syndrome,'' said a Democratic strategist.
``These guys all want to come home, have their necks rubbed, have
their slippers handed to them, and be told what big, virile men
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women who went to see last weekend's City Center production
of the Bernstein, Comden and Green musical, ``Wonderful Town,''
found the retro lyrics of ``100 Easy Ways (to lose a man)''
disturbingly up-to-date:
</P>
<P>
   ``A splendid way to lose a man.
</P>
<P>
   Just throw your knowledge in his face,
</P>
<P>
   He'll never try for second base.''

   They say necessity is the mother of invention, but desperation
can also be its source. In Colombia, a government frustrated by its
inability to end three decades of warfare with two major guerrilla
insurgencies is now seeking peace by granting both movements one of
the things they crave most: uncontested territory they can call
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not without logic, though its many critics contend
that the logic is deeply flawed. The idea was that pulling troops
out of what were already rebel strongholds could create an
atmosphere of good will in peace talks. But that hasn't really
happened so far, and so the effect has been somewhat different:
Colombia has formally recognized that it doesn't exercise full
sovereignty over all its territory.
</P>
<P>
   That has left the two zones a kind of never-never land where it
is not clear who is in charge or how the zones fit into the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing, in a sense, the hollowing-out of government in
critical regions of Latin America and its replacement by
individuals who are, in fact, introducing a narco-government, a
small narco-empire,'' said Peter Romero, the State Department's
senior official for Latin American affairs, last week.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of these two insurgent-controlled areas began 18
months ago, when the government ceded 16,000 square miles to
Colombia's largest guerrilla group, known as the FARC, in an effort
to jump-start peace talks. But the talks have faltered, and the
FARC has only become more powerful. It acts increasingly like a
parallel government and is now planning a ``peace tax'' on wealthy
people and companies in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move also left Colombia's other big rebel
group, known as the ELN, intensely jealous. So the group began a
sabotage and kidnapping campaign, to which President Andres
Pastrana responded last month by agreeing to concede it a second
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America has had its share of insurgencies, but even at the
height of the Central American civil wars of the 1980s there was
never an arrangement quite like this. Guerrillas exercised de facto
control of parts of El Salvador and Contras ranged freely over
northern Nicaragua, but they certainly did not do so with the
consent of the governments they were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concession has not gone over well with ordinary
Colombians, especially those who must live in the area that is to
become a haven for the ELN, or Army of National Liberation. In
February and March, residents blocked highways to protest the plan,
pointing to the creation of the earlier guerrilla safe zone as a
naive experiment gone totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As originally envisioned in the agreement with the FARC, or
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, only soldiers and police
were to be withdrawn from the so-called zone of disarmament, which
is larger than Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island
combined. But the FARC eventually drove mayors, judges,
prosecutors, tax collectors and priests out, implanting its own
authority _ and inviting in coca producers.
</P>
<P>
   So in all but name, the first demilitarized zone is now an
entity beyond the Colombian state's control. Hence the sardonic
nickname given it by its 60,000 residents: Farclandia. Passengers
landing at the airport in San Vicente del Caguan have their
passports and luggage inspected by rebels; guerrillas staff the
city hall and residents have to deal with them when they need
police protection or a road paved.
</P>
<P>
   The ``zone of encounter'' that is now to be handed over to the
ELN is barely one-tenth the size of the FARC zone, or roughly the
size of Delaware, but its location is much more strategic. So the
dent in Colombian sovereignty may be just as great, even though
this time Pastrana has promised that all civil authorities in the
area ``will continue in the exercise of their functions,'' and
international observers will be allowed in to assure that the ELN
is honoring the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's action is all the more surprising given the
importance that Latin American governments traditionally attach to
the concept of national sovereignty. To maintain the notion
untarnished, countries like Mexico and Venezuela, for example, have
turned down offers of U.S. assistance after natural disasters, and
Chile's government, though full of officials who were persecuted
while Chile was under military rule, repeatedly cited sovereignty
in demanding that Britain release Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   But historical experience also says that sovereignty is one of
those ideas, like the rule of law or military subordination to
civilians, that is more honored in the breach than in practice in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia's case, sovereignty in remote areas often consists
of little more than a flag and a national anthem. Guerrillas and
drug traffickers can move into areas like Caqueta and Putumayo
precisely because the state has never bothered _ or been able _ to
build roads, schools or hospitals there, and the forlorn, neglected
peasants there feel only the most tenuous of connections to the
authorities back in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian state is scarcely alone in failing to back up
assertions of sovereignty with meaningful actions. Many residents
of the area in the heart of the Amazon, where Colombia, Peru and
Brazil share a border, carry the identity cards of all three
countries and use their currencies interchangeably, as if the
frontier did not exist. None of those countries, however, has a
history of reliably supplying services like medical care and
education there; for these, citizens have had to depend on
missionaries.

AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA: A PRESIDENT MISAPPREHENDS A KILLER

<P>
   The tone and substance of the letter was so peculiar that some
officials in Washington thought it was a hoax. In a five-page
letter to President Clinton last month, South Africa's president,
Thabo Mbeki, argued that his country had to chart its own course in
dealing with AIDS, including consulting those who challenged
prevailing views on the causes and treatments of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A ``campaign of intellectual intimidation and terrorism'' akin
to ``medieval book-burning'' was keeping such voices from being
heard, Mbeki wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was no hoax, and it touched off an uproar, in part
because South Africa's democratic politics and advanced industry
make it the natural leader in the fight against a disease that has
devastated Africa. This status was acknowledged in the nation's
selection to sponsor this year's international AIDS conference. Yet
here was Nelson Mandela's anointed successor questioning many years
of scientific research. Never mind that Mandela hardly mentioned
the disease during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, many South Africans have engaged in a kind
of psychoanalysis of the 57-year-old president they elected last
year. Why did this cultured man, educated as an economist at Sussex
University in England, take such a position? What does he gain from
it?
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is the only African leader to have questioned the
consensus theory on AIDS. He has, moreover, an embattled history
with the disease, having first become embroiled in the scientific
debate three years ago, when Mandela's cabinet backed research into
Virodene, a supposed cure developed locally that turned out to be
carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
   Attacked by scientists, the health minister in Mandela's
government, which Mbeki was virtually running, refused to back
down, and it later turned out that stock in the company set up to
make Virodene had been given to the ruling African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Virodene was discredited long before Mbeki began publicly
questioning the causes of AIDS, so there seems little reason to
believe that led to his present position. But it helped create the
ill-will that exists between the scientific establishment and the
ANC.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mbeki stunned experts by questioning the safety of
the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT, which the government has declined
to distribute to pregnant women despite studies indicating that it
could greatly reduce the transmission of the virus to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AIDS activists are shocked by Mbeki's refusal to accept
the standard scientific model of the disease. Political analysts,
meanwhile, say they can see little political gain for him or for
his party (which took 66 percent of the vote in the 1999 elections)
in his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Most see it as a personal decision from a man who, since his
teens, has lived largely in exile, petitioning world leaders to
help fight apartheid. They say that Mbeki's desire to reject
Western thinking _ and condescension _ is strong, and his speeches
have repeatedly called for an African renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very keen on doing things in an African way and not just
accepting the gospel from the West,'' said Raymond Louw, editor of
the weekly newsletter Southern Africa Report. ``You hear this all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wishful thinking about a cheap cure may also have played a part,
some say, since South Africa isn't nearly rich enough to afford
$15,000 AIDS cocktails, (or even $3,000 ones, if drug companies cut
prices, as they indicated they might last week) for the 13 percent
of the population that is infected.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that Mbeki simply couldn't help himself. He has
repeatedly displayed a stubborn inclination to master technical
issues in his own way, and in a highly personal speech recently he
told of Internet searches with dictionaries at his side as he
looked for information that might help him formulate his country's
AIDS policies.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his current approach _ convening a ``What Causes AIDS?''
panel divided between orthodox AIDS researchers and those who
believe it is caused by malnutrition and parasites _ will help or
hurt his country is an open question. Heading the panel of 33
experts is William Makgoba, who runs South Africa's equivalent of
the National Institute of Health. Makgoba strongly supports the
standard model of AIDS, but said that bringing the dissidents
``into the tent'' will be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Makgoba believes Mbeki to be a ``very intellectual person'' who
is trying to inform himself on a disease that is ravaging his
country. He wishes, however, that Mbeki had informed himself in
private, fearing that he will be classified ``as one of those
African leaders who doesn't care about science or technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lodge, a professor of political science at the University of
Witwatersrand, says that Mbeki shows the personality traits of what
he calls ``an interferer, not a delegater.'' It is a trait that has
come up in other arenas as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lodge pointed out, Mbeki is shuttling back and
forth to Zimbabwe, trying to ease the tensions over the violence
that has broken out as supporters of President Robert Mugabe have
seized white-owned farms. But Lodge said Mbeki should let his
foreign minister do the traveling. ``He is running up to Harare
every two minutes like an office boy,'' Lodge said. ``The AIDS
issue is the same. Maybe he will learn the lesson that a head of
state does not busy himself with details.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CHANGING IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After so many years of watching him miniaturized on TV and,
occasionally, life-sized at courtside, I prepared to flinch as he
thundered toward me Kong-sized on the huge Imax screen in the
opening scene of ``Michael Jordan to the Max.'' But then,
curiously, just before contact, the camera changed its point of
view, circling Michael, then rising above him. Interesting, flashy,
but ultimately disappointing. Once again, we didn't get close.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those gasping for just another whiff of Airness, this
documercial seems earthbound, slick and bland. Maybe Michael was,
after all, just about a few expensive thrills, now fading in rerun
without the drama of winning and losing. The film seems
particularly empty compared with the recent PBS documentary on Joe
DiMaggio, which was brilliant and dark, and the latest flurry of
reinterpretations of Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   We still know nothing about Michael. Which, of course, may be
enough. Posed on a stool in the middle of an empty basketball
court, he talks glibly about the pain of being cut from his high
school team; it was the trauma that drove him. He offers sound
advice; make sure kids learn to love the game first, and, always,
try. He says he is grateful that he had his dad, who was murdered,
for 32 years, because so many grow up with no dads at all.
</P>
<P>
   That's about it for up close and personal. The highlight reel
has the winning shots and the best commercials with Spike Lee. The
music is heroic movie sound, very little NBA anthem hip-hop here.
Commissioner David Stern utters the benediction: ``Globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   And the last words we hear, from Michael, are fit for a
hero-prophet: ``There will be a player greater than me.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do you expect for $9.50? Even the steak sauce at the
memorabilia shop at his pricey Grand Central Terminal restaurant is
$6 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 45-minute film, Bob Greene, the Chicago columnist
and Jordanologist, cites one reason for Michael's competitive
ferocity _ he doesn't want to disappoint that one person in the
audience who might never have seen him before. This is a vanity
often attributed to Joe DiMaggio, another fierce competitor who
never seemed to stand for much more than performance and cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Written and narrated by the DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben
Cramer, with telling insights by the sportswriter Maury Allen, this
90-minute chapter in the ``American Experience'' series is a cold
look at the hollowness of ``The Hero's Life.'' A former Yankee
teammate, Jerry Coleman, without apparent affection, calls DiMaggio
``a giant'' in the game, but admits he isn't sure why. A friend of
Marilyn Monroe's, Brad Dexter (my favorite gunslinger in my
favorite western, ``The Magnificent Seven''), describes DiMaggio as
justifiably tortured with guilt because he, as much as anyone else,
contributed to her deadly overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Mean, petty, spiteful, insecure, Joltin' Joe may also have been
a wife-beater. He had little to do with his only child, Joe Jr.,
who had his own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life, according to the documentary,
DiMaggio earned $250,000 for two days at card shows. It isn't steak
sauce, but it adds up.
</P>
<P>
   Some icons are reinterpreted every generation. Ali seems to get
a fresh look every five years or so. In two recently published
books, he is portrayed as an overhyped clown and as the most
important sports figure of last century.
</P>
<P>
   In Nick Tosches' ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' (Little, Brown),
Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali is described as ``tiresome drably
colorful'' and ``the darling of a white intelligentsia who sought
meaning and metaphor in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Liston, ``the most unconquerable of heavyweight boxers enslaved
by the forces of darkness,'' tanked both fights against Ali for the
mob, according to Tosches, although Ali never knew because ``the
main burden of making the fix look real'' is carried by ``the
preordained winner.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight: Cassius Clay vs. The United
States of America,'' (M. Evans), Ali's best friend, the
photographer Howard Bingham, and Max Wallace advance the case that
Ali's refusal to be drafted during the Vietnam War was a pivotal
moment in American history. It stiffened the resolve of other
protesters and was a catalyst for further change.
</P>
<P>
   The background music to this boomlet is being written by John
Duffy, composer of the opera ``Muhammad Ali,'' scenes from which
were showcased last week by the New York City Opera. Not to be too
coy, I am writing the libretto.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville will begin a
national campaign next month to raise $60 million for its
riverfront site and its school outreach programs on tolerance and
conflict resolution. The state of Kentucky has already budgeted $10
million, and there is $10 million from private donors, according to
Barry Alberts, the project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there could be a few bucks in there for Jim Thorpe. In her
latest public-relations sortie, his daughter, the indomitable Grace
Thorpe, has recruited Anna McKibben, the 10th National Indian
U.S.A. (Quapaw tribe of Oklahoma), to campaign for Thorpe's picture
on a Wheaties box. Jim mesmerized the globe at the Stockholm
Olympics in 1912, long before globalization.
</P>
<P>
   A dark documentary, a perennial re-evaluation, cereal fame, none
of these may be in Michael's future. He and his agents seem to have
shut the lid on his image box. History will get the highlight reel,
which may be all there is anyway.  &QL;

   It may take a village to raise a child, but a family still ought
to be able to afford one. It now costs about $160,140 to raise a
middle-class child through age 17, according to the Department of
Agriculture's annual report, ``Expenditures on Children by
Families.'' That's up from $25,229 in 1960 and $69,333 in 1980,
seemingly a huge increase. But that 1960 figure, adjusted for
inflation, would equal $141,998 today, so in fact, the cost of
bringing up baby has risen only about 13 percent since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Housing has always been the biggest single expense, these days
making up about a third of the cost of rearing a child, just as it
did 40 years ago. But many other expenditures have changed since
then.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, for example, child care was a tiny subcategory lumped
into overall housing costs. In the 1970s, however, as mothers of
young children poured into the work force, child care expenditures
shot up. By the 1980s, child care and education were given their
own category, which now comprises an average 10 percent of expenses
for preteens. Education costs _ school supplies, books and tuition
_ have risen, too. They now account for 8 percent of family
spending on teen-agers, up from only 2 percent in 1960. A large
proportion of that increase is likely due to spending on private
schools, according to Mark Lino, the Agriculture Department
economist responsible for the report.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs, 4 percent of the total in 1960, are now at 7
percent, having risen sharply in the last 10 years. Food and
clothing, by contrast, haven't fallen as a percentage of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   Single-parent families spend about as much on each of their
children as much as two-parent families, by using a greater share
of their income for their children. And across all income strata,
families with a single child lavish about a third more on that
child than families with three or more children spend on each of
theirs. The rich spend about half again as much on food, clothes
and health care than the poor, and more than twice as much on
housing, child care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Costs are highest in in Western cities, lowest in rural areas
and Midwestern cities. And as every parent finds out, older
children cost more than younger ones: child care costs go down, but
not enough to make up for all the extra food, clothes, and video
games.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-income baby born last year, incidentally, will have
cost $236,680 by the year 2016, the Department of Agriculture
estimates. But don't worry, that's not adjusted for inflation. Keep
in mind, however, that even after college bills are paid, almost
half of all parents in their fifties are still supporting their
over-21 children.

<P>
   Millenarians, mark your calendars. Wednesday, May 17, may be the
last chance for the destruction of planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Y2K was a bust. For all the headaches caused by
computers choking on the double zeros of the new century,
civilization remained stubbornly intact. The millennial leap year
on Feb. 29 was also supposed to create computer havoc. But that too
was a disappointment, as was May 5, when Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn lined up with the moon and sun, promising, for
the scientifically impaired, calamitous gravitational effects on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   With the Year 2000 almost half over, the opportunities for a
millennial end time are narrowing. In fact, the last big chance may
come this Wednesday, when there will be another planetary
alignment. This time the sun and five planets (but not the moon)
will form an even tighter grouping than they did earlier in the
month.
</P>
<P>
   If anything calamitous does happen, it will not be explainable
by physics. For one thing, these alignments are far from exact:
Next week's is really a clustering within a 19-degree arc of the
sky. But even a perfect alignment would be no cause for alarm.
Gravity weakens so rapidly with distance that the tug exerted on
Earth by all nine planets is vastly less than that of the moon. And
in this month's celestial events, the planets are lining up on the
far side of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the planets on the opposite side of the sun,'' reassured
a NASA Web site (nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/alignment.html),
``the force from each body will actually be at its absolute
minimum.'' And with the sun in the way, astronomers will not even
be treated to a good celestial show.
</P>
<P>
   The real action is not in the sky but on the Internet, where a
smattering of sites are devoted to the astrological, biblical and
monetary possibilities of the nonevent.
</P>
<P>
   A business called the Survival Center has a Web page, ``Earth
Changes Update'' (www.zyz.com/survivalcenter/echange.html), that
warns of earthquakes, tidal waves and winds as intense as 2,000 mph
_ perfect conditions for hawking its supply of gasoline generators,
solar radios and six-day candles. The site also sells a book titled
``5/5/2000 Ice: The Ultimate Disaster,'' in which the author,
Richard Noone, predicted that the alignment would cause the poles
to melt, unleashing a flood of Noachian proportions.
</P>
<P>
   All this may sound familiar to those who remember ``The Jupiter
Effect,'' a 1974 book in which two scientists, John R. Gribbin and
Stephen Plagemann, forecast that a planetary alignment in 1982
would upset the sun, setting off a complex chain of events that
would result in a devastating California earthquake. ``There is no
question about the implication,'' the authors wrote, evoking the
hit tune ``Age of Aquarius'': ``In 1982 `when the Moon is in the
Seventh House, and Jupiter aligns with Mars' and with the other
seven planets of the Solar System, Los Angeles will be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was followed by a sequel: ``The Jupiter Effect
Reconsidered.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Roman Catholics in New York began to take the measure
of their next archbishop, Edward M. Egan, who has been bishop of
Bridgeport, Conn., for more than a decade. At a press conference
Thursday, hours after the Vatican announced the appointment, the
archbishop-designate showed himself to be multilingual, answering
questions in English, Italian and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Egan comes to his new post with a reputation as an effective
administrator and fund-raiser. But another way to view the bishop's
selection is from the perspective of the appointments made by Pope
John Paul II. Simply put, the pontiff has reshaped the U.S. church
hierarchy as perhaps none of his predecessors has. He has filled
vacancy after vacancy with men who share his own vision of how the
church should be run _ and not just in the United States, but in
other parts of the world as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The process has been gradual, but its effect has been profound.
John Paul, moreover, has begun a second round of appointments,
selecting prelates to succeed bishops he himself once appointed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, in his 11th year as pope, John Paul had chosen leaders
for the archdioceses of Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los
Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington; these archbishops
traditionally become cardinals. In the 11 years since, he has
repeated the process, with Cardinal Adam Maida in Detroit
succeeding Cardinal Edmund Szoka, who was chosen in 1981; Cardinal
Francis George in Chicago replacing the late Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin, appointed in 1982; and now Egan in New York succeeding
the late Cardinal John O'Connor, appointed in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul may go on to select new archbishops for Philadelphia
and Washington, to succeed Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who was
appointed in 1988, and Cardinal James Hickey, a 1980 appointment.
Both men are long past the official church retirement age of 75.
The pope has also named new archbishops for major sees like
Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of appointments, the Rev. David M.
O'Connell, president of the Catholic University of America, in
Washington, said John Paul II has ``had the most influence of any
pope in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Longevity has helped. Elected in 1978 at a relatively youthful
58, John Paul II, who turns 80 on Thursday, has reigned longer than
any other 20th-century pope _ longer than all but six of his 261
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   But more than simply benefiting from a long life, John Paul II
has demonstrated that he knows which characteristics he wants in
the men in the front ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Taken individually, the current crop of U.S. cardinals are known
for various strengths. Chicago's George, for example, is highly
regarded as an intellectual; Cardinal William Keeler in Baltimore
is considered a leader in ecumenical relations.
</P>
<P>
   But the cardinals share important, basic qualities. They are
``doctrinally steadfast,'' thoroughly loyal to the Vatican, said
Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology and Catholic
studies at Georgetown University in Washington. ``I think there's a
premium put on obedience to Rome, particularly for cardinals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they are not inclined to innovation. In 1980, the pope
warned some of the Latin American bishops against embracing
political ideas arising from liberation theology, which states a
preference for the poor. Speaking in Mexico that year, he said
church leaders must safeguard ``the purity of doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the U.S. bishops are more cautious than they were 15
years ago, when the National Conference of Catholic Bishops engaged
in sweeping pastoral letters on such broad and highly charged
topics as war and peace, and American capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see no moves by the bishops to write a major pastoral
letter,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine
America, who is an authority on the bishops' conference. ``They
passed Ex Corde Ecclesia the way the Vatican wanted it,'' he said,
referring to a long-discussed document on the relationship between
Catholic colleges and the church hierarchy, adopted by the bishops
last November. It contained a controversial provision that will
require theologians to obtain a mandate from their local bishop
certifying that what they are teaching is fully within church
doctrine. ``The new generation of bishops,'' Reese said, ``is not
going to argue with the Vatican on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That new generation will be leading the church for some years.
(It is a group of prelates that in the United States remains
overwhelmingly white, even as recent immigration has made the
people in the pews more ethnically diverse, a change that will take
some time to make itself more apparent in the hierarchy.)
</P>
<P>
   Reese, who studies appointments to the College of Cardinals in
Rome, said that more than 90 percent of its voting members _ the
prelates under age 80 _ owe their status to John Paul II. The
120-member body will select his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``His influence will not end with his death,'' Gillis said.
``His influence will go on for a number of years after his
papacy.''

   Last week, Roman Catholics in New York began to take the measure
of their next archbishop, Edward M. Egan, who has been bishop of
Bridgeport, Conn., for more than a decade. At a press conference
Thursday, hours after the Vatican announced the appointment, the
archbishop-designate showed himself to be multilingual, answering
questions in English, Italian and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Egan comes to his new post with a reputation as an effective
administrator and fund-raiser. But another way to view the bishop's
selection is from the perspective of the appointments made by Pope
John Paul II. Simply put, the pontiff has reshaped the U.S. church
hierarchy as perhaps none of his predecessors has. He has filled
vacancy after vacancy with men who share his own vision of how the
church should be run _ and not just in the United States, but in
other parts of the world as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The process has been gradual, but its effect has been profound.
John Paul, moreover, has begun a second round of appointments,
selecting prelates to succeed bishops he himself once appointed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, in his 11th year as pope, John Paul had chosen leaders
for the archdioceses of Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los
Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington; these archbishops
traditionally become cardinals. In the 11 years since, he has
repeated the process, with Cardinal Adam Maida in Detroit
succeeding Cardinal Edmund Szoka, who was chosen in 1981; Cardinal
Francis George in Chicago replacing the late Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin, appointed in 1982; and now Egan in New York succeeding
the late Cardinal John O'Connor, appointed in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul may go on to select new archbishops for Philadelphia
and Washington, to succeed Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who was
appointed in 1988, and Cardinal James Hickey, a 1980 appointment.
Both men are long past the official church retirement age of 75.
The pope has also named new archbishops for major sees like
Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of appointments, the Rev. David M.
O'Connell, president of the Catholic University of America, in
Washington, said John Paul II has ``had the most influence of any
pope in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Longevity has helped. Elected in 1978 at a relatively youthful
58, John Paul II, who turns 80 on Thursday, has reigned longer than
any other 20th-century pope _ longer than all but six of his 261
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   But more than simply benefiting from a long life, John Paul II
has demonstrated that he knows which characteristics he wants in
the men in the front ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Taken individually, the current crop of U.S. cardinals are known
for various strengths. Chicago's George, for example, is highly
regarded as an intellectual; Cardinal William Keeler in Baltimore
is considered a leader in ecumenical relations.
</P>
<P>
   But the cardinals share important, basic qualities. They are
``doctrinally steadfast,'' thoroughly loyal to the Vatican, said
Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology and Catholic
studies at Georgetown University in Washington. ``I think there's a
premium put on obedience to Rome, particularly for cardinals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they are not inclined to innovation. In 1980, the pope
warned some of the Latin American bishops against embracing
political ideas arising from liberation theology, which states a
preference for the poor. Speaking in Mexico that year, he said
church leaders must safeguard ``the purity of doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the U.S. bishops are more cautious than they were 15
years ago, when the National Conference of Catholic Bishops engaged
in sweeping pastoral letters on such broad and highly charged
topics as war and peace, and American capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see no moves by the bishops to write a major pastoral
letter,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine
America, who is an authority on the bishops' conference. ``They
passed Ex Corde Ecclesia the way the Vatican wanted it,'' he said,
referring to a long-discussed document on the relationship between
Catholic colleges and the church hierarchy, adopted by the bishops
last November. It contained a controversial provision that will
require theologians to obtain a mandate from their local bishop
certifying that what they are teaching is fully within church
doctrine. ``The new generation of bishops,'' Reese said, ``is not
going to argue with the Vatican on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That new generation will be leading the church for some years.
(It is a group of prelates that in the United States remains
overwhelmingly white, even as recent immigration has made the
people in the pews more ethnically diverse, a change that will take
some time to make itself more apparent in the hierarchy.)
</P>
<P>
   Reese, who studies appointments to the College of Cardinals in
Rome, said that more than 90 percent of its voting members _ the
prelates under age 80 _ owe their status to John Paul II. The
120-member body will select his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``His influence will not end with his death,'' Gillis said.
``His influence will go on for a number of years after his
papacy.''

(REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING) 
 A TWO-MONTH OLD FUND, CARRYING A BIG STICK 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATE BERRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most mutual funds keep their distance from companies on matters
of corporate governance, but the $3 million Allied Owners Action
fund, introduced on March 10, jumps in with both feet.
</P>
<P>
   Its goal is to buy shares of companies with underperforming
assets or subpar management, then to lobby for change _ helped by a
network of investors called to arms through a companion Web site,
eRaider.com.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, the fund posted its first target on the site:
Employee Solutions of Phoenix, a staff leasing firm in which the
fund had acquired a 5 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The raid may already have had an effect on the company,
according to Aaron Brown, president of Privateer Asset Management,
which oversees both the fund and the Web site: On May 5, Employee
Solutions announced that Quentin Smith, its president, chief
executive and chairman, would relinquish the chairman's position.
The move was one of several supported by Privateer, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is also clamoring for changes to a management
restructuring plan. And it wants a separate shareholder vote on a
new contract for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Employee Solutions, James Donnelly, declined to
comment last week about the restructuring or the fund's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had 1999 sales of $938.9 million, was once a
hot stock. In 1996, it was rated as one of America's best small
companies by Forbes magazine. Shares hit a weekly high of $28.375
in February 1997; they now are at 43 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Employee Solutions ran into problems because of skyrocketing
workers' compensation rates and a growth-by-acquisition strategy
that saddled it with debt. The current management took charge in
1998; by then, the shares had tumbled into penny-stock territory.
It posted a loss of $56.1 million last year, and on April 20, its
auditor, said the company might not be able to continue as a going
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who says he has been in discussions with Smith on the
proposed restructuring, describes his dealings with Employee
Solutions as amicable. ``They have treated us from the beginning as
a large investor and someone who communicates honestly with
shareholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One area of disagreement: According to Brown, management would
prefer to gain concessions from holders of the company's $85
million in debt, including forbearance on interest payments, and
seek a capital injection from outside investors once its stock
price has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, for his part, said he would prefer raising capital now to
extinguish the debt, even if it diluted the value of existing
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he wants an independent party to render a fairness
opinion on both the restructuring and Smith's contract _ and has
not ruled out a proxy fight. He says he is in contact with
shareholders who _ together with his fund's position _ control
about one-quarter of Employee Solutions' shares.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Employee Solutions hired a new auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is upbeat about the raid. ``This has already been a
success, because we've taken a process that was behind closed doors
and we've made it transparent,'' he said. And he will continue to
be busy: The fund, which is down 2.7 percent since its start, has
investments in five other companies, whose identities it has not
yet disclosed.

<P>
   Much has been made of the National Basketball Association's
post-Michael Jordan blues, epitomized by financially troubled
franchises, declining television ratings, a rash of empty seats at
regular season games and overly drawn-out playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cassandras bemoan the current state of a league
that does, after all, generate over a billion dollars in revenue,
the Basketball Hall of Fame is considering the inclusion of a
long-forgotten Italian immigrant bowling-alley proprietor from
Syracuse, N.Y., who saved the game when it was  &UR; really &LR;  in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1953-54 season, the future of the five-year
old NBA was very much in doubt. The game's biggest star, George
Mikan, had retired, and attendance was falling sharply in a league
that had dwindled to nine teams from 17 just five years earlier.
Making matters worse was the increasing tendency of teams to slow
down the game to protect leads or prevent more talented opponents
from getting the ball. The final score of one game in 1950 was
19-18, and it wasn't uncommon for a team to pass the ball around
for five minutes before taking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball, which after all was in the entertainment
business, had committed a mortal sin: It had become boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things went from bad to worse,'' said Maurice Podoloff, the
league commissioner at the time. ``The games were interminable.
Attendance was suffering. We were in a desperate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Danny Biasone, the feisty owner of the Syracuse Nationals.
Biasone had emigrated from Sicily in 1918, when he was 10 years
old, and by 1946 he owned a bowling alley and a liquor store in
Syracuse. Biasone, a self-described sports nut, got so upset when
the nearby Rochester Royals allegedly refused to play a game in
Syracuse that he vowed to get the city its own pro basketball team.
Which he promptly did, procuring a franchise from the National
Basketball League in 1946 for the grand sum of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The players became part of Biasone's family. His wife cooked
pasta and laundered uniforms for the young men, who had to hold
down other jobs in the off-season to make ends meet. In Syracuse,
they hung out at Biasone's blue-collar bowling alley. On the road
they took long bus and train rides to play in smoky arenas with
names like ``The Tub of Blood,'' where hostile fans would shake the
basket while the players were shooting and occasionally run out on
the floor to slug them with pocketbooks or bare fists.
</P>
<P>
   Biasone loved it all, and couldn't bear to see his beloved Nats,
now in the NBA, go under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew fans weren't paying to see the ball being dribbled
around all night,'' he said in an interview in the mid-1980s. ``So
I went to those fellas in the league and said I'm having a tough
time selling something here. There's one thing basketball needs, I
said. It needs a time. I don't care what the time is. Put in a
time!''
</P>
<P>
   The other owners were skeptical. But Biasone won them over in
August 1954 when he invited them to Syracuse to watch his idea in
action. On a hot and humid afternoon at Biasone's alma mater,
Vocational High School, the future Hall-of-Famer Dolph Schayes and
other local players played the first game in which each team had to
shoot the ball within 24 seconds or lose possession.
</P>
<P>
   Biasone started yelling at them if the clock got down to five
seconds, while NBA patriarchs like Ned Irish of the New York Knicks
and Walter Brown of the Boston Celtics saw the future of the game
unfold before them as the players streaked up and down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The league instituted the 24-second rule that fall, scoring
soared and the pro game was revived. (The Syracuse Nats also won
their first and only championship that season).
</P>
<P>
   ``The adoption of the clock was the most important event in the
NBA,'' Podoloff said, ``and Danny Biasone is the most important man
in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he sold the Syracuse Nats to a group of Philadelphia
businessmen in 1963 for $500,000, Biasone languished in obscurity.
He continued to run the neighborhood bowling alley until his death
30 years later, and, despite several nominations, was never voted
into the Basketball Hall of Fame. His supporters hope that
historical neglect will be rectified next week, however, when the
Hall of Fame, which is once again reviewing Biasone's
contributions, announces the newest members of the league's
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   And why 24 seconds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we were averaging about 60 shots a game per team,''
Biasone said. ``If each team used up 24 seconds for a shot, they
would average 60 shots. But the exact number wasn't important. My
idea was to keep the game going, to speed it up.''

 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the annals of bureaucratic slip-ups, this one was a beaut.
Last December, an obscure government agency known as the European
Patent Office mistakenly issued the first patent to allow the
cloning of a human being. More alarmingly, critics say, it may have
granted scientists the right to change the genetic makeup of the
entire human species.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, issued in Munich, Germany, is No. EP-0695351B1. It
gives its holder, the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, the sole
right to make, use and sell human beings created in its laboratory.
The university has the legal right, at least for the next 20 years,
to prevent competitors in 19 European countries from copying its
techniques without paying the university a fee.
</P>
<P>
   True, the University of Edinburgh, where Darwin once studied,
intended none of this _ it wanted only to patent certain laboratory
methods that may prove useful in fighting diseases like
Parkinson's. The patent office intended none of this, either _
someone forgot to require the correct legal disclaimers during
nearly six years of patent review. Greenpeace, the environmental
group, discovered the flawed patent and mounted a noisy protest in
February, after which the office acknowledged its error.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are no reported techniques for producing people
(except for the time-honored one) and even if there were, European
research rules ban human cloning. If renegade Scottish scientists
chose to clone humans anyway, the scientists would presumably be
arrested under anti-slavery laws.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever anyone did or did not do, this case of ``Brave New
World'' meets the Marx Brothers will not be untangled anytime soon.
The appeals process for overturning the 1999 patent is sure to take
years. An unrelated 1997 patent involving pig production is flawed
in the same way, according to Greenpeace researchers, who filed an
appeal, but the patent office disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Patents have long been issued by governments, granting the
exclusive right to profit from commercially applicable inventions.
Biopatents, however, are recent and are based largely on one
laboratory mouse. In 1988, Harvard University patented the first
``transgenic'' animal, a genetically altered mouse predisposed to
getting cancer. After a patent moratorium in the United States
ended in 1993, biotech investors turned bullish on brave new mice
(and cows, pigs and, most famously, Dolly, the cloned sheep)
because of biopatents.
</P>
<P>
   Patents don't stop with four-legged animals. Private companies
and a U.S.-British consortium, the Human Genome Project, have been
racing for years to compile the complete catalog of mankind's
genes, or genome. It may be only weeks before a research team
claims credit for explicating a human being as a list of chemical
``letters'' longer than 800 Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain proposed that data from the human genome be made publicly
available without the legal restrictions of patents.
</P>
<P>
   Patent lawyers, however, say the Clinton-Blair proposal does
nothing to diminish the value of gene patents. ``Making the
alphabet publicly available has not reduced the value of novels,''
said Colin Sandercock, a patent lawyer specializing in
biotechnology in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But patent law will have to be revised and strengthened in the
biotech age, some lawyers say. In Europe, at least, an appeals
process can overturn challenged patents as in the Edinburgh case.
But in the United States challenged patents simply lead to
drawn-out litigation without a clear resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology, meanwhile, has raced so far ahead of patent law
that scientists are encouraged to try to patent everything in their
labs. Eric Juengst, a former director of the ethics program at the
Human Genome Project, compares overly broad patents to the Oklahoma
land rush of the 1890s. ``You had every incentive to say, `I claim
everything between here and the river,' no matter what was in
between,'' said Juengst, a professor at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Broad patents may grant far-reaching rights at a time when
genetic engineering is still in its infancy. For example, something
called germline manipulation may have more long-term consequences
than human cloning, experts say. A clone, after all, is simply an
identical twin separated in time. But animals, including human
beings, whose genetic makeup, or germline, has been altered pass on
a new set of genes to their children and their children's children,
and so, through many generations, have a potential impact on the
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narrowly speaking, you can't patent a gene because everyone's
genes are their own,'' said David Magnus, a philosophy professor
who led a recent scholarly conference at the University of
Pennsylvania titled ``Who Owns Life?'' But, he said, scientists can
and do patent the use of genes and parts of genes known as
``expressed sequence tags.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, when someone's susceptibility to, say, breast
cancer is cured with a patented gene therapy, Magnus said, the

<P>
   In the annals of bureaucratic slip-ups, this one was a beaut.
Last December, an obscure government agency known as the European
Patent Office mistakenly issued the first patent to allow the
cloning of a human being. More alarmingly, critics say, it may have
granted scientists the right to change the genetic makeup of the
entire human species.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, issued in Munich, Germany, is No. EP-0695351B1. It
gives its holder, the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, the sole
right to make, use and sell human beings created in its laboratory.
The university has the legal right, at least for the next 20 years,
to prevent competitors in 19 European countries from copying its
techniques without paying the university a fee.
</P>
<P>
   True, the University of Edinburgh, where Darwin once studied,
intended none of this _ it wanted only to patent certain laboratory
methods that may prove useful in fighting diseases like
Parkinson's. The patent office intended none of this, either _
someone forgot to require the correct legal disclaimers during
nearly six years of patent review. Greenpeace, the environmental
group, discovered the flawed patent and mounted a noisy protest in
February, after which the office acknowledged its error.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are no reported techniques for producing people
(except for the time-honored one) and even if there were, European
research rules ban human cloning. If renegade Scottish scientists
chose to clone humans anyway, the scientists would presumably be
arrested under anti-slavery laws.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever anyone did or did not do, this case of ``Brave New
World'' meets the Marx Brothers will not be untangled anytime soon.
The appeals process for overturning the 1999 patent is sure to take
years. An unrelated 1997 patent involving pig production is flawed
in the same way, according to Greenpeace researchers, who filed an
appeal, but the patent office disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Patents have long been issued by governments, granting the
exclusive right to profit from commercially applicable inventions.
Biopatents, however, are recent and are based largely on one
laboratory mouse. In 1988, Harvard University patented the first
``transgenic'' animal, a genetically altered mouse predisposed to
getting cancer. After a patent moratorium in the United States
ended in 1993, biotech investors turned bullish on brave new mice
(and cows, pigs and, most famously, Dolly, the cloned sheep)
because of biopatents.
</P>
<P>
   Patents don't stop with four-legged animals. Private companies
and a U.S.-British consortium, the Human Genome Project, have been
racing for years to compile the complete catalog of mankind's
genes, or genome. It may be only weeks before a research team
claims credit for explicating a human being as a list of chemical
``letters'' longer than 800 Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain proposed that data from the human genome be made publicly
available without the legal restrictions of patents.
</P>
<P>
   Patent lawyers, however, say the Clinton-Blair proposal does
nothing to diminish the value of gene patents. ``Making the
alphabet publicly available has not reduced the value of novels,''
said Colin Sandercock, a patent lawyer specializing in
biotechnology in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But patent law will have to be revised and strengthened in the
biotech age, some lawyers say. In Europe, at least, an appeals
process can overturn challenged patents as in the Edinburgh case.
But in the United States challenged patents simply lead to
drawn-out litigation without a clear resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology, meanwhile, has raced so far ahead of patent law
that scientists are encouraged to try to patent everything in their
labs. Eric Juengst, a former director of the ethics program at the
Human Genome Project, compares overly broad patents to the Oklahoma
land rush of the 1890s. ``You had every incentive to say, `I claim
everything between here and the river,' no matter what was in
between,'' said Juengst, a professor at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Broad patents may grant far-reaching rights at a time when
genetic engineering is still in its infancy. For example, something
called germline manipulation may have more long-term consequences
than human cloning, experts say. A clone, after all, is simply an
identical twin separated in time. But animals, including human
beings, whose genetic makeup, or germline, has been altered pass on
a new set of genes to their children and their children's children,
and so, through many generations, have a potential impact on the
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narrowly speaking, you can't patent a gene because everyone's
genes are their own,'' said David Magnus, a philosophy professor
who led a recent scholarly conference at the University of
Pennsylvania titled ``Who Owns Life?'' But, he said, scientists can
and do patent the use of genes and parts of genes known as
``expressed sequence tags.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, when someone's susceptibility to, say, breast
cancer is cured with a patented gene therapy, Magnus said, the
patient is not patentable nor are her children.
</P>
<P>
   But the repaired genes are the scientist's patented genes, he
said. Noting that it would be a ``public relations disaster,''
Magnus nonetheless noted that ``it may be legally possible for the
scientist to restrict your right to have children and pass on the
patented genes, without his permission.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Edinburgh case, the patent application applies to a
mousetrap not yet invented. It was drafted in 1994 without
disclaimers like ``transgenic nonhuman animal'' that are routine
today. ``In the context of this invention,'' the approved patent

USE OF THE INTERNET IS SLOWLY BUT PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMING JAPANESE
SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INA, Japan _ The Ohara Farm seems pretty much like any other
family-owned farm here, small in scale, neat as a pin and dreamily
bucolic, set amid the magnificent mountains of central Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint that the farm is not so typical is a pen in front
full of feisty, free-range chickens, which are popular here but not
a widespread phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Its most distinguishing feature, however, is less obvious. The
farm is selling its wares online.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohara Farm's Web site is the most frequently visited
``shop'' at Rakuten, an online bazaar that features dozens of such
farm sites and that scores 95 million hits a month. The farm's site
has generated a cult following of shoppers and fans of the chicks
that Rei Kimura, the 29-year-old son of the farm's owner, profiles
in a ``Chick Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, for instance, Kimura introduced Sakura-chan and
Momiji-chan, two newly hatched chicks from Gifu prefecture. (Sakura
and Momiji are Japanese chicken breeds.) ``They are still unstable,
although they can stand up,'' Kimura reported. ``They are cheeping
for their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is quietly transforming Japan, making celebrities
of small farmers like the Kimuras, empowering women, changing the
way people apply for jobs and schools and generally chipping away
at traditional patterns of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is set to become the world's largest user of the Internet
next year, according to Infocom, a Japanese research company that
specializes in data about the Internet and telecommunications. That
is thanks to the country's voracious appetite for cruising
cyberspace using mobile terminals, and many believe the impact of
that love affair will be huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the Internet here has started more as a social
thing that in the end is going to have enormous implications,''
said Jiro Kokuryo, a professor at Keio University's business
school, who specializes in e-commerce and information systems. ``It
is changing people's point of view and empowering them to challenge
traditional ways of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups that have traditionally had little influence here are
finding their voices and taking action on the Internet. Farmers
like the Kimuras escape the huge, bureaucratic distribution system
that has been sucking up their profits. Working mothers are banding
together to form business ventures. Small companies are using the
Internet to expand business and decrease reliance on a primary
corporate customer.
</P>
<P>
   These are all revolutionary developments by Japanese standards,
and not limited to marginal players. The NEC Corp., a confirmed
member of Japan Inc., is soliciting applications internally for
jobs in its expanding Internet-related businesses via e-mail,
encouraging employees to seek new opportunities without necessarily
asking permission of their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this would have been insubordination of the first
order and a sure-fire way of wrecking one's career. Now, a bastion
of corporate culture is at least inadvertently encouraging the
breakdown of tradition _ although NEC is loathe to own up to that.
</P>
<P>
   It will, however, concede that requirements that new employees
and old managers seeking promotions must take a test proving a
specified degree of English language skills is largely a result of
the Internet. That's a fairly stringent requirement, considering
that Japanese traditionally do not score well on English aptitude
tests. ``If this company wants to be in the business of the
Internet,'' said Aston Bridgman, an NEC spokesman, ``its employees
are going to have to be able to speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   The language Kimura, the egg farmer, has chosen is seduction.
Not only does his diary provide updates on the chicks, showing
pictures of their first feathers and first eggs, shoppers can also
listen to chicks cheeping, watch them hop (albeit rather jerkily)
and see how they live. This month, his mother is featured doing a
little dance for joy as part of a Mother's Day sales pitch.
Kimura's father has been more reticent about his son's online sales
venture _ ``he will hardly look at that machine,'' said Kimura,
gesturing toward the computer _ but he has allowed his picture to
be used on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It is the art of the soft sell at its best, and it is working.
Sales were up 20 percent last year, Kimura said. He is expecting 20
to 30 percent more growth this year _ with all the profit from
Internet sales going into the farm's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimuras' endeavor represents at least a small challenge to
one of the world's most cumbersome distribution systems. For
decades, the government maintained a tight grip on farmers through
production quotas, distribution regulations and stringent standards
that rendered a portion of Japan's produce substandard and thus
unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   The government system has been waning for more than a decade.
Before they put the farm on line, the Kimuras had already begun
shipping to the less-restrictive co-op system, which allows them to
improve their profit margins but still involves middle men.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet has provided the small farm with direct contact
with its customers, and the Kimuras are finding the relationship
delightful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if we've been doing business from behind a curtain all
this time, and suddenly we are face-to-face with our customers,''
Kimura said. ``A lot of customers are housewives with small
children or working women who have no time to shop. They talk to us
online about the cherry blossoms in their area or how their child
has a cold, and I get ideas for how to improve our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are also banding together on the Internet. Some 25.6
percent of the 14 million Japanese using the Internet at the end of
1998 were women, according to the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, up from 17.8 percent in the same period a year
earlier. At the same time, the number of American women tapping
into the Net declined to 35.8 percent of total users from 40.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can solve the problems of the time and location of work
with the Internet, it will become a means of solving some of the
child care problems that women who want to work face in this
country and, in the future, the problems relating to care of the
elderly,'' said Naoko Utsonomiya, who has joined an online work
place called Y's Staff.
</P>
<P>
   She believes the changes brought by the Internet will help crack
the bamboo ceiling. ``The business practice of face-to-face
negotiation and drinking sake together into the night has made it
difficult for women to advance in the business world,'' she said.
``But as more business relationships go online, business dealings
should become much more professional.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Women like Utsonomiya, in particular, are finding new
opportunities in cyberspace. Yuri Tazawa is the founder of Y's
Staff, a virtual company that attempts to put to use the skills of
women who want to work at home. With child care facilities limited
and pressure strong on mothers to stay home, most Japanese women
leave their jobs after marriage or after having children.
</P>
<P>
   Tazawa abandoned a job in computer planning at Sharp Electronics
when she married seven years ago and moved to her husband's new job
in Sendai from Nara, her hometown. Pregnant, she looked for work
and found an editor who gave her a job writing for a magazine aimed
at new computer users.
</P>
<P>
   She had two more daughters, and the family moved about Japan,
setting up home in four different cities around the country before
settling in Hokkaido three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, stories about ``small office, home office,'' or
``soho'' workers abounded in the media. Soho workers were typically
women with children working from home using the Internet, doing
relatively thankless tasks like data entry.
</P>
<P>
   The media hailed the phenomenon as a huge opportunity for former
career women, but Tazawa was hearing differently. ``I heard from
women who were doing data entry all day long and earning only 1,000
yen,'' or about $9.00 at current exchange rates, Tazawa said. ``It
seemed that in many cases, these women were just cheap labor, and
if the Internet was indeed going to overcome all the barriers to
women working, that would have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   She has set about changing it with Y's Staff, which now has
about 40 members whose skills range from Web page design and
writing to fortune-telling. Tazawa drums up projects and posts the
parameters and specifications on the Y's Staff Web site, and
recruits from among the members to build project teams.
</P>
<P>
   Between 30 and 50 women apply to join Y's Staff each month, and
1 or 2 are accepted. ``We have to determine who wants to work for
pocket money when the baby is asleep and who really wants to
distinguish themselves in society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her aim was to create an online office. Y's Staff members have
conferences on the Net, exchange ideas, strategize and even argue.
Tazawa controls quality, and enforces deadlines. Y's Staff has done
consulting for e-commerce and Internet-related ventures, created
contents for home pages, planned and edited online magazines and
written books about the Internet and personal computing. Members'
earnings range from $280 to $2,800 a month, depending on how active
they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have done this without the Internet,'' Tazawa said.
``If there was no Internet, after quitting the company and getting
married and having kids and moving every one or two years, the only
job I would have had would be standing behind a cash register at a
local supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-business people, too, seek to use the Internet to improve
their prospects. Consider Niizuma, a prototype maker in Kamata, a
district in Tokyo that is home to hundreds of tiny parts suppliers,
machine tool makers and the like. It went online last November,
touting its three-dimensional computer-assisted design capabilities
and soliciting new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small companies usually depend on getting orders from one or
two companies,'' said Kiyokazu Niizuma, the company's founder. ``If
orders keep coming, you're fine, but if they stop, you have almost
no work.''
</P>
<P>
   He has long used a sales force to make sure Niizuma did not rely
too heavily on any one company. But that strategy is costly and
time-consuming, since it takes roughly six months of wining and
dining, meetings and discussions to secure an order.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, orders coming in over the Internet take two or
three weeks, said Shiro Katagiri, the head of Niizuma's sales
department. About 20 companies that Niizuma has never done business
with have expressed interest in placing orders, and four have
actually done so. ``Before we did this, I was thinking at times
that I should increase the number of sales people,'' Niizuma said.
``But now I'm starting to worry about whether we can do all the
work coming in over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Niizuma, who is old enough to remember having to flee Tokyo
during the American air raids in World War II, thinks the impact of
the Internet will reach far beyond his thriving company.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional emphasis on personal relationships, which have
been critical to business here, is fast breaking down. New
distribution systems are putting businesses and customers into much
closer contact, to the benefit of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even major companies are placing orders in an arm's-length
process now to cut costs,'' he said. ``Sony is selling some things
online for 1,000 yen less than in stores, which is a big step
toward removing intermediaries and connecting to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Do these changes alarm him? ``I don't have any worries about the
future,'' he said. ``To me, the changes the Internet is bringing
about represent new chances.''

   A Ringing Endorsement for Bush
</P>
<P>
   Looking a bit like a teen-ager forced to attend a classical
music concert, Sen. John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with
Gov. George W. Bush at a news conference on Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I
 &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush,'' McCain intoned over and over, after a
reporter asked why he seemed so reluctant to use the word.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition probably had the effect McCain intended: It
reduced the term to ridiculousness. Still smarting over the
negative turn that the primary campaign _ and some of Bush's
commercials _ had taken, McCain had for weeks resisted falling into
line behind the presumptive Republican nominee. When he finally did
so last week, saying Bush had the ``vision, knowledge and
expertise'' to be president _ and that he himself had no interest
in being Bush's vice president _ there was a tight, grudging
quality to the event.
</P>
<P>
   As if to confirm that the political and journalistic worlds have
for months been hanging on McCain's every word, his utterance of
that single word was the major political news of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed pleased to have gotten over that hump, but Vice
President Al Gore reminded audiences that the two Republicans were
not all that in sync. Speaking that same day in Washington to the
Anti-Defamation League, Gore brought up an issue that divides Bush
and McCain, the Confederate flag that flies over the South Carolina
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to remain silent about it,'' Gore said, an
allusion to Bush's deferring to the people of South Carolina on the
issue. (McCain recently declared he had erred in not announcing
earlier that he favors the flag's removal.)
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to politics, Gore's boss is not remaining silent,
either. It was disclosed last week that President Clinton is
serving as a behind-the-scenes adviser to many Democratic
candidates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can't live without a campaign in his life,'' said Sen.

   The German Army Hero, Updated &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The past is inexhaustible in Germany. Beyond each confrontation
with the Third Reich, a new accounting always lurks. This time it
was the turn of the army, which has tended to cling to the notion
that Hitler's crimes were the work of the SS and death squads, not
the Wehrmacht.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his back on such views, Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping stripped a base of the name of a Wehrmacht general long
regarded as a hero and renamed it after Anton Schmid, a sergeant
who was executed by the Nazis in 1942 after he disobeyed orders and
helped Jews in the Vilnius ghetto. Honoring him reflected Germany's
growing determination to place ``Zivilcourage'' _ the courage of
conscience _ above duty in its scale of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I merely behaved as a human being,'' Schmid wrote in his last
letter to his wife. But very few people in Hitler's Reich had the
courage to do that.

   Iran's Reformers Win An Uncertain Victory

   When the votes in the runoff election were counted, Iran's
reformers appeared to have clinched their majority in the new
parliament that is set to open May 27. But they remained on
tenterhooks: The all-important Council of Guardians, dominated by
the hard-liners who have labeled the reformers as foreign agents,
has yet to certify the three-month-old results from first round of

   Planned Fire Turns Wild  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal government effort to thin dense pine forests with a
controlled burn near Los Alamos, N.M., suddenly burst into a
disastrous wild fire. Heavy winds sent flames racing through
tinder-dry canyons and then residential areas, and even across
portions of the highly sensitive nuclear weapons laboratory at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The local head of the National Park Service, which set the fire,
was suspended, more than 25,000 people had to be evacuated and at
least 260 homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear lab suffered no major damage and officials said
there was no release of radioactivity. Still, officials said, it
could take weeks to get the facility running fully again. Officials
also said it could take weeks before services could be restored so
that residents of the area can move back to their homes _ those
that still stand.

   The perils of Internet auctions _ and the potential for fraud _
were highlighted when the price of a ``great, big, wild'' painting
soared on eBay from 25 cents to $135,805 on speculation that it was
by the artist Richard Diebenkorn. The seller, Kenneth A. Walton of
Sacramento, later acknowledged that he had fabricated part of the
story that described the work and had bid on the painting ``for a
friend.'' EBay suspended him and voided the auction.

   A Ringing Endorsement for Bush
</P>
<P>
   Looking a bit like a teen-ager forced to attend a classical
music concert, Sen. John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with
Gov. George W. Bush at a news conference on Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I
 &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush,'' McCain intoned over and over, after a
reporter asked why he seemed so reluctant to use the word.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition probably had the effect McCain intended: It
reduced the term to ridiculousness. Still smarting over the
negative turn that the primary campaign _ and some of Bush's
commercials _ had taken, McCain had for weeks resisted falling into
line behind the presumptive Republican nominee. When he finally did
so last week, saying Bush had the ``vision, knowledge and
expertise'' to be president _ and that he himself had no interest
in being Bush's vice president _ there was a tight, grudging
quality to the event.
</P>
<P>
   As if to confirm that the political and journalistic worlds have
for months been hanging on McCain's every word, his utterance of
that single word was the major political news of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed pleased to have gotten over that hump, but Vice
President Al Gore reminded audiences that the two Republicans were
not all that in sync. Speaking that same day in Washington to the
Anti-Defamation League, Gore brought up an issue that divides Bush
and McCain, the Confederate flag that flies over the South Carolina
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to remain silent about it,'' Gore said, an
allusion to Bush's deferring to the people of South Carolina on the
issue. (McCain recently declared he had erred in not announcing
earlier that he favors the flag's removal.)
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to politics, Gore's boss is not remaining silent,
either. It was disclosed last week that President Clinton is
serving as a behind-the-scenes adviser to many Democratic
candidates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can't live without a campaign in his life,'' said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La.

   The German Army Hero, Updated &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The past is inexhaustible in Germany. Beyond each confrontation
with the Third Reich, a new accounting always lurks. This time it
was the turn of the army, which has tended to cling to the notion
that Hitler's crimes were the work of the SS and death squads, not
the Wehrmacht.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his back on such views, Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping stripped a base of the name of a Wehrmacht general long
regarded as a hero and renamed it after Anton Schmid, a sergeant
who was executed by the Nazis in 1942 after he disobeyed orders and
helped Jews in the Vilnius ghetto. Honoring him reflected Germany's
growing determination to place ``Zivilcourage'' _ the courage of
conscience _ above duty in its scale of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I merely behaved as a human being,'' Schmid wrote in his last
letter to his wife. But very few people in Hitler's Reich had the
courage to do that.

   Iran's Reformers Win An Uncertain Victory
</P>
<P>
   When the votes in the runoff election were counted, Iran's
reformers appeared to have clinched their majority in the new
parliament that is set to open May 27. But they remained on
tenterhooks: The all-important Council of Guardians, dominated by
the hard-liners who have labeled the reformers as foreign agents,
has yet to certify the three-month-old results from first round of
voting in the capital, Tehran, as well as the runoff races.

   A New Way to Diet  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Ross walked into a suburban Detroit convenience store last
week with a $100 bill and bought a hot dog for himself and 98
lottery tickets for his wife Nancy. Now they're multimillionaires,
after purchasing one of the two winning Big Game lottery tickets.
The 47-year-old swimming pool company owner and an unidentified
ticket holder in Illinois will split $363 million, a record for a
lottery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't eaten in three days,'' he said. Was it the
excitement or the hot dog?

   Planned Fire Turns Wild  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal government effort to thin dense pine forests with a
controlled burn near Los Alamos, N.M., suddenly burst into a
disastrous wild fire. Heavy winds sent flames racing through
tinder-dry canyons and then residential areas, and even across
portions of the highly sensitive nuclear weapons laboratory at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The local head of the National Park Service, which set the fire,
was suspended, more than 25,000 people had to be evacuated and at
least 260 homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear lab suffered no major damage and officials said
there was no release of radioactivity. Still, officials said, it
could take weeks to get the facility running fully again. Officials
also said it could take weeks before services could be restored so
that residents of the area can move back to their homes _ those
that still stand.

   Let the Bidder Beware
</P>
<P>
   The perils of Internet auctions _ and the potential for fraud _
were highlighted when the price of a ``great, big, wild'' painting
soared on eBay from 25 cents to $135,805 on speculation that it was
by the artist Richard Diebenkorn. The seller, Kenneth A. Walton of
Sacramento, later acknowledged that he had fabricated part of the
story that described the work and had bid on the painting ``for a
friend.'' EBay suspended him and voided the auction.

   Scandal Fallout for Clinton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton leaves the presidency about eight months from
now, few assume that he will hang out a shingle and practice law.
Nonetheless, he is battling to keep his law license in Arkansas in
a proceeding that could result in his being disbarred or suspended
from the practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent filing, Clinton disputed the main charge against him
_ that he lied under oath when he denied having had a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky _ by continuing to insist that
his answers were technically accurate if misleading. A decision may
come later this month.

   Coronation in Russia  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more coronation than inauguration _ a palace, a choir,
a red carpet, a huge gold emblem. But after Vladimir Putin was
sworn in as Russia's second president, he pledged to build a
democratic and capitalist nation. Capitalist, yes: His new prime
minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, is an economic liberal who has deftly
renegotiated Russia's Western debt.
</P>
<P>
   But democratic? At week's end, a police raid and search of the
media conglomerate that is the Kremlin's major critic, Media-Most,
left some wondering about Putin's political ideals.

   A Hacker Found (Perhaps)
</P>
<P>
   Onel de Guzman, a 23-year-old computer student, came forward
after several days of hiding and admitted in Manila that ``it is
possible'' he had unleashed the program that crippled e-mail
systems around the world. The Philippine National Bureau of
Investigation did not immediately call de Guzman a suspect, but
said agents would question him.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman, a student at the AMA Computer College, was suspected
after it was learned that he had submitted a thesis proposal that
resembled the destructive virus that paralyzed the accounts of
e-mail recipients who opened an attachment with the subject line,
``I Love You.'' His lawyer said de Guzman was ``not really aware
that the act imputed to him was done by him.''

   A Politician Unfazed

   Ever the optimist, former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards of Louisiana
said that prison is ``nothing to be afraid of.'' The prison system
is well-managed, he said, and provides its residents with food,
medical attention and a place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards may well have a chance to test his assessment first-hand
at some point. He, his son, and three other co-defendants were
convicted on Tuesday by a U.S. District Court jury in Baton Rouge
on racketeering charges related to the extortion of businessmen
seeking riverboat casino licenses. The 72-year-old Edwards, a
four-term governor who escaped conviction in two criminal trials in
the 1980s, has vowed to appeal.

   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, it was hard to say whether the
scene looked more like a television chat show or a ``Saturday Night
Live'' parody. There on a Washington stage last month sat Gov.
George W. Bush, his wife, Laura, and two prominent Republican
officeholders, both women, all in a semicircle and awaiting their
first guest.
</P>
<P>
   On cue, out walked an adorable second-grader with a giant white
bow in her hair, along with one of her teachers. As the women
beamed, Bush asked 7-year-old Elena Douglass, ``How is it here in
the nation's capital? Are you having a good time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, very,'' she whispered into her hand-held microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me too,'' confided Bush, who was using her to showcase his
interest in literacy and foreign language instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the infantilization of politics. Ever since President
Clinton won re-election four years ago with child-centered issues
like school uniforms, literacy and teen-age smoking, candidates
have increasingly behaved as if they are auditioning for the role
of Santa Claus, and not running for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, politicians have always kissed babies. And yes, even in
1988, both George Bush, the father, and Michael Dukakis were vying
to be the education president. But it was Clinton who built a whole
campaign around children, displaying his empathy for working
parents by watching children make model airplanes, or dropping into
a school that requires uniforms, or reading along with towheaded
tykes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, his Republican opponent, once complained, ``You give
President Clinton five minutes on television, he'll mention
children 15 times.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around there are no complaints. Everybody's doing it.
Just try to count how many times over the last year that Bush has
read ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to kindergartners to
demonstrate his commitment to literacy. He said it was his favorite
book from childhood _ no matter that it wasn't published until
1969, a year after he graduated from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Al Gore in New Hampshire, where he not only knelt
to read ``Tikvah Means Hope'' to 6-year-old Nikkita Gottling, but
bought her the book and autographed it?
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore can regularly be found in schools, eating in
the cafeteria or sitting at a student's desk. This habit may even
have raised the level of debate. At one high school, students were
discussing the Plessy vs. Ferguson case of 1896, in which the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the concept of separate but equal facilities
for blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have put education and the decline of civic and cultural
values at the top of their list of concerns. The boomers have made
raising children an obsession, while more and more women voters are
trying to balance motherhood and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you will check out your Jeep Cherokee, you will see the
vanity mirror is on both sides,'' said Alex Castellanos, a
Republican political consultant. ``It's now on the driver's side
and the soccer mom has her hand on the steering wheel. The soccer
mom is 70 percent of consumer spending. Two out of three new
college entrants are women. The economic power has shifted and
she's still the key swing voter in suburban America.''
</P>
<P>
   What better way to play gender politics than by having a child
on your lap? It telegraphs warmth, empathy and understanding.
``Everyone who is running for office has to bend over backward to
show that they know what it's like to be a typical American
family,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wanted a demonstration of the emotional power of an
encounter with a child had only to watch Clinton hug a boy on
crutches at the funeral for Cardinal John O'Connor of New York,
leaving the other dignitaries looking stiff and remote by
comparison. Still, a few lonely voices in both parties deplore the
dumbing down of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It atrophies the muscle of political debate,'' says Jeff Faux,
a liberal Democrat at the Economic Institute, a Washington policy
research center, who argues that it all started with Ronald
Reagan's success with political imagery.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, blames
Clinton. ``The kid card is used as a trump and it trumps all
debate,'' he said. ``You say this is good for our kids and that's
the end of it, instead of here are the arguments for and against
the measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Bill Bradley and John McCain, the primary candidates
who ran on ``authenticity'' and ``substance,'' lost.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, politicians are using people as props more than ever.
They hold small panel discussions with people who agree with them,
to highlight some policy proposal. The elderly are paraded for
discussion of Social Security. Nurses stand around listening to
talk of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans say they are delighted they have a nominee with
some of Clinton's political skills and an ability to soften their
party's image. ``Unfortunately, politics is about symbols and I
don't even think you can overdo it,'' said David Horowitz, whose
pamphlet ``The Art of Political War'' has been circulating among
House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls have shown Bush in the lead, and making a
strong showing among married women, a swing group that Clinton won
in 1996. So don't be surprised to see Bush and Gore surrounded by
children, reading away like school librarians, right up to
November.

   ``It atrophies the muscle of political debate,'' says Jeff Faux,
a liberal Democrat at the Economic Institute, a Washington policy
research center, who argues that it all started with Ronald
Reagan's success with political imagery.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, blames
Clinton. ``The kid card is used as a trump and it trumps all
debate,'' he said. ``You say this is good for our kids and that's
the end of it, instead of here are the arguments for and against
the measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Bill Bradley and John McCain, the primary candidates
who ran on ``authenticity'' and ``substance,'' lost.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, politicians are using people as props more than ever.
They hold small panel discussions with people who agree with them,
to highlight some policy proposal. The elderly are paraded for
discussion of Social Security. Nurses stand around listening to
talk of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans say they are delighted they have a nominee with
some of Clinton's political skills and an ability to soften their
party's image. ``Unfortunately, politics is about symbols and I
don't even think you can overdo it,'' said David Horowitz, whose
pamphlet ``The Art of Political War'' has been circulating among
House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls have shown Bush in the lead, and making a
strong showing among married women, a swing group that Clinton won
in 1996. So don't be surprised to see Bush and Gore surrounded by
children, reading away like school librarians, right up to
November.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It is the height of the social season here. Every
year around Mother's Day, emboldened by humidity as dense as wet
laundry, tens of thousands of couples, romantically lit by
gaslights, descend upon the historic French Quarter to mate.
</P>
<P>
   It is Formosan termite swarm season, a time of year when termite
wing cases flutter in the breeze and homeowners wonder if they have
stumbled into a 1950's horror film. Formosan subterranean termites
with an insatiable taste for irreplaceable historic structures have
been devastating the French Quarter, drawn to its moist, porous
bricks and centuries-old wood, ravaging ancient live oak trees. The
Quarter is ground zero in the federal government's $15 million
effort to thwart the Formosan, the most destructive species of
termite in the world, capable of building colonies of up to 10
million writhing white bugs, which devour an average of 1,000
pounds of wood a year. Native termite colonies, one-tenth the size,
eat a meager 7 pounds per year.
</P>
<P>
   An exotic species probably imported in the 1940s in infested
planks aboard military cargo ships, the Formosan termite has spread
through 11 states, including California, creating an estimated $1
billion a year in damage, $300 million of it in greater New
Orleans. Eighty percent of the city's historic structures have been
affected, and almost every house, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The Formosans have found their Galatoire's in this languid
semitropical climate where it can be difficult to distinguish air
from water.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs are eating their way through landmarks along the Gulf
Coast, from barracks at the Citadel in Charleston, S.C., to
cast-iron fronted stores in Galveston's Strand Historic District.
And they are heading north, having been confirmed in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their movement can be traced to humankind: infested
railroad ties sold for raised planting beds and other landscaping,
said Brian Forschler, an associate professor at the University of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, termite baits round out historic decor, lying in
wait behind Victorian velvet settees, beneath Persian rugs. In
swarm season, which lasts through June and is triggered by
80-degree temperatures with 85 percent humidity, flying Formosans,
called alates, leave nests by the tens of thousands to build
colonies, blinding motorists in bewinged blizzards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have people over,'' said Roland Behan, who lives in
the Lower Pontalba apartments, built in 1851, overlooking Jackson
Square. ``You don't want them to step in the wrong spot and go
through the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy and Marie Cahn, longtime residents of a 1840s Creole
cottage, remember all too well the dinner party they threw last
year that was interrupted by clouds of termites streaming out of
the kitchen walls, swarming toward the fanlights and dropping into
the chicken cacciatore. They have not made it since. ``It kind of
kills the mood,'' Cahn said.
</P>
<P>
   In a city below sea level with a history of flood and pestilence
_ yellow fever epidemics killed thousands _ termite damage is both
physical and psychological, playing into its residents'
predilection for dark humor and fatalism.

   ``In New Orleans we're addicted to apocryphal stories,'' said
Patrick Dunne, an antiques dealer. He tells of a client who
complained that her 18th-century Venetian mirror was hanging
crookedly, only to discover its wooden backing riddled with
termites.
</P>
<P>
   (End Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   With powerful mandibles, Formosan subterranean termites are more
intrusive foragers than their native counterparts, tunneling
through plaster, creosote, plastic, asphalt, electrical
high-voltage wire, utility poles, even espresso makers, to find
food and water. A queen can live for 30 years and lay up to 1,000
eggs a day.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregg Henderson, an associate professor of entomology at
Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in Baton Rouge,
calls the swarm ``the eighth wonder of the world.'' He is working
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the New Orleans
Mosquito and Termite Control Board on Operation Full Stop, a
national termite eradication program which includes treating 15
blocks in the 100-block French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Ring, his colleague at the center, added, ``This
termite flies. We can reduce numbers. Eradicating them is just not
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans architecture is custom-made for termites:
flat-roofed wooden structures with shared walls and porous stucco,
designed with a cooling wicking action to absorb moisture in days
before air-conditioning. Joists supporting floors and ceilings sit
in pockets in the ancient brick, providing ``a Ho Chi Minh trail
between bricks and mortar and their food source,'' said Marc
Cooper, director of the Vieux Carre Commission, the city
preservation agency that oversees the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One house in Lake Charles, La., has a colony estimated at 70
million Formosan termites.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time of year, lights are dimmed at dusk and the talk
revolves around baiting and trapping, giving the ``city that care
forgot'' the impression of a gigantic Rod &AMP; Gun club. In the
testing area around Jackson Square, tourists pass sticky traps and
step unawares on shiny silver discs implanted in the sidewalk,
indicating underground baits. Baiting, which costs about $1,500 a
year a house, is the newest and most promising treatment thus far.
In contrast to traditional pesticides, which create a poison
barrier around a building, baits contain wood laced with a
low-toxicity pesticide that prevents the termites from shedding
their exoskeleton during molting, essentially strangling them in
their own skin. They carry the toxin _ the termite equivalent of an
Obituary Cocktail, a legendary local drink _ back to the nest,
infecting their cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   The termites hid successfully for 25 years, reaching a critical
mass a decade ago. ``They're cryptic insects,'' said Ed Bordes, the
administrator of the city's Mosquito and Termite Control Board.
Three years after a colony is formed, the population starts
``square-rooting'' and continues to do so each year, said Ed
Martin, an entomologist and president of Terminix New Orleans, a
pest-control franchise. The infestation has grown bigger since
1987, when chlordane, an effective termiticide, was banned by the
Environmental Protection Agency as a probable human carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   Baiting is having promising results in some of the city's most
treasured landmarks, which just a few years ago were infested. They
include the majestic Cabildo, built in 1795-1799, where the
Louisiana Purchase was signed, (now part of the Louisiana State
Museum) the Presbytere, 1795-1847, originally built as the rectory
for St. Louis Cathedral, and Perseverance Hall (1820), a
longstanding cultural center for the African-American community.
``We're going after the enemy instead of letting him come to us,''
Martin said.

   Preliminary research in treated areas of the French Quarter
indicates that scientists have turned a corner in their battle. At
a recent public update for residents of the quarter, entomologists
bearing charts and red pointers explained ways to invite termites
into your home. These included air-conditioning leaks and
polystyrene slab insulation, which likened to a ``great big termite
Po Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners with termites volunteer as trappers during swarm
season, when the insects are dramatically visible. They use
fluorescent lights to draw them to buckets with metal traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nights when they all seem to get together and say,
`Let's rumble,''' Marie Cahn said. ``It's atrocious. You can hear
the low hum of wings beating.''
</P>
<P>
   The economics of Formosan termite infestation are of greatest
concern to residents in New Orleans. Termite inspections are
mandatory before the purchase of a property, but they are of
limited effectiveness. When inspecting a house, pest-control
operators are not responsible for pulling up floor boards or
checking inaccessible crawl spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite regular termite inspections, Janet and Scott Howard and
their children one day discovered a terrible infestation in their
1920s federal house in the city's historic Garden District, its
renovated dining room inspired by the Pompeiian Room at the Met,
she said. Termites had turned their joists, in her words, ``into
straw.'' They say it will cost around $400,000 to repair the
damage. Of that, $150,000 is reimbursable through her pest-control
company, which they are suing for misdiagnosing the problem and for
improper repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no federal disaster relief for homeowners. Deloise
Rainey, 63, a deli clerk nearing retirement, lives about 10 miles
from the French Quarter. One day she saw dust on the kitchen
countertop. A year later, it was the walls. ``When I pushed the
wall they were peeking out at me,'' she said. Then she discovered
mud tunnels in the sheetrock, in the columns, in the 2 by 4's. Over
the past five years, she has spent about $5,000 on repairs and
another $1,000 on pest control, she said. ``I'm spending all my
money on termites,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (End Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., introduced a bill
proposing tax relief for homeowners. It would change the definition
of casualty loss to include Formosan termites. It would also
provide low-interest loans for treatment. ``It's not a sudden
disaster,'' Landrieu said, ``but it is certain.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, residents have been battling the Formosan termite for
well over a century. The famed Iolani Palace in Honolulu, built in
1845, was so decimated that it had to be totally rebuilt in 1879.
Builders are now required to use chemically treated wood for
framing. But in Louisiana, builders object that it would add $3,000
to the price of each house.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hawaiian builders are also turning to steel and concrete
construction, a more expensive solution.
</P>
<P>
   Building techniques are evolving even in historic structures. In
New Orleans, the old clock in the tower of St. Patrick's church was
recently replaced with a fiberglass version, its beams with steel,
its wooden floors with lightweight concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In their never-ending search for what one scientist called the
termite's ``Achilles' heel,'' researchers are focusing on behavior
and detection, hoping to find termites within walls by homing in on
the sound the emit. They are also studying vetiver, a fragrant
grass cultivated for centuries by the Creoles that contains
nootkatone, a natural repellent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, community-wide action, such as the one in the French
Quarter, seem to hold the most promise. ``It's an effort that has
to cut across property boundaries,'' said Forschler, of the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Quarter, Mother's Day finds residents in a philosophical
mood. ``God may have said `subdue the earth,''' observed Kenneth
Hedrick, rector of the landmark St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson
Square, which is still battling termites. ``But some things can't
be subdued.''

 SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS WIDENING POLITICAL ATTACK ADS  (Eds.: Style
violation in lede with `the Michigan Republican' is intentional for
parallelism with `the suspected international terrorist.') 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ It was one of the more astonishing political
images of the year: a newspaper advertisement that linked Osama bin
Laden, the suspected international terrorist, with Sen. Spencer
Abraham, the Michigan Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the senator, asked the advertisement that ran in some of
Michigan's largest newspapers, ``trying to make it easier for
terrorists like Osama bin Laden to export their way of terror to
any street in America?''
</P>
<P>
   The question not only puzzled readers, but the advertising
campaign, sponsored by a Washington-based group that regularly
inveighs against any form of immigration, the Federation for
American Immigration Reform, also infuriated institutions like the
Michigan Catholic Conference, the voice of the state's seven Roman
Catholic dioceses on social and political issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been real ugly and I think very vicious,'' said Paul A.
Long, vice president for public policy of the conference, which
asked television stations around the state to stop broadcasting
anti-immigration spots sponsored by the federation. ``We felt
compelled to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation's advertisements _ which include television and
radio spots that warn viewers and listeners that Abraham's
legislative initiatives would ``import more than 200,000 foreign
workers a year to take good American jobs'' _ are among the
nastiest running anywhere this political season. They are also an
extreme example of a trend that is changing the face of political
advertising: the increasing insertion of special-interest groups
into the process as masters of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for instance, Handgun Control, the antithesis of
the National Rifle Association, began running a spot in eight
cities around the country that implied that the NRA would work out
of the Oval Office if Gov. George W. Bush should be elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Groups as well known as the Sierra Club and individuals as
obscure as the Republican campaign donors Sam and Charles Wyly _
they of the attack commercial on Sen. John McCain's environmental
record _ are on the air with spots leveling ominous accusations
about Republican and Democratic candidates alike.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in fact, the Sierra Club began running
commercials in 17 congressional races across the nation, about
evenly divided between candidates it considers good for the
environment and those it views as bad, including Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest-group ads have been a growth industry ever since
`Harry and Louise' appeared in '93 and '94,'' said Darrell West, a
Brown University political science professor who studies campaign
advertising. Harry and Louise were the ubiquitous television couple
in the insurance industry spots that helped kill the Clinton
administration's national health care proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that time, we have seen a virtual explosion of
interest-group ads,'' West said, adding that the groups sometimes
serve as surrogates for candidates, who, at a time when voters are
prone to punish office-seekers for seeming too negative, cannot
afford to be perceived as attacking an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decade, candidates have been less likely to employ attack
ads for fear of the backlash,'' he said. ``The groups can provide a
candidate with a level of insulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race in Michigan is a microcosm of the trend. So far,
the only significant television advertising in the race has been by
organizations ostensibly unaffiliated with either political party,
including the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club, Michigan Right to Life and
a business group called Americans for Job Security. Abraham,
engaged in what polls show is a tight race, and his Democratic
opponent, Rep. Debbie Stabenow, have yet to begin advertising in
any concerted way.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, known by its acronym, FAIR. The Catholic Church was
condemning a $700,000 advertising campaign that the federation
described as an effort to defeat immigration legislation sponsored
by Abraham. But many people here view the federation's effort as a
virulent campaign to defeat the senator himself in the fall
election. Abraham, a first-term senator of Lebanese descent, is
chairman of a Senate subcommittee on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   At least one television station, a Fox Network affiliate in
Detroit, pulled a federation commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit federation, founded in the late 1970s by Dr. John
Tanton, an ophthalmologist from northern Michigan, has long viewed
a ban on immigration as crucial to population control. It advocates
a moratorium on all immigration, with the exceptions of spouses and
children of American citizens, and ``a limited number of
refugees.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The group, which claims a dues-paying membership of 70,000, has
attracted a smorgasbord of support from both the left and the
right, and had been running harshly anti-immigration commercials on
radio and television in high-visibility primary states like Iowa
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   (Former Gov. Dick Lamm of Colorado, a Democrat, is on the
federation's board. Former Sen, Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., resigned
from the advisory board over the federation's advertising campaign
in Michigan.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been controversial,'' said Frank Sharry,
executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a Washington
advocacy group for immigrants. ``Their work has always been
surrounded by accusations of racism and white supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   What often raises hackles about the federation is its past
financial backing from the Pioneer Fund, an organization formed in
the 1930s in part to promote racial purity.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stein, the federation's executive director, says the group
long ago severed its connections with the Pioneer Fund, and that
the purpose of the Michigan television and radio spots and print
advertisements is to educate Abraham's constituents about the
issues, not the election. One of the commercials' objectives is the
defeat of a bill sponsored by Abraham that would increase the
number of visas granted to foreigners seeking to work for high-tech
companies, which complain of a shortage of skilled applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In its television spot, the federation characterized the measure
as a threat to American college graduates, and urged constituents
to call the senator on a toll-free number that the group arranged
to have connected to Abraham's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a charitable entity,'' Stein said. ``We are not
interested in affecting the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abraham camp thinks otherwise. ``Their goal is to defeat
Abraham and show his colleagues what they can do,'' said Joe
McMonigle, the senator's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   As a nonprofit charity whose donors can receive tax deductions,
the federation is permitted to engage in lobbying but is barred by
the Internal Revenue Service from campaigning for or against
political candidates, legal experts say. (The Sierra Club has more
leeway in campaigns. It is also a nonprofit group but the money it
receives from donors is not tax deductible.)
</P>
<P>
   Doug Varley, a lawyer in the Washington offices of Caplin &AMP;
Drysdale, who advises tax-exempt and nonprofit organizations
including Sharry's, said, ``I think most charities try very hard to
comply with the electioneering ban. Most are scrupulous, because
the stakes are so high.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein maintained that his commercials do not cross the line.
``We have the ability and the right to engage in grass-roots
lobbying,'' he said. ``Unless your ad says `Vote against Abraham,'
you're really on terra firma.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation's advertising has become an issue in the Michigan
race, but which of the candidates will benefit remains unclear.
Stabenow has told reporters that while she disagrees with the
shrillness of the federation's commercials on immigration, she
feels the group raises a legitimate issue for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The federation said it was not working with Stabenow.
</P>
<P>
   McMonigle said he had devoted much time to alerting the news
media to the group's background and rebutting its accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sarpolus, a pollster with EPIC/MRA in Lansing, said the
federation might be doing some damage to Abraham simply by its
ability to distract his campaign. ``It has taken Spence off message
and strategy,'' he said, adding that his latest poll showed the two
candidates in a virtual dead heat.

<P>
   Oct. 24, 2000 _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced
today that it would conduct a controlled meltdown at the Pilgrim
Nuclear Power Plant in Plymouth, Mass. The meltdown is part of an
annual safety measure, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps the thing from going all kooky,'' said the Pilgrim
safety chief, Edward McGahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the weather is dry like this, the rods, the core, all
that nuclear stuff could melt or explode or something,'' McGahan
added. ``See, this way, if we do it on purpose, it can't meltdown
on its own by accident.''
</P>

   Nov. 16, 2000 _ Officials at Hoover Dam said today that they
would blow up the dam this weekend. Speaking at a news conference,
Tom Drymalski, the director of safety, said: ``There's all that
water building up and there's, like, pressure. So this guy Phil,
from maintenance, said, `Dude, what would happen if the dam broke?'
So then we got to thinking that we should blow it up and rebuild
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by reporters about the effect of releasing 28,537,000

first?'' Gen. William Landay said. He added that it was not
uncommon for the Pentagon to try to avoid disaster by actually
creating it.

the Washington police chief, Lars Gustafson. ``I don't want to

<P>
   ``Officials have begun to express anger at the National Park
Service, which set what it had hoped would be a controlled fire.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Times, May 12, 2000, in an article about a large
wildfire in Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 24, 2000 _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced
today that it would conduct a controlled meltdown at the Pilgrim
Nuclear Power Plant in Plymouth, Mass. The meltdown is part of an
annual safety measure, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps the thing from going all kooky,'' said the Pilgrim
safety chief, Edward McGahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the weather is dry like this, the rods, the core, all
that nuclear stuff could melt or explode or something,'' McGahan
added. ``See, this way, if we do it on purpose, it can't meltdown
on its own by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 16, 2000 _ Officials at Hoover Dam said today that they
would blow up the dam this weekend. Speaking at a news conference,
Tom Drymalski, the director of safety, said: ``There's all that
water building up and there's, like, pressure. So this guy Phil,
from maintenance, said, `Dude, what would happen if the dam broke?'
So then we got to thinking that we should blow it up and rebuild
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by reporters about the effect of releasing 28,537,000
acre-feet of water, Drymalski said, ``Well, we hadn't really
thought of that, but it'll probably be pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   March 9, 2001 _ ``It's impossible to know what the Belgians will
do,'' said an angry Pentagon official today at a news conference to
announce that the United States would drop a nuclear bomb on
Belgium Monday afternoon. ``They're Belgians. What if they attack
first?'' Gen. William Landay said. He added that it was not
uncommon for the Pentagon to try to avoid disaster by actually
creating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People underestimate Belgium,'' he said. ``I bet you didn't
know that the Belgians tried to invade this country just two weeks
ago but were turned away at Customs because of expired passports.''
</P>
<P>
   July 3, 2001 _ Police in Washington, D.C., announced that all
officers on the force would be required to shoot themselves at the
beginning of each shift. The move was immediately hailed by law
enforcement agencies nationwide. ``These are violent times,'' said
the Washington police chief, Lars Gustafson. ``I don't want to
stand here while our guys are out there getting shot on the street.
I would much rather they do it themselves. This way, I think, we're
all better prepared.''

<P>
   The presumptive Senate candidate tells reporters that his
marriage is kaput _ possibly even before informing the mother of
his children. He has already announced his high regard for the
``very good friend'' who accompanied him to a recent press dinner.
A few hours later, his wife counters with her own news conference,
choking on tears as she says that her husband has not only been
unfaithful but serially unfaithful, previously with a member of his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   And the public's reaction? Instant statewide polling suggested
that New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's personal problems would
have no effect on how most voters would view his candidacy. A Daily
News headline summed it up: ``Voters Don't Care.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't that Americans are no longer concerned with moral
issues; they may simply be drawing the line between public and
private behavior that the media no longer draws for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Americans have punished candidates who made them
aware of their messy intimate lives.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller divorced Mary Todhunter Clark to
marry Margaretta Fitler Murphy, the public was scandalized, and his
presidential chances crippled. When Ronald Reagan was elected
president in 1980, a mere 28 years into his second marriage, it was
considered a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Voters never got the chance to judge House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who surely deserves a place in the chutzpah hall of fame
for wagging his finger at President Clinton during the impeachment
debate. Gingrich was no longer in power when Americans learned that
he was involved with a congressional staff member at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who was about to replace Gingrich as
speaker, decided to step down after his own past indiscretions were
revealed by Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler and
self-appointed hypocrisy cop.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that there is a continuing debate over whether
Giuliani still has a political future shows how far the public has
come since, as William Bennett, a conservative writer and former
secretary of education, says, ``the ancient standards were in place
in the days of yore _ 1987,'' when Gary Hart's presidential
campaign went pfft after the story broke about his affair with
Donna Rice. Even his wife's decision to stand by him did no good.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said adultery, by itself, is no longer fatal for
candidates for higher office, and even such ``complicating
factors'' as lying about an affair, or carrying on with an
underling, seem to matter less and less. While he believes that
those factors should end any campaign for higher office, Bennett
said, ``I'm not having a lot of agreement on that, even around my
own office.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprisingly, several Republicans said they do not
think that Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky is responsible for
the shift in public opinion. Instead they feel that Clinton's
popular success is just more evidence that the culture was moving
in that direction anyway: Voters elected him _ twice _ knowing they
were not getting Ozzie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is anesthetized to all of this in-your-face stuff
about private lives,'' said Rep. Michael Forbes of New York, who
switched parties and became a Democrat last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean they don't have concerns and opinions,''
Forbes said. ``But what the public really doesn't like is when you
beat your chest with righteous indignation about somebody else's
behavior and then do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Estrich, who closely followed the Hart drama while running
Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign, says the country seems
to have moved so far so fast since Hart's downfall that today a
messy affair can actually be a plus for a candidate, especially one
who seems to need a little humanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, right now it helps in the weird political world
in which we live,'' she said, ``because watching them be human,
even if it's because they're having an affair, is better than
watching them be politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   New York voters certainly were responding sympathetically when
they recently learned that Giuliani also has prostate cancer, which
he has said will be the prime consideration in deciding whether he
stays in the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With divorce so common, fewer voters and candidates are in a
position to judge others for the same problems they have.
</P>
<P>
   There would obviously be no arms buildup on this issue in a
Giuliani-Clinton matchup, and no commercials from Clinton's
campaign featuring footage of her opponent's distraught wife.
</P>
<P>
   Though most political analysts say the public still holds women
candidates to a higher moral standard, even that appears to be
changing: Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, with strong ties to the
religious right, recently survived revelations of a long-past
affair and was subsequently re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of other, perhaps more subtle factors now influence
whether the public will tolerate private indiscretion from any
given elected official.
</P>
<P>
   Other considerations for voters include how the (apparently)
wronged or exiting spouse reacts. And how well the public likes the
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep seeing Judith Nathan described as a nurse and a single
mom,'' Estrich said, referring to Giuliani's friend, who is 45.
``And I think the situation would be different if she were a
25-year-old aspiring model.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the candidate been hypocritical?
</P>
<P>
   Can he or she take the heat?
</P>
<P>
   How conservative are constituents? (Last year, supporters of
Gary Bauer, the ``family values'' presidential candidate,
criticized him simply for meeting alone with a female staff
member.)
</P>
<P>
   And most important of all: How well did voters like the guy in
the first place?

for Sunday, May 14, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   PEACEKEEPING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Call it Democratic Man's Burden.
He watches TV news. He sees a child starving in Somalia,
eviscerated by shrapnel in Sarajevo or maimed by rebels in Sierra
Leone. He feels morally affronted, angry and a little guilty. He
demands Something Be Done. So it begins _ the peacekeeping
imperative. From Haiti to East Timor, Angola to Iraq, the Western
democracies _ and especially the United States, with its news media
as its tireless, outrage-sniffing hound _ have claimed a stake in
almost every fight, especially those that produce television
pictures of pitiless tyrants harming innocents. By Blaine Harden.
(Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Call it the infantilization
of politics. Ever since President Clinton won re-election four
years ago with child-centered issues like school uniforms and
literacy and stopping teen-age smoking, candidates have
increasingly behaved as if they are auditioning for the role of
Santa Claus. But it was Clinton who built a whole presidential
campaign around kids, telegraphing his empathy for working parents
by watching children make model airplanes, or dropping into a
school that requires uniforms, or reading along with towheaded
tykes. By Alison Mitchell. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved:
</P>
<P>
   ADULTERY-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Until fairly recently,
American voters punished candidates who made them aware of their
personal complications. The presidential prospects of Nelson
Rockefeller and Adlai Stevenson, it is said, were hurt by their
divorces. Eventually divorce became politically acceptable, but
adultery was still a no-no. Now, as William Bennett points out, not
only is adultery no longer politically fatal for candidates, but
even such ``complicating factors'' as lying to the public about an
affair, or carrying on with an underling, seem to matter less and
less. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   GENES-PATENTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In December, an obscure agency
known as the European Patent Office erroneously issued the first
patent to allow the cloning of a human being. More alarmingly, it
may have granted scientists the right to change the genetic makeup
of the entire human species. This case of ``Brave New World'' meets
the Marx Brothers will not be untangled soon. The appeals process
for overturning the patent is sure to take years. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ Playwright Michael
Frayn's `'Copenhagen'' arrived on Broadway last month after a
critical and commercial success in London. The three-character play
about the unsettling philosophical implications of quantum physics
is a hit here, too. Ben Brantley, theater critic of The New York
Times, called it ``the most invigorating and ingenious play of
ideas in many a year.'' But does anyone understand it? By Rick
Marin.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD-COSTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It now costs about $160,140 to
raise a middle-class child through age 17, according to a
government report. That's up from $25,229 in 1960 ($69,333 in
1980), seemingly a huge increase. But that 1960 figure, adjusted
for inflation, would equal $141,998 today, so the cost of bringing
up baby has risen only about 13 percent since 1960. By Tamar Lewin.
With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL-HERO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Basketball Hall of Fame
is considering the induction of a long-forgotten Italian immigrant
bowling-alley owner from Syracuse, N.Y., Danny Biasone, who back in
the mid-1950s literally saved the game at a time when the future of
the young NBA was in doubt. By Charles Paikert.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-BISHOPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The selection of Edward Egan
as archbishop of New York is illustrative of the appointments made
by Pope John Paul II. The pontiff has reshaped the American church
hierarchy as perhaps none of his predecessors has. He has filled
vacancies with men who share his own vision of how the church
should be run. The process has been gradual, but its effect has
been profound. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   DOOMSDAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Let's face it: Y2K was a bust. Now
with the Year 2000 almost half over, the opportunities for a
millennial end time are narrowing. In fact, the last big chance may
come May 17, when the Sun and five planets will form an unusually
tight alignment. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   PHILOSOPHERS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The writer Paul Strathern,
who earned a philosophy degree at Trinity College in Dublin, has
been distilling most of the world's best-known philosophers to 90
minutes. A godsend in this era of the short attention span, the
series begins with ``Socrates in 90 Minutes,'' wittily compressing
his life and works, and proceeds to Locke, Augustine, Descartes,
Sarte and others. Excerpts from the books.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROLLED-CATASTROPHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ In the wake of the
Los Alamos wildfire, some imaginary deliberate disasters are
reported.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Across Africa, there have been
countless incidents of quack AIDS cures being sold, some even
supported by government officials. But South African President
Thabo Mbeki is the only leader to have questioned the mainstream
theories on what causes AIDS. AIDS activists, long annoyed by South
Africa's inaction, are now shocked by the attention the issue is
getting. But Mbeki's refusal to accept standard scientific thinking
remains puzzling to almost everyone. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-REBELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Colombian government,
frustrated by its inability to end thirty years of war against two
major guerrilla movements, is now seeking peace by granting both
guerrilla movements the one thing they want most: uncontested zones
that they can call their own territory. The government has in
effect formally recognized that it doesn't exercise full
sovereignty over all its territory, leaving the two zones a kind of
neverland where it is not clear who is in charge _ or how the zones
fit into the rest of the country. By Larry Rohter. With graphic.

   COPENHAGEN-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ Playwright Michael
Frayn's `'Copenhagen'' arrived on Broadway last month after a
critical and commercial success in London. The three-character play
about the unsettling philosophical implications of quantum physics
is a hit here, too. Ben Brantley, theater critic of The New York
Times, called it ``the most invigorating and ingenious play of
ideas in many a year.'' But does anyone understand it? By Rick
Marin.

   CHILD-COSTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It now costs about $160,140 to
raise a middle-class child through age 17, according to a
government report. That's up from $25,229 in 1960 ($69,333 in
1980), seemingly a huge increase. But that 1960 figure, adjusted
for inflation, would equal $141,998 today, so the cost of bringing
up baby has risen only about 13 percent since 1960. By Tamar Lewin.

   CATHOLIC-BISHOPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The selection of Edward Egan
as archbishop of New York is illustrative of the appointments made

   PHILOSOPHERS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The writer Paul Strathern,
who earned a philosophy degree at Trinity College in Dublin, has
been distilling most of the world's best-known philosophers to 90

VENTURES AIM TO PUT FARMS IN PHARMACEUTICAL VANGUARD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Iowa, Calif., Ark., Britain, France)   (With: MOLECULAR-FARMING-VACCINE) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Williams, a Virginia tobacco farmer, has been forced to cut
his production nearly in half over the last three years as people
have kicked the smoking habit. But he is hoping that a small
experimental plot he just planted will hold the key to his staying
on the farm. That tobacco has been genetically engineered to
produce not cigarettes but pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Plants containing drugs could, indeed, represent a new
high-priced crop. ``If we can actually find a medical use for
tobacco that saves lives, what a turnaround for the much-maligned
tobacco plant,'' said Christopher Cook, chief executive of ToBio, a
company recently formed by Virginia tobacco farmers like Williams
to grow drugs in cooperation with the CropTech Corp. of Blacksburg,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   The production of drugs in genetically altered plants _ called
molecular farming or biopharming _ seems poised to represent the
next wave in agricultural biotechnology. Until now, efforts have
mainly been directed at protecting crops from pests and improving
the taste and nutrition of food.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the production of bioengineered foods has been
controversial, molecular farming is already raising some safety and
environmental concerns. Chief among them is that drugs might end up
in the general food supply, either because crops or seeds are
misrouted during processing or because pollen from a
drug-containing crop in an open field fertilizes a nearby food
crop. What if insects eat the drug-containing plants or if the drug
leaks into the soil from the roots?
</P>
<P>
   About 20 companies worldwide are working on producing
pharmaceuticals in plants, according to the Bowditch Group, a
Boston consulting firm. A handful of such drugs are already being
tested in human clinical trials, including vaccines for hepatitis B
and an antibody to prevent tooth decay.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been dozens of field tests like the one on
Williams' farm, aimed at seeing if products ranging from hemoglobin
to urokinase, a clot-dissolving drug, can be grown in crops like
corn, tobacco or rice. In a closely related effort, companies are
also trying to use plants to produce industrial chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say that farming for pharmaceutical proteins would be
far cheaper than the current practice of producing these drugs in
genetically modified mammalian cells grown in vats. That could
lower the price of drugs produced by biotechnology, some of which
now cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year per
patient.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the drugs would not even have to be extracted
from the plant. Scientists are testing edible vaccines in which
people would be protected from diseases by eating genetically
engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   As these crops get closer to market, regulators are trying to
figure out how to ensure their safety. Last month, the Food and
Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department held a public
meeting in Ames, Iowa, to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators say some safeguards are already in place. To
minimize environmental risks, all field tests of drug-producing
plants must receive government permits, while some field tests of
other modified crops require only that the government be notified,
said Michael Schechtman, biotechnology coordinator for the
Agriculture Department. In addition, the distance by which the
drug-bearing plants must be isolated from other plants to prevent
cross-pollination is double the usual distance used by seed
companies to assure purity of their seeds, he said. And although
genetically modified food crops are often deregulated after the
product becomes commercial, he added, the planting of
drug-containing crops is likely to be regulated forever.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman C. Ellstrand, a professor of genetics at the
University of California at Riverside and an expert on pollen flow,
said that long-distance pollen flow is poorly understood and that
the appropriate isolation distance for drug-producing plants would
depend on the particular crop and drug. ``It's just not clear that
setting a double distance is going to solve everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, biopharming lies on the border of medical biotechnology,
which has been largely free of controversy, and food biotechnology,
which has been beset by protests.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives in the fledgling industry say that because
medicines clearly help people, their activity is not generating the
same kind of resistance as the production of genetically modified
food crops. In addition, they say, drugs are tested and regulated
far more stringently than biofoods. ``It's being received entirely
differently,'' said William White, president of Integrated Protein
Technologies, a unit of the Monsanto Co. that is trying to grow
drugs in corn.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of agricultural biotechnology say that such
companies, which underestimated the public reaction to
bioengineered foods, are repeating the mistake. Michael Hansen of
Consumers Union, for one, said the public had no idea about the
work being done to produce drugs in plants. ``Once they have an
idea, the thought of putting drugs in plants is not going to go
over well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies producing drugs in plants are already being hit.
Axis Genetics of Britain went out of business a few months ago,
saying the protests over bioengineered food had scared off
investors. Groupe Limagrain, a French seed company, says it has
been conducting its field tests in the United States because the
dispute over modified crops is greater in Europe. And Planet
Biotechnology Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., keeps the location of
its greenhouses secret to prevent possible vandalism by protesters,
as has happened to companies growing modified food products.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are considering various techniques to keep
drug-producing crops from accidentally entering the food supply,
including the implanting of a gene to turn drug-producing crops a
different color from other crops.
</P>
<P>
   Techniques are also being developed to prevent
cross-pollination. CropTech, for instance, said its tobacco would
be harvested before sexual maturity. Some drugs needed in small
quantities might be grown only in greenhouses, rather than open
fields.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just as with food, biocrops should be able to produce large
quantities of drugs at low cost, advocates say. The newest
factories now used to produce pharmaceutical proteins in
genetically modified mammalian cells can cost $100 million or more
and can produce a few hundred kilograms a year at most. Drugs made
in such factories can cost thousands of dollars per gram to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   For many biotechnology drugs already on the market, this is not
a problem because prices are high and only minuscule amounts are
needed. But some drugs under development, like an
antibody-containing cream for herpes, are likely to require much
larger quantities and not to be able to command high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot make these drugs using the old technologies,''
said White of Monsanto's Integrated Protein Technologies. ``It's
just not going to be cost effective to do so.'' White said his
company could produce 300 kilograms of a purified drug for a $10
million capital investment and a cost of $200 a gram.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Biotechnology is in clinical trials of an antibody,
produced in genetically altered tobacco, that blocks the bacteria
that cause tooth decay. Elliott L. Fineman, the chief executive,
said it would be impossible to use mammalian cells to produce the
600 kilograms a year that might be needed in a cost-effective way.
But the entire supply could be affordably produced on a single
large tobacco farm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the companies wanting to grow drugs have found the going
somewhat rough. The Large Scale Biology Corp., formerly Biosource
Technologies, did the first field test of a drug produced by a
plant in 1991 but still does not have a drug in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies are hesitant to depart from existing technology.
And some industry experts are not convinced that plants would be
cheaper when the cost of extracting the drug from the plant is
considered. ``With respect to purifying it and isolating it, a
plant can pose challenges,'' said Norbert Riedel, president of the
Baxter Healthcare Corp.'s recombinant DNA business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the production of drugs in plants faces competition
from production in the milk of genetically modified animals. This
also offers potentially high volumes at low costs, and the animal
milk companies are closer to bringing products to market. Some
already have deals signed with major drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   The plant-drug companies say their technique is safer because
mammalian cells and animal milk can introduce harmful viruses into
the drug, while plant viruses are not known to infect people.
</P>
<P>
   There could be other problems, however, including contamination
by pesticides and plant chemicals like nicotine. The FDA, which is
preparing draft guidelines for production of certain drugs, is
considering such issues as assuring that the pharmaceutical protein
does not change form during plant growth, harvesting and storage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another issue is that the sugars attached to proteins by
plants are different from those attached by animals. This could
prevent the plant-derived drug from working and could cause
allergies, said Dr. Gary A. Bannon, professor of biochemistry and
molecular biology at the University of Arkansas medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Molecular farming might not prove to be the salvation of vast
numbers of farmers since the acreage needed would probably be
small. White of Monsanto said even a drug needed in large
quantities could be produced on a few thousand acres of corn, a
mere blip compared with the roughly 77 million acres of corn grown
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandon Price, chief executive officer of CropTech, which is
working with the Virginia farmers, said 45,000 acres would be
needed to satisfy the entire worldwide demand for human serum
albumin, a blood product that his company wants to produce in
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at thousands and thousands of acres,'' said
Williams, the Virginia farmer, ``if it takes off and goes.''

LABOR LEADERS LOBBY FIERCELY TO KILL CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also moving in `w' category.) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American labor movement is mounting its biggest
lobbying campaign ever on trade matters in seeking to defeat the
Clinton administration's drive to normalize commerce with China.
Unions are holding dozens of meetings on Capitol Hill, putting
intense pressure on individual legislators back in their districts,
staging rallies and writing huge numbers of letters across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   With the House scheduled to vote on the China trade bill the
week after next, organized labor is struggling to counter the
intense lobbying of the administration and business groups, with
some labor leaders believing that their efforts will succeed in
defeating the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The members of a single union _ the Steelworkers _ have written
more than 200,000 letters urging House members to oppose the bill,
which would grant China permanent normal trade relations and pave
its way into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the House vote is too close to call, John J.
Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, has cleared much of his schedule
to hold one-on-one meetings with House members as well as sessions
with moderate Republicans, the Congressional Black Caucus and the
New York congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling them that our members take this issue very
seriously,'' Sweeney said. ``We tell them that there is absolutely
no good reason for them to support permanent normalized trade
relations with China. There is no information showing that China is
improving its human rights situation or workers rights situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has dispatched full-time coordinators to 32
congressional districts that are represented by undecided House
members. These coordinators are organizing demonstrations and
candlelight vigils, arranging meetings with lawmakers and taking
cell phones to factories so union members can inundate House
offices with phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's lobbying is often done in conjunction with religious
leaders, environmentalists and exiled Chinese dissidents. On April
12, thousands of union members crowded the halls of Congress to
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday night, 60 union members demonstrated at a Wal-Mart
in Tewksbury, Mass., which stocks many items made in China, to
pressure Rep. Martin T. Meehan, a Democrat, to vote against the
bill. This Monday, union members plan to set up a tent outside the
Alabama district office of Rep. Robert E. Cramer, a Democrat, to
urge him around the clock to oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders oppose the China bill because it does not protect
worker rights and because of China's poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Many acknowledge that defeating the bill remains an uphill
battle. President Clinton and congressional leaders, they say, will
make any deals necessary to obtain the 218 votes needed in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still neck and neck,'' said Peggy Taylor, lobbyist for
the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations, which represents 13 million union members. ``We're
not only holding our own, we're challenging them very strongly. We
can win this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional leaders say that the
bill will pass easily in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, neither side has 218 votes,'' said Commerce
Secretary William Daley, who is coordinating administration efforts
to win passage. ``Labor's been very active. The fact of the matter
is we've seen a whole host of House members struggling with this
issue. One of the main reasons they've struggled is their friends
in organized labor feel so strongly about it.'' Daley said the
House would pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and business executives assert that the
bill will help the U.S. economy and workers by increasing exports
to China. In the bill, Congress would approve the administration's
agreement with China calling on it to lower tariffs and many trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good deal,'' said William Morley, trade
lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``What can be wrong
about accepting a deal that will slash tariffs on American
exports?''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders assert that the deal will not bring about
increased exports but an exodus of American factories to China
using low-wage Chinese labor to produce for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the union members' opposition stems from a widespread
conviction that the North American Free Trade Agreement encouraged
an exodus of American industry _ and jobs _ to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, labor campaigned in vain to defeat that agreement.
Union leaders say the campaign against the China trade bill is
bigger, involving more members and a wider swath of unions.
</P>
<P>
   In one unusual move, hundreds of members of the United
Steelworkers of America at a Rubbermaid factory in Wooster, Ohio,
upset that much of the plant's operations were being transferred to
Mexico, recently wrote on the back of a bathmat and sent it to Rep.
Ralph Regula, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Ralph Regula,'' they wrote, ``We are losing 180 plus jobs
to Mexico. These products will no longer be made in the U.S.A.
Since Nafta, the biggest export has been our jobs. Don't make the
same mistake. Vote No on P.N.T.R. for China.''
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the Steelworkers, said: ``This deal
is for multinationals, not for workers. It's for multinational
companies to build plants in China and bring products back to the
United States. It's the same as the Mexican trade deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Clement, R-Tenn., acknowledged that labor's lobbying
helped sway him to oppose the bill. Noting that he was upset by
China's religious repression, he said he believed that the current
annual trade review of China helps to pressure it on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., who has met with many labor
leaders, said he was leaning toward supporting the bill. He said he
favored inserting labor rights into trade accords, but he said that
because most of America's trading partners refuse to accept such
provisions, that should not block all future labor agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney insisted that in his meetings with members of Congress,
he never threatens retribution against people who vote for the
China bill. While saying that the bill was not a litmus test, he
said union members would certainly weigh a lawmaker's stance on
China, along with other factors, in deciding whom to endorse.

   Rep. Bob Clement, R-Tenn., acknowledged that labor's lobbying
helped sway him to oppose the bill. Noting that he was upset by
China's religious repression, he said he believed that the current
annual trade review of China helps to pressure it on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., who has met with many labor
leaders, said he was leaning toward supporting the bill. He said he
favored inserting labor rights into trade accords, but he said that
because most of America's trading partners refuse to accept such
provisions, that should not block all future labor agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney insisted that in his meetings with members of Congress,
he never threatens retribution against people who vote for the
China bill. While saying that the bill was not a litmus test, he
said union members would certainly weigh a lawmaker's stance on
China, along with other factors, in deciding whom to endorse.

CHINA'S TRADE FUTURE MAY BE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HANDS

   WASHINGTON _ Southern California's congressional representatives
stand in the way of a China trade vote that's a top priority for
Hollywood studios, the industries that feed the Southland's ports
and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional bill that would give China normalized trade
relations with the United States is opposed outright by one area
congressman, Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills. Democrats Howard
Berman and Henry Waxman and Republicans Elton Gallegly and James
Rogan all are undecided. Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa
Clarita, is leaning toward a ``yes'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   House backers of the measure reported that, as of Friday, they
could count on ``yes'' votes from 140 to 145 GOP members and 70 to
80 Democrats. At least 218 votes will be needed for passage in the
435-member house, which is made up of 222 Republicans, 211
Democrats and two independents.
</P>
<P>
   Some representatives opposed to the measure cite the country's
human rights violations. Others - with the strong backing of
organized labor - say manufacturing jobs will be siphoned to China.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a black-and-white, Democrats vs. Republicans
issue. In fact, party allegiances are being shattered and ties to
constituents are being sorely tested as Congress heads toward a
scheduled May 22 showdown vote on the status of trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents, led by President Clinton, leading Republicans and
major business interests, argue that permanent normal trade
relations - or PNTR - will increase the pace of democratization and
reform in China while unleashing a multibillion-dollar trade boom
for Southern California and the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Foes, including many Democratic leaders, organized labor,
anti-communists and human rights advocates, say China cannot be
trusted to deal fairly with either its trading partners or its own
people. They advocate that Congress continue its policy of annually
reviewing China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the stakes in the PNTR debate last November when
U.S. trade negotiators announced tentative new pacts with China.
The deals, including lucrative development and distribution
opportunities for Hollywood, are all contingent on congressional
approval of PNTR.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, Congress has held a yearly vote to extend or revoke
most-favored-nation trading status for China. It has been approved
each year, although several votes have been close.
</P>
<P>
   PNTR is expected to win easily in the Senate, where supporters
include California Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
But the House roll call is still too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of Southern California's delegation found six members in
favor of PNTR, three leaning toward a ``yes'' vote, five opposed
and 10 undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a difficult decision at all,'' said Rep. David
Dreier, R-Covina, who is leading the GOP's effort for PNTR
approval. ``The single most powerful force for reform in the
5,000-year history of China is economic reform. PNTR will help get
our American values in there and undermine political repression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have voted for most favored nation status for China, but I
can't support permanent status,'' said Sherman, the Woodland Hills
Democrat. ``Under this measure, resolution of our trade disputes
with China would be settled by the World Trade Organization. But
the WTO would only deal with problems that are on the table. I'm
worried about what China will be doing under the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman and other foes (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Sherman and other foes say China has repeatedly violated past
trade pacts and copyright laws and has been heavily involved in
such activities as video piracy.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that China's business community continues to be
intertwined with the ruling Communist Party and the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must keep China on probation until the `Made in China'
label stands for fairness,'' Rep. Joe Baca, D-Rialto, told a recent
Capitol Hill labor rally. ``They must respect people, not just
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, D-Mission Hills, is among several undecided members who
want to place conditions on PNTR. Berman has indicated he will vote
in favor of the measure if it includes a provision for immediate
revocation should China attack or blockade Taiwan, a U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, R-Pasadena, has said he will support PNTR only if the
United States also agrees to give the same permanent trade status
to Taiwan. Such a move would be opposed by China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his supporters, who have made PNTR the top priority
for the president's last year in office, have so far rejected
placing any conditions on China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has produced strange political bedfellows, starting
with Democrat Clinton and Republican Dreier, who, as chairman of
the House Rules Committee, has been a leading critic of many of the
president's policies.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, both Reps. Loretta Sanchez, D-Garden Grove,
and Dana Rohrabacher, R-Huntington Beach, have announced their
opposition to PNTR - for vastly different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said she is concerned that freer trade will result in
the export of American jobs to China. She is also concerned about
China's treatment of its workers and political dissidents.
Rohrabacher sees China as a major threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not lock in advantageous trade status for the brutal
dictators in Beijing, who continually repress their own people and
threaten their democratic neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Undecided Southland Democrats face the greatest quandary as they
weigh the economic benefits of increased trade against alienating
their longtime allies in organized labor. The AFL-CIO is vehemently
opposed to PNTR, calling it a ``blank check'' that would reward a
repressive regime.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald, D-Torrance, has
received $25,500 from union political action committees for the
2000 campaign. She also represents the Port of Los Angeles area,
which stands to directly benefit from increased trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission records show that labor, through its
political action committees, provides significant campaign cash to
Democratic incumbents. But, in fact, most Southland Democrats
receive more money from business interest PACs than they do from
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant to undecided Democrats, including Rep.
Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, who is also a candidate for Los
Angeles mayor, are the rank-and-file voters whom unions can deliver
on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lois Capps, D-Santa Barbara, summed up her decision to vote
for PNTR by stating that it ``will pry open vast new markets for
Central Coast citrus and beef producers, technology and service
companies and their employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponent Sherman offers a different bottom line on the China
trade issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is China going to ship all of their toys and shoes and
clothes to if we vote it down? We're their market,'' Sherman said.
``China's economy will crumble if it stops shipping to the U.S.''

CONSENT DECREES SHIFT CITY POWER TO FEDERAL JUDGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Are the feds taking over L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   It may look that way, with some of the most powerful players in
Los Angeles - responsible for spending local tax dollars and
overseeing local programs - at the federal courthouse, not the
Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of consent decrees in the past decade, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Los Angeles Unified School
District, the Sheriff's Department and city Sanitation Bureau all
have fallen under control of federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements significantly changed how these agencies operate,
forced them to collectively spend billions of additional taxpayer
dollars and diminished local government's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Justice Department is seeking a consent decree for the
Los Angeles Police Department to correct a long pattern of alleged
civil rights abuses by officers. As a result, the city could have
to surrender some control over the LAPD and be required to spend
significant sums on specified programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pure transfer of power from elected officials to
unelected judges,'' said Ralph A. Rossum, director of the Rose
Institute of State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna
College.
</P>
<P>
   He and other critics say government agencies can become less
responsive to their residents when they surrender some of their
authority to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   They charge that government officials can be too quick to
abdicate their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes government entities need to bite the bullet and
fight vigorously against these lawsuits and take their chances,''
said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's
Association. ``It's a judgment call. We have seen districts just
chicken out.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say such settlements should be expected when local
governments are caught violating the law and failing to solve
problems over long periods of time. Having an outsider make
decisions can reduce those violations and improve service to the
disenfranchised. And in many cases, the result would have been much
worse if the agency fought the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case would've been litigated, it would've been lost and
there would've been a remedy imposed with less discretion to the
government than the consent decree (gave),'' said Erwin
Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the University of
Southern California. ``Often these cases are started because the
city's violating constitutional law.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky added that while consent decrees typically involve
ceding some control to an outside authority, they address specific
problems and do not constitute a broad takeover of an agency.
</P>
<P>
   But as some of the active consent decrees involving government
entities around Los Angeles demonstrate, that's not always the
case:
</P>
<P>
   -- To settle a lawsuit over bus overcrowding, the MTA signed a
consent decree in 1996 agreeing to expand its service by hundreds
of buses and replace its aging fleet at a faster pace. By 2004, the
agency has projected, it will have spent more than $730 million to
comply with the consent decree, including the cost of buying and
running new buses, legal fees and the special master's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides agreed to the terms, they were back in court
earlier this month arguing over an issue that illustrates one of
the dangers of consent decrees: the potential for micromanagement
by an outside authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the special master went too far,'' said MTA spokesman
Marc Littman. ``In essence he was almost running the MTA, where he
had no transit expertise. He wanted to buy particular buses and put
them on certain lines. That minutiae of detail, we felt,
overextended his authority.''
</P>
<P>
   But Constance Rice, a prominent civil rights attorney
representing the Bus Riders Union, said the MTA itself proposed
most of the consent decree, so it shouldn't be complaining about
its contents. She added that if the agency were living up to its
side of the agreement, the special master wouldn't have to be so
active.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not giving up any power,'' Rice said. ``Under the
decree, MTA always has the first crack at doing it the way it wants
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Chanda Smith Consent Decree, signed by the LAUSD in 1996,
resulted from a class-action suit filed by a parent whose daughter
twice flunked 10th grade after she was denied enrollment in a
special education program. The decree aimed to expand educational
opportunities for special education students as required by federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   The decree resulted in the creation of an independent office,
with 11 full-time employees and 20 consultants, that reports to the
courts, not school administrators. The district has spent $18
million on the consent decree, and expects to spend $34 million
next year out of a total special education budget of $888 million,
according to Assistant Superintendent Steven Mark.
</P>
<P>
   -- The city Sanitation Bureau (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   -- The city Sanitation Bureau agreed to a consent decree with
the Environmental Protection Agency in 1986 to end a lawsuit over
sewer discharge into Santa Monica Bay. The agreement set a
timetable for $2 billion in improvements at the Hyperion sewage
treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1993, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department agreed
to a consent decree to end a long-running class action suit
alleging sexual harassment and discrimination in hiring practices.
The department had to create an ombudsman office to deal with
sexual harassment complaints and spend at least $2.5 million on
improving working conditions and advancement opportunities for
women, among other changes.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs suggested that the best way
for government agencies to avoid consent decrees is to encourage
problems to be aired publicly from the beginning and then fix them
immediately, rather than letting them fester. For example, with the
LAPD, he noted that it has been clear the department has had a
civil rights problem ever since the Rodney King arrest in 1991, but
it appears little improvement has been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consent decrees are just like initiatives - they're what
people resort to when government doesn't clean up its own act,''
Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, when political resistance is encountered to
problem- solving, consent decrees allow politicians to avoid
criticism because they can blame the remedy on the courts, Rossum
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This absolves any elected politician from having to do
anything unpopular or politically sensitive,'' Rossum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're free to grandstand and complain about what the special
master and others are doing, and yet are free from having to step
up to the plate and take a swing at the ball themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency of courts to muscle in on local governments is not
just a Los Angeles phenomenon, of course, but is happening
throughout the country on an increasing basis, said Mike Alissi,
publisher of Reason magazine, put out by the conservative Reason
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem that I've heard in a number of municipalities,
even out here on the East Coast,'' said Alissi, who is based in
Connecticut. ``The courts have been very active and not hesitant at
all in going in and in a sense taking over those agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a source of never-ending frustration for the people who
used to be running those agencies to have no discretion and follow
the rules of judges who aren't in touch with the professions that
are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS A CONSENT DECREE?
</P>
<P>
   -- A consent decree is a legal term for an out-of-court
settlement. The plaintiffs and defendants in a lawsuit consent to
an agreement, which is then approved by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   -- In cases of government agencies being sued for alleged civil
rights violations, consent decrees typically focus on changes in
the agency's policies, but can also involve payment of monetary
damages if that is seen as an appropriate remedy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Consent decrees sometimes involve the appointing of a special
master, an independent authority whose job it is to interpret the
document, rule over any disputes, and make sure it is properly
carried out.

   Philosophy, the discipline for students intent on becoming
philosophers until their parents ask how much it pays, is now
within reach and available without the deep pain of tuition. For
the past few years, the writer Paul Strathern, who earned his own
philosophy degree at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, has been
distilling most of the world's best-known philosophers to 90
minutes, which, he said, is the length of a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   A godsend in this era of the short attention span, his series,
published by Ivan R. Dee, begins with ``Socrates in 90 Minutes,''
wittily compressing his life and works, and proceeds to Locke, St.
Augustine, Descartes and Sartre, among others. New books on George
Berkeley and Paul-Michel Foucault are scheduled to be published
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Strathern wanted to write about the philosophers' lives, he
said, adding in a few of their ideas. ``If you fix it that way,
people do get it,'' he said. ``It gets to them, like garlic: It
sticks to them.''

   Socrates developed a method of negatively aggressive questioning
called dialectic (the forerunner of logic). This he used in
conversation to cut through the twaddle of his adversaries and
arrive at the truth. . . .

   Socrates went on to study under the philosopher Archelaus, ``by
whom he was beloved in the worse sense.'' . . . It wasn't long
before Socrates had demonstrated to his own satisfaction that the
so-called wise men of Athens in fact knew nothing _ just like him.
So he concluded that the Delphic Oracle had been right: He  &UR; was &LR; 
the wisest man _ because he  &UR; knew &LR;  that he knew nothing. . . . One
of his best-remembered remarks is, ``The unexamined life is not
worth living.''

``When I was 15 I was only interested in studying.'' This was the
bedrock of his life, which he would later see as having been
divided into distinct stages: ``When I was 30 I began my life; at

<P>
   FATIMA, Portugal _ The Vatican Saturday disclosed the so-called
Third Secret of Fatima, which for decades has kept this shrine of
the Virgin Mary at the center of conspiracy theories and doomsday
cults, describing the secret as a vision of the 1981 assassination
attempt on the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state,
explained that the one concealed part of the prophecies revealed to
three Portuguese shepherd children by an apparition of the Virgin
in 1917 was a vision of an attempt to kill a pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `bishop clothed in white' makes his way with great effort
toward the cross amid the corpses of those who were martyred,''
Sodano told 600,000 pilgrims gathered at the sanctuary where John
Paul II had just beatified two of the shepherd children, Francisco
and Jacinta Marto, and thanked the Virgin for saving his life on
May 13, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``He too falls to the ground, apparently dead, under a burst of
gunfire,'' the cardinal said, describing the vision.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was an effort by the Vatican to put an end to
the kind of fevered speculation that has at times overshadowed the
shrine's spiritual importance to hundreds of millions of Catholics.
Versions of the secret, broadcast on hundreds of Websites (usually
under headlines like, ``Third Secret Revealed!'') range from
worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts within the Roman
Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot the pope in St.
Peter's square in 1981, told prosecutors at his trial in 1985 that
his attempt was ``connected to the third secret of the Madonna of
Fatima.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatima fanatics have held hunger strikes _ one even hijacked a
plane _ to try to force the Vatican to disclose the secret. During
John Paul's visit to the shrine in 1982, on the first anniversary
of the assassination attempt by Agca, a knife-wielding Spanish
priest tried to kill the pope, but was wrestled to the ground by
security officers.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has always credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving
his life in 1981, when the assassination fell on her feast day, May
13. After he first visited the shrine in 1982 to give thanks for
his survival, a bullet extracted from his body was placed alongside
diamonds in a gold crown worn by a statue of the Virgin. In 1991,
on the 10th anniversary of his assassination, he returned again to
give thanks for his life as well as the recent collapse of
Communism, a fate that believers say the Virgin of Fatima had also
predicted in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this solemn occasion of his visit to Fatima, his holiness
has directed me to make an announcement to you,'' Sodano said,
adding that the pope ``wishes his pilgrimage to be a renewed
gesture of gratitude to Our Lady for her protection during these
years of his papacy. This protection seems also to be linked to the
so-called third part of the secret of Fatima.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said the secret in its entirety would soon be
published by the Vatican ``after the preparation of an appropriate
commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope Saturday referred to the prophecies, speaking of
``Fatima, where these times of tribulation were foretold,'' but he
made no mention of the ``third secret.'' Instead, he once again
gave thanks ``for the goodness of God towards me, when severely
struck on that May 13, 1981, I was rescued from death.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new tribute, the pope donated to the shrine the ring given
to him by the late Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski of Poland at a prayer
service at the shrine on Friday evening. Wyszynski, whose long
fight against Communism in Poland inspired John Paul and millions
of their countrymen, told the pope after his election in 1978 that
he would lead the church into the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, dismissed rumors
that the gift was a signal that the pope was set to resign as ``150
percent wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls described the ring as ``one of the pope's most
precious possessions,'' given as an offer of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the pope put the two dead witnesses to the
Virgin's apparitions on the path of sainthood Saturday was another
sign of his devotion to the cult of Fatima. Francisco and Jacinta
Marto are the first children ever beatified by the Roman Catholic
Church who were not martyrs. Beatification is the penultimate step
before sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony, the pope, who turns 80 on Thursday, met
privately inside the basilica near the children's tombs with the
third surviving witness to the apparition, Lucia de Santos, 93, a
Carmelite nun, who believers say was the main recipient of
prophecies from the Virgin about 20th century debacles.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin of Fatima was said to have appeared before three
shepherd children on May 13, 1917, and on five later occasions.
Lucia was 10. Her cousins, Francisco and Jacinta, who were 8 and 7
at the time of the first apparition, died of influenza a few years
later. Believers say two of the Fatima secrets were revealed in
writing by Lucia de Santos in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The first foretold the end of World War I and the start of World
War II, the other predicted the spread, then the collapse of
Communism and the conversion of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That prophecy, which came with a request that the church
consecrate Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary _ John Paul II
finally consecrated the whole world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary

Joseph Ratzinger, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the

   FATIMA, Portugal _ The Vatican Saturday disclosed the so-called
Third Secret of Fatima, which for decades has kept this shrine of
the Virgin Mary at the center of conspiracy theories and doomsday
cults, describing the secret as a vision of the 1981 assassination
attempt on the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state,
explained that the one concealed part of the prophecies revealed to
three Portuguese shepherd children by an apparition of the Virgin
in 1917 was a vision of an attempt to kill a pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `bishop clothed in white' makes his way with great effort
toward the cross amid the corpses of those who were martyred,''
Sodano told 600,000 pilgrims gathered at the sanctuary where John
Paul II had just beatified two of the shepherd children, Francisco
and Jacinta Marto, and thanked the Virgin for saving his life on
May 13, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``He too falls to the ground, apparently dead, under a burst of
gunfire,'' the cardinal said, describing the vision.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was an effort by the Vatican to put an end to
the kind of fevered speculation that has at times overshadowed the
shrine's spiritual importance to hundreds of millions of Catholics.
Versions of the secret, broadcast on hundreds of Websites (usually
under headlines like, ``Third Secret Revealed!'') range from
worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts within the Roman
Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot the pope in St.
Peter's square in 1981, told prosecutors at his trial in 1985 that
his attempt was ``connected to the third secret of the Madonna of
Fatima.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatima fanatics have held hunger strikes _ one even hijacked a
plane _ to try to force the Vatican to disclose the secret. During
John Paul's visit to the shrine in 1982, on the first anniversary
of the assassination attempt by Agca, a knife-wielding Spanish
priest tried to kill the pope, but was wrestled to the ground by
security officers.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has always credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving
his life in 1981, when the assassination fell on her feast day, May
13. After he first visited the shrine in 1982 to give thanks for
his survival, a bullet extracted from his body was placed alongside
diamonds in a gold crown worn by a statue of the Virgin. In 1991,
on the 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt, he returned
again to give thanks for his life as well as the recent collapse of
Communism, a fate that believers say the Virgin of Fatima had also
predicted in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this solemn occasion of his visit to Fatima, his holiness
has directed me to make an announcement to you,'' Sodano said,
adding that the pope ``wishes his pilgrimage to be a renewed
gesture of gratitude to Our Lady for her protection during these
years of his papacy. This protection seems also to be linked to the
so-called third part of the secret of Fatima.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said the secret in its entirety would soon be
published by the Vatican ``after the preparation of an appropriate
commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope Saturday referred to the prophecies, speaking of
``Fatima, where these times of tribulation were foretold,'' but he
made no mention of the ``third secret.'' Instead, he once again
gave thanks ``for the goodness of God towards me, when severely
struck on that May 13, 1981, I was rescued from death.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new tribute, the pope donated to the shrine the ring given
to him by the late Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski of Poland at a prayer
service at the shrine on Friday evening. Wyszynski, whose long
fight against Communism in Poland inspired John Paul and millions
of their countrymen, told the pope after his election in 1978 that
he would lead the church into the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, dismissed rumors
that the gift was a signal that the pope was set to resign as ``150
percent wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls described the ring as ``one of the pope's most
precious possessions,'' given as an offer of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the pope put the two dead witnesses to the
Virgin's apparitions on the path of sainthood Saturday was another
sign of his devotion to the cult of Fatima. Francisco and Jacinta
Marto are the first children ever beatified by the Roman Catholic
Church who were not martyrs. Beatification is the penultimate step
before sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony, the pope, who turns 80 on Thursday, met
privately inside the basilica near the children's tombs with the
third surviving witness to the apparition, Lucia de Santos, 93, a
Carmelite nun, who believers say was the main recipient of
prophecies from the Virgin about 20th century debacles.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin of Fatima was said to have appeared before three
shepherd children on May 13, 1917, and on five later occasions.
Lucia was 10. Her cousins, Francisco and Jacinta, who were 8 and 7
at the time of the first apparition, died of influenza a few years
later. Believers say two of the Fatima secrets were revealed in
writing by Lucia de Santos in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The first foretold the end of World War I and the start of World
War II, the other predicted the spread, then the collapse of
Communism and the conversion of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That prophecy, which came with a request that the church
consecrate Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary _ John Paul II
finally consecrated the whole world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary
in 1984 _ made Fatima an ideological shrine for anti-Communists
throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Fatima, like the rest of Portugal, also had fascist links during
World War II, when Portugal was neutral under the rightwing
dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, but traded with the Nazi regime.
Earlier this month, the rector of the sanctuary, Luciano Guerra,
confirmed news reports that in 1976 Fatima received Nazi gold bars
bearing the Third Reich insignia looted from Jews during the war,
and sold them in 1982 and 1986 to finance construction projects at
the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the third secret, which legend says was delivered to
the Vatican in a sealed envelope in 1943 and has been kept secret
by all the popes who have seen it, that has kept Fatima at the
center of apocalyptic fears and controversy. Vatican officials did
not say why the secret was not revealed sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Many pilgrims, some wearing baseball hats emblazoned with the
names of Jacinta and Francisco, cheered after Sodano delivered his
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that the pope knew the prophecy and survived
it,'' said Lucia Dias, 31, a lawyer from Sintra, who added that she
had once believed that the ``third secret'' was a prophecy of World
War III. She made her own prediction about the pope. ``I think now

CALIFORNIA PLAN WOULD EXEMPT TEACHERS FROM INCOME TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive) 
By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a striking gesture of support for public
education, Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday proposed to exempt all
California public school teachers from the state's personal income
tax, in what state officials said they believed was the first such
peacetime exemption for any occupation in American history.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the proposal, part of the governor's
revised budget package to be announced on Monday, would amount to
an income tax cut of $1,350 for the average experienced California
teacher, who earns about $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state has about 283,000 public school teachers, and the
estimated annual cost of the program, which requires legislative
approval, would initially be $545 million out of a total statewide
budget of about $88 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the governor proposed to spend another $500
million a year to reward teachers whose schools show improvements
in student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, teachers whose schools show an improvement rate
of 20 percent or more based on the state's new academic performance
index, which ranks schools according to standardized tests, would
receive bonuses of $5,000 each, while others would receive lesser
amounts based on their schools' performances.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to a form of merit pay that rewards collective
achievement by an entire school, as opposed to individual teachers,
which education unions generally oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took office two years ago vowing to make education his
``first, second and third'' priority.
</P>
<P>
   But as a fiscal conservative, cautious to a fault, he has also
faced growing criticism for not moving swiftly enough in a booming
economy to redress the severe educational problems in a state that
once led the nation in per-pupil spending and investments in
education but that since the tax revolt of Proposition 13 in 1978
has seen itself slip toward the bottom in numerous national
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the first Democrat to lead the state in 16 years, had
faced pressure from fellow Democrats in Sacramento and especially
sharp attacks from the state's largest teachers' union, which had
threatened to sponsor a statewide ballot initiative this fall that
would have required California to return its per-pupil spending,
which has lagged in the bottom third of states in recent years, to
the national average over the next five years. Davis has opposed
that measure as requiring a costly tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the union agreed to drop the measure after the
governor proposed an additional $1.8 billion in discretionary
spending for education, intended to compensate for the lean years
of the early 1990s, when teachers were forced to do without
cost-of-living increases in wages to help close looming budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with a projected budget surplus of $11 billion to $13
billion, the challenge has been how to spend the unexpected money.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Davis aides said the idea of the tax exemption for
teachers arose at a brainstorming session in a staff retreat last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a huge statement about the importance of teaching,''
said one senior adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``What are the Republicans going to say? They and the teachers are
going to be hard pressed to oppose this.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, legislative Republicans have said they believe there is
room in the budget to spend perhaps an additional $3 billion on
education, and while they may well be wary of anything that looks
like special treatment for the teachers' unions, it seems likely
that they would have trouble objecting to the symbolism of Davis'
gesture, which was held in extraordinary secrecy by the governor's
staff over the last week so as to make a maximum public splash.
</P>
<P>
   Davis aides said their research had shown various past tax
exemptions for certain employee groups, but only in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Davis plan, public school teachers would be permitted
to deduct 100 percent of their teaching income on state personal
income tax returns. The estimated tax relief for a beginning
teacher would be $500 a year, rising to $1,350 for experienced
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break for teachers is just one element of Davis'
proposals for doling out the budget surplus. Other plans include a
$150 rebate for every income-tax payer to the state, and $300 for
couples who file joint returns, at a total cost of $1.76 billion.
Other measures include cutting state parks fees in half.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the State speech in January, Davis acknowledged
that California must spend more to return its schools to the
post-sputnik era achievements of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even more important, we must spend wisely,'' Davis said
then. ``We cannot win this battle simply by throwing money at it.
We must not let taxpayer dollars be wasted on bureaucracy, but,
instead, we must invest them directly into the classroom: for
students and for teachers.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is certain that the 127
people who have been executed in Texas during his tenure were all
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that every person that has been put to death in
Texas, under my watch, has been guilty of the crime charged, and
has had full access to the courts,'' Bush said on the NBC News
program ``Meet the Press'' in February.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Texas, which under Bush has executed more people
than any other state, some of the officials who administer the
death penalty, reviewing the case records, considering inmates'
appeals and weighing final pleas for clemency, are not so sanguine.
These officials, who support Bush's presidential candidacy and
believe in the death penalty, said in interviews that they believed
Texas ran the risk of executing an innocent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the death penalty and I don't want to do anything
that will cause George Bush to lose the election,'' said Paddy Lann
Burwell, a retired Exxon manager who was appointed by the governor
two years ago to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which
reviews all clemency requests in capital cases and makes
recommendations to the governor. Still, in an interview at his
cattle ranch outside Westhof, south of Austin, Burwell voiced
concerns about the fairness of the state's judicial system,
particularly several cases in which he said prosecutors seemed more
concerned with scoring victories, in the form of capital
convictions, than with justice.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Burwell said, he thinks the system is conscientiously
administered. ``But I worry that we may execute an innocent
person,'' he said. ``Any person would know that is a possibility. I
think our system needs to be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the board, Tom Moss, a retired federal parole
officer, talked about his vote for clemency for Troy Farris, who
was executed for killing a police officer. The Farris case, Moss
said, was one of two cases in which he ``saw something that may
have indicated that they were innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Tauss, who has studied law, is also on the board. She
said she ``cried all day'' after Texas executed Farris. ``I wasn't
sure he should have been given the death penalty,'' she said.
``That's why I voted to commute.'' A majority of the 18-member
board would have to have voted for clemency in order to make a
recommendation of it to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Baird, a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
until 1998, was in Washington this week to announce the formation
of a national committee to prevent wrongful executions. Asked
whether he agreed with Bush that no one had been wrongfully
executed under his watch, Baird said: ``Everyone in Texas hopes and
prays that that's the case. I do not share his view.'' For such
certainty to exist, he added, ``You have to take the position that
this very fallible system has worked flawlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, along with other law enforcement officials and death
penalty lawyers, agrees that some of the conditions that have
created doubt elsewhere and have sent innocent people to death row
in other states _ especially bad lawyers, a lack of resources for
lawyers to mount a vigorous defense, and overzealous prosecutors _
exist in abundance in Texas. The state also has endemic problems,
including elected judges who are under political pressure to mete
out the death penalty and a speeded-up appeals process with an
unusually low reversal rate, which trouble some officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
   A System's Built-in Risks
</P>
<P>
   No one can point with certainty to a case in which an innocent
person has been executed here since Texas reinstated the death
penalty in 1976. Death penalty lawyers say it is almost impossible
to prove a dead man was innocent; once a person is executed,
crucial evidence that might prove innocence disappears and lawyers
and investigators want to put their resources into trying to save
clients who are still on death row.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look by The New York Times at a half dozen
executions carried out during Bush's tenure _ including interviews
with jurors, prosecutors, judges, witnesses and co-defendants still
on death row _ makes clear that a legal and judicial system rife
with these conditions creates, at the very least, the risk of an
innocent person being sent to death row. Although most of the
officials interviewed said they believed that the executed men were
guilty, they questioned aspects of the legal system that sent them
to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country there have been 87 exonerations in the last
27 years, more than a third of them in the last seven years. These
cases have prompted a growing national concern over executions. In
January, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who supports
the death penalty, announced a moratorium on executions while a
thorough review is conducted of the state's criminal justice
system. Ryan, who is Bush's state campaign chairman, described his
state's system, where 13 death row inmates have been exonerated
since 1987, 11 of them since 1994, as ``fraught with error.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven death row inmates were exonerated in Texas from 1983 to
1997 after evidence of witnesses who had lied, mistaken
eyewitnesses and prosecutorial misconduct led to the discovery of
their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, 13 states have had bills pending that would
have halted executions. Asked on ``Meet the Press'' if he would
consider following the lead of Ryan, Bush said he would not. Asked
why he thought Ryan had taken the action, Bush answered: ``Maybe
they've had some problems in their courts. Maybe they've had some
faulty judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined an interview request for this article. His top
criminal justice policy adviser, Johnny Sutton, answered questions
about Bush's criminal justice record and some specific capital
cases in a lengthy telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the harsh reality of the death penalty
and we take that responsibility very seriously,'' said Sutton, a
former prosecutor. ``This is probably the most important thing we
do in state government. The governor takes it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite glaring examples of bad lawyering at the trial level in
Texas, including at least three widely publicized cases of lawyers
who have slept through the proceedings, the state appeals court has
reversed only eight death penalty cases in the last five years,
while affirming the convictions and death sentences in 256 cases,
according to court statistics. This is the lowest reversal rate in
capital cases in the country. In contrast, Florida, which ranks
behind Texas with the nation's third-highest death row population,
has a 50 percent reversal rate. Illinois' rate is nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Farris case, the one that caused Tauss of the parole
commission to break down into tears, the Court of Criminal Appeals
said there was no forensic evidence to link Farris to the crime or
to support the testimony of the two key witnesses against him. But
the appeals court upheld the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an unusual move, seven members of the state parole
board voted for clemency, but 10 opposed it and one abstained.
Farris was executed in January 1999. During Bush's tenure, the
parole board has granted clemency to only one death row inmate,
according to the board's statistics; as of the end of April, it had
rejected 68 clemency petitions.
</P>

<P>
   Texas Leads in Executions
</P>
<P>
   Since George W. Bush took office in 1995, Texas has put to death
more than twice as many people as the next state, Virginia, with
52, and more than all the executions put together in the next four
states _ Missouri with 31, Oklahoma with 21, South Carolina with 20
and Arizona with 18. Texas has 12 executions scheduled for May and
June. The state has 462 people on death row, second only to
California, with 561 death row inmates (California, in contrast,
has executed eight people). Ann W. Richards, the liberal Democratic
governor who preceded Bush, presided over the executions of a
then-record 50 death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike juries in many states, those in Texas do not have the
option of life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been praised by victims' rights groups. ``The families
of victims want resolution,'' said Dianne Clements, the president
of one group in Houston, Justice for All. Her 13-year-old son
Zachary was killed nine years ago in an accidental shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer number of executions in Texas, a fiercely
pro-death-penalty state, has attracted criticism. The cases of two
Texas death row inmates, David Spence and Odell Barnes, drew
considerable national attention around the time of their executions
(Spence was sent to his death in 1997, Barnes two months ago).
Questions about their innocence were raised by their lawyers and
news organizations. In the Spence case, one of the state's
investigators expressed doubt after the trial about Spence's
involvement in the murder for which he was convicted. In the Barnes
case, there were questions about forensic evidence. There were
accusations of police misconduct in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases examined by The New York Times also raise lingering
questions of possible innocence. More broadly, the cases expose
systemic failings in the administration of the death penalty in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One of those failings is a pattern of overzealous prosecution.
In the case of James Lee Beathard, for example, who was executed in
1999, the prosecutor, in a subsequent trial, branded the chief
witness against Beathard a liar and offered a different version of
who committed the murders.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of legal resources available to murder defendants in
Texas may have sealed the fate of David Castillo, an impoverished
high school dropout, who was convicted of murdering a liquor store
owner. Castillo's defense was hampered by the court's refusal to
give him an additional $600 for an investigator, and his
court-appointed lawyers failed to prepare character witnesses who
might have persuaded the jury to spare his life. He was executed in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush vetoed a modest indigent defense bill that its
backers said would have improved the quality of representation in
criminal cases. It would have given counties the authority to set
up public defender offices, which only a handful now have, and
curbed the power of judges to appoint their friends and campaign
contributors to represent indigents. For a small-town practitioner,
these appointments can be a lucrative source of income; to remain
in the good graces of the judges who dole them out, some lawyers
feel bound to move cases quickly. The bill would also have required
that a lawyer be appointed within 20 days after a person is
arraigned. There is no limit now.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his veto at the time, Bush said, among other things,
that the bill would not improve legal counsel for the poor. Asked
about the bill on ``Meet the Press,'' Bush said he could not
remember it, though he insisted that he was ``for public
defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas also puts a premium on the speed of its executions, aided
by an appeals court that rarely overturns capital cases and a
clemency board that has voted only once to stop an execution.
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on speed hurt Jerry Lee Hogue. Although there was
strong evidence, including two eyewitnesses, that he had committed
the arson-murder for which he was convicted, on the eve of his
scheduled execution nearly 20 years later a law enforcement
official had gnawing doubts. The official, Joseph Stewart, an arson
investigator in Wichita Falls, arrested a man for a different arson
who it turned out had been at the arson for which Hogue had been
convicted. The arsons seemed disturbingly similar, Stewart said in
an interview, and he called Bush's office several times, pleading
for a reprieve of 30 days in order to pursue the new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a defense lawyer, I'm a Texas peace officer,'' said
Stewart, a death penalty supporter who has voted for Bush and has
been in law enforcement since he was 21. For this reason he thought
Bush would listen to him. He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said that the governor had rejected Stewart's entreaties
because ``the jury decision was right.'' The execution of Hogue on
March 11, 1998, left Stewart with grave doubts about how the death
penalty is administered. ``Being in law enforcement, I am not
against the death penalty,'' he said in an interview in the county
building in tiny Crowell. ``I had always assumed there was a good
set of checks and balances. I was pretty disillusioned afterward.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Blow to Death Row Inmates
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the state has appointed all death row inmates'
lawyers for post-conviction review. But the Court of Criminal
Appeals controls the list of those lawyers, and many highly
qualified death penalty lawyers are not on it. There are numerous
instances of court-appointed lawyers missing crucial deadlines and
filing habeas petitions that raise few if any legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Baird, who served on the appeals court from 1989 to 1998 and
reviewed hundreds of death penalty cases, said, ``Even in cases
where the lawyers did care and worked hard to represent their
clients, they were not given the resources necessary to make that
representation effective.'' Baird, a Democrat, was defeated in his
bid for re-election to the court and is now teaching law.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, death row inmates in Texas had access to a federally
financed resource center, whose lawyers handled post-conviction
appeals, helped pro bono firms with those appeals, and monitored
all death cases in the system to make sure that everyone had a
lawyer. The Texas resource center, which helped several death row
inmates gain exoneration, closed after Congress eliminated its
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Semel, who directs the American Bar Association's
Death Penalty Representation Project, finances two lawyers for the
nonprofit Texas Defender Service, but she said that her effort
cannot begin to make up for the loss of the resource center.
</P>
<P>
   Other states provide considerable resources to death row inmates
seeking to prove their innocence. Most states, for example, have
post-conviction offices. Illinois put state money into a
post-conviction office after its federal resource center closed.
Illinois also has a tradition of private law firms working pro bono
on capital cases. In addition, a journalism class at Northwestern
University specializes in investigating the innocence claims of
death row inmates. With this system in place, evidence has been
uncovered that has led to the exonerations of 13 death row inmates
in Illinois since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Parole Board Criticized
</P>
<P>
   The Texas pardons and paroles board, another institution that is
supposed to safeguard against the execution of the innocent, has
been criticized for meeting in private, voting by fax and not being
required to give reasons for decisions. The board members are
appointed by the governor to six-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on a lawsuit filed by death row inmates in December 1988,
Judge Sam Sparks of the U.S. District Court in Austin called the
board's procedures ``appalling,'' and held that they barely met the
minimal procedural safeguards required by the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board would not have to sacrifice its conservative
ideology to carry out its duties in a more fair and accurate
fashion,'' the judge ruled. The judge said it was up to the Texas
Legislature to make any changes. Bush said he saw no need for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the rate of clemency is so low, lawyers may not
always put their full energies into applying for it, said a former
lawyer in the governor's general counsel office from 1989 to 1998,
Jim Sallans, who reviewed hundreds of clemency petitions in capital
cases. He said he ``supports the way Governor Bush handles clemency
in capital cases,'' and he said he had no doubt that all those
executed under the governor were guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But he faulted the preparation of many clemency petitions and
the quality of legal representation for some death row inmates
making their final pleas for mercy. ``Too many clemency petitions
were hastily prepared, and poorly written,'' Sallans said. ``The
attorneys would often call up and ask us for a response, and we
would politely tell them that we were doing our best with what
little they had submitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has never witnessed an execution, weighs all clemency
petitions, as well as all other cases set for execution, sometimes
several days, or more, before an execution, sometimes the morning
of the lethal injection. His powers to act are limited by the
recommendations of the parole board, except that he may grant a
30-day reprieve on his own. He has never done so.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, unlike many other states, there is no office in Texas
that systematically tracks the cases of the nearly 500 condemned
inmates. As the pace of executions quickens, with 20 scheduled to
die over the next four months, the handful of death penalty lawyers
struggle to keep abreast of as many cases as possible.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Maurie Levin, who runs a one-person branch of the
Texas Defender Service in Austin that handles death penalty
appeals, with financing from the American Bar Association's Death
Penalty Representation Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters keep calling, asking, ``Got an innocence case?'''
Levin said the other day. She threw up her hands in frustration.
``How would we know?''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is certain that the 127
people who have been executed in Texas during his tenure were all
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that every person that has been put to death in
Texas, under my watch, has been guilty of the crime charged, and
has had full access to the courts,'' Bush said on the NBC News
program ``Meet the Press'' in February.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Texas, which under Bush has executed more people
than any other state, some of the officials who administer the
death penalty, reviewing the case records, considering inmates'
appeals and weighing final pleas for clemency, are not so sanguine.
These officials, who support Bush's presidential candidacy and
believe in the death penalty, said in interviews that they believed
Texas ran the risk of executing an innocent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the death penalty and I don't want to do anything
that will cause George Bush to lose the election,'' said Paddy Lann
Burwell, a retired Exxon manager who was appointed by the governor
two years ago to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which
reviews all clemency requests in capital cases and makes
recommendations to the governor. Still, Burwell voiced concerns
about the fairness of the state's judicial system, particularly
several cases in which he said prosecutors seemed more concerned
with scoring victories, in the form of capital convictions, than
with justice.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Burwell said, he thinks the system is conscientiously
administered. ``But I worry that we may execute an innocent
person,'' he said. ``Any person would know that is a possibility. I
think our system needs to be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the board, Tom Moss, a retired federal parole
officer, talked about his vote for clemency for Troy Farris, who
was executed for killing a police officer. The Farris case, Moss
said, was one of two cases in which he ``saw something that may
have indicated that they were innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Tauss, who has studied law, is also on the board. She
said she ``cried all day'' after Texas executed Farris. ``I wasn't
sure he should have been given the death penalty,'' she said.
``That's why I voted to commute.'' A majority of the 18-member
board would have to have voted for clemency in order to make a
recommendation of it to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Baird, a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
until 1998, was in Washington this week to announce the formation
of a national committee to prevent wrongful executions. Asked
whether he agreed with Bush that no one had been wrongfully
executed under his watch, Baird said: ``Everyone in Texas hopes and
prays that that's the case. I do not share his view.'' For such
certainty to exist, he added, ``You have to take the position that
this very fallible system has worked flawlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, along with other law enforcement officials and death
penalty lawyers, agrees that some of the conditions that have
created doubt elsewhere and have sent innocent people to death row
in other states _ especially bad lawyers, a lack of resources for
lawyers to mount a vigorous defense, and overzealous prosecutors _
exist in abundance in Texas. The state also has endemic problems,
including elected judges who are under political pressure to mete
out the death penalty and a speeded-up appeals process with an
unusually low reversal rate, which trouble some officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
   No one can point with certainty to a case in which an innocent
person has been executed here since Texas reinstated the death
penalty in 1976. Death penalty lawyers say it is almost impossible
to prove a dead man was innocent; once a person is executed,
crucial evidence that might prove innocence disappears and lawyers

innocent person being sent to death row. Although most of the
officials interviewed said they believed that the executed men were
guilty, they questioned aspects of the legal system that sent them
to their deaths.

reversed only eight death penalty cases in the last five years,
while affirming the convictions and death sentences in 256 cases,
according to court statistics. This is the lowest reversal rate in
capital cases in the country. In contrast, Florida, which ranks
behind Texas with the nation's third-highest death row population,
has a 50 percent reversal rate. Illinois' rate is nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>

   Raw potatoes might not be most people's idea of a delicious
meal, especially if the potatoes have been genetically modified to
contain a protein from the Norwalk virus, which causes vomiting and
diarrhea. But when 20 volunteers in Baltimore ate such potatoes,
the viral protein not only did no harm; it stimulated an immune
response in 19 of them that might prevent them from becoming sick
if they ever encounter the real virus.
</P>
<P>
   The test, conducted last year, was one of the first clinical
trials of a so-called edible vaccine. Some day, some scientists
say, people might be protected from disease by eating special
bananas, tomato paste or crackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather eat a candy bar or would you rather get a
needle?'' said John Howard, chief executive of ProdiGene, a company
in College Station, Texas, that is working on edible vaccines in
corn.
</P>
<P>
   Edible vaccines could be especially important for developing
countries, which often lack resources to distribute and preserve
injectable vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   The Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y., developed the anti-Norwalk-virus potato
and has done early clinical trials on potatoes containing vaccines
for hepatitis B and for the diarrhea-causing illness known as
travelers disease. Scientists in Poland working with Dr. Hilary
Koprowski of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia have
tested a hepatitis B vaccine contained in lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous obstacles must still be overcome, so it is likely to be
several years before such vaccines reach the market.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge will be to shift to foods that are more commonly
eaten raw, since cooking could destroy the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the desired protein is often produced in the food
at extremely low levels, and proteins are destroyed by acids in the
stomach. Such factors could make it hard, particularly for infants,
to eat enough to get a proper dose. Assuring a consistent dose is
another problem.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, some scientists say that using a raw fruit or
vegetable as a vaccine is impractical. Some processing will be
necessary to concentrate the vaccine and assure a consistent dose,
said Dr. Hugh S. Mason, who has been developing the vaccines at
Boyce Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Its next trials will use tomatoes ground into powder and then
turned into a paste or juice by adding water. This concentrated
tomato juice would have to be pasteurized and maybe refrigerated to
keep out other harmful organisms. That could limit the practicality
of the vaccine in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shengwu Ma of the London Health Sciences Center in London,
Ontario, hopes to use edible vaccines to treat autoimmune diseases,
in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. He wants
to induce what is known as oral tolerance, the tendency of the body
generally not to mount an immune attack on foods.
</P>
<P>
   Ma has developed genetically modified potatoes containing a
protein known as GAD, which is found in the pancreas cells that are
attacked by the immune system of people with juvenile diabetes. The
idea is that if the immune system thinks GAD is food, it might
reduce its attacks on the GAD-containing pancreas cells. Tests on
mice have been promising.

UNIVERSITY'S OWNER SETTLES FEDERAL DISPUTE OVER STUDENT AID
</HEADLINE>
 - PHOENIX - AUDIT-NYT c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The University of Phoenix, a leader in providing
higher education to adults, has improperly allowed students to
obtain millions of dollars in federal loans and grants, the
inspector general for the Department of Education has found.
</P>
<P>
   The government's review concluded that students had obtained
more than $50.6 million in federal loans and $4 million in Pell
Grants in excess of the amounts they were entitled to receive. The
financial aid is granted to students to help with tuition and other
expenses. The audit recommended that the university pay back the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company of the university, the Apollo Group of
Phoenix, disputed the auditors' findings in documents released with
the report on March 31. But a spokeswoman with the Department of
Education said that the company had agreed to a $6 million
settlement at the time of the report.
</P>
<P>
   From October 1995 through September 1997, the university, which
is run as a for-profit business, distributed $339 million in
federal loans and nearly $9 million in Pell Grants, awards that
help low-income families pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   When the report was issued, Todd S. Nelson, the president of the
Apollo Group, said in a statement, ``There is no basis either in
statute or regulation for this assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Nelson said that by settling the
dispute, the Apollo Group had avoided an estimated $3 million to $4
million it would have cost to appeal the case. ``That would be
unfair for the students,'' he said. ``We are glad to have this
resolved.''

   Government auditors found that the school did not provide its
students enough instructional time to qualify for much of the
federal loans and grants. The university also included
cost-of-living expenses inappropriately when determining financial
need for students enrolled in correspondence courses, the review
found.

<P>
   The university measures its educational programs in credit
hours, but does not use a semester, trimester or quarter system.
</P>
<P>
   To receive federal funds, institutions that do not follow the
standard approach must provide 12 hours of regularly scheduled
instruction, examinations or preparation for examinations during
each week of instructional time. This regulation, known as the
12-hour rule, requires the equivalent of at least 360 instructional
hours per academic year.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general found that the university's academic year
provided only 180 instructional hours, with the university relying
primarily on student study groups instead of classroom time. That
meant that some students were not eligible for the aid they
received.

<P>
   The University of Phoenix enrolls more than 74,000 students at
sites in 15 states in undergraduate and graduate degree programs
and certificate programs, making it the largest private accredited
university for working adults, according to the school's Web site.
Students must be at least 23 and employed. The university also
offers online degree programs.

   The university's owner, the Apollo Group, is a rapidly growing
provider of higher education for working adults. It operates three
other educational services in addition to the University of
Phoenix. The company, whose stock began trading in 1994, had $59
million in net income for the fiscal year that ended in August.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much more pleasant weather is expected along the Atlantic
seaboard as drier air streams into the region on an active breeze
from the northwest. Colder air above 5,000 feet will move from the
Great Lakes across the northern Ohio Valley and into the
Appalachians. As a result, clouds will develop and a few light
showers will be scattered around the region Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and seasonably cool conditions will dominate the middle of
the nation. But a return flow of sultry air into the southwest
Plains will produce showers and a few heavy thunderstorms, mainly
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A large storm off the coast of Northern California will send a
plume of clouds across the Northwest with showers moving inland
from northwest California to Oregon. The Southwest will stay sunny
and seasonably hot.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: POTENT JET STREAM
</P>
<P>
   The mercury rose to 105 degrees in Del Rio, Texas, on Friday
afternoon for the highest reading there so early in May. At nearby
Laughlin Air Force Base, the temperature hit 108. Meanwhile, by
Saturday morning, the temperature plunged to a record low of 23
degrees at Denver's international airport, one of the lowest
readings so late in the season. These large thermal contrasts help
to drive the jet stream. Winds at 30,000 feet over the southern
Rockies were very strong last week. This powerful jet stream will
begin to reconfigure the weather pattern across the nation this
week. &QL;

   &UR;  &LR; ALONG THE GUNFLINT TRAIL, Minn. _ It took 20 minutes for the
fierce windstorm last summer to flatten the towering boreal forest
surrounding Bruce Kerfoot's Gunflint Lodge at the edge of the
boundary waters in northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As if a giant hand had swept across the lakeside resort his
family has owned for three generations, Kerfoot's 80 acres were
toppled into a litter of spruce, ash and centuries-old white pine
stacked like kindling and all eerily pointed east.
</P>
<P>
   ``It nails your psyche,'' he said, recalling the powerful storm
cell that produced downdrafts of 130 mph with the force of a
hurricane. In the end, 25 million trees were destroyed along nearly
half a million acres through the heart of Minnesota's remote and
treasured Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness near the Canadian
border.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one year later, as foresters and resort owners still
struggle to clear trails and restore cabins, they face the prospect
of large and destructive wildfires, made more likely by the thick
blanket of drying logs, leaves and needles left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of if a large fire happens,'' said Paul
Tine, a fuels specialist with the U.S. Forest Service in Grand
Rapids, Minn., who has studied the fire danger. ``It's a question
of when a large fire happens. So we're preparing people as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   For fire officials here, who have collectively tapped more than
$4 million in special state and federal funds, preparations to
fight such a fire are unusual in the state's history. Since the
start of the fire season last month, the area has been surrounded
by extra crews, firefighting aircraft, increased air patrols,
milelong mobile sprinklers, heliports and cooperative emergency
networks within range of the 1.1 million acres of wilderness, which
is the most visited of all protected wild lands in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to this is far different from the response to
other blowdowns I've seen,'' said Lee Frelich, a forestry
researcher at the University of Minnesota who has studied such
events for 20 years. ``The boundary waters has this mystique about
it _ this canoe country with the rocky islands and beautiful lakes.
It's a signature, an icon for the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires have always been part of the boundary waters ecology.
Every year, dozens of smaller blazes move within the islands amid
1,000 lakes, clearing deadwood for new growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a study commissioned by the U.S. Forest Service in January
shows a changed course of events for a fire in the blowdown,
particularly in the worst-hit section of the wilderness, where
drying trees are stacked as much as 20 feet high along a corridor
40 miles long and 8 miles wide. There, a fire could start more
easily, become hotter and spread more quickly, even on days when
humidity usually reduces the risk of fire, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   If the wind is swift and the air is dry, as it can be during the
northern Minnesota summers, computer models also show that a
wilderness fire might fan into a ``plume-dominated'' blaze like the
one that swept through Yellowstone National Park in 1988 _ a fire
so large it creates its own weather system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're talking miles of fuels without any break,'' said Olin
Phillips, who is in charge of fire suppression for the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials are preparing for the worst as
Minnesota faces an unusually dry year. Campfires have been banned
in the blowdown area. The forest service is seeking congressional
approval for controlled burns in the wilderness to create
firebreaks on as much as 80,000 acres starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for this fire season, which peaks now and again in
late summer, the strategy will be ``aggressive, immediate initial
attack'' from the air, said Jim Thomas, fire and aviation manager
of the Superior National Forest, which oversees the wilderness
area.
</P>
<P>
   Forest officials say such air power is even more critical in the
wilderness, accessible only by canoe and where a large fire could
threaten Canadian commercial forests to the north or U.S. resort
areas in the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take hours to paddle people in,'' Thomas said. ``The
faster we get there, and the sooner we keep it small, the better
chance we have.''
</P>
<P>
   A major concern is the summer homes and resorts along the
Gunflint Trail, which runs 70 miles inland from Lake Superior on
the east side of the wilderness. In anticipation of this summer,
when the population swells with thousands of people who stay at
resorts or begin canoe treks, residents have updated evacuation
plans and installed sprinkler systems, and they are preparing to
warn visitors about fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke that two cigarettes and a campfire and you'll have a
plane over you dropping water,'' Kerfoot said.
</P>
<P>
   The forest service reports no slowdown in the number of
wilderness reservations for this summer. But some canoe outfitters
say they are seeing as much as a 15 percent decline in their
bookings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about people panicking from incorrect
information,'' said David Seaton, who runs Hungry Jack Outfitters.
``We're hoping for a Y2K II. We'll be so prepared that nothing will
happen.''

RULE-SETTING POWER OF FEDERAL AGENCIES FACES SUPREME COURT
CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: D.C., Mass., N.J.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time the Supreme Court ruled that Congress
had unconstitutionally given away too much of its lawmaking
authority to the executive branch, a majority of the justices who
sit on the court today had not even been born.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1935, and since then, the doctrine of
``nondelegation,'' which the court invoked to strike down part of a
major New Deal program, the National Industrial Recovery Act, has
appeared little more than a historical footnote. It lingered as a
quaint reminder of a formalistic approach to the constitutional
separation of powers, even as the modern administrative state, with
powerful regulatory agencies engaging in what often looks very much
like lawmaking, grew up around it.
</P>
<P>
   But while it disappeared from public view, the nondelegation
doctrine has not lacked for friends in high places: academics,
lawyers for regulated industries, as well as the occasional judge,
who found a disturbing lack of political accountability in
Congress' penchant for shifting important policy choices to
administrative agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 65 years, the issue has cycled back to the Supreme
Court. The court will announce, perhaps as early as Monday, whether
it will hear an appeal from a ruling last year that invalidated two
clean air standards issued in 1997 by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision last May by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit concerned an important issue
of environmental law, what set off shock waves was not so much the
actual ruling as its rationale: that the Clean Air Act, as
interpreted by the agency, ``effects an unconstitutional delegation
of legislative power.''
</P>
<P>
   After failing to persuade the full appeals court last fall to
reconsider the panel's 2-1 decision, the Clinton administration,
calling the case one of ``extraordinary governmental concern,''
filed a Supreme Court appeal in January. So did Massachusetts and
New Jersey, along with the American Lung Association, which had
participated at the appeals court level to defend the new clean air
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of industry groups that successfully challenged
the standards, including the American Trucking Associations, the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation,
is also urging the justices to accept the case, for the purpose of
affirming the decision that the new standards are invalid. The
coalition, in fact, wants the court to broaden the scope of the
case and decide for the first time whether the Clean Air Act
requires the Environmental Protection Agency, in setting national
standards, to engage in some form of cost-benefit analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The industry coalition argues that by reading a cost-benefit
requirement into the statute, the justices would be providing the
``intelligible principles'' that the appeals court found lacking
and would thus be able to avoid the whole sticky nondelegation
issue. Whether the justices will find industry's invitation
attractive is highly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually everyone familiar with the case, Browner vs.
American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257, assumes that the court
will grant at least the federal government's petition and decide,
in its next term, whether the nondelegation doctrine merits the new
lease on life the appeals court gave it in what Solicitor General
Seth P. Waxman's petition for the government calls a ``radical
departure from settled law.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications are enormous. ``It's the basic challenge to the
administrative state,'' Richard Lazarus, an expert in
administrative and environmental law at Georgetown University Law
Center, said in a recent interview. ``A huge amount of regulated
activity depends on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act is hardly unique in the amount of
administrative discretion it leaves in the hands of the agency; if
this law is unconstitutional on the basis of excessive delegation,
then so, plausibly, are many others, from the Communications Act of
1934, which authorized the Federal Communications Commission to
regulate broadcasting in light of ``public interest, convenience,
and necessity,'' to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which
established and placed in the judicial branch a commission charged
with establishing the range of sentences for every federal offense,
an almost quintessentially legislative power.
</P>
<P>
   These delegations and countless others _ with the exception of
two New Deal-era initiatives struck down in 1935 _ have been upheld
by the Supreme Court under a test established in a 1928 opinion by
Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Under that test, a delegation of
legislative authority will be upheld as long as Congress ``shall
lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle'' to which
the agency ``is directed to conform.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Judges Stephen Williams and Douglas Ginsburg, over
the dissent of Judge David Tatel, found lacking in the Clean Air
Act. The law directs the Environmental Protection Agency to set
national air quality standards at levels that ``in the judgment of
the administrator'' and ``allowing an adequate margin of safety''
are ``requisite to protect the public health.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court majority said that for pollutants like those
at issue in the case, ozone and fine airborne particles, for which
there is no level above zero that does not pose a health risk, the
agency lacked ``any determinate criterion for drawing lines'' and
had ``no intelligible principle by which to identify a stopping
point.'' The agency's unconfined discretion ``leaves it free to
pick any point between zero and a hair below the concentrations
yielding London's Killer Fog,'' the decision said, referring to the
4,000 deaths that occurred in a weeklong pollution crisis in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tatel's dissenting opinion and the various Supreme Court
appeals assert that the agency's process for setting its new
standards, based on dozens of studies as well as review by an
independent scientific advisory panel, bore no relationship to the
casual and high-handed approach portrayed by the appeals court
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of broad agency discretion often argue that Congress
cannot possibly make the fine-tuned scientific judgments necessary
to keep modern regulatory programs up to date, a point that
Congress recognized in the Clean Air Act by instructing the EPA to
review national air quality standards every five years.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the government petition notes, agency regulations
are always subject to being set aside as ``arbitrary and
capricious,'' a well-known administrative law concept that serves
adequately as a judicial brake on agency behavior without calling
the entire regulatory structure into question.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court majority clearly had a more expansive game
plan than setting aside a regulation or two. In a 1995 essay in the
magazine Regulation, published by the libertarian Cato Institute,
Ginsburg offered a paean to the nondelegation doctrine, which he
said had existed, along with other concepts repudiated as the
Supreme Court acquiesced in the New Deal vision of a strong
national government, for 60 years ``only as part of the
Constitution-in-exile.'' He wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory of these ancient exiles, banished for standing in
opposition to unlimited government, is kept alive by a few scholars
who labor on in the hope of a restoration, a second coming of the
Constitution of liberty _ even if perhaps not in their own
lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the eventual fate of the Clear Air Act case, Ginsburg's
words sound decidedly less out of context today than they did even
five years ago, just before the court began issuing a series of
decisions reviving a limited vision of federal power. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist has written many of those opinions, and if the
nondelegation doctrine resonates for any member of the court, it
does so for him. Twenty years ago, as an associate justice,
Rehnquist was a solitary voice in any earlier regulatory case when
he wrote, ``We ought not to shy away from our judicial duty to
invalidate unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority
solely out of concern that we should thereby reinvigorate
discredited constitutional doctrines of the pre-New Deal era.''

STREET-NAME PROPOSAL SPARKS A JEFFERSONIAN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ This American classic city is about to
acknowledge a Faulknerian chapter and consider naming a street
Hemings Way after Sally Hemings, the slave of Thomas Jefferson who,
the scholars of Monticello concede, was almost certainly the mother
of at least one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people raised with the belief that this was a moral
impossibility, it's not an easy transition,'' said Cinder Stanton,
one of the Monticello historians in the eye of a double storm.
</P>
<P>
   On one front, dissenters in the Jefferson bloodline are fighting
the latest DNA evidence of Jefferson's paternity as they heatedly
deny the kinship claims of Hemings' African-American descendants.
</P>
<P>
   On the other front, the street-naming proposal, which is
expected to move to the City Council next month, is being denounced
by some black residents as an affront to the countless other former
slave families who helped build this city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In naming Hemings to this supposed status, we are not honoring
her but Jefferson and the institution of slavery that defiled and
demeaned our ancestors,'' said Agnes Cross-White, editor of The
Tribune, the local black community newspaper. Cross-White has been
thundering against the street naming and arguing for a public
memorial far more inclusive of local slave history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we so devoid of self-esteem that we will accept and cling
to anything white because it makes us feel more valuable, more
American?'' Cross-White asked. She dismissed the street-name
proposal as an attempt to mine tourist gold from a bit of
underground history long denied by the white establishment until
modern science rendered the issue moot, at least for the keepers of
Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   On a human level, the controversy bubbling here suggests that
Jefferson's continuing legacy in this Blue Ridge Valley region
includes all the fighting that typically defines one man's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're white, we're black and we're in between,'' said Dorothy
Westerinen, prouder of bearing Hemings' blood than any tincture of
Jefferson's. She holds that both the Hemings family and American
history would be well honored by having the Hemings name on a strip
of West 10th Street, next to a Main Street motel on a plot where
Sally Hemings lived and where she died after slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Westerinen journeyed here from her home in New York last weekend
with other Hemings descendants from across the nation. They held
another inconclusive meeting with the Monticello Association, a
group of Jefferson descendants wrestling with the question of
whether to admit Hemings kin to membership, a privilege that
includes the right of burial in the cemetery on the Jefferson
estate in Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got pretty ugly,'' Westerinen said of the closed meeting.
``Most of the association members were lovely toward us, but a
faction that's splintering off from the main group grew
particularly insulting, especially toward the Monticello historians
trying to explain the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the association said in a statement that the
delay was a result of ``the complexity of the issues.'' But the new
splinter group, led by John H. Works Jr., a Jefferson descendant,
is resolved to fight the paternity finding.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, DNA test results linked the two family lines
by way of Jefferson, and in January the likelihood was confirmed on
the basis of parallel historic evidence by scholars at the Thomas
Jefferson Memorial Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not pin it on Thomas Jefferson,'' Works insisted. He
is among those who deny the evidence and argue that even if it is
valid, some other Jefferson male might have been the father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to see the truth remembered,'' said Kevin Cox, a
resident concerned that this city of 40,000 not shy away from the
rough edges of its history.
</P>
<P>
   As the two extended families ponder their disunity, the city
fathers will go ahead with consideration of the Hemings Way
proposal, Mayor Virginia Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supporting it because the whole Hemings family was very
important in our early history here,'' Daugherty said. ``Her family
eventually owned 12 different pieces of property around town. This
issue is all about our own sense of ourselves as a city and what we
would like to pass along to our children.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor is supported by Dianne Swann-Wright, one of the
Monticello historians who confirmed the paternity evidence.
Swann-Wright stresses that the Hemings tale embraces ``unknown acts
of courage, discipline and steadfastness'' that are universal in
human experience. ``I say, name the corridor after all of them, in
honor of them and in honor of us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-White of The Tribune raised the Groucho Marx question,
asking ``why anyone would want to belong to this association based
on the fact that Jefferson was a man who took lecherous advantage
of his property.'' Local blacks, the editor said, laugh off the
romantic television docudramas about the affair but pay tribute to
Hemings for having prevailed through unimaginably difficult trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she could make her life and the lives of her children more
tolerable by being the physical interest of the master, then more
power to the sister,'' Cross-White said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hemings' descendants emphasize that the issue actually
involves the larger family of America itself. They promise to
continue pressing Jeffersonian bluebloods to acknowledge their
black enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I couldn't care less about membership or where I'm
buried,'' Westerinen said. ``We want our family to recognize us, to
embrace us. And that's a very important symbolic gesture for the
rest of the nation to see. I'm proud of Sally Hemings. She put up
with a hell of a lot from him.''
</P>
<P>
   And so must this city, Cross-White said. ``We're living with
Thomas Jefferson every single day,'' she noted wearily. ``He's
still walking the streets of this city.''

CLINTON CALLS MOTHERS, NOT GUN LOBBY, THE STRONGER VOICE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Ga.)  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the nation's capital and other cities prepared
for Mother's Day demonstrations favoring stricter gun control laws,
President Clinton said the events on Sunday would show that the gun
lobby ``is no match for America's moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his regularly scheduled radio address on Saturday
to praise the Million Mom March, the label organizers have given to
nationwide demonstrations. The organizers expected to draw about
150,000 people to the main march in Washington. The president has
repeatedly spoken out for the march, urging Congress to act on gun
control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A counterdemonstration is also scheduled on Sunday in Washington
by a group of women who oppose new controls on guns. While the
larger crowd occupies the huge grassy Mall at the foot of Capitol
Hill, the counterdemonstrators, sponsored by a Dallas group called
the Second Amendment Sisters, will march nearby up Constitution
Avenue to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Million Mom March have said it is not, as
organizers characterize it, a true grass-roots movement but rather
a political operation in masquerade. But while some political
figures, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, are expected to join in
the march, the featured speakers are to be ordinary people whose
lives have been shattered by gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the organizers have lost children of their own and
other loved ones to gunfire,'' said the president, who met some of
them at the White House recently as part of his publicity campaign
on the gun issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the march is striking a deep chord in women
who have not been touched by gun violence, but who simply fear for
the safety of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Caren Appel, a 38-year-old mother of three from
Atlanta. After coordinating a companion Million Mom March in that
city, she brought her family to Washington this weekend for the
main demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my way of showing complete support for this movement,''
Appel said. ``I just felt that I personally needed to do something
so that there were no more shootings in schools. I want my children
to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Appel said she felt ``lucky that gun violence hasn't
hit me,'' she said she did have a scare recently. Her 8-year-old
daughter went to visit a friend, and came home to report that
children in the house had produced ``the family gun,'' which they
claimed was real. Appel did not pursue the issue with the other
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``From now on, if I do not know the family, I
will ask if there is a gun in the house, and I will ask if it is
locked up, and then I will decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the counterdemonstration said that their keynote
speaker would be Suzanna Gratia-Hupp, a state representative from
Texas whose parents were among 21 people killed in a rampage
shooting at a restaurant in 1991. She has said that she might have
shot the assailant and prevented the massacre if she had been
allowed by law to carry her legally owned sidearm into the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Saturday, President Clinton credited the
Million Mom March as ``a grass-roots effort that has already put
stronger laws in place in states like California, Massachusetts and
Maryland. They're letting the gun lobby know it is no match for
America's moms. But our nationwide fight won't be over tomorrow, no
matter how many march. We have so much work still to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation that Clinton favors would close a loophole
allowing the sale of some firearms at gun shows without full
background checks of the buyers; mandate child safety locks with
every handgun sold; ban high capacity ammunition clips; bar the
most violent juveniles from possessing firearms as adults, and hold
adults accountable if they allow children access to guns. He has
also proposed research on safer ``smart guns'' and a state-based
licensing system, and sought $280 million for increasing
enforcement of gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has countered with a pledge to
spend an additional $1 million on gun safety education in
elementary schools.

SIERRA LEONE'S RETURN TO WARLORD RULE DRAWS IN U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ For years, warlordism has ruled Sierra
Leone, a state in name alone. With the authority of the government
barely extending beyond Freetown, warlords have been ensconced in
different corners of the country, each with access to enough
diamond mines to buy arms. The balance of power shifted
occasionally, depending on the energies of a Nigerian-led
intervention force or mercenaries hired by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the apparent collapse of a 9-month-old peace accord,
Sierra Leone is on the verge of slipping back into warlordism. The
Nigerians, whose departure less than two weeks ago led the top
warlord, Foday Sankoh, to challenge the U.N. force, are on their
way back.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference now is that U.N. peacekeepers are in the
middle of all this, and an increasing number of British
paratroopers are under pressure to provide more muscle.
</P>
<P>
   While the peacekeepers arrived with the understanding that they
would be a neutral force, they have become allied with the Sierra
Leone army, with the soldiers of another warlord, a born-again
Christian named Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, and with a militia
controlled by Hinga Norman, nominally a deputy defense minister,
all against Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Having clambered over the back wall of his house last week when
U.N. peacekeepers were not around, Sankoh, a potbellied 63-year-old
with a reportedly bad heart, is on the run. Many suspect he has
somehow fled far from the capital, perhaps as far as Liberia, a
redoubt from which he has often marshaled his forces during this
country's 9-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, two men who have long commanded personal
militias of their own have re-emerged as power brokers. Their
troops helped repel an assault on Freetown by Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front, known as the RUF, when it became clear
that the U.N. force was unable to do that by itself.
</P>
<P>
   At ease inside his home office, wearing a green robe and
slippers, Koroma, who has retired from the Sierra Leonean army
since he briefly held power after a coup in 1997, smiled when he
was asked the number of soldiers at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say. But the number was significant, judging from
the thousands of loyalists who surfaced on the streets, armed with
automatic rifles, after he spoke on national radio. Koroma told his
men to rearm, though not before shouting, ``Jesus,'' for five
minutes at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Norman gave orders from his office inside the
Ministry of Defense. He derives his power from his Kamajor militia,
the thousands of tribal hunters who have traditionally sided with
the government. Norman's men gird themselves for battle by applying
oil to their skin, putting on wigs, mirrors and horns, and reciting
verses from the Koran and the Bible _ so that ``they will be saved
from RUF bullets,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe these things can work,'' the deputy defense minister
said.
</P>
<P>
   The re-emergence of warlordism in Sierra Leone has led experts
to draw parallels with Somalia, where the West had a traumatic
experience with peacekeeping in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity is one reason that Washington seems ready to
weather criticism rather than become directly engaged in Sierra
Leone, and that the British keep insisting they are here merely to
evacuate Europeans and offer technical assistance, even as their
presence at the front line becomes clearer day by day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra Leone is in serious danger of being mired in violence
again, with the looming possibility of turning into another
Somalia, a state now being run by bands of warlords,'' Roble
Olhaye, the ambassador from Djibouti to the United Nations, said at
the Security Council's first public debate on Sierra Leone on
Thursday. Olhaye, whose country borders Somalia, added, ``We cannot
abandon Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   In Somalia, the United Nations also found itself trying to keep
peace in a stateless territory riven by clan warfare, alongside
U.S. troops under direct U.S. command. There, too, they came to
oppose one warlord, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aideed. The operation came
to a disastrous end when 18 American soldiers were killed during an
attack on Aideed, and one American's corpse was dragged through the
streets of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia traumatized the West, especially the United States, in
such a way that the United Nations remained paralyzed in the face
of large-scale massacres in Rwanda in 1994. At least half a million
Tutsi were killed in an event that directly led to the later war in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   If Sierra Leone is considered a test of the West's resolve in
African peacekeeping, it is because Congo presents the same
problems _ though on a grander scale. Congo, where the United
Nations is considering sending a peacekeeping force, is the size of
Western Europe. There, too, the government's authority is limited
to the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko could
count on the West to provide money and arms. Now, Congolese
warlords, armies from five foreign countries, and innumerable
militias have carved up the Congo into various strongholds,
plundering its mineral riches to buy arms. President Laurent
Kabila, who was for decades a small-scale warlord in Congo's
northeast, is the head of the country's central government.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila may not be a warlord, technically. But in his persistent
efforts to block his country's peace negotiations, he is surely one
of the ``national leaders who are so insular, whose vision is so
narrow, that in their concerns about their own power and survival,
the interests of their people don't count,'' as U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Friday, describing leaders who
made peacekeeping a much more complex operation than it was in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, the warlords seem to be back at war with one
another. Even if the fighting is contained in the near future, the
warlords have gained legitimacy and power as the government and the
United Nations had no choice but to become allied with them.

</P>
<P>
   These are uneasy alliances, especially the one between the
government and Koroma. The government in theory has 5,000 soldiers,
but Koroma is considered the real force behind the military.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Koroma, now 40, overthrew the elected government of
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and then invited Sankoh's group to join him in
power. At his home on Friday, he said he had done so ``in the
interest of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we can end this war is to call these guys out of
the bush and talk to them,'' he said. ``So we invited them to come
out. If we said we are going to end it militarily, we will never
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his real motives, the Nigerians expelled him in 1998
and reinstalled Kabbah. Over the next year, Koroma and Sankoh's
followers fought fiercely together to regain power, culminating in
an attack on Freetown in January 1999, during which thousands of
civilians were killed, raped or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the peace accord was signed last July, Koroma had served
as the chairman of the committee for the consolidation of peace in
a power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found him to be reasonably remorseful of whatever it is
that he may have done in the past,'' said Septimus Kaikai, Kabbah's
spokesman. He added that, for example, Koroma on his own had
visited a Freetown camp for amputees, whereas Sankoh never had.
``We found that he was willing to work with us to resolve the
crisis in the country. And we were reasonably happy with some of
the things that he has been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a risk here?'' Kaikai said. ``If you take note of the
fact that there is risk involved in everything we do, yes, there's
a certain amount of risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah, a former U.N. Development Program official, has proved
to be a powerless, nearly irrelevant, figure who seldom leaves his
hilltop mansion. So a greater amount of risk may derive from
Koroma's alliance with Norman.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups had fought each other fiercely for years, but now
find themselves allied against Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   The Kamajors, who are mostly traditional hunters from the south,
began fighting in the early 1990s. Norman, 60, a former soldier who
was convicted of treason and imprisoned from 1968 to 1974, became
the Kamajors' leader in 1994. Made up entirely of volunteers, the
Kamajor militia are thought to number around 15,000, though Norman
claims their real number is 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quarreling bedmates,'' Norman said of his new alliance
with Koroma. ``We are trying hard to build confidence. We are not
best friends yet, but the `best' should come later.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Sankoh, he has not been spotted in Freetown since
climbing over his back wall. Many believe that without him, his
rebel group will splinter into factions led by sub-warlords.

<P>
   DORTMUND, Germany _ Time was, in this region, Grandpa worked for
Krupp, Dad worked for Krupp, and if Junior did not work for Krupp
too, everyone was aghast. Here in the heartland of German heavy
industry, the big companies took care of you, and employment was
for life.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. The Ruhr industrial area _ coal, steel, belching
chimneys, grinding machinery, polluted rivers, great heaving motor
of German postwar reconstruction and economic might _ is no more.
Many of the former pits and factories have been converted into
museums of ``industrial culture'' where old compressors adorn chic
cafes.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of the steel-and-coal men who made the Ruhrgebiet,
or Ruhr Valley, an industrial legend, meet hard-driving Josef
Brewing, 37. He heads a venture called Electronic Commerce Center,
is given to talk of ``start-up incubators,'' and is busy turning a
100-acre site occupied in Cold War days by the British Rhine Army
into a new-economy hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the biggest agglomeration of e-commerce companies
in Germany,'' said Brewing (pronounced BRER-wing). ``We opened the
first building less than a year ago and already have 17 companies
with 300 employees offering everything from Internet consulting to
software development. Within three years, we expect about 3,000
people to work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not easy to turn Pittsburgh into Palo Alto, and
it is impossible to do so overnight. But the revolution taking
place in dowdy Dortmund reflects a broader one in Germany. The land
of social-market consensus is giving way to a brasher place where
young entrepreneurs are lionized as modernizing heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the TV and chances are some high-tech upstart like
Gerhard Schmid of Mobilcom is explaining how he made millions.
Stock market reports are increasingly ubiquitous, restaurant banter
is often about bargain shares. Last year, the number of Germans
owning stocks jumped 11 percent to more than 5 million; the trend
is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wealthy don't have to hide in this country any more
because they are no longer held up as examples of greed,'' said
Michael Wolghat, an economist at Deutsche Bank. ``Germany is
changing as shareholding spreads at a rapid rate. Students now seem
less interested in politics than in price-earning ratios.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this transformation of Europe's biggest economy more
dramatic than in the Ruhr, the most concentrated industrial area of
the continent and the place where Marshall Fund money first ignited
the postwar economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began many years ago because Germany's coal cannot
compete with South Africa's, which is cheaper to mine. In the last
decade, 20 mines have closed. The unemployment rate, at 16 percent
in Dortmund, is still well above the national average of 10
percent; the few vestiges of the coal industry are heavily
subsidized and perhaps doomed. Still, a change of culture is
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is partly because he is widely seen as more capable
of managing this reinvention of the Ruhr that Wolfgang Clement, the
Social Democratic premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, is expected to
defeat his Christian Democratic challenger, Joergen Ruttgers, in a
state election on Sunday. Ruttgers' anti-foreigner message has
played poorly in a state more inclined to the pragmatism of
Clement, whose approach has not yet undone the sweeping social
damage of pit closures, but who has already suggested that the new
economy can bring prosperity to the land of Krupp and Thyssen.
</P>
<P>
   One representative of this change is Rainer Rudolf, 38. He
started his software and consulting company, Adesso, two years ago
and has more work than he can handle. In striking contrast to the
``Herr Doktor'' formality of the traditional German workplace, his
72 employees sit around in T-shirts and open-necked shirts munching
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Adesso, based in the new Dortmund e-commerce center, is working
a lot with insurance companies that want to sell car insurance and
other policies over the Internet but have little idea how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This activity reflects a crucial change in Germany during the
last year: old-economy companies have understood they too must
master new-economy techniques. ``We're swamped,'' Rudolf said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a country that takes a long time to move, but when it
does, it tends to do so with a single-minded determination and a
somewhat startling speed. The blitzkrieg was a German invention.
The current embrace of the Internet shows some of the same
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until a year ago, e-commerce was widely regarded as just
electronic shopping,'' Brewing said. ``But in the last year, people
have understood that it's a way to rationalize your business and an
essential route to new clients. The fact that we're the
accelerators of the old economy has been grasped.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while. The shift that has led to the emergence of
companies like Adesso and Electronic Commerce Center had its germ
in 1986 with the creation, backed by the local government, of a
``Technology Park'' next to Dortmund University. As coal and steel
suffered, the plan was to ensure that inventions in the university
could quickly find expression in new electronic and high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has proved fertile in the end: close to 25,000 people
now work in software or microelectronic businesses in the Dortmund
area. About one quarter of German venture capital is applied in the
Ruhr.
</P>
<P>
   The largest company, Materna Information and Communications, a
specialist in the software that provides short-message services
over mobile phones, has about 1,000 employees. As for Thyssen and
Krupp, they have merged into a slimmed-down modern company and
embraced the sale of steel on the Internet.

   ``The change is happening very fast today,'' said Kurt Monse,
who helps coordinate the ``Media'' initiative of Clement, which
provides financial support for the transformation of the Ruhr. ``We
provide one-stop shopping for anyone, German or foreign, who wants
to invest in our new Internet economy. What Ruttgers does not
realize is that one investment by an Indian can provide 20 jobs for
Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttgers, the Christian Democratic candidate, has become
notorious for the anti-immigrant electoral slogan ``Kinder Statt
Inder'' _ ``Children not Indians'' _ that he has since withdrawn.
It was badly received in his party, and he appeared to have misread
the mood of an area that might be unhappy with its large number of
foreigners but seemed to have reached a consensus that there was
scant future in being closed to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got all the public housing in Essen taken over by
asylum-seekers, and you can't find a German on a building site,''
said Wilhelm Wetzel, a miner who retired at 50 when his pit was
closed in 1988. ``It is not a good situation. But I don't see how
we can reverse this situation any more than we can reopen the
mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetzel works as an occasional guide at what was once the area's
largest mine, the Zollverein in Essen. The mine, which once
employed 6,000 people, closed in 1986. Today, its functional,
red-brick, Bauhaus-inspired buildings have been converted for a
variety of uses, including concerts and jewelry workshops.
</P>
<P>
   There is a design museum, converted by the British architect Sir
Norman Foster; a media institute; graphic studios; an art gallery;
a museum of the mine; and a variety of small businesses. ``We even
have guided tours ending with a glass of Champagne beneath the moon
on the roof of the building where coal was washed,'' said Marie
Mense, a coordinator of what is now called the Zollverein
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   From that roof, a fine view stretches away from the fabled
Ruhrgebiet, marked now by dormant chimneys and mounds of earth
under which industrial waste lies. The Zollverein has become a
prominent part of the ``Industriekultur'' road that takes visitors
around disused plants, gas storage facilities and breweries, now
all museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have wines or cheeses in the Ruhr, but we have a lot
of industry, or rather ex-industry,'' said Eckhard Albrecht, the
director of the Ruhrgebiet Initiative that has financed these
transformations. ``This remains a central part of our culture, our
traditions, even if the attitudes of Silicon Valley have now
penetrated our world.''

DISPUTE OVER FLORIDA EXAM PITS CUBAN EXILES AGAINST DOCTORS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)  By PETER T. KILBORN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A decadeslong dispute over the licensing of a group of
Cubans who want to practice medicine in Florida is testing the
power of the Cuban-American lobby against that of the state's
medical establishment and is about to involve the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will affect the futures of Cuban refugees who have
been struggling for the right to be licensed as doctors in the
United States. Also at stake, representatives of the medical
establishment say, are standards of care for the profession.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 400 immigrants are Cubans who came to
Florida in the 1980s. Nicaraguans make up about a third of the
group. While contending that they had medical training or had been
licensed in their homeland, they have been unable to produce
sufficient evidence to obtain licenses here or to pass a national
exam required for all doctors by all states.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate them, the Florida Legislature, at the urging of
the Cuban-American Caucus, has established a separate test for this
group, in the hopes of making it easier to pass. It has placed less
emphasis on pure science and more on treatment and diagnosis, and
it has made special courses available to help these immigrants
prepare for the test.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has also eliminated internships and hospital
residency as preconditions for licensing for this group.
</P>
<P>
   The test was actually revised twice. After more than 90 percent
of the immigrant doctors failed the modified exam when they first
took it last May, the state rewrote it again and translated it into
Spanish. Again, more than 90 percent failed the easier version when
they took it in November. With still further revisions, the exam
will be offered yet again late this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cuban-American doctors' lobby says it will press
the Legislature to eliminate licensing exams entirely for the group
and to require instead that the doctors work under the close
supervision of licensed physicians before setting off on their own.
</P>
<P>
   While many Cuban exiles have passed the test required of other
doctors, the fact that one group of exiles is getting so much
special attention has raised concerns among members of the medical
establishment in Florida and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   At its September meeting, the Florida Medical Association
adopted a resolution urging the Legislature to abolish the special
exam and rely solely on the national exam. And at its annual
meeting in June, the American Medical Association's House of
Delegates will vote on a resolution supporting the Florida
association's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to open the medical system to testing for a
particular group,'' said Dr. Yank Coble, an endocrinologist in
Jacksonville, Fla., and a member of the AMA's board of trustees.
``It's important not to be perceived as making special exceptions
for political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Other medical organizations have expressed opposition as well,
contending that these accommodations are, in effect, unleashing an
underqualified group of doctors on an unsuspecting public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public needs to be concerned,'' said Dr. L. Thomas Bowles,
president of the National Board of Medical Examiners in
Philadelphia. ``No other state has found it necessary to create an
alternate pathway for a special cohort of physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts contend that the fact that the Legislature has
persisted in its efforts to help these immigrants illustrates the
power of a relatively small group of Cuban legislators who make up
the Cuban-American Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Cuban-American legislators maintain that
they are trying to right injustices against their fellow exiles.
They say the Florida Medical Association and the American Medical
Association want to restrict competition for patients and exert
unfair influence over the State Health Department and its Board of
Medicine, which administers the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of fairness,'' said state Rep. Rudy Garcia
Jr., a Republican from Hialeah and a prominent spokesman for South
Florida's 800,000 Cuban-Americans. The content and scoring of the
tests that the state devised for the immigrants seem to
discriminate against them, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Camilo Lopez is typical of the group of immigrants
whom the Legislature is trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 39, said he fled Cuba for Miami in March 1980, having
completed a year of medical school in his homeland. Unable to
afford the high cost of medical school here, he went to the
Dominican Republic, where, he says, he completed his medical
studies at Utesa University. He then returned to Florida, where he
was granted a temporary license to become a physician's assistant,
which allowed him to provide much of the care of a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lopez, who is married and the father of two
teen-agers, has been trying to become a doctor. Like some of his
colleagues, he could not produce credible evidence of his training
and as a result could not be certified to take a national licensing
exam.
</P>
<P>
   In another special privilege that the Legislature created for
the group, a two-semester course was designed to prepare the Cubans
for the exam. The course was offered in 1990 and 1992 by the
University of Miami and by a private company.
</P>
<P>
   But as they were completing the course, the National Board of
Medical Examiners, Bowles' organization, and the Federation of
State Medical Boards in Chicago introduced a new national exam, the
U.S. Medical Licensing Examination, replacing the one for which the
students had been studying. The students, who had paid the
University of Miami $10,000 each for tuition, were ill-prepared to
take the new exam. Some took it and failed it; some did not take
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did everything they were supposed to do,'' said State
Sen. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican who is leaving the
Senate this month because of term limits. ``And oops. Wrong exam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature then asked the University of South Florida to
prepare a special licensing exam for the group. In spite of the
change, 250 of 260 candidates, including Lopez, failed the special
exam when it was offered last May.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Alberto Gutman, a Cuban-American Republican from
Miami who has been sentenced to prison for Medicare fraud and gave
up his seat last year after he was indicted, persuaded the Board of
Medicine to change some questions and translate the exam into
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In November, 87 candidates took the revised exam, and 79 failed.
Saying he believed that the second exam was stacked against him,
Lopez did not take it.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about 40 percent of foreign-trained doctors fail the
national exam on the first try, four times the rate of U.S.-trained
physicians. Doctor organizations attribute the failures mostly to
differences in medical school training, difficulties with English
and unfamiliarity with U.S. medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In a comprehensive study of physician licensing and discipline
five years ago, the Florida Legislature's nonpartisan Office of
Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability called the
licensing process neutral and thorough. ``If an applicant satisfies
all the requirements prescribed by statute and rule,'' the office
concluded, ``the license will be issued.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's special treatment upsets many doctors, including
some of the state's 12,000 other foreign-trained physicians, a
third of the total of 37,500 practicing in Florida, who earned
their licenses without special help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're are not bad doctors,'' said Dr. Juan Wester, a surgeon
in Hollywood, Fla., who was born in Argentina and went to medical
school there. ``They're probably as good as many of us. But we have
always felt that as international medical graduates, we wanted to
be treated exactly the same as anybody else.''

MEXICO TIES A MASS GRAVE TO ABDUCTION AND COCAINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Mexico)  By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In 1995, after a Texas jury had acquitted him of
cocaine trafficking, Alberto Ochoa Soto, reportedly a member of a
Colombian drug cartel, was driven to the top of the arched
international bridge over the Rio Grande and released into Mexico,
where his lawyer greeted him, witnesses have said.
</P>
<P>
   As the two met on the bridge, however, a Chevrolet Suburban
drove up the bridge, and several men with Mexican Federal Judicial
Police credentials seized Ochoa and the lawyer, Antonio Tarazon
Navarro, shoved them into the car and roared off into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, little news emerged on their fate, until this
week, when Mexican and American authorities announced that they had
identified six of nine bodies unearthed by forensic experts from
the FBI from three mass graves near Ciudad Juarez. That border city
is a staging point for drug shipments into El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their names and nationalities, little is known about five
of the six men whose remains were identified. But the sixth
skeleton was identified as that of Tarazon, the lawyer, who was 42
when he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The case is well known to human rights and legal investigators,
who have pressed authorities in the United States and Mexico for
justice in what they consider a brazen crime that has focused a
spotlight on the involvement of the Mexican police in scores of
border executions.
</P>
<P>
   Tarazon's skeleton was exhumed on a ranch 43 miles west of
Juarez, the senior prosecutor who heads the Mexican Organized Crime
Unit, Jose Trinidad Larrieta, said on Thursday. Tarazon was killed
by gunshots to the neck and face, Larrieta said. A DNA test that
used a blood sample provided by Tarazon's sister definitively
identified the remains, Larrieta added.
</P>
<P>
   Tarazon was found buried with one other man, and Mexican and
American agents presume that the remains are those of Ochoa, who
was 51 when he disappeared. An American who has spoken with FBI
agents about the case said the agents had obtained blood samples
from Ochoa's relatives in Medellin and were awaiting results of a
DNA test.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Ochoa and Tarazon vanished, a financial dispute was
simmering between Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, and,
according to court records and American investigators who have
studied the case, the Mexican police appear to have acted as
contract killers in the pay of a powerful Mexican trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa had been arrested in Texas and charged with importing 6
tons of cocaine. But the jury in El Paso acquitted him at his trial
months later, court records show. On Feb. 15, 1995, he was released
across the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   An American who has interviewed the Tarazon and Ochoa families
said when Tarazon greeted his client he was wearing dark slacks, a
gray shirt and black loafers, the same clothes found with the
remains, Larrieta said.
</P>
<P>
   After the men had been shoved into the Suburban, all that was
know was that Tarazon left a message on an answering machine at an
associate's office saying Mexican federal agents were holding him.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa's Mexican wife had reported his detention to Federal
Police officers in an office of the agency in Juarez. With Ochoa's
wife listening, a federal agent telephoned colleagues, who
acknowledged that they had Ochoa and Tarazon in custody, the
American who has interviewed Ochoa's wife said.
</P>
<P>
   The agent assured Ochoa's wife that her husband and Tarazon were
in no danger and told her to get back in touch the next day. When
she phoned back, however, the agent was no longer in the office,
and she was never able to re-establish contact with him or to learn
more about the fate of the two men, until Larrieta's announcement
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor identified three other skeletons as Americans who
had lived in El Paso. They were Jesus Alonso Provencio, Marcelo
Javier Aguilar Molina and Guillermo Jesus Rojo. The other two
skeletons were identified as Ignacio del Real Fierro, a Mexican who
lived in El Paso, and Raul Alarcon Sanchez, a Mexican who lived in
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in the executions, Larrieta said.

SIERRA LEONE SAYS REBELS WERE DRIVEN BY DIAMONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of fighting among rebel groups and government troops
in the capital of Sierra Leone, officials loyal to President Ahman
Tejan Kabbah are beginning to amass documents that they say show
the extent to which the rebel leader Foday Sankoh was
systematically exploiting the country's diamonds to pay for his
rebellion and enrich himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible people in history keep very good records,'' a
high-ranking government official said in a telephone interview
Saturday. On Monday, Sierra Leone's attorney general, Solomon
Berewa, plans to begin making public a large number of documents
found in the looted house of Sankoh, whose whereabouts is now
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of some of these papers dealing with the diamond trade
were made available to The New York Times by other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, whose forces are being held responsible for the
abduction of about 500 U.N. peacekeepers _ some of whom had begun
to be assigned to diamond-producing areas _ took over the mining
ministry last year after a peace agreement brought him into
government in return for ending his savage rebellion. Under
Sankoh's soldiers, many of them brutalized children themselves, the
limbs of civilians were hacked off and communities were destroyed
to send a deliberate message of terror throughout the population.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front, had
been in government since last summer, some of his diamond deals
would have presumably been legal. Foreign companies, including some
from the United States, were known to have been negotiating with
him, or at least exploring the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But records that government officials say they are finding now
appear to be meticulous accounts of personal deals recording the
delivery to Sankoh of more than 2,000 stones of varying sizes from
last August, soon after Sankoh came into government, until the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the records they found _ along with letters from a
business associate abroad, identified only as ``Michel,'' who was
apparently trying to find a buyer for the diamonds in Antwerp,
Belgium, the center of the rough diamond trade _ officials in
Sierra Leone are more convinced than ever that the trouble with
U.N. peacekeepers began when the force's Indian commander, Maj.
Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley, ordered some of his troops into the
richest diamond mining area, around Kono, in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as Sankoh saw that the U.N. was serious about
deploying in Kono, then he declared war on the U.N.,'' the senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents involving diamonds _ including handwritten lists
naming every courier who brought stones to Sankoh, with notes about
their color and size _ may answer other questions puzzling the
government about the rebel leader's relations with President
Charles Taylor of neighboring Liberia and with Sankoh's former
field commander, Sam Bockarie.
</P>
<P>
   Bockarie, who personally delivered many of the stones to Sankoh,
according to the records, opposed the peace agreement with the
government and fled several months ago to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Sankoh's records no longer included diamond
deliveries. Officials want to know why, as well as if and how,
these events may have been related. In recent months, Sankoh, whose
rebel movement was helped if not created by Taylor, appears to have
been trying to circumvent the Liberians as he sought partners for
diamond deals abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, the Security Council, under the
leadership of the Canadian ambassador, Robert Fowler, has produced
a report on how the diamond trade fueled the rebellion in Angola of
Jonas Savimbi and his organization, the Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or Unita. The council plans to act on that
report in the fall after further investigations, possibly seeking
punitive measures against countries or companies that have been
trading with Unita in violation of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, officials say they are now looking at evidence
of a similar gems-for-weapons system developed by Sankoh. Early
reading of documents shows all the same hallmarks _ local mining
operations, links to international traders and a marketing focus on
Antwerp, which until recently has been lax in examining the origins
of gems or the identities of sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone officials say that Sankoh may have been doing more
than merely enriching himself and buying weapons for his rebel
troops in the field. There is some evidence emerging, they say,
that he may have been planning to accumulate enough resources to
attempt to overthrow the government in Freetown.

FRAUD AGAIN FEARED IN PERU'S RUNOFF ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Two weeks before the final round of Peru's
presidential election, international observers say they again have
serious concerns that President Alberto Fujimori may be preparing
to steal enough votes to ensure he wins a third term.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Peru came close to turmoil as opposition candidates
and election monitors accused the government of widespread vote
tampering after a campaign marred by smear tactics and dirty
tricks. A crisis was averted only when electoral authorities
announced that Fujimori had fallen just short of an outright
first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now negotiations between the government and the opposition to
improve election monitoring have collapsed over the government's
refusal to replace poll watchers who reportedly took part in the
tampering of ballots in the first vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are disquieting signs that the scenario of the first
round may be repeated,'' said Eduardo Stein, a former Guatemalan
foreign minister who leads the election observation team for the
Organization of American States. ``We don't know if there will be
enough guarantees for a clean, transparent election.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, the business school professor who has staged a
surprisingly strong challenge to Fujimori, is threatening to pull
out of the race rather than lend credibility to a process he
characterizes as hopelessly flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Observers from the OAS say the government has set such an early
date for the runoff that there is not enough time to guarantee that
the count will be any more reliable now than in the first round on
April 9.
</P>
<P>
   They say they continue to receive reports that army and
government vehicles are being used to the advantage of the Fujimori
campaign and that officials involved in handing out milk and
cereals to poor mothers are mixing political propaganda with the
food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Independent observers say Fujimori's intelligence service
appears to continue to orchestrate coverage of the campaign in
several tabloid newspapers and a political magazine called Si,
which have depicted Toledo as unstable, a liar and a tool of Alan
Garcia, a former president who lives in exile to escape corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of Toledo in the magazine typically show him with a
bottle or glass in his hand _ suggesting that the opposition
candidate, who is a heavy water drinker, is imbibing something
alcoholic. Several Si articles have reported sardonically that
Johnny Walker is the challenger's principal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The independence of the election apparatus remains in question.
The senior officials who presided over the first round remain in
place. And a government investigation into evidence that the
Fujimori campaign forged a million signatures to get him on the
ballot has stalled. A few election officials have resigned and many
more are expected to be implicated in the scandal _ but only after
the vote on May 28 is tallied.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Peruvian government officials continue to commit
themselves publicly to holding a clean election. Francisco Tudela,
Fujimori's vice presidential running mate, said last week, ``It is
everyone's concern to create better conditions in the second
round.''
</P>
<P>
   International election observers, however, say privately that
they believe the government is manipulating them by agreeing to
make changes that are more cosmetic than real. For instance, the
government television network, which for months covered only the
Fujimori campaign, broadcast parts of a Toledo rally for the first
time last week. But only snippets of Toledo's speech were shown and
camera shots focused on the outskirts of the crowd, giving the
appearance that attendance was sparse.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Atlanta-based Carter Center and the nonprofit
National Democratic Institute, both of which have monitored
numerous elections around the world, said that unless there were
``immediate and comprehensive improvements'' in the administrative
and technical procedures of the runoff, ``Peru's election process
will ultimately fail to meet minimal international standards for
democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Various opinion polls show the race between Fujimori and Toledo
to be very close, and there is a good chance that Fujimori could
win a majority without fraud. But the reports of new irregularities
suggest that a Fujimori victory could be seriously tarnished even
if cleanly won, igniting more street demonstrations and diminishing
the president's authority as he tries to fight drug trafficking and
promote investment through his third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official first-round count, Fujimori won 49.87
percent of the vote to Toledo's 40.24 percent. Recent polls show
that a majority of Peruvians, including those who support Fujimori,
believe there was fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fujimori wins, there still will be a crisis of
credibility,'' said Rafael Roncagliolo, director of Transparencia,
a Peruvian election monitoring group largely financed by the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has embraced Fujimori's anti-drug and
anti-terrorism efforts, could be put in the uncomfortable position
of either choosing to support a tainted government and compromising
on its commitment to uphold democracy in Latin America or cutting
back on cooperation that is in both countries' interests.
</P>
<P>
   The administration put heavy pressure on the Fujimori government
to hold a runoff after international monitors reported during the
first-round vote that ballots and tally sheets had disappeared and
election computer centers had shut their doors without explanation
for many hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials are again pressing for a clean
election and expressing cautious optimism that it is still
possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They point to several modest signs of improvement, including an
opening of some government-allied television stations. They also
note that election officials appear to be moving toward giving
Toledo's party access to software that will allow it to inspect the
final computer vote count.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and independent monitors have praised
election officials for agreeing to retrain poll watchers and
refining the lines of command for officials responsible for
transporting and counting the ballots and vote tally sheets.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein, the OAS official who has emerged as the most
influential independent election monitor, is still expressing
serious reservations.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it would take three weeks to test the computer
software that the government is preparing to provide the opposition
to watch the vote count. But with only two weeks to election day,
the software still has not been made available for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that the government had so far agreed to only
one independent monitoring station capable of watching the
transmission of voting data from 16 vote tabulation centers,
leaving 40 tabulation centers uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that unauthorized people could transmit data or
corrupt data without observers knowing it,'' Stein said.

   ERGONOMICS _ WASHINGTON _ Businesses large and small _ and their

proposed last fall by the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration. OSHA says 27 million workers would be affected by
the new rules involving repetitive motions, awkward reaching or
heavy lifting. OSHA said the rules would cost businesses about $4.2
billion a year to implement, while saving $ 9 billion annually
through increased productivity and lower absenteeism. Industry
groups responded that the cost would be much higher. (Malone, Cox

   UNIVERSE _ WASHINGTON _ Astronomers have for several years
believed that most of the matter in the universe is ``dark
matter,'' which we can't see or perceive in any way other than in
the gravitational pull it exerts on ordinary matter. Now, to
explain the strange way distant galaxies appear to be racing away
from us at ever greater speeds, they have come up with the concept
of ``dark energy,'' something that seems to be acting in defiance
of the usual laws of gravity. Without it, these faraway objects
should be gradually slowing down from the momentum of the ``Big
Bang.'' Instead, they are flying away at speeds that now approach
the speed of light. Dark energy may be a kind of reverse gravity,
cosmologists think. (Nesmith, Copx News Service). WITH LOGO.

   ISRAEL-LEBANON _ KIBBUTZ MENARA, Israel _ When the loud thuds
started sounding every couple of minutes, residents here calmly
made their guesses. Katyusha rockets from Lebanon? Israeli
artillery toward Lebanon? Both were wrong. They were land mines,
blown up under the tread of an armoured Israeli bulldozer that was
making room for a new border post a few hundred yards away. Israel
plans to pull out of southern Lebanon soon, and the road work is
under way. They're clearing mines, building new roads and, near one
Arab village, taking land for a new post. Residents founded these
farms to stake out the border in the 1940s. Now, they will lose
their buffer of Israeli-occupied land. They will be on the edge
again and wonder if it will be safe to go out at night, to use
their roads and whether they will be on the frontline of a lasting
peace or continuing war. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

prison, I'd be be dead right now,'' said Eshelle Scott. At a
therapy session, part of a ground-breaking program aimed at helping
female inmates, Scott said she was trapped in an abusive
relationship with a man who introduced her to witchcraft and beat
her nearly every day. Depressed, she found comfort in drugs and
killing animals. Angry about a beating, she said, she once
decapitated her boyfriend's mother's cat and left it on the woman's
doorstep. Finally, she was convicted of burning churches and
sentenced to a 63-month term. At the Federal Correctional
Institution here, Scott participated in the inaugural class of New
Pathways, a pilot program aimed at addressing the special needs of
female inmates who have been physically or sexually abused. (Turay,

   COXNET FOCUS 0513: THE NEW URBANISM -- One of the key buzzwords

advocates do not want to force you out of your subdivision and into
a high-rise apartment building. What they are trying to do is to
answer some of the toughest questions facing modern metropolitan
areas. How can cities and suburbs grow in population while avoiding
the potentially devastating environmental and other consequences of
asphalt-heavy sprawl or of poorly planned density? (Goldberg,

BUSH VS. GORE MEANS AN ALL-BABY-BOOM RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades of caricature as the most
self-indulgent and permissive generation in American history, baby
boomers _ including Al Gore and George W. Bush _ are realizing that
it's time to get with the program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences in political orientation, the two
parties' presumptive presidential nominees, both of whom were born
into the vanguard of the boomer generation, are delivering the same
message on the campaign trail: ``responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that goes to the personal and the political and
speaks, the candidates hope, to a generation once famous for its
idealism and its determination to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the campaigns have sensed a new wrinkle, so to speak,
in the ever-scrutinized lives of the boomers that has emerged as
they have aged _ the oldest boomers are now in the unusual position
of contemplating their own retirements even as their parents are
living longer and requiring more care. At the same time, some, like
Gore, whose mother is 87 and whose mother-in-law lives with him and
his wife, are even becoming grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   This nexus of life-defining events for the biggest cohort in
American history (the 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964)
has infused the presidential campaign with a new urgency,
especially regarding Social Security and health care. Both Bush and
Gore have devoted much time on the campaign trail to Social
Security and both plan to deliver major addresses on Social
Security on the topic on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a response to what's happening in society,'' said John
Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, one of
the biggest and most effective lobbying groups in the country.
``It's driven by demographics, the economy and technology. There's
a growing awareness, particularly of people who are Bush's and
Gore's age, that their parents' generation is becoming frail, we
don't have support systems that are in very good shape, and the
anxiety about your own retirement is on the top of people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was born March 31, 1948, making him 52. George W. Bush
was born July 6, 1946, making him 53. And while they had different
coming-of-age experiences during the 1960s and 1970s _ Gore was
closer to the counterculture than was Bush, but still by no means a
radical _ both are invoking their generational roots as themes in
their campaigns and are developing ``responsibility'' as rationales
for their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign marks one of the few times in modern history that
candidates from both parties have been so close in age. For the
first time, two baby boomers are running for president,
representing a definitive break with the World War II era. Given
the unprecedented prosperity, these factors give the nation a
chance to reset its compass and restructure its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here was Bush in a recent interview with ``The News Hour'' on
PBS:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong candidate because I come from the baby boomer
generation, recognizing that we've got to usher in an era of
responsible behavior, which starts with behaving responsibly in the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Here was Gore at a Dallas fund-raiser on Wednesday night,
criticizing Congress for doing little to improve schools:
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation of students crowded into the schools right now
just broke the all-time attendance record set by the baby boom
generation so many years ago. They'll break the record again next
fall,'' he said. ``But we have not yet responded as a nation the
way the World War II veterans did to the baby boomers. They built
new schools and hired new teachers and passed the GI Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, says the invocation of
responsibility is a harkening to fundamental values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that people ought to be responsible for their
actions is one of the top-most widely shared values in this
country,'' he said. ``So it's no surprise that politicians talk in
that idiom.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a strong degree of self-interest in their
appeals, particularly when it comes to issues like Social Security
and Medicare. Politicians used to focus issues like Social Security
and Medicare solely on the over-65 crowd. But now, Mellman noted,
``people are worried about taking care of their parents, and the
leading edge of the baby boom are worried about their own
retirement and some are worried about both at the same time, which
is a newer phenomenon.''

<P>
   A political focus group of mostly middle-aged people conducted
earlier this month in Bala Cynwyd, a suburb of Philadelphia, by
Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, found unanimity on one subject _
despite the prosperous economy, people are anxious about health
care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``As baby boomers get older, people start to feel it as well as
think it,'' Frank Ratel, 60, an accountant, said during the focus
group.
</P>
<P>
   Rother of AARP said: ``The assumption among many people is that
it's only seniors who care about Medicare and Social Security, but
nothing could be further from the truth. Our polling shows it is
boomers who are the most interested in prescription drug coverage
because you're thinking about your mom and at the same time
wondering about your own future. When you're in your 50s, you don't
know what kind of shape you're going to be in. This is a greater
concern of people in their 50s than it is for people 65 and
older.''
</P>
<P>
   The crunch for baby boomers is becoming increasingly obvious.
Almost 50 percent of the people who filed for bankruptcy in 1999
were baby boomers. Some academics, like Elizabeth Warren, a
bankruptcy expert at Harvard Law School, argue that, contrary to
the popular image of affluent boomers spending their way to
consumer heaven, this is ``the most vulnerable generation'' because
of the confluence of potential failures that they face, from the
loss of a job to catastrophic illness to the effects of divorce and
the need to care for aging parents.

   The likelihood of bankruptcy increases with age, as people
approaching retirement face mounting costs, particularly for
prescription drugs and long-term care. Both Gore and Bush are
offering proposals to help people meet these needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security system has a surplus now, but the government
predicts that the trust fund will begin paying out more than it
takes in by 2015 as the baby boom generation retires. Without a
major fix, the system could go broke by 2037.
</P>
<P>
   But for both candidates, the notion of ``responsibility'' goes
beyond strengthening Social Security, which they would do by
different means.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emphasizes personal responsibility as a direct
counterweight to what he perceives as the irresponsibility of
President Clinton (the first baby boomer president). The goal of
his candidacy, Bush says, is to restore honor and dignity to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   And the signal inherent in his message is an appeal to family
values, long seen as Republican turf.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has emphasized the theme since he began his campaign last
June, saying ``My first goal is to usher in the responsibility era
_ an era that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades,
where our culture has said: If it feels good, do it, and if you've
got a problem, blame someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also used his emphasis on compassion to temper any
impression that responsibility means harshness or sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, responsibility is a multipurpose concept, and he tends
to use it both subliminally and overtly. He too is trying to
distance himself from the actions of Clinton. But he also wants to
present himself as the logical successor to Clinton as the steward
of the nation's current prosperity, and so he offers himself as the
responsible heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, necessitates presenting Bush as the
``irresponsible'' alternative, a neat way, learned from Clinton, of
transforming a policy matter into a values judgment. Repeatedly,
Gore casts Bush's proposals as ``reckless,'' a quality Gore
conjures up with his relentless referencing to Bush's ``risky tax
scheme.'' The contrast between the responsible Gore and the
irresponsible Bush has fast become the organizing principle of the
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Gore is using the idea of responsibility to reinforce
one of the basic tenets of his party. While Bush's reference
summons family values, Gore's highlights the Democrats' traditional
advantage on preserving entitlement programs. The ``risky tax
scheme'' that he invokes is a direct threat to two tenets of
Democratic orthodoxy _ Social Security and Medicare _ that baby
boomers are now either depending on to help their parents or
expecting to receive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It references the basic policy dilemma of his presidency,''
said Elaine Kamark, Gore's chief domestic policy adviser. ``The
challenge has gone from how to manage the insolvency of these
programs to who can keep control of the surplus. The money guys on
Wall Street understand this very well. They want confidence. You
get it by running a straight, sound fiscal policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore had children relatively early for his generation,
he is now a grandparent. ``His life cycle is slightly ahead of his
generation, so he can see ahead to the centrality of some of these
issues,'' Kamark said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore is more a creature of the popular image of the baby
boom than is Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush exudes a more retro 1950s youth, one of hijinks and
drinking and frat parties, remarkably detached from the Vietnam War
or any kind of rebellion or existential angst. As he told an
interviewer for GQ: ``I don't remember any kind of heaviness
ruining my time at Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems much more a product of his time. He invariably
dangles his boomer credentials before his audiences, mentioning the
touchstones of his generation _ the assassinations, the civil
rights movement, Vietnam, Watergate, his ``disillusionment with
politics,'' though never rebellion, and his admission that he
smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments about drug use also carry a responsible message
of caution, as he warns audience that the marijuana of today is
much stronger that what he smoked.

 &HT;    S.C. governor teaches a lesson in flag compromise
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ As much as anybody, South Carolina Gov. Jim
Hodges may have determined the future of the Confederate battle
flag, one of Dixie's most enduring symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The argument has roiled privately and publicly for months in the
Legislature but now seems headed for a resolution that will remove
the battle flag from the Capitol dome July 1 for the first time in
38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges has created a blueprint for compromise that can be
followed by fellow Southern Democratic Governors Roy Barnes of
Georgia and Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   When South Carolina lowers the Rebel banner, Georgia and
Mississippi still will be displaying the battle emblem of the
Confederacy on their state flags. Debate then will belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will say to Jim Hodges, `You did the right thing, that
you were a statesman,' '' said Georgia Rep. Tyrone Brooks
(D-Atlanta), a key member of the legislative black caucus who will
fight next year to change the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges massaged and managed the fiery debate within the cool
granite walls of the Capitol, pulling together both parties.
Through public comments dispensed at calculated moments, he steered
the Legislature. When the House threatened stalling to death a
compromise sent from the Senate, Hodges hinted he'd call a costly
and embarrassing special session.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING A PROACTIVE APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   So far, Barnes has spoken vaguely about Georgia's flag, changed
to include the Rebel design in 1956, a time when federal courts
were mandating school desegregation in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has said only that there's no legislative will to change
the flag _ a path Hodges walked until the NAACP enacted a tourism
boycott of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   While there remains considerable debate about whether the
boycott has hurt South Carolina economically, it undeniably brought
the state a lot of negative media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be proactive on it. It's not an issue that's
going to go away,'' Hodges said in his office Thursday, the morning
after the state House passed its version of a Senate compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy Barnes and I have talked a couple of times about it, not
at length,'' Hodges said. ``It's an issue that needs to be resolved
for the image of the states and for the people as well. Our states
need to be focusing on educational improvement, health care. To be
distracted and spend the amount of time that can be consumed on an
issue like this, it's not good for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Republican Gov. David Beasley, and
former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, Hodges minimized his
public comments until he had worked privately to achieve broad
support among a number of leaders _ blacks, whites, Republicans,
Democrats, big business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get so many bites of the apple with public
pronouncements,'' Hodges said. ``Pretty soon, people start ignoring
you if you say the same thing over and over. A leader _ a governor,
particularly _ has to be careful that he or she has something
significant to say. I tried to measure my public pronouncements
very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain Barnes' comparable silence on the issue. The
battle flag helped Beasley lose his job and nearly cost Miller his.
Though not up for re-election in November, Barnes is worried
Republicans could use the flag to chisel away at Democratic
majorities in both legislative chambers.
</P>
<P>
   HOPES BIPARTISAN COALITION WILL PROMPT ACTION BY GOVERNOR BARNES
</P>
<P>
   Among those ready to hold Democrats accountable on the issue is
Georgia House Minority Whip Earl Ehrhart, a Republican and flag
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think it's such a big issue, then they should go to
every Democrat and say we'll withdraw support this November if you
don't pledge to change the flag,'' Ehrhart said. ``If they don't do
that, they're hypocrites.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Barnes nor his spokeswoman, Jocelyn Butler, will be
drawn into the flag mire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Barnes continues to focus on a number of important
issues,'' including education reform, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   That was how Musgrove in Mississippi dismissed the issue until a
legal challenge to the state flag prompted the state Supreme Court
a week ago to rule that the flag had no official standing. Musgrove
immediately called for a 17-member commission to study redesigning
the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and other black legislators said they'll have a political
plan in place when the Georgia General Assembly returns in January.
Until then, and not before November's elections, he expects Barnes
to remain mute on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the governor sees there's going to be a bipartisan
coalition of legislators who come together and address the flag
issue, at that point I think the governor will want to say
something,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   After months of meeting privately with all sides of the issue,
Hodges used his January State of the State Address to say in no
uncertain terms the Legislature must bring the flag down.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from Beasley and Miller, Hodges avoided a personalized
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be ownership for the solution beyond the
governor,'' Hodges said. ``I'll be the first to pat the Republican
speaker of the House on the back and a number of others who cast
difficult votes that split them with members of their own party.
They deserve credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate engaged in three months of name-calling before
passing a plan last month that had bipartisan and biracial support.
Last week, the House modified the bill. Lawmakers decided to fly a
smaller, squarer battle flag at the Confederate Soldiers Monument
in front of the Capitol. The slight disagreement is over how high
the flag will fly. The Senate version specifies 20 feet; the House
version, 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Final tinkering either in the Senate or a conference committee
is left before Hodges can sign the bill.

 &HT;    Political hay reaped from playing fields
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On March 20, 1980, Craig Masback was standing near the
starting line of a race in San Francisco with aspirations of
representing the United States in the 1980 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Before Masback stepped to the line, a television reporter
approached. Masback, one of the world's best middle-distance
runners, can't forget what he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Carter has just announced a boycott of the Moscow
Olympics,'' the reporter said. ``He says it's a matter of national
security. Do you support your president?''
</P>
<P>
   Masback, who in 1979 had the sixth-fastest time in the world in
1,500 meters, knew his Olympic dream was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would contend that it's impossible to say no to that
question,'' said Masback, chief executive officer of USA Track &AMP;
Field. ``No American could say no to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, athletes often have been forced to choose
sides in the sports-politics debate. And sporting events often have
been the pawns of those political struggles.
</P>
<P>
   That collision soon could reach Georgia. The South Carolina
Legislature voted last week to remove the Confederate battle flag
from the dome of the statehouse, deterring a threat by the NCAA to
remove all NCAA-sponsored events from the state. Now, many believe
the NAACP and other civil rights organizations will turn their
attention to Georgia, which incorporates the Confederate battle
flag on its state flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect a long, hot summer,'' said South Carolina Rep.
John Scott, a black Democrat from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   With Atlanta scheduled to host several national sporting events,
including this summer's Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the
2002 NCAA men's basketball Final Four, Georgia's flag debate could
make South Carolina's look like a blip on the radar screen.
High-profile events create leverage; sports becomes the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports tend to be invested with the most deeply felt
sentiments and values of America,'' said Dr. Harry Edwards, a
professor of sociology at the University of California. ``There's
patriotism, courage and even religion in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports and politics are no strangers. From the 1936 Berlin
Olympics to the raised black-fisted gloves of the 1968 Mexico City
Games, the two have collided throughout history. And it has often
been a volatile mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sports mirror society,'' Masback said. ``I'm not
fundamentally opposed to politics being involved in sports. I
believe the sports boycott of South Africa helped overturn
apartheid. I think the white citizens of South Africa were
fanatical about sports and when they became ostracized by the
sporting world, it opened people's eyes about the injustices that
were occurring in their homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 20th century, the Olympics often were used as a
forum for political protest. The casualties were often the lifelong
dreams of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games, set in motion by President
Jimmy Carter in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in
December 1979, still evokes bitterness among many athletes who feel
they were victims of a sports-politics war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe an opportunity was wrongfully taken from a group of
people, and it can never be returned,'' said Anita DeFrantz, a
member of the 1980 U.S. women's rowing team. ``It was the athletes'
right to decide, and that decision was taken away by very powerful
political forces. People worked their entire lives (to participate
in the Olympics). It's something that you believe in and you make
life-changing decisions to work for it. And then someone says you
can't go. You can't give that back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics were canceled twice because of world wars, and the
Games also have been overshadowed by disputes over race, religion
and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of us understand that the Olympic Games are rare,''
said DeFrantz, a vice president of the International Olympic
Committee.

5 CASES THAT RESULTED IN EXECUTIONS OF TEXAS INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEXAS-EXECUTIONS and TEXAS-EXECUTIONS-ABRIDGED) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER and SARA RIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Beathard: Executed 12/9/99
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Beathard received the death sentence for his role in
the 1984 murder of Gene Hathorn Sr., 45, his wife, Linda Sue, 34,
and their 14-year-old son, Marcus, while they were watching
television in their mobile home outside Groveton, a small town in
East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There was no physical evidence to link Beathard to the crime _
no fingerprints, no footprints, no blood. After giving
investigators several different versions of what happened that
night, Beathard finally admitted he had been at the mobile home,
that he had accompanied Gene Hathorn Jr. on what he thought was a
drug deal. When Hathorn began shooting his family, Beathard said he
ran into the woods and hid.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard was convicted largely on the testimony of Gene Hathorn
Jr., who had wanted his family killed in order to collect a modest
inheritance; after the murders, he discovered he had been written
out of his father's will.
</P>
<P>
   At Beathard's trial, Hathorn testified that he had stood outside
the trailer and fired a blast through the window with a shotgun;
that had killed his father. Then, Hathorn _ who hoped that the
state would go easier on him if he helped convict Beathard _ told
the jury that Beathard, 24, a quiet, pot-smoking man who worked at
the state mental hospital and had no experience with guns and no
record of violence, had gone inside, brandishing a semi-automatic
rifle and a semi-automatic pistol, and had finished off the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hathorn might be a cold-blooded killer, but there hasn't been
any evidence in this courtroom that says he is a liar,'' the
prosecutor, Joe L. Price, told the jurors. ``He is telling the
truth.'' Beathard was convicted and sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Then, several months later, Price tried Hathorn, who testified
only at the punishment phase of his trial, hoping to avoid
execution. Now Price, in speaking to the jurors, said that if they
believed he was telling the truth, ``I'm a one-eyed hunting dog.''
</P>
<P>
   In his cross-examination of Hathorn, a man with a violent past
and experience with guns, the prosecutor ridiculed the notion that
Beathard, and not Hathorn, had gone inside and killed the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, and here was this ol' boy that had never shot that pistol
before, was not near as familiar as you with weapons, going into a
house he had never been in before in his life, to attack two people
that had some advance warning that he was coming,'' the prosecutor
said to Hathorn. ``Does that seem a little bit strange to you,
Gene?'' Hathorn was also convicted and sentenced to die. He remains
on death row.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the trial, Hathorn recanted his testimony. He said
that he had acted alone, that Beathard had been present but that he
had hidden in the woods and had not participated in the killings.
Based on this, Beathard's lawyers asked for a new trial. But the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals turned down the request because a
criminal defendant has only 30 days after a judgment is entered
against him to present new evidence that might justify a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   That 30-day period in Texas is longer than the 21-day deadline
for the introduction of new evidence in Virginia, but it is still
one of the shortest time periods in the country. Many states have
no deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview on death row at Livingston, Hathorn did
not want to talk about the case. He put most of his answers ``off
the record,'' even one on whether he still stuck to his
recantation. He left no doubt, however, that he had been the one to
go inside the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after the Beathard trial, Price, the prosecutor,
is still uncertain about what happened on the night of the crime.
``I'll be honest with you,'' he said, talking in his office in
Groveton. ``I've vacillated on that one over the years.'' But he
said that it did not matter what roles Hathorn and Beathard had
played that evening since both were present _ under Texas ``law of
parties'' they were equally guilty _ or even that Hathorn might
have lied on the stand. ``Under Texas law my duty is to seek
justice, and there is no question in my mind that these two people
murdered the family,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that justice was served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beathard should not have been put to death,'' said Burwell, a
parole board member who voted with two others to have Beathard's
sentence commuted to life in prison. Burwell explained why by
getting out the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and reading
Article 2.0.1: ``It shall be the primary duty of all prosecuting
attorneys, including any special prosecutors, not to convict, but
to see that justice is done.'' He made a copy and handed it to a
visitor. He had underlined the section, and double-underlined the
word ``not.''
</P>
<P>
   Burwell believes that overzealous prosecutors are at the core of
the problem with the Texas criminal justice system. ``If the
prosecutor doesn't have integrity, there won't be justice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the board, Linda Garcia, also voted for
clemency. ``I don't believe anything improper happened with
Beathard,'' said Garcia, a former prosecutor. ``My doubt is whether
he deserved the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Two jurors in the case recalled in recent interviews that they
had been impressed by Price _ and less impressed by Beathard's
court-appointed lawyer. ``It didn't seem to me like he was very
forceful,'' one of the jurors, Dorothy Cates, said of Beathard's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Heber Taylor covered the Beathard and Hathorn trials for The
Lufkin Daily News. Taylor asked Hathorn if Beathard had fired the
shot from outside the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just snorted in complete contempt,'' recalled Taylor, who
is now editor of The Galveston Daily News. Beathard was too much of
a patsy to kill anyone, Hathorn told Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Losch, a lawyer who does death penalty appellate work,
said that when he first began working on Beathard's case he was
uncertain whether he was innocent. But by a week before the
execution, Losch had become persuaded by Beathard's version of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of case that illustrates the risk of innocent
people being executed in Texas,'' Losch said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said that Gov. George W. Bush ``felt there was no
reason'' not to execute Beathard. A jury had found that he
participated in the murders, the appellate courts had determined
that he had a fair trial, and there was ``no mitigation'' that
would warrant not putting him to death, Sutton said.

   Troy Farris: Executed 1/13/99
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before Christmas, a young deputy sheriff, Clark
Rosenbalm Jr., was murdered, shot twice with a Magnum .357, when he
chanced upon a drug deal, on an isolated road outside Fort Worth.
Troy Dale Farris, who was part of the deal, was convicted of the
murder, but the manner in which the investigation and trial were
conducted left many uneasy, including a remarkable number of
members of the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   The crime scene was badly trampled by investigators and
onlookers. Sixty-three photographs of the sheriff's patrol car
disappeared. So did the plaster casts taken of tire tracks in the
area. Marijuana was found on Rosenbalm, but an investigator flushed
it down the toilet, or so he first claimed. The investigator was
indicted for perjury and planting evidence. Then, after Farris'
trial was over and he was on death row, the indictment of the
investigator was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that ``the
circumstantial and forensic evidence offered at trial not only
failed to connect'' Farris with the murder, but it ``also failed in
nearly all material respects to confirm the testimony'' of the two
key witnesses against Farris.
</P>
<P>
   Farris was convicted largely on the testimony of a
brother-in-law, Jimmy Daniels, who claimed that Farris had
confessed to him, albeit not until a year after the crime. Daniels
also led police to an area where he said his brother-in-law had
once fired his Magnum .357 into a tree. The police recovered slugs,
but the markings did not match those of the bullets that killed the
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Daniels' ``credibility was seriously undermined by the
fact that'' his testimony before the grand jury had been
inconsistent with his trial testimony, ``and, therefore,
inconsistent with'' Farris' guilt, the Court of Criminal Appeals
found.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the court voted to affirm the jury's finding of
guilt. As a guiding principle, unless the court concludes that a
``rational trier of fact'' could not have found the defendant
guilty based on all the evidence before it, the court upholds the
jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The case bothered members of the parole board more than just
about any other that has come before them during Bush's tenure.
Seven members voted for some form of clemency, either commutation
or a 30-day reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some questions on the fairness'' of the prosecution,
explained Daniel Lang, a Bush appointee to the board, who has a
National Rifle Association emblem on his desk and signed
photographs of himself with Presidents Ford and Bush on the walls
of his office in Angleton.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, the criminal adviser to Bush, said that the governor
could have granted a reprieve, but that he had ``looked at all the
facts of the case and chose not to.''
</P>
<P>
   David Castillo: Executed 9/23/98
</P>
<P>
   Clarencio Champion was stabbed in a robbery of the Party House
Liquor Store on North Texas Avenue in Mercedes, Texas. The injuries
were not fatal, however, and he was recovering in the hospital
when, a week after the stabbing, he suddenly developed an infection
and a high fever, and died. It turned out that during surgery, a
9-inch clamp had been left in Champion's stomach; Champion's widow
eventually sued the doctor and the hospital for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   But under Texas law, the person who set the events in motion
that led to Champion's death could be prosecuted for capital
murder, and that helped convict David Castillo, an 18-year-old high
school dropout from Illinois who had drifted down to South Texas.
During Castillo's trial, the doctor testified that the leaving of
the clamp inside Champion had been for the best because, he said,
it prompted him to go back in and clean the wound.
</P>
<P>
   There was no direct evidence linking Castillo to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the robbery, Castillo appeared at a friend's
home and washed his hands at an outside faucet. The police tested
it for blood. ``It could not be determined whether the blood was
human or not,'' the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, who had pleaded guilty to another robbery-stabbing
committed a month before the Party House crime, lacked the means
for a strong defense. The state gave him $500 for an investigator.
The trial court turned down Castillo's lawyer's request for an
additional $600. The court ruled that there was no legal obligation
to provide Castillo with the additional money.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Owen, a death penalty appellate lawyer with the Austin firm
Schonemann, Roundtree &AMP; Owen, said that an adequate investigation
would have required $5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, Bush's criminal adviser, said it was difficult to know
what it would have cost for a good investigation 17 years ago. He
added, ``We do everything we can to put up enough money to
represent these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A critical witness against Castillo was Pedro Garcia, who was
himself a suspect because he had worked across the street from the
liquor store and knew Champion's pattern of going to and from the
bank with money.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the crime, Castillo was living with Garcia and
his family in a public housing complex. Garcia testified that when
Castillo came home late on the night of the robbery, his first
words as he came though the door were, ``I did it.'' Castillo did
not explain what it was he had done.
</P>
<P>
   The police searched Garcia's two-bedroom apartment. They found
nothing. But the next day, his wife, Lucinda, found a bloody
T-shirt and two money bags in a closet, and called the police.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors took only 45 minutes to find Castillo guilty. They
might not have been so sure if Castillo's lawyers had found Pedro
Garcia's uncle, Oscar Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in his modest home in Mercedes, Oscar
Garcia said things that might have led jurors to question Pedro
Garcia's credibility. There was deep hatred, Garcia said, between
the Garcia and Castillo families.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Garcia, 39, talked about the case in the four-room house
in Mercedes where she is raising four of her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``David, he never, ever admitted to it,'' she said. ``To this
day, I wouldn't be sure he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the punishment phase of Castillo's trial, his sister and
brother wanted to testify. But they could not afford to travel to
Texas from their homes in the Midwest. And Castillo's lawyers did
not ask the court for money to help them make the trip. Mitigating
witnesses are essential if a jury is to be persuaded not to give a
convicted murderer the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The character witnesses who did take the stand were not
adequately prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of the lawyers told us what they were going to ask
us, or what kinds of things they wanted us to say,'' David
Castillo's father, Juan Castillo Sr., said in an affidavit filed as
part of his son's unsuccessful state habeas petition. ``I think I
must have done more harm than good because I didn't know what to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the jury half an hour to vote the death sentence for
Castillo, a sentence that Sutton, the Bush adviser, said was fair
and supported by the case record.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   David Spence: Executed 4/3/97
</P>
<P>
   David Spence was executed in connection with the rape and
torture murders of two 17-year-old girls and the murder of an
18-year-old boy in Waco. He received death sentences in two trials
for the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Spence, a roofer with a history of substance abuse, was accused
of a murder-for-hire killing that went awry, in which the three
victims died. Muneer Deeb, a convenience store owner, was also
charged and sentenced to death in the case. But he received a new
trial and was acquitted in 1993. Deeb died last November of liver
cancer. He had steadfastly maintained that neither he nor Spence
had anything to do with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The original police homicide investigator, Ramon Salinas,
acknowledged in the appeals process that he had serious doubts
about Spence's guilt. In a sworn deposition given to Spence's
lawyers in 1993, Marvin Horton, a former Waco police lieutenant who
was involved in the case, said, ``I do not think David Spence
committed this offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution built its case against Spence around bite marks
_ a state expert said that bite marks on the body of one of the
girls matched Spence's teeth _ and jailhouse snitches, both of
which can be highly unreliable forms of evidence. Spence was
already in prison, serving a 90-year sentence for aggravated sexual
abuse of an 18-year-old man, when he was indicted for the Waco
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the six jailhouse witnesses who testified at trial
subsequently recanted, saying they had been given cigarettes,
television privileges and alcohol, and one of them had been allowed
conjugal visits with a girlfriend, in exchange for their
accusations against Spence.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's post-conviction lawyers from the now-closed Texas
Resource Center organized a blind panel study in which five experts
_ odontologists _ said the bite marks could not be matched to
Spence's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, the governor's criminal justice adviser, said the
verdict was fair and the death penalty was justified.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush running for president, and the Texas death penalty
system under heavier scrutiny, one of Spence's post-conviction
lawyers, Raoul Schonemann, says ruefully that Spence is receiving
more attention now than he did when his lawyers were fighting to
save his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``David certainly wanted us to persist in trying to bring out
the truth,'' Schonemann said. ``I've always been willing to answer
questions. But I feel very conflicted. It's competing with my time
for our people who are living.''
</P>
<P>
   Odell Barnes: Executed 3/1/00
</P>
<P>
   Odell Barnes admitted to robbery and rape, and acknowledged that
he was a crack addict. But he went to his death maintaining that he
had not raped and murdered Helen Bass.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who handled Barnes' final federal appeals, Mike
Charlton, Philip Wischkaemper and Gary Taylor, were so certain of
his innocence that they spent a good portion of their own money
investigating his case.
</P>
<P>
   But like all death row inmates, once Barnes had entered the
post-conviction phase, the burden was on him to prove not just that
he was innocent, but that there had been constitutional errors in
his case. It is extremely difficult to prove either one.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' two court-appointed trial lawyers had done almost no
investigation, Charlton said. They had not hired any scientific
experts to look at the blood and semen that the prosecution said
linked Barnes to the murder. And they only interviewed a few
witnesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barnes' trial lawyers had handled only one capital murder
trial. The other lawyer had also handled one previous case, as a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Barnes had killed Bass, a 42-year-old nurse who was
his mother's best friend, by bludgeoning her with a rifle butt and
another heavy object, stabbing her and shooting her in the head.
Semen found inside Bass matched that of Barnes. A fingerprint on a
lamp, which police said may have been used to beat her, also
belonged to Barnes. In addition, one dime-sized spot of blood on a
pair of Barnes' coveralls, which the police had seized from his
brother's car, matched that of Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said the state's case against Barnes was strong. But
Charlton and his partners challenged the state's case by
establishing that Barnes had had a consensual sexual relationship
with Bass. Barnes had told his lawyers that from the beginning, but
they had apparently not listened, Charlton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Burtman of The Houston Press conducted an investigation of
the 1991 murder, and the newspaper published a lengthy article in
January that raised doubts about Barnes' guilt. Burtman found a
letter Barnes had written in 1994 to his state habeas lawyer,
saying that he had not raped Bass, that they had had a sexual
relationship. Barnes said they had had sex two or three days before
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their sexual relationship, Barnes helped Bass
with repairs around the house, and was a frequent visitor. That
could have explained the fingerprint on the lamp, Charlton said.
And while the prosecution had maintained that Bass had bought the
lamp a week before her death _ an assertion that went unchallenged
at trial _ Barnes' final team of lawyers learned from Bass' son
that the lamp was seven or eight years old.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny spot of blood on Barnes' coveralls was analyzed by
Kevin Ballard, a leading forensic chemist who is a consultant to
the FBI. The state had already run DNA tests confirming that the
blood was Bass'. Ballard concluded that it contained extremely high
levels of citric acid, which is used in vials to preserve blood. He
said that the blood had either been planted or dropped accidentally
on Barnes' coveralls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new forensic evidence, Charlton and his
partners interviewed new witnesses who contradicted all the
testimony put on by the state at trial. The lawyers also found that
the Wichita Falls Police had botched the crime scene investigation,
failing, among other things, to preserve a shoe print found at the
scene and to test blood smeared all over the house.
</P>
<P>
   The federal and state courts both refused to allow Barnes'
lawyers to present their new evidence. Finally, the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to intervene.

MEXICO TIES A MASS GRAVE TO ABDUCTION AND COCAINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Mexico)   (Eds.: Changes ``this week'' to ``last week'' in 3rd graph.) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In 1995, after a Texas jury had acquitted him of
cocaine trafficking, Alberto Ochoa Soto, reportedly a member of a
Colombian drug cartel, was driven to the top of the arched
international bridge over the Rio Grande and released into Mexico,
where his lawyer greeted him, witnesses have said.
</P>
<P>
   As the two met on the bridge, however, a Chevrolet Suburban
drove up the bridge, and several men with Mexican Federal Judicial
Police credentials seized Ochoa and the lawyer, Antonio Tarazon
Navarro, shoved them into the car and roared off into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, little news emerged on their fate, until last
week, when Mexican and American authorities announced that they had
identified six of nine bodies unearthed by forensic experts from
the FBI from three mass graves near Ciudad Juarez. That border city
is a staging point for drug shipments into El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their names and nationalities, little is known about five
of the six men whose remains were identified. But the sixth
skeleton was identified as that of Tarazon, the lawyer, who was 42
when he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The case is well known to human rights and legal investigators,
who have pressed authorities in the United States and Mexico for
justice in what they consider a brazen crime that has focused a
spotlight on the involvement of the Mexican police in scores of
border executions.
</P>
<P>
   Tarazon's skeleton was exhumed on a ranch 43 miles west of
Juarez, the senior prosecutor who heads the Mexican Organized Crime
Unit, Jose Trinidad Larrieta, said on Thursday. Tarazon was killed
by gunshots to the neck and face, Larrieta said. A DNA test that
used a blood sample provided by Tarazon's sister definitively
identified the remains, Larrieta added.
</P>
<P>
   Tarazon was found buried with one other man, and Mexican and
American agents presume that the remains are those of Ochoa, who
was 51 when he disappeared. An American who has spoken with FBI
agents about the case said the agents had obtained blood samples
from Ochoa's relatives in Medellin and were awaiting results of a
DNA test.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Ochoa and Tarazon vanished, a financial dispute was
simmering between Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, and,
according to court records and American investigators who have
studied the case, the Mexican police appear to have acted as
contract killers in the pay of a powerful Mexican trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa had been arrested in Texas and charged with importing 6
tons of cocaine. But the jury in El Paso acquitted him at his trial
months later, court records show. On Feb. 15, 1995, he was released
across the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   An American who has interviewed the Tarazon and Ochoa families
said when Tarazon greeted his client he was wearing dark slacks, a
gray shirt and black loafers, the same clothes found with the
remains, Larrieta said.
</P>
<P>
   After the men had been shoved into the Suburban, all that was
know was that Tarazon left a message on an answering machine at an
associate's office saying Mexican federal agents were holding him.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa's Mexican wife had reported his detention to Federal
Police officers in an office of the agency in Juarez. With Ochoa's
wife listening, a federal agent telephoned colleagues, who
acknowledged that they had Ochoa and Tarazon in custody, the
American who has interviewed Ochoa's wife said.
</P>
<P>
   The agent assured Ochoa's wife that her husband and Tarazon were
in no danger and told her to get back in touch the next day. When
she phoned back, however, the agent was no longer in the office,
and she was never able to re-establish contact with him or to learn
more about the fate of the two men, until Larrieta's announcement
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor identified three other skeletons as Americans who
had lived in El Paso. They were Jesus Alonso Provencio, Marcelo
Javier Aguilar Molina and Guillermo Jesus Rojo. The other two
skeletons were identified as Ignacio del Real Fierro, a Mexican who
lived in El Paso, and Raul Alarcon Sanchez, a Mexican who lived in
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in the executions, Larrieta said.

SPORTS COLUMN: GOLF'S LITERARY ROOKIE OF THE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., La.)   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the midst of Tiger Woods' golf reign, it's too bad Beau
Stedman isn't alive to challenge him.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Beau was never alive.
</P>
<P>
   In a golf mystery that you can put in your back pocket like a
scorecard, Beau Stedman is ``The Greatest Player Who Never Lived''
(Sleeping Bear Press, $22.95). Now in its third printing, J.
Michael Veron's first novel is golf's literary rookie of the year.
It has sold nearly 85,000 copies and the publisher, Brian Lewis,
has retained the Artists Management Group to negotiate offers for a
Hollywood tee time.
</P>
<P>
   As literature rather than sport, golf often proves George
Plimpton's philosophy that the smaller the ball, the better the
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Not always. Too many golf books are too frivolous. Too many of
those books deserve the same title: ``How I Three-Putted Every
Hole.'' Because nobody else cares.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The Greatest Player Who Never Lived,'' readers are
introduced to a golfer just elusive enough to be believed. And to
be revered as a mythical cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Stedman is the golfer that every duffer never was.
</P>
<P>
   Chunky at only 5 feet 6 inches, with wild curly hair, using
various aliases in his quiet duels with famous golfers over three
decades, Beau was on the lam for a murder he didn't commit. All
this is told and investigated by Charley Hunter, a law-school hire
in an Atlanta firm who discovers Stedman's exploits while filing
the late Bobby Jones' papers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   As anybody who has ever hit a golf ball out of bounds knows,
Jones really was an Atlanta lawyer even before he retired from
tournament golf after his 1930 Grand Slam: winning the U.S. Open
and Amateur as well as the British Open and Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   But as nobody knew until now, in the 1928 Southern Amateur at
Seminole, Jones lost his semifinal match on the 20th hole when a
15-year-old amateur, one Beauregard Stedman, sank a 40-foot birdie
putt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, while Stedman was working odd jobs in the pro shop of a
Hilton Head, S.C., country club, he discovered the bloodstained
body of Mrs. Henry Gladstone, stabbed 47 times. Her husband accused
Stedman, who took off but wrote a letter to Jones, for whom he had
caddied at East Lake in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I wooden do nuthin so bad,'' the unschooled Stedman
wrote, ``but what chance have I got? They say I will get the chare.
I don't want to die for sumthin I didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of letters, Jones advised Stedman to lay low but
keep teeing his ball high. Soon a stranger named Dave Malone won
the Mississippi Amateur. Another stranger named Clarence Walker won
the Louisiana Amateur. And then Jones began arranging money matches
for various other strangers with the best players of that era:
Tommy Armour, Francis Ouimet, Gene Sarazen, Walter Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   It's this connection to golf's real people and real places that
makes Beau Stedman seem real, whatever his alias was as a stranger
in town.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, another stranger tees off with Byron Nelson,
Jimmy Demaret and Jack Burke Jr.; another goes 54 holes with Arnold
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering newspaper clippings and Jones' letters
regarding these matches, Hunter, the law-school hire, not only
persuades the USG A to assemble a Beau Stedman exhibit in its Golf
House headquarters in Far Hills, N.J., but he also uncovers
evidence clearing the by now vanished golfer of Mrs. Gladstone's
murder.
</P>
<P>
   To disclose the author's twist here would be worse than faking a
sneeze during somebody's backswing.
</P>
<P>
   As happens to so many unsolicited novels, Veron's manuscript sat
unread for several months in publisher Lewis' office in Chelsea,
Mich., until his administrative assistant, Karmel Bycraft, took it
home one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put it down,'' she told Lewis the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis couldn't put it down either. Veron, a trial lawyer in Lake
Charles, La., who has served as a USGA committee member and rules
official, had a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping Bear usually publishes classy nonfiction about golf and
golf courses, but ``The Greatest Player Who Never Lived'' is its
first novel and its first movie deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's about to publish Veron's second novel, ``The Greatest
Course That Never Was.'' Even though Beau Stedman never played it.

21 ASIAN-AMERICANS GET MEDAL OF HONOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Calif.)  By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than a half-century since they braved enemy
fire after first enduring the contempt of their own countrymen, 21
servicemen have been awarded the nation's highest military
decoration, the Medal of Honor, for heroism during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   All 21 were of Asian descent, and 19 were Japanese-Americans,
some of whose fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters were
interned behind barbed wire in the days of fear and prejudice that
followed the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are privileged to properly honor the heroic actions of
these brave soldiers,'' Louis Caldera, the secretary of the Army,
said in making the announcement on Friday. The medals will be
presented by President Clinton at a White House ceremony scheduled
for June 21.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 21 honored Friday was Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
As a 20-year-old lieutenant, he was gravely wounded in Italy on
April 21, 1945, while leading his platoon in an attack on a Fascist
bunker. He lost his right arm, and with it his dream of being a
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply grateful to my nation for this extraordinary
award,'' the senator said in a statement. ``If I did well, much of
the credit should go to my parents, grandparents and the gallant
men of my platoon. This is their medal. I will receive it on their
behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 21 are not as well known as Inouye. They were among
the millions of young Americans from classrooms and shops, cities
and prairies who went to war. But the Japanese-Americans felt they
had something to prove, and several thousand of them did, leaving
U.S. internment camps to become volunteers, most notably in the
442nd Regimental Combat Team.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Europe, the 442nd became known as ``the Purple Heart
battalion'' for the casualties it suffered. The 442nd fought in
eight major campaigns in Italy, France and Germany. The unit
suffered more than 800 casualties in the fall of 1944 as it rescued
211 members of a Texas unit pinned down by the Germans in southern
France, a battle known in military legend as ``the rescue of the
lost battalion.''
</P>
<P>
   The 442nd was awarded thousands of citations, including some
9,500 Purple Hearts and 52 Distinguished Service Crosses, the
second-highest military honor. By war's end, military historians
say, it was the most decorated unit in U.S. military history. But
the victory was far from complete. Japanese-American veterans
encountered prejudice when they came home. And why, some people
asked as the years went by, were only two Asian-Americans awarded
the Medal of Honor for World War II combat, especially if 104 rated
the Distinguished Service Cross?
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, saw that a provision was
written into a military-programs bill calling for the Army and Navy
to review the 104 Distinguished Service Cross citations to gauge
whether any recipients had been unfairly denied the Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries determined that the 21 honored on Friday _ during
Asian Pacific American Heritage Month _ indeed deserved the
star-spangled, pale blue ribbon and gold medallion of the Medal of
Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 21 were members of the famed 442nd. One who was not
is Richard B. Davila. As a young Army officer, he saw combat in
France and Italy. On one occasion, he emptied three ammunition
boxes firing a machine gun at Germans barricaded in a house, then
charged the building and lobbed in hand grenades. When all went
quiet, he said, he knew he had done his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems funny, telling you all of this,'' he said wistfully
as the years dropped away.
</P>
<P>
   He was only slightly hurt that day in 1944. But not long
afterward, he was wounded in the right arm and chest. He spent
years in medical treatment and never regained use of the arm. But
he went to college, studied science, got his master's degree.
Davila married, had five children and retired after 25 years of
teaching in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Now 84, he looks back on a good life and looks forward to the
White House ceremony. His children and grandchildren will be there.
His wife will not. She died on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have been thrilled,'' Davila said with a catch in
his voice. Here are the men who were awarded the Medal of Honor:
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Davila, Barney Hajiro, Mikio Hasemoto (posthumous), Joe
Hayashi, Shizuya Hayashi, Daniel Inouye, Yeiki Kobashigawa, Robert
Kuroda (posthumous), Kiyoshi Marunaga and Kaoru Moto (posthumous).
</P>
<P>
   Masato Nakae (posthumous), Shinyei Nakamine (posthumous),
William Nakamura (posthumous), Joe Nishimoto (posthumous), Allan
Ohata, Yukio Okutsu, Frank Ono (posthumous), Kazuo Otani

 &HT;    `Mockingbird's' Scout comes to Monroeville
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``I just found my Truman!''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy McCoy's exultant chuckle leapt through the phone line,
making Monroeville, Ala., feel like right next door. And in a way,
the little (population 7,000) town on the western side of the state
has always felt familiar to millions who know it as the real-life
inspiration for Maycomb, where Harper Lee's classic novel ``To Kill
a Mockingbird'' is set.
</P>
<P>
   Lee still lives very privately in Monroeville, also the hometown
of late novelist Truman Capote, one of her closest childhood
friends. After much searching, McCoy, director of the Monroe County
Heritage Museums, cast a diminutive Capote doppelganger for a
walking tour of the town, ground zero for Mockingbird Fever.
</P>
<P>
   The town's Mockingbird Players are midway through a 12-show run
of a two-act stage version of Lee's book, directed by McCoy and
performed in the 400-capacity historic Courthouse. (All 12 shows
sold out the first day tickets were available.)
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the all-amateur production moves to Washington for
five shows at the Kennedy Center. But first, Monroeville gets to
welcome into its midst Saturday perhaps the biggest ``Mockingbird''
fan of all, Mary Badham. A Birmingham native who lives in Virginia,
she played Scout in the Oscar-winning 1962 film version of
``Mockingbird.'' Her character was the emotional eyes and ears of
the story of a 1930s small-town Southern lawyer (Gregory Peck)
defending a black man falsely accused of rape _ yet Badham has
never been to Monroeville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very excited to see the town, the courthouse and
experience the play in that setting,'' said Badham, who will attend
Saturday night's closing performance and gala afterward. ``I feel
that I will need to prepare myself for a very emotional
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   She should be getting used to it. Indeed, she's just back from
Kansas and an event with the Winfield Regional Symphony titled
``Scout Remembers `To Kill a Mockingbird.' '' Several years ago,
the symphony's director asked Badham to talk about making the movie
during a performance of selections from the film score. Invited
back this year, Badham brought along two other actors from the film
_ Philip Alford, who played Scout's brother, Jem, and Brock Peters,
who played Tom Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Badham, 47, is booked through October with ``Mockingbird''
events. And though she occasionally feels ``overwhelmed,'' she says
she completely understands the growing fascination with a
4-decades-old work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get fan mail from all over the world from people that have
been touched by this story,'' said Badham, who made only one other
film (1966's ``This Property Is Condemned,'' with Robert Redford).
``As human beings, it seems that we keep having to learn these
lessons over and over again. . . . To learn the meaning of, and the
feelings of, tolerance, love, understanding, valuing education,
honor, dignity _ it's all there, in this story.''

`INVINCIBLE' MAYOR ACKNOWLEDGES HIS WEAKNESSES
</HEADLINE>
 - (2TAKES)-NYT By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He has been the man so in control that he could
almost be heard setting his jaw. He has been the man who knows what
is best for everybody, the man who takes it upon himself to restore
morality to Gomorrah on the Hudson. For better, for worse, for
seven years, he has been the man.
</P>
<P>
   Then, over a span of a few days that culminated with an
extraordinary news conference on Wednesday, he became someone other
than the mayor a city thought it knew. That aura of confidence had
evaporated; in its wake was revealed a man in pain, ailing and
dispirited. Suddenly, Rudolph Giuliani seemed on the verge of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   The very qualities that some admired and others loathed seem to
have been turned upside down. Here was the man who had advocated
posting the Ten Commandments in public classrooms, now admitting to
a relationship with a woman other than his wife. Here was the
champion of public integrity now accused by his wife of having had
a relationship with a third woman, a much younger aide who now
heads a city-financed agency. Here was the invincible mayor now
acknowledging human weakness.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to separate what all this might mean for Rudolph
Giuliani the man as opposed to Rudolph Giuliani the presumed
candidate for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   So blurred is the line between his private and public lives that
he announced his desire for a legal separation from his wife, Donna
Hanover, at a news conference. Not only did his public announcement
take his wife by surprise, it recalled the many times he dismissed
some government study because it had been released before he had
been given a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later why he had delivered the news in a manner that
wounded his family and flabbergasted the public, Giuliani suggested
that his performance reflected his sense of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most honest, direct and decent way to deal with
something that is enormously complex,'' he said. ``So I felt that
was the moment that it had to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of last week, some people were saying that Giuliani
has handled his personal crises with his typical decisiveness.
Others are saying that his performance was typical in its
harshness; he had devastated his wife in a public forum. Then there
were those who were talking as though a new mayor _ a new man _ had
been revealed to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he seemed like a dictator _ you know? _ like iron,''
said Orlando Cienfuegos, 37, an auto mechanic in Nyack, N.Y. ``But
now he looks like he wants to cry. Can you see that? Rudy crying?''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Pettingel, a graphic designer on a break from jury duty in
Brooklyn, said that she too was struck by Giuliani's
uncharacteristic display of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought of Rudy as some cold-blooded reptile kind of
thing,'' she said. ``Not to be insulting, but that's how he came
off. But now he has problems that all of us can relate to. And
watching him on the TV last night just nearly broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's friends and advisers agreed. A few say they
do not care whether he runs for the Senate; they are more concerned
about his wife, his two young children, his overall well-being.
Matters have temporarily spun out of control for the controlling
mayor, they say, and understandably so.
</P>
<P>
   He has an extremely difficult job, he is running for higher
office, his own actions have led to the probable breakup of his
marriage _ and he just learned that he has the disease that killed
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer has a way of getting one's attention, even if early
detection means a likely cure. In cases of prostate cancer, the
kind that the mayor has, treatment can also lead to impotence or
incontinence. And the blithe discussion in some quarters of the
mayor's cancer being treatable does not reflect the terror he may
feel.
</P>
<P>
   As with any person faced with such issues, someone close to
Giuliani said, ``he has started to review his life.'' The wrinkle
is, that review is unfolding in public.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so long ago, when Giuliani's friends and
advisers struggled to convince skeptical reporters that the mayor
did indeed have a warm, personal side. Fault him for not always
being empathetic, they would say, but know that he is a dedicated
family man whose moral leadership is needed by a city at sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the comments of the mayor and his wife last week confirm
what has been long suspected. Despite his ``Father Knows Best''
public persona, Giuliani's private decisions were far from black
and white.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Hanover announced that for a long time she did not
participate in her husband's public life because of his close
relationship with his communications director, Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor and his former aide repeated their denials of
an affair, Hanover's comments indicate that at the very least, the
emotional attachment the mayor shared with Lategano-Nicholas
unnerved her.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover said that last May _ the same month that
Lategano-Nicholas left the administration _ she made a ``major
effort'' to restore her marital bond with Giuliani. ``Rudy and I
re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall,''
she said. ``At that point he chose another path.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover was referring to a relationship that her husband had
developed with Judith Nathan, a divorced executive who lives with
her teen-age daughter on the Upper East Side. Through the fall and
into this year, Nathan has been, in effect, hiding in plain sight _
attending various events at Gracie Mansion and City Hall, dining
with the mayor at restaurants and having him as a guest at her
condominium in Southampton.

NEW YORK: in Southampton.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a side of Giuliani never quite seen before. Having long
maintained that his private life was no one's business but his own,
he was now stopping just short of flaunting a relationship with
someone other than his wife.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Giuliani was running a Senate campaign that
seemed to rely more on verbal brickbats than on statewide travel. A
traditionally moderate Republican, he suddenly sought to
distinguish his views from those of his Democratic opponent,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, by attacking her as hostile to ``America's
religious traditions'' and opposed to posting the Ten Commandments
in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   He then delivered a curious taunt: As a joke, he flashed a
picture of the Ten Commandments at the end of a slide presentation
at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the laughter ended 18 days ago when, with refreshing and
reassuring candor, Giuliani revealed that he had prostate cancer.
Since then, it seems, time has been marked by tabloid headlines:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer News Moved Rudy To Tears, Pal Says''; ``Dinner Belle:
Rudy Eats With Gal Pal `Every Night'''; ``Donna's Dilemma: Mayor's
Wife Says `Decisions' Have To Be Made''; ``GOP Honcho's Advice to
Rudy on Marriage Mess: Work It Out.''
</P>
<P>
   That last headline, from The New York Post, referred to concerns
that the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, had expressed about
the state of the mayor's Senate campaign, concerns that are said to
be shared by other state Republican leaders. Giuliani later said
that it was the headline that moved him to go public with his
private problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me that I had to move forward, and that something
had to move forward,'' he said. ``Because the whole complex of the
decisions that I have to make _ including about my health _ and I
guess part of that is also straightening out your personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   And so last Wednesday, at Bryant Park, a different Rudy Giuliani
spoke to reporters: one with averting eyes and an apologetic
demeanor. He said that he would be seeking a legal separation from
his wife; that he accepted responsibility for everything he had
done; that he and those close to him had been going through a very
painful period; that given his illness, he might rely on Nathan
``more now than maybe I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My emotional state is, I'm very sad,'' he said. ``And I feel
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, even those close to him asked why he had done it. He
had rattled the Republican leadership, given tacit license to the
media to delve further into the lives of those around him, and all
but invited Hanover to lash back.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is clearly in the throes of a personal evaluation, they
say _ about his political future, about his sources of comfort,
about the preciousness of life. And such personal evaluations are
rarely neat _ especially those partially conducted in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough time,'' one adviser said. ``Certainly his human
side is showing in a way he's never allowed to be shown before. If
anything, it shows that he has that side _ that he's mortal like
the rest of us, vulnerable like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have not been so understanding. One former public
official said that what the mayor presented to the public last week
was ``puritanical self-destruction _ a rigid, remorseless
prosecutor now turning on himself.'' Another former official said
that the mayor was in the midst of learning what the mighty and
sanctimonious sometimes forget: ``Yo, you too are a human being,
and no one's bigger than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Orlean, a 40-year-old bank teller in Nyack, said she
had been left with a different impression, one formed by the fact
that she is going through an amicable divorce after 10 years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the mayor,'' she said. ``I think he runs the city
like it was his own, and not the people's. But if I don't vote for
him _ and I really don't think I will _ it won't be because of his
marriage problems. That part of him I sort of understand.''

LATEST POLL RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Utah, Fla., Colo.)  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida looks like Bush country. The presidential preference
polls there have Gov. George W. Bush of Texas leading Vice
President Al Gore by half a dozen points or more. One reason:
George W.'s brother Jeb is the Sunshine State's governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore says he nevertheless intends to compete for Florida's
big trove of electoral votes. And he insists he has a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Or maybe he's just bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, if he is to have any reasonable chance of
carrying Florida, he must overwhelmingly carry Broward County, on
the state's southeast coast. Broward is Democratic country, home to
thousands of condo-dwelling retirees from the Northeast,
particularly the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   On election days, they vote by the thousands, spurred to turn
out by the county's 40 or so Democratic clubs. In a country and
state in which election turnout has dropped to an embarrassing low,
election day in Broward is a political sight to see.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there is trouble in Broward. Rather than
concentrating at this point on drumming up support for Gore, the
county's Democratic clubs are locked in a divisive squabble over
who is to be chairman of the Council of Presidents, the umbrella
organization for the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Broward is still teeming with retirees. But as in
much of the rest of Florida, more and more young people are moving
in (including some Republicans, though Democrats still
predominate). Some of the new young Democrats think it is time for
the Broward old guard to move aside and let them run things,
including the Council of Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, when they tried to install 40-year-old Randy
Fleischer, the head of the county's Young Democrats organization,
as council president, the old guard, many in their 80s, balked, and
the meeting ended in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Another meeting has been called for June, and the county's
Democratic leader, Mitch Ceasar, is working to cool tempers and
restore unity lest Al Gore be the ultimate loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clubs are a critical element in our get-out-the-vote
campaign in the fall,'' he warned the other day.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION IN UTAH ON THE HIGH COURT?
</P>
<P>
   Utah was founded by Mormons. Two of every three residents of the
state are Mormons, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints; and Mormons, most of them conservative
Republicans, dominate Utah politics. The congressional delegation
is all Mormon. The state Legislature is predominantly Mormon. The
governor, Michael Leavitt, is a Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1926, the year when the five justices on the Utah
Supreme Court began to be appointed (before that they were
elected), the unwritten rule in Utah government has been that at
least one non-Mormon would always sit on the high bench.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that was the understanding until February.
</P>
<P>
   Then Leavitt broke with tradition. When the sole non-Mormon on
the court stepped down, he filled the slot with a Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Society of Separationists, which tried unsuccessfully
in 1993 to persuade the court to forbid opening prayers at
governmental meetings, strongly objected to the appointment. But
Leavitt stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   The society's director, Christopher Allen, contends that the
court was ``spineless'' when it was dominated by four Mormon
justices, and that it henceforth will be even more so. Utah, he
argues, is not a state but ``a solid theocracy'' with a theocratic
high court.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice, Richard C. Howe, disagrees. He told The
Associated Press the other day in a rare interview that he saw
nothing wrong with an all-Mormon court, and then added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you belong to one church or another shouldn't make any
difference. What we want on this court are men and women of good
character and legal ability, and their own private view on religion
really doesn't enter into their decisions. There may be an
exception once in a while, but it would be very subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   STUDENTS READY TO SPEAK WITH VOTES
</P>
<P>
   The way the freshman class at Northglenn High School in suburban
Denver saw it, if Gov. Bill Owens was so dead set on joining the
national rush to test students at various grade levels to see if
they are learning anything, or their teachers are teaching them
anything, he should come in and take the test himself.
</P>
<P>
   They sent him an invitation. After all, they reasoned, a lot of
them oppose assessment tests, along with their teachers, and the
Colorado Legislature might well have rejected the bill that made
the tests mandatory had Owens not bulled it through.
</P>
<P>
   The governor didn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, last week he sent back a letter that stung worse than a
whack on the hand by a 12-inch ruler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly not concerned with my ability to pass a test,''
he wrote, ``but I will certainly not take a test because a group of
students _ or others _ demand that I do so. If interest groups feel
that I can be threatened, pressured or intimidated, then that is a
formula for a weak governor. I will not give in.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon enough the sting wore off. And the freshmen, having
learned a thing or two, were ready to counter when a reporter from
The Rocky Mountain News showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of immature,'' said Kaitlin Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting a really bad example,'' added Brittany Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon the governor's spokesman, Dick Wadhams, chimed in with
some Politics 101.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't have it both ways,'' he said. ``If you wade into the
public arena and make demands of a public official, then this is
the kind of response that might be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned _ and then some, said Jessica Quimby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be threatened, either,'' she said. ``He's just our
governor. We'll be turning 18 pretty soon, and if he keeps this up,
we'll probably kick him out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   LATEST POLLS SHOW BUSH THE WINNER
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a
running tab of presidential preference polls in various states as
they become available. Last week, 13 polls were added to the list.
Here is how things stood overall a week ago:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush led in 23 states, worth 271 electoral votes.
Vice President Al Gore led in 11 states, worth 160 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Needed to win: 270 electoral votes.

.500 RECORD A RARE FEAT IN A.L. WEST
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's beginning to smell a lot like 1994. That would be the aroma
coming from the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1994 season ended prematurely, courtesy of a labor
dispute between the players and the owners, no AL West team had a
winning record. None had even a .500 record. The Texas Rangers were
in first place, and their record (52-62) was far from .500.
</P>
<P>
   Check the division's developments in the early weeks of the
season, heading into Saturday's games:
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (16-19) had their best winning percentage after they
won the first two games of the season. The last time they had a
.500 record was at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oakland Athletics (19-17) sneaked one victory over .500
at 18-17 on Thursday night, it was the first time since they had a
2-1 record that they had climbed above .500.
</P>
<P>
   The best the Anaheim Angels (18-19) had done was get two
victories above .500. They were one under.500 before Saturday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Seattle Mariners (17-16) had a 12-7 record, they had
won five games and lost nine.
</P>
<P>
   The teams, however, aren't ready to play down to their past. ``I
don't think it's going to reach that,'' Pat Gillick, the Mariners'
general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, said, ``I think
somebody will be at .500 to win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team has had its problems. The Mariners put together what
promised to be the best starting pitching rotation in their
history, but the leaders of that rotation, Jamie Moyer and Freddy
Garcia, are on the disabled list, having started a combined seven
games. The Mariners think Moyer, recovering from a strain behind
his left shoulder, can return before June 1. Garcia, who fractured
a leg, isn't expected back until the latter part of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it,'' Gillick said, ``but it will come down to
who can stay injury-free. There have been a lot of injuries in this
division already. If you lose a significant contributor, it puts a
crimp in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels began the season with Tim Belcher, one of their
veteran starting pitchers, on the disabled list. He has since been
joined by two other starters, Ken Hill and Jason Dickson, as well
as shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who had hit .395 in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer and Gabe Kapler, two-thirds of the Texas outfield,
are on the disabled list, as is Frank Catalanotto, a .500-hitting
platooned second baseman. The Rangers also learned last week that
Justin Thompson, the primary pitcher they received in the Juan
Gonzalez trade, needs rotator-cuff surgery and won't pitch at all
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's offensive catalyst, second baseman Randy Velarde, only
recently came off the disabled list, where he had been since the
start of the season. Their current contributions to the list are
Kevin Appier, one of their veteran starters, and John Jaha, one of
their productive hitters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Athletics have no shortage of productive hitters. The
division, in fact, boasts an offensive orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lead the league in hitting, while the Athletics lead
in runs scored despite having one of the lowest batting averages
and the most strikeouts, and they are second in home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics' Jason Giambi entered the weekend No. 1 in the
league in home runs (15) and runs batted in (42) and second in
slugging percentage (.735), Darin Erstad of Anaheim had the highest
batting average (.388), the highest home average (.461) and the
most hits (59), Alex Rodriguez of Seattle was first in runs scored
(36), on-base percentage (.483), road batting average (.435) and
walks (29), David Segui of Texas was second in batting average
(.378) and Ivan Rodriguez of Texas was second in total bases (92).
</P>
<P>
   Pitching, then, must be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin readily acknowledged that the Rangers' relief corps has
undermined the team's efforts to attain a winning record. John
Wetteland squandered a couple of ninth-inning leads over Cleveland
and the Yankees, and Jeff Zimmerman, who last year was virtually
unhittable, gave up game-losing home runs to Clay Bellinger of the
Yankees and Greg Vaughn of Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Just as damaging, some of the relievers' earned run averages
look like they were attacked by a severe siege of inflation: Mike
Munoz 13.50, Matt Perisho 10.50, Tim Crabtree 9.18. The Angels have
some of those, too: Mark Petkovsek 8.84 and Shigetoshi Hasegawa
6.98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starting pitching, for the most part, has been good,''
Bill Stoneman, the Angels' general manager, said. ``Our relief
pitching started off poorly, but it looks like it's coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman said he believed the Angels were better than a .500
team. ``We haven't been able to separate ourselves from the .500
mark,'' he added, ``but I see ourselves doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Ken Griffey Jr., the Mariners are not the
same offensively explosive team they have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't bludgeon anybody,'' Gillick said. ``Our offense is
sporadic. Our game is get a well-pitched game and good defense and
hope we score enough runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick said he didn't think there was any real difference
between his division and the Central. Melvin offered a similar
view, noting that the West was ``a good division from the
standpoint of being competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Yankees,'' he added, ``everybody has problems. If
you take away what the Yankees have done, I'm not sure there are
any other great teams. That's the way it is in our league right
now. It looks like there's parity.''
</P>
<P>
   With parity comes mediocrity. Mediocrity breeds .500 teams, or
worse.

 A RARE PAIR OF 1-0 SHUTOUTS ;  LEFT-HANDERS CAN'T HIT JOHNSON;
HERNANDEZ HOMER RATIO UP; KIM'S GLOVE FULL OF STRIKEOUTSBy MURRAY c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, as some baseball people believe, the ball has been altered
to allow batters to hit more home runs, which balls must Steve
Trachsel have used in his last two starts for Tampa Bay? An 18-game
loser last year who did not win two successive starts until
September, Trachsel has pitched two consecutive 1-0 shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   He did not complete the second one, against the Yankees and
Orlando Hernandez on Thursday night, but his seven-inning,
three-hit performance was impressive nonetheless, especially
following his complete-game three-hit shutout against Boston last
Saturday in a matchup with Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The only 1999 performance that came close to Trachsel's
achievement was a pair of 1-0 complete-game shutouts Jose Jimenez
pitched for St. Louis against the Arizona Diamondbacks, whose
pitcher in both games was one Randy Johnson. Just to make the feat
more spectacular, Jimenez pitched a no-hitter in the first shutout
and allowed only two hits in the second. The only problem was
Jimenez made a start between those 1-0 shutouts, losing to Houston,
11-3.
</P>
<P>
   According to research by Elias Sports Bureau, the last pitcher
to win two consecutive starts by 1-0 scores was Zane Smith of
Pittsburgh in 1992. Smith pitched a complete-game five-hitter
against St. Louis, then permitted five hits in 8 1/3 innings
against Houston. Stan Belinda got the last two outs in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs may be up from last season, but so are 1-0 games.
Eight such games have been played this season compared with seven
in the corresponding period last year. The Devil Rays have won
three of them. The Red Sox, the Angels and the Dodgers have each
lost two.
</P>
<P>
   Left-Handers Can't Hit Johnson
</P>
<P>
   In Randy Johnson's first seven starts for Arizona this season,
the relatively few left-handed batters who faced him did not fare
well. But then left-handers seldom do. Rafael Palmeiro, for
example, made no pretense about not wanting to play when Johnson
pitched against his team. Palmeiro has batted against the
left-hander 21 times and has only one hit to show for his futile
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   This season Todd Helton of Colorado and Mark Grace of the
Chicago Cubs had the only two left-handed hits against Johnson in
left-handers' 25 times at bat. Then last Wednesday night Johnson
pitched against Los Angeles, and the Dodgers put only one
left-handed hitter in their lineup. That hitter, Shawn Green, who
had not had a hit in five American League at-bats against Johnson,
stroked three singles in four tries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see a left-hander stay in there against Randy
the way Green did,'' said Sandy Johnson, the Diamondbacks'
assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez Homer Ratio Up
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu was not the most popular pitcher who ever played
for the Yankees. One element of his game that aroused criticism was
his penchant for giving up home runs. Last season he allowed an
average of one home run for 6.5 innings. The popular Orlando
Hernandez, meanwhile, permitted one per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching for Montreal this season, Irabu has basically
maintained his 1999 pace, giving up one home run every seven
innings (5 in 35 1/3 innings). But look who's giving up more?
Hernandez has thrown 11 home run pitches in 56 2/3 innings, or one
every five innings. He is tied for second in the American League
for most home runs allowed, only one behind Mike Mussina of
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's Glove Full of Strikeouts
</P>
<P>
   Byung Hyun Kim, a Diamondbacks relief pitcher from Kwayngsan-ku
Songjung-dong, South Korea, committed a no-no in a game against the
Dodgers last week. As a bunt by Alex Cora rolled past him, Kim
flung his glove at the ball to try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Kim, his aim was not good and the glove missed
the ball. Had he made contact, Cora would have wound up at third
base with one out in the 10th inning of a tied score. The rules
award three bases to a batter if a fielder throws his glove at a
ball and hits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah yes, three bases, no more,'' Kim said the next day when he
was asked about the play.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old right-hander might not have known about the
glove-throwing rule, but ask him about strikeouts and he could
already write his own book. In six appearances from April 27
through last Wednesday, Kim pitched a total of six innings and
struck out batters for 17 of the 18 outs.
</P>
<P>
   His only miss? A tapper back to the mound by Todd Hundley of Los
Angeles in the fifth of those six games. Kim pitched to two San
Diego batters Friday night and both grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing a fastball in the low 90s and an assortment of sliders,
Kim dazzled batters for Philadelphia, Milwaukee, San Diego and Los
Angeles. He gave up four hits, and the lone run he allowed cost the
Diamondbacks the first of those games, but his string of strikeouts
represents one of the most impressive performances of the season.
In 13 games overall, he has struck out 28 in 16 2/3 innings and has
a 1.62 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   What happened after the glove-tossing display? He had struck out
Adrian Beltre before the bunt, and afterward he struck out Dave
Hansen and Todd Hollandsworth.

CALIFORNIA PLAN WOULD EXEMPT TEACHERS FROM INCOME TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 3rd graf to add `credentialed' before teachers, CORRECT
figure for state budget to $90 billion; Subs 7th graf with 3 grafs
bgng, ``You know ..., with remarks from Gray's conference call
today; Adds response from state GOP, teachers union, background on

 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a striking gesture of support for public
education, Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday proposed to exempt
California public school teachers from the state's personal income
tax, in what state officials said they believed was the first such
peacetime exemption for any occupation in American history.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the proposal, part of the governor's
revised budget package to be announced on Monday, would amount to
an income tax cut of $1,350 for the average experienced California
teacher, who earns about $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state has about 283,000 credentialed public school teachers,
and the estimated annual cost of the program, which is subject to
legislative approval, would initially be $545 million out of a
total statewide budget of about $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the governor proposed to spend another $500
million a year to reward teachers whose schools show improvements
in student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, teachers whose schools show an improvement rate
of 20 percent or more based on the state's new academic performance
index, which ranks schools according to standardized tests, would
receive one-time bonuses of $5,000 each, while others would receive
lesser amounts based on their schools' performances.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to a form of merit pay that rewards collective
achievement by an entire school, as opposed to individual teachers,
which education unions generally oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I value all work, whether you're a janitor, middle
manager or a CEO, and I take a back seat to no one in my respect
for people who put themselves in harm's way, such as firefighters,
policemen, paramedics,'' Davis said in a conference call with
reporters, when asked why he was singling out one profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really believe we have to make a simple declarative
statement that above all else, teaching matters,'' he said. ``This
is the single most important profession to us in the Year 2000 and
that's the statement I'm making.''
</P>
<P>
   California has often been a trend-setter in tax policy, and
Davis, who took office two years ago vowing to make education his
``first, second and third'' priority, has sometimes been mentioned
as a potential Democratic vice-presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   But as a fiscal conservative, cautious to a fault, he has also
faced growing criticism for not moving swiftly enough in a booming
economy to redress the severe educational problems in a state that
once led the nation in per-pupil spending and investments in
education but that since the tax revolt of Proposition 13 in 1978
has seen itself slip toward the bottom in numerous national
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the first Democrat to lead the state in 16 years, had
faced pressure from fellow Democrats in Sacramento and especially
sharp attacks from the state's largest teachers' union, which had
threatened to sponsor a statewide ballot initiative this fall that
would have required California to return its per-pupil spending,
which has lagged in the bottom third of states in recent years, to
the national average over the next five years. Davis has opposed
that measure as requiring a costly tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the union agreed to drop the measure after the
governor proposed an additional $1.8 billion in discretionary
spending for education, intended to compensate for the lean years
of the early 1990s, when teachers were forced to do without
cost-of-living increases in wages to help close looming budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with a projected budget surplus of $11 billion to $13
billion, the challenge has been how to spend the unexpected money.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Davis aides said the idea of the tax exemption, which
would apply to fully credentialed teachers from kindergarten
through 12th grade, arose at a brainstorming session in a staff
retreat last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a huge statement about the importance of teaching,''
said one senior adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``What are the Republicans going to say? They and the teachers are
going to be hard pressed to oppose this.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, legislative Republicans have said they believe there is
room in the budget to spend perhaps an additional $3 billion on
education, and while they may well be wary of anything that looks
like special treatment for the teachers' unions, it seems likely
that they would have trouble objecting to the symbolism of Davis'
gesture, which was held in extraordinary secrecy by the governor's
staff over the last week so as to make a maximum public splash.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate Republican leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga, said his members favored tax relief but believed it
should be ``for all taxpayers in California, not just for one
group.'' Brulte said he wanted to review the proposal before
commenting further, but added, ``It'll make my kid brother happy:
He's a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kerr, the vice president of the California Teachers
Association, the state's largest teachers' union, expressed
pleasure at Davis's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible package,'' Kerr said. ``It's a positive
step, and I think it's going to help the kids of California. It
shows teachers are valued, and it's awfully creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis aides said their research had shown various past tax
exemptions for certain employee groups, but only in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Davis plan, public school teachers would be permitted
to deduct 100 percent of their teaching income on state personal
income tax returns. The estimated tax relief for a beginning
teacher would be $500 a year, rising to $1,350 for experienced
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break for teachers is just one element of Davis'
proposals for doling out the budget surplus. Other plans include a
$150 rebate for every income-tax payer to the state, and $300 for
couples who file joint returns, at a total cost of $1.76 billion.
Other measures include cutting state parks fees in half.
</P>
<P>
   Like other governors, Davis has offered a series of financial
incentives to recruit and retain qualified public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he proposed offering candidates who agree to teach in
low-performing schools $10,000 loans for buying a home, $30,000
bonuses for attaining advanced certification and $11,000 to repay
college loans.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis has generally resisted formally committing the state
to returning its per-pupil spending, which is calculated by complex
and sometimes disputed means involving a mix of state and federal
money, to the national average. He contends that his latest
proposals will take California's spending, which is estimated at
$6,045 this year, very close to the national average by the time
that average is next recalculated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Davis aides acknowledged, for example, that there are bound
to be disagreements about whether to count the teacher tax
exemption toward the per-pupil spending figures, since it is an
indirect expenditure of state funds.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the State speech in January, Davis acknowledged
that California must spend more to return its schools to the
post-sputnik era achievements of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even more important, we must spend wisely,'' Davis said
then. ``We cannot win this battle simply by throwing money at it.
We must not let taxpayer dollars be wasted on bureaucracy, but,
instead, we must invest them directly into the classroom: for
students and for teachers.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MAJERLE KEEPING THE KNICKS COVERED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (Eds: In 2nd graf ``SETI'' stands for the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence program) 
By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dan Majerle heard a whistle and looked at Hue Hollins
the way Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson once did, with incredulity
and rage. A foul? You called that a foul?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a reach-in foul 20 feet from the basket, contact with
Patrick Ewing that SETI might not have detected, with 2 seconds on
the shot clock and 13.6 seconds in overtime and the Knicks and
Heat, after 52 minutes and 46.4 seconds, still tied at the bargain
basement score of 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I really didn't hit him,'' Majerle would say
after fate had heard his case and adjudicated in his favor. ``And
that's a tough call to make with the game on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing missed a free throw. Anthony Carter made what may very
well have been an illegal shot from the Dolan family seating area
and no-trespassing zone. The 41 minutes to which Majerle had
sacrificed a couple more octogenarian years of jogging by the
beachfront were not lost in the final entanglement of angles and
issues, in Miami's 77-76 victory in Game 3 of the Eastern
Conference semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The box score couldn't tell us all we needed to know about
Majerle and Allan Houston, about an exhaustive perimeter dance most
reflective of a series that perhaps will not be decided by sheer
talent after all. The box score could only tell us that Houston had
come home with his best game, on 24 points on 9 of 18 from the
field. He had ignited an explosion of sound in Madison Square
Garden with a face up 3-pointer that gave the Knicks a 73-71
overtime lead and left an exasperated Majerle staring at his bench
and wondering how much more of Houston's release space he could
steal. ``I've been saying for a while now that he's my toughest
cover,'' Majerle would say. ``Once he gets his legs under him, he
can just go up and score from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lewis Majerle, born Sept. 9, 1965, in Traverse City,
Mich., has never been a great professional basketball player. Like
most of the very good contemporary white players, his reputation
has at times exceeded his game. At his very best in the early
1990s, in Phoenix, he was worth about 17 points, six rebounds and
three assists a game. They called him Thunder Dan. He could shoot
from way out and had a strong, purposeful stride. He relished a
defensive challenge and didn't back away from the matchup with
Michael Jordan in the 1993 NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thunder Dan, my behind,'' Jordan snapped when the series was
over and Majerle had measured a clear second to a true basketball
great.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle played basketball in those days the way Lenny Dykstra
played baseball, and he, too, paid for his abandon with injuries,
with a body sapped too soon of offensive skill. He left Phoenix,
unhappily, for Cleveland. He migrated south to Miami, just in time
for the start of the Knicks-Heat wars. He is 34 now, healthy again,
but with more clouds than thunder in his sinewy, 6-foot-6-inch
frame. On the final possessions of a long, draining night, Houston
became obscured in Majerle's defensive cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how the Knicks wanted the ball in the pure shooter's hands,
leading by 75-73, needing a basket to put Miami away, maybe once
and for all, after pushing into overtime on Ewing's clutch jumper.
Latrell Sprewell had given up his dribble out front. Houston tried
desperately to create a passing lane.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle would not give him room. The Knicks took a timeout, and
ultimately settled for a shot they didn't want, a missed Marcus
Camby drive.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning tied the score with a baseline jumper. Now here
came the Knicks, waiting for Houston to break free of Majerle,
again on the left side. And Majerle wouldn't let Houston get away,
wouldn't let him breathe. The shot clock ran down. Ewing turned the
ball over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Jack Ramsay, the former Portland coach and Miami
television analyst would say. ``How often do you see defense where
the guy can't even go out 20 feet from the basket and get the
ball?''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Brown knew why. ``When you come down to this point of your
career,'' he said, ``every game becomes the game of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   In career twilight, Majerle has become, more than any other
player, more so with each passing season, the embodiment of Pat
Riley's Heat. There is no champion in this team. In Majerle, there
is only the heart of one.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat has the Knicks good and scared going into Game 4
Sunday. Miami is an outfit patched together with sticks and glue,
with offensive alignments that could be a Regis question for $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the following Heat players is capable of scoring a
basket in a crucial half-court set? a)Otis Thorpe. b)Anthony
Carter. c)Bruce Bowen. d)Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumstances of his defensive attrition, Riley could
forgive Majerle's 1-for-6 shooting Friday. He did have a game-high
seven assists and six rebounds and, of course, the final answer for
Houston on defense. And Anthony Carter somehow found the basket,
negating the cheap call that put Ewing on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle wasn't tired, he said, but he was counting on ``being
exhausted'' by morning. If he were home, he would have played 18
holes after practice Saturday. He would instead spend the afternoon
and evening relaxing, eating right, getting ready for Houston in
Game 4, which is a game the Knicks, of course, are certain to win
because Miami and Majerle cannot keep this up.
</P>
<P>
   They can't, right?

EDITORIAL: ACTIVISM ON MOTHER'S DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, May 14:
</P>
<P>
   No matter how simple it looks, Mother's Day is a complicated
holiday. It has its roots in mid-19th-century women's activism,
championed first in 1858 by Anna Reeves Jarvis and then in 1872 by
Julia Ward Howe. Their causes, honored locally on various mother's
days in mid-spring, were improved sanitation, first aid and world
peace. But activism is about the last thing Mother's Day called to
mind in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the first official Mother's Day on May
8, 1914, fulfilling a joint resolution of Congress that authorized
the president to proclaim the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day
and to request the flying of the American flag as a token of that
fact. The patriotism has filtered out of Mother's Day over the past
86 years, making it hard to think of this holiday as an
acknowledgment, as the joint resolution put it, of ``the service
rendered the United States by the American mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The day has instead been formalized, commercially, into a
festival of flowers and feminine gifts and, perhaps, a few minutes
of hard-earned leisure. But it has also been informalized, made a
more intimate and less civic display of feeling.
</P>
<P>
   There is something a little ambivalent, a little archaic, about
the formulaic ways we celebrate this day, if only because the
status of mothers has never been more complex. In 1914, a mother's
service outside the home was mainly inferential. ``The American
mother,'' Congress wrote, ``is doing so much for the home, for
moral uplift, and religion, hence so much for good government and
humanity.'' There is a lot in that one word ``hence.'' But these
days there is no inference about it at all. Mothers are as likely
to work in good government as they are in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best fate for this holiday would be to make it,
again, a day of open activism, as it is for the women marching on
behalf of gun control in many cities across the country today. Not
everyone believes, as Julia Ward Howe did, that if mothers could
only come together somehow, world peace would ensue. But the second
Sunday of every May could come to symbolize a powerful reality of
contemporary American politics. Women united behind a cause can be
a powerful force for progressive social policies, better child
care, broader health coverage and fully equal opportunity for them
and their children.  &QL;

GIULIANI CANCELS FUND-RAISING TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (With GIULIANI) 
 By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani canceled an upstate campaign
trip on Saturday as aides said he wanted to devote the weekend to
making a decision on both his treatment options for prostate cancer
and whether he wanted to proceed with his campaign for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides said that the mayor could decide whether to
continue his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton as soon as
Monday. Giuliani was said to be receiving conflicting advice about
what to do, though several people close to the mayor said it seemed
increasingly unlikely that he would stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Giuliani has announced that he has
prostate cancer, is separating from his wife of 16 years and has
established a relationship with a 45-year-old sales manager for a
drug company who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had been scheduled to make a speech Saturday night in
Oneonta, N.Y., at a fund-raising dinner sponsored by Delaware
County Republicans. Giuliani's campaign announced Saturday morning
that he was canceling the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's entitled to some time for himself to contemplate his
medical treatment,'' said his campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum.
``This is the first day in a long time that he'll have an
opportunity to sit back and to think seriously about his medical
treatment, and he's certainly entitled to the time.''
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, the mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, echoed
Teitelbaum's comments, saying the mayor was taking it easy. ``He's
pulling his schedule back,'' she said. ``He's focusing on reviewing
his medical options.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is scheduled to make a midweek fund-raising visit to
California, though aides said the chances of his going through with
that trip were remote. And he is scheduled to appear at a town hall
meeting on Thursday night in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's decision to cancel his trip was just one sign that he
was moving into the final phases of making a decision about the
race. Campaign and City Hall officials said the mayor, who
customarily makes himself available to reporters on Saturdays, had
no plans to make any public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   However, at City Hall on Saturday, a mayoral spokesman said that
Giuliani might appear at an event in Manhattan on Sunday, but he
had no further details. Campaign and City Hall officials said
Giuliani was expected to stay in New York City over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's advisers acknowledged that in this intense
environment, he might have difficulty maintaining much privacy. On
Friday night, Giuliani had dinner on the Upper East Side with
Judith Nathan, the woman whom he has called a ``very good friend,''
before strolling the streets of Manhattan, trailed by
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing his cancer diagnosis two weeks ago, the mayor
acknowledged a relationship with Nathan and said that she had been
a comfort to him during a difficult time and that he would continue
to rely on her support as he contemplated his medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hanover, the mayor's wife, is spending the weekend in
California with her parents, her aides said.

BUSH VS. GORE MEANS AN ALL-BABY-BOOM RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 11th and 12th grafs, Here was ..., for new Gore quote) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades of caricature as the most
self-indulgent and permissive generation in American history, baby
boomers _ including Al Gore and George W. Bush _ are realizing that
it's time to get with the program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences in political orientation, the two
parties' presumptive presidential nominees, both of whom were born
into the vanguard of the boomer generation, are delivering the same
message on the campaign trail: ``responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that goes to the personal and the political and
speaks, the candidates hope, to a generation once famous for its
idealism and its determination to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the campaigns have sensed a new wrinkle, so to speak,
in the ever-scrutinized lives of the boomers that has emerged as
they have aged _ the oldest boomers are now in the unusual position
of contemplating their own retirements even as their parents are
living longer and requiring more care. At the same time, some, like
Gore, whose mother is 87 and whose mother-in-law lives with him and
his wife, are even becoming grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   This nexus of life-defining events for the biggest cohort in
American history (the 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964)
has infused the presidential campaign with a new urgency,
especially regarding Social Security and health care. Both Bush and
Gore have devoted much time on the campaign trail to Social
Security and both plan to deliver major addresses on Social
Security on the topic on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a response to what's happening in society,'' said John
Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, one of
the biggest and most effective lobbying groups in the country.
``It's driven by demographics, the economy and technology. There's
a growing awareness, particularly of people who are Bush's and
Gore's age, that their parents' generation is becoming frail, we
don't have support systems that are in very good shape, and the
anxiety about your own retirement is on the top of people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was born March 31, 1948, making him 52. George W. Bush
was born July 6, 1946, making him 53. And while they had different
coming-of-age experiences during the 1960s and 1970s _ Gore was
closer to the counterculture than was Bush, but still by no means a
radical _ both are invoking their generational roots as themes in
their campaigns and are developing ``responsibility'' as rationales
for their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign marks one of the few times in modern history that
candidates from both parties have been so close in age. For the
first time, two baby boomers are running for president,
representing a definitive break with the World War II era. Given
the unprecedented prosperity, these factors give the nation a
chance to reset its compass and restructure its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here was Bush in a recent interview with ``The News Hour'' on
PBS:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong candidate because I come from the baby boomer
generation, recognizing that we've got to usher in an era of
responsible behavior, which starts with behaving responsibly in the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Here was Vice President Gore at a fund-raiser Thursday night in
Los Angeles, explaining the strong economy:
</P>
<P>
   ``We got rid of the politics of illusion and said to the
American people: `We have got to make the real hard choices. We
have to accept responsibility for our own future.' That's why it
was so tough to pass the changes that have helped to unleash all
this potential. Tough, tough, tough.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, says the invocation of
responsibility is a harkening to fundamental values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that people ought to be responsible for their
actions is one of the top-most widely shared values in this
country,'' he said. ``So it's no surprise that politicians talk in
that idiom.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a strong degree of self-interest in their
appeals, particularly when it comes to issues like Social Security
and Medicare. Politicians used to focus issues like Social Security
and Medicare solely on the over-65 crowd. But now, Mellman noted,
``people are worried about taking care of their parents, and the
leading edge of the baby boom are worried about their own
retirement and some are worried about both at the same time, which
is a newer phenomenon.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A political focus group of mostly middle-aged people conducted
earlier this month in Bala Cynwyd, a suburb of Philadelphia, by
Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, found unanimity on one subject _
despite the prosperous economy, people are anxious about health
care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``As baby boomers get older, people start to feel it as well as
think it,'' Frank Ratel, 60, an accountant, said during the focus
group.
</P>
<P>
   Rother of AARP said: ``The assumption among many people is that
it's only seniors who care about Medicare and Social Security, but
nothing could be further from the truth. Our polling shows it is
boomers who are the most interested in prescription drug coverage
because you're thinking about your mom and at the same time
wondering about your own future. When you're in your 50s, you don't
know what kind of shape you're going to be in. This is a greater
concern of people in their 50s than it is for people 65 and
older.''
</P>
<P>
   The crunch for baby boomers is becoming increasingly obvious.
Almost 50 percent of the people who filed for bankruptcy in 1999
were baby boomers. Some academics, like Elizabeth Warren, a
bankruptcy expert at Harvard Law School, argue that, contrary to
the popular image of affluent boomers spending their way to
consumer heaven, this is ``the most vulnerable generation'' because
of the confluence of potential failures that they face, from the
loss of a job to catastrophic illness to the effects of divorce and
the need to care for aging parents.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of bankruptcy increases with age, as people
approaching retirement face mounting costs, particularly for
prescription drugs and long-term care. Both Gore and Bush are
offering proposals to help people meet these needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security system has a surplus now, but the government
predicts that the trust fund will begin paying out more than it
takes in by 2015 as the baby boom generation retires. Without a
major fix, the system could go broke by 2037.
</P>
<P>
   But for both candidates, the notion of ``responsibility'' goes
beyond strengthening Social Security, which they would do by
different means.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emphasizes personal responsibility as a direct
counterweight to what he perceives as the irresponsibility of
President Clinton (the first baby boomer president). The goal of
his candidacy, Bush says, is to restore honor and dignity to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   And the signal inherent in his message is an appeal to family
values, long seen as Republican turf.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has emphasized the theme since he began his campaign last
June, saying ``My first goal is to usher in the responsibility era
_ an era that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades,
where our culture has said: If it feels good, do it, and if you've
got a problem, blame someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also used his emphasis on compassion to temper any
impression that responsibility means harshness or sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, responsibility is a multipurpose concept, and he tends
to use it both subliminally and overtly. He too is trying to
distance himself from the actions of Clinton. But he also wants to
present himself as the logical successor to Clinton as the steward
of the nation's current prosperity, and so he offers himself as the
responsible heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, necessitates presenting Bush as the
``irresponsible'' alternative, a neat way, learned from Clinton, of
transforming a policy matter into a values judgment. Repeatedly,
Gore casts Bush's proposals as ``reckless,'' a quality Gore
conjures up with his relentless referencing to Bush's ``risky tax
scheme.'' The contrast between the responsible Gore and the
irresponsible Bush has fast become the organizing principle of the
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Gore is using the idea of responsibility to reinforce
one of the basic tenets of his party. While Bush's reference
summons family values, Gore's highlights the Democrats' traditional
advantage on preserving entitlement programs. The ``risky tax
scheme'' that he invokes is a direct threat to two tenets of
Democratic orthodoxy _ Social Security and Medicare _ that baby
boomers are now either depending on to help their parents or
expecting to receive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It references the basic policy dilemma of his presidency,''
said Elaine Kamark, Gore's chief domestic policy adviser. ``The
challenge has gone from how to manage the insolvency of these
programs to who can keep control of the surplus. The money guys on
Wall Street understand this very well. They want confidence. You
get it by running a straight, sound fiscal policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore had children relatively early for his generation,
he is now a grandparent. ``His life cycle is slightly ahead of his
generation, so he can see ahead to the centrality of some of these
issues,'' Kamark said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore is more a creature of the popular image of the baby
boom than is Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush exudes a more retro 1950s youth, one of hijinks and
drinking and frat parties, remarkably detached from the Vietnam War
or any kind of rebellion or existential angst. As he told an
interviewer for GQ: ``I don't remember any kind of heaviness
ruining my time at Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems much more a product of his time. He invariably
dangles his boomer credentials before his audiences, mentioning the
touchstones of his generation _ the assassinations, the civil
rights movement, Vietnam, Watergate, his ``disillusionment with
politics,'' though never rebellion, and his admission that he
smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments about drug use also carry a responsible message
of caution, as he warns audience that the marijuana of today is
much stronger that what he smoked.

N.Y. COLUMN: INDIAN MASCOT STIRS CULTURE WAR IN CATSKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOICEVILLE, N.Y. _ The once-dominant Onteora Indians high school
football team sank so low that it did not even play one recent
season. Seeking to stoke athletic prowess in 1997, boosters painted
a mural in the gym of a tomahawk-wielding Indian, with war paint,
bulging muscles and gritted teeth, bursting through a brick wall.
The team is still struggling, but the Indian seems to have turned
everyone else here into warriors.
</P>
<P>
   If the New York race for Senate is a soap opera, the Onteora
school board race is the World Wrestling Federation. Body-slamming
has broken out in Woodstock and surrounding Ulster County towns
that share the high school. One side sees the Indian mascot as a
racist stereotype; the other sees a symbol of local pride under
attack by the political correctness militia.
</P>
<P>
   There are accusations of punctured car tires, swiped campaign
signs and telephone threats. Police reports have been filed, and
Justice Department mediators have been called in to ease tensions.
School board meetings have gotten loud and ugly, with names like
``racists'' and ``freaks'' flying freely. About 700 people signed
petitions demanding the ouster of the superintendent of the mainly
white school district, Hal Rowe, who calls the mascot
``institutional racism.'' Joseph Doan, a board member who supports
the Indian mascot, said a woman took her son off a baseball team
Doan coaches, in protest.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's school board election, there are two competing
slates, one favoring the mascot, one opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say this pejoratively,'' Donna Boundy, an anti-mascot
candidate, said of the other side's mind-set, ``but it's less
intellectual, more Reaganesque.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Perry, a pro-mascot candidate, said: ``The Indian head is
on a new silver dollar. Is that wrong?'' He added, ``Forty-nine
years it was not a problem, and then you have these strange-looking
Rastafarians coming in cursing.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Perry is referring to members of Color, a group of
interracial families in Woodstock who asked that the board remove
the mural. To their surprise, the board voted 4-3 in January to
phase out the Indian name, beginning next school year. It was the
first shot of this culture war in the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's appropriate for four people to reverse 50
years of history,'' said Martin Millman, the board president.
</P>
<P>
   Indian mascots are controversial elsewhere, but here, at least,
the fight is less about Indians than about who rules.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock is, well, Woodstock, and much of the rest of the
school district consists of rural towns where it is not quite as
easy to find a good tofu burrito. Hundreds of people have attended
recent board meetings seeking to undo the vote. Millman said he
proposed removing the mural yet retaining the name, but opponents
wouldn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rosato, a board member, said he opposed the mascot after
realizing that Indian symbols were as sacred as a crucifix or Star
of David. ``They're flesh-and-blood human beings,'' he said of
Indians. ``They're still alive. They work, they have families,
they're our neighbors, and they're telling us they're not honored
by this.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side was expressed by a man at an auto supply store in
the village of Phoenicia. ``It's not worse than Vikings or Spartans
or Trojans,'' said the man, who insisted on not being identified.
``This all existed. What kind of society is this if we suppress
reality?''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Yerry, a musician and one of the few people with Indian
blood involved in the dispute, objected to the mural a few years
ago. To him, the mascot is typical of the white man's odd
relationship with Indians. ``My idea is when you come to an area
and wipe out all the trees and deer, you then call it Deer Lane,''
he said. He said that Onteora is a name invented by a white man in
the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   But Onteora High is ``Indian'' territory. There is a totem pole
painted on the cafeteria wall, the school's coat of arms has three
dancing Indians, and the spring social event is the Tomahawk Dance.
In a straw poll students strongly favored the mascot, but student
leaders are considering other names _ the Thundercats, the Storm.
They are overlooking the obvious local symbol of unleashed
ferocity. How about the Battlin' Board Members of Onteora High?
Fight, team, fight!

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 14:
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years after the worst accident in the history of
nuclear power, Ukraine seems determined to shut down the lone
active reactor remaining at Chernobyl by the end of the year. The
long overdue decision will close a reactor that has experienced an
unsettling variety of minor failures and end power generation at a
complex that once contained four nuclear plants. But in other ways
the Chernobyl accident still haunts the people and lands of the
former Soviet Union. The steel and concrete shell encasing the
radioactive ruins of the destroyed reactor is leaking and must be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Reactors with similar designs to those at Chernobyl _ and
considerable safety problems _ still operate in Russia and
Lithuania. Several countries in Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union depend on other types of Soviet-built reactors that
also fall short of Western safety standards. These are expensive
problems, requiring money that former Soviet bloc nations do not
have. The West has provided millions in financial assistance, but
it will have to contribute more to improve nuclear safety and close
dangerous reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The sarcophagus that houses the No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl, the
one that exploded in April 1986, is unstable and cracked. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is trying to raise
$768 million to reseal the tomb temporarily and to build a new one.
So far, the United States and European nations have given only
about half that amount. When donor nations meet in Berlin this
summer, they must pledge to pay the balance.
</P>
<P>
   A second need is to continue to care for those affected by the
Chernobyl disaster. The greatest problem is thyroid cancer in
people who were children at the time of the accident. Most of the
2,000 victims so far live in Belarus and are being treated with
help from the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Group of Seven industrialized nations recommended
the closure of 25 Soviet-designed reactors, including all
Chernobyl-style power plants. These reactors _ there are 14 today _
are considered the most dangerous. Though they have been upgraded
to fix the flaws that contributed to the Chernobyl disaster, they
remain unsafe. The 43 other Soviet-design reactors in use are
considered somewhat safer, but all need more backup systems and
other protective measures. The poverty of former Soviet nations
adds to the risk. At Chernobyl, for example, maintenance is
slighted and employees have often had to wait months for their
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to join the European Union has encouraged Lithuania,
Slovakia and Bulgaria to try to meet European safety standards by
scheduling early closing of their most dangerous reactors. It is no
small sacrifice for a poor nation to shut down a source of cheap
energy. Lithuania, for example, is planning to close one of its two
reactors, which together provide 75 percent of the country's power.
</P>
<P>
   The industrialized nations have been talking about helping
Ukraine to close Chernobyl for years. Their aid will take the form
of loans to complete two new nuclear reactors _ a bad idea, as the
reactors will not meet Western safety standards. The safer, if
costlier, choice would be to build a coal plant and improve the
energy efficiency of existing factories. Few catastrophes have less
respect for borders than a nuclear meltdown. Unsafe reactors are an
international problem, and decommissioning requires international
cooperation.

DREW BARRYMORE'S MOTHER IS CHARGED WITH GUN POSSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jaid Barrymore, the estranged mother of actress Drew
Barrymore, was charged with gun possession early Saturday after
police officers who arrested her on charges of putting up
promotional posters for a rock band in Soho said they found a
loaded revolver in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Barrymore, 53, who lives in the East Village, and a
26-year-old man were arrested about 2 a.m. at the corner of Houston
Street and Broadway by police officers from the department's
graffiti unit, said Officer Chris Cottingham, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore was charged with third-degree criminal possession of a
weapon, a felony for which she could face a maximum of seven years
in prison if convicted, the authorities said. Both she and the man
she was with, Paul Charnin, 26, of the same address, were charged
with criminal mischief, making graffiti and possession of graffiti
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The two were putting up posters for the Paul Cote band on a
plywood wall outside a construction site when they were arrested,
Cottingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore argued with the officers, and said, ``I can't believe
you're arresting me for this,'' Cottingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers searched her possessions and found a Ruger .357
Magnum handgun in her purse, Cottingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The pistol had bullets loaded in two of its six chambers, he
said.
</P>

   Barrymore is often a guest on Howard Stern's radio and
television shows, and has talked publicly about her troubled
relationship with her daughter, Drew, 25, whose successful acting
career has overshadowed her own. Drew Barrymore broke all contact
with her mother about five years ago.

EDITORIAL: COPING WITH SUPERSALMON
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, May 14:
</P>
<P>
   Just as we were getting used to genetically engineered corn and
potatoes, along comes a strain of salmon that grows to market size
in only 18 months, twice as fast as normal salmon. These hormonally
hyperactive creatures _ called Frankenfish by their detractors _
may in fact turn out to be the first genetically modified animal to
make it onto American dinner plates. But before they do, regulators
here and in Canada have two obligations _ to see whether these fish
pose a threat to the environment and, if they do, to ensure that
they are properly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent story in The New York Times, Aqua Bounty
Farms, a subsidiary of A/F Protein, a biotechnology company, has
applied to the Food and Drug Administration for approval to market
the fish in the United States. The company, which has several
thousand prototype fish swimming in tanks on an island near New
Brunswick, Canada, says it has orders for 15 million eggs from
aquaculture companies that want to raise these fish. All it needs
is approval from the FDA. The FDA claims regulatory authority
because it regards as a drug the genetically engineered growth
hormone that transforms ordinary Atlantic salmon into supersalmon.
The agency promises a rigorous food safety review as well as a
review of the superfish's potential impact on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the FDA is ill equipped to deal with
environmental questions. Its scientists are not trained in that
field and its interests do not lie in that direction. A more
obvious choice would be the National Marine Fisheries Service, a
division of the Commerce Department, or the Interior Department's
Fish and Wildlife Service, both of which have scientists who know
more about marine life.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main fears. One is that genetically engineered
fish, should they escape into the wild, will mate with wild salmon,
diluting the wild salmon's genetic makeup and diminishing its
ability to survive in nature. The other is that the supersalmon
will invade the wild salmon's habitat, competing for food and
space. At least one computer model suggests that the intermingling
of wild fish and genetically engineered salmon could wipe out
entire populations of wild salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The company says its superfish are so pampered that even if they
escaped, they would not survive long enough to do any harm. This
does not reassure those who worry about the decline of wild
Atlantic salmon. Ordinary farm-raised salmon were also thought to
be too domesticated to cause trouble in the wild. But they have
escaped in large numbers, competing for habitat and spawning in the
same streams as wild salmon. And while the extent of the biological
pollution caused by farm-bred salmon is a matter of hot debate,
some scientists believe that interbreeding is at least partly
responsible for the decline of wild Atlantic salmon stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A special panel convened by the White House last year to
coordinate federal policy on genetically engineered foods is now
looking into the salmon issue _ specifically, whether the Fish and
Wildlife Service can claim jurisdiction under statutes covering
``injurious'' wildlife and aquatic nuisances. Another possible
approach would be to invoke the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   At the prodding of two conservation groups, Trout Unlimited and
the Atlantic Salmon Federation, the Interior Department has
proposed classifying salmon populations in eight rivers in Maine as
endangered. If these populations are so designated after the
required period of public comment, the federal government would be
empowered to impose strict controls on any activity seen to
threaten the species, including commercial fishing, logging and
fish farming of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic salmon is an obvious candidate for protection. Its
numbers in North America, including Canada, have dwindled from 1.5
million 30 years ago to 350,000 today. Most of these are in Canada.
The population returning to the eight rivers in Maine can be
measured in the hundreds. The last thing these beleaguered
creatures need is competition from a bunch of brutish newcomers.

UNIVERSITY PUTS ITS HOPE ON PATENTS
</HEADLINE>
 RESEARCH-TRIMS-(2TAKES)-NYT By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ The University of Rochester had ambitions to
be a national powerhouse in medical research. And it had charted a
meticulous 10-year plan to get there: get more research money from
the National Institutes of Health, recruit 100 more biomedical
scientists and construct two research buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the university announced that it had been awarded a
broad patent covering the use of a new type of painkiller that
could bring in billions of dollars in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   So administrators, faculty and students at the midsize
university are mulling over how the institution could be catapulted
to prominence faster than anyone had dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, it would certainly be a great catalyst,'' Dr.
Jay Stein, who oversees the University of Rochester Medical Center,
said of the potential billions. ``It could obviously make it easier
to do what we're planning and help us compete better with the
Harvards, Stanfords and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   A no-nonsense scientist to the end, Stein soberly refused to
bite when asked for his wildest fantasies on how the money might be
spent. So did other administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it could be a lot of money. Officials at the university say
the patent, for the basic science underlying a new type of
painkiller, is the most lucrative ever awarded to an academic
institution.
</P>
<P>
   The patent says that research conducted in the late 1980s and
early 1990s by Dr. Donald Young, a professor of medicine and
biochemistry at the university, and two colleagues pioneered the
development of Cox-2 inhibitor drugs. The popular medications are
sometimes called superaspirin for their ability to alleviate pain
while minimizing side effects _ particularly stomach ulcers _
associated with frequent use of aspirin, ibuprofen or similar
painkillers. Superaspirin has become the pharmaceutical industry's
fastest-selling product, and analysts predict that the market for
such drugs could grow to $12 billion per year by 2008, said Terry
O'Grady, associate counsel for the University of Rochester Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the university caution that no one should expect to
see Porsches filling the parking lot any time soon, primarily
because of legal fights with the companies that developed products
that the university said were based on its research. After the
university received the patent, it immediately filed a patent
infringement suit against the makers of one top-selling painkiller,
Celebrex, claiming that the university is entitled to significant
royalties. Legal showdowns with makers of several best-selling
drugs could tie up the case for years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't kept some people from dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of students and faculty have ideas on how to put the
money to good use.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly heard pitch from students? Start by trimming
the $31,000 price tag for tuition and lodging. One English
professor asked to have elevators installed in the five-story
building where she works. (Her office happens to be on the fifth
floor.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, they can all dream on.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If this patent proves to be as incredibly lucrative as we
believe it will be, we will be doing more of the same,'' said
Thomas H. Jackson, the university's president. Jackson said a
significant portion of the money would be used for basic research,
laboratories and the hiring of faculty members, though no specifics
had been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a growing number of universities are showing an
increased willingness to seek their share of riches from
inventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities have gotten a lot smarter about how to encourage
faculty to engage in this kind of activity and a lot smarter about
how to win the patent battle,'' said Robert Zemsky, a professor and
director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``This is a giant deal. If this works,
this is the university equivalent of the big-game lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Rochester filed the patent application in
1992, and it took eight years to work its way through the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. This turned out to be to Rochester's
benefit because in the meantime, the drugs have gone on the market
and became an immediate hit. Because the life of the patent _ 17
years _ began when it was granted, the university presumably
avoided wasting many years as a patent holder before the drugs
began to make money.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the university decided to undertake the expensive process
of filing a patent application, it was intended to protect
intellectual property. ``This was truly an academic patent,'' said
Jackson. ``I don't think anybody necessarily thought that it would
be a huge commercial success. As it sat in the patent office, it
went from looking more and more like the original decision was not
only correct but stunningly correct.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nils Hasselmo, president of the Association of American
Universities, said such patents had become an important part of
university financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities in recent years have tried to get patents and
licensing opportunities in order to generate revenues for both
research and education,'' he said. ``There's one study that calls
it academic capitalism.''

   The University of Rochester is regarded as more of a solid
regional institution rather than a heavy-hitting national player,
though a number of its programs, like optics and the Eastman School
of Music, are well respected.
</P>
<P>
   The university, with about 6,500 students, was ranked 32nd last
year among 228 national universities by U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
Several of the university's graduate programs, including political
science and economics, were ranked in the top fifth nationwide in a
1995 study by the National Academy of Sciences.

   On a recent spring day, in which the main preoccupations were
final exams and soaking up the sunny weather on the grassy
university quadrangle, many students said they did not really
expect the patent to change their lives any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Green was taken aback to learn that drug profits could
be so huge. ``I wish it resulted in a tuition decrease and
financial aid, but I don't think it will,'' said Green, 22, who was
studying for a psychology exam.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Apgar, 22, a microbiology major, was in her dormitory
room, recuperating from final exams. She said she hoped that the
university would at least win name recognition if the patent came
to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the general population get it confused with
SUNY schools or the Rochester Institute of Technology,'' said
Apgar, a senior who plans to attend the university's medical
school. ``People don't know what it is exactly. They don't know
it's a private institution.''

   Medical research is expected to be the big winner from any
royalties. Even before the announcement of the patent award, the
University of Rochester Medical Center was thre years into a
10-year, $550 million self-improvement regimen. It has hired nearly
half of the 100 research scientists that it plans to recruit, has
built one research building and is to break ground in June on a
second one.

   A year and a half ago, Dr. Bradford Berk was recruited from the
University of Washington in Seattle. He had graduated from the
University of Rochester and returned to direct its new center for
cardiovascular research at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences.
The federal government pays for a special program to train two to
six medical science students at Rochester each year. Berk would
like to see more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the future scientists,'' said Berk, standing amid the
airy and spacious new laboratories that he oversees. ``The only way
to get new Don Youngs is to train the young people.''

   Rochester's mayor , William A. Johnson, imagines the university
turbocharging a local economy that has seen a steady decline in
manufacturing jobs. He envisions new discoveries at the university
spinning off local companies, which in turn would lead to scores of
skilled jobs in the community.
</P>
<P>
   It is not fanciful thinking. The university's most lucrative
patent to date, for an influenza vaccine used globally, yielded $34
million in royalties and led to the creation of a locally based
company that has already produced 165 highly skilled jobs.

   Richard Insel, a pediatric immunologist at the University of
Rochester, was one of the founders of the start-up company that
developed the influenza vaccine. He said he hoped that the
potential income from the latest patent would promote an
environment in which researchers will take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Insel said he would like the revenue to attract creative people
who would not be expected to generate purely money-making ideas but
ideas for ideas' sake. ``Some of the efforts here would be just
asking questions and not necessarily developing products,'' he
said.

   The wish list was modest in Young's spartan laboratory in an old
section of the medical school. Young, who was assisted by Michael
K. O'Banion and Virginia D. Winn in paving the way for the
development of Cox-2 inhibitor drugs, declined to comment,
primarily because of litigation, a university spokesman said. But
the researchers are likely to become millionaires many times over
if the patent prevails.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s-era fluorescent-lit laboratory, a technician,
Thomas Murant, said he would buy new centrifuges and incubators to
replace malfunctioning equipment that has been borrowed from other
laboratories. ``In research, you always have to look to see how
much money you are spending,'' said Murant, 37, who has not taken
off a weekend in two months. ``It's a very big concern. When a lab
closes, you go and scavenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The technician expressed pride in the university's good fortune.
But by nature, scientists are cautious types. So Murant is taking
the wait-and-see approach: ``You just carry on and keep doing your
work.''

OUTDOORS: MAKING STRIKES AMID SILENCE OF THE FLORIDA FLATS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARPON SPRINGS, Fla. _ Just beyond the endless shopping centers
and housing developments that now typify much of Florida's western
Sun Coast lie the remnants of a true wilderness, the sprawling
shallow water bays and sand flats of the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, where beds of aquatic turtle grass gently wave in
the tide and prehistoric-looking spider crabs scuttle slowly along
the bottom, that I recently waded out from shore, a light spinning
rod in hand. Mottled brown and olive flats covered in warm,
thigh-deep water spread monotonously to the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   For the tourist angler not visiting such well-known hubs as the
Florida Keys, the Everglades or perhaps the Ten Thousand Islands
region, Florida's vastness can easily overwhelm. I spent the
previous few weeks trying to glean as much information as I could
from guide books, the Internet and friends who had fished the area.
But the best I could find were vagaries about ``decent fishing''
and ``lots of different kinds of fish.'' So, with little to go on,
the particular flat I chose seemed as good (or as bad) as any.
</P>
<P>
   Now 200 yards from shore, I rummaged through the tackle stuffed
down the pouch in my waders. Tangled in the middle of high-tech
looking plugs and soft plastic ``jerk baits'' hung a somber brown
bucktail. Baitfish often match the color of their surroundings, so
I tied the jig and began casting and retrieving it over the tops of
the grass beds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flats' finest attribute may be their virtual silence. Except
for the distant roar of an occasional boat whizzing across the
horizon and the tiny wavelets lapping against my waders, I heard
nothing for minutes on end. Individual sounds became distinct. A
loud ``thwack'' behind me turned out to be a brown pelican
performing its signature headlong crash into the water, arguably
one of nature's goofiest moments. Then a single mullet
splish-splashed along in graceful leaps 50 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Below the surface, stingrays of various sizes flapped past every
few minutes, reminding me to shuffle, not step, as I moved, or I
might risk pinning one to the bottom with disastrous results. One
particularly large and docile ray allowed me to approach within a
rod's length. I stared at it for a few moments (and it at me,
presumably), then decided to pass the shadow of my arm over its
eyes to see what might happen. Instantly, it burst across the flat,
leaving a trail of marl and muck as it headed back out to the Gulf.
If a stingray could scream, this one was shrieking the entire way.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a cast exactly like the hundred previous ones I had
just made, the lure jerked to a stop, and I set the hook into an
unseen fish that plowed past me in low gear and continued across
the flat. I held the rod high trying to keep the line from tangling
in the grass or chafing on a submerged rock.
</P>
<P>
   After a long initial run, I finally wrestled the fish into
turning its head. Its tail then kicked on the surface, revealing a
single dark spot at the base _ the telltale mark of a redfish. Also
called red drum or channel bass, redfish are frequent visitors to
tidal flats, where they root around for crabs, shrimp and baitfish.
</P>
<P>
   They are also known to fight like mules, and this one was no
exception. Even though it weighed only 6 or 7 pounds, it clearly
outbattled a similar-sized striped bass or weakfish that I might
catch in more northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the fish tired and I managed to slip my hand under
its belly and hold it against my waders. It looked more copper than
red, and its underslung mouth and thick sides reminded me a little
of a freshwater carp. I then popped the jig from its rubbery lip
and watched it dash away, my first-ever flats-caught fish.
</P>
<P>
   The tide had now dropped to knee-deep level and I began spotting
swirls and miniature wakes being pushed by unseen fish. Redfish
will sometimes rise to surface lures, so I switched to a small bass
popper trying to send it on a collision course. It worked. The fish
engulfed the lure with a loud slurp, then set off on a powerful
run.
</P>
<P>
   But this fish felt different; it seemed faster but did not have
the sheer pulling strength of the redfish. I drew it closer and saw
it was a 2-pound jack crevalle, a fish as ubiquitous to Florida
waters as it is strong. I felt a slight pang of disappointment, but
got over it quickly as the jack zipped off on yet another run
across the flats. &QL;

LACK OF LAWYERS CRIPPLING NYC FAMILY COURT, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A growing docket and a dwindling pool of lawyers
available to represent the poor have so crippled the New York City
Family Court system that judges are forced to adjourn cases
repeatedly, children are forced to remain in foster care far longer
than they ought to, and parents accused of child abuse are
frequently denied their due-process rights, according to a report
to be released Sunday by the city's public advocate, Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and judges agree that the shortage of court-appointed
counsel for the indigent, known as the 18-B panel, is driven
chiefly by the low reimbursement rates. Since 1986, hourly fees
have remained at $40 an hour for in-court services and $25 an hour
for time preparing out of court. And while the shortage affects the
entire state court system, in Family Court, the quality of legal
representation _ and delays in getting any representation at all _
can profoundly disrupt children's lives. They can be separated from
their parents, sometimes unjustifiably, for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current beleaguered system, everyone loses,'' the
report reads. ``The parents suffer an injustice, the children
languish in care, and the judicial process is sorely undermined.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrative judge of the city's Family Court, Joseph M.
Lauria, said court officials had themselves drawn attention to the
shortage of lawyers, although he added that he did not think due
process was necessarily being violated. In addition, Lauria noted,
the chief judge of the state courts, Judith S. Kaye, has repeatedly
pressed the governor and the Legislature to raise reimbursement
rates to $75 an hour, to be paid for partly by criminal surcharge
fees collected by the state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Justice Denied: The Crisis in Legal
Representation of Birth Parents in Child Welfare Proceedings,'' is
the latest in a series of critical assessments of the Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a report by the Vera Institute of Justice, a
nonprofit research institution, found that parents who used the
Family Court most frequently complained about long waits _ an
average of three hours in Manhattan before seeing a judge _ and
about representation. Some lacked lawyers; others said their
lawyers were either unhelpful or unavailable to meet with them
about their cases.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Special Child Welfare Advisory Panel, an
independent group of experts charged by a federal court with
investigating the Administration for Children's Services, turned
its gaze to the Family Court, unexpectedly and to the chagrin of
court officials. The panel was particularly critical of judges who,
it said, frequently placed children in foster care even when the
city child welfare officials failed to provide sufficient evidence
of abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Green's report walks a delicate political line. It criticizes
neither judges nor the quality of lawyers on the 18-B panel, and it
takes pains to note how the lack of counsel can affect children,
not just their parents.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Green pointed out, it is politically difficult to
advocate for lawyers who represent parents who are accused of child
abuse. That is chief among the reasons, he said, why there has been
such tepid political will in Albany to raise reimbursement rates
for the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends raising reimbursement rates to $75 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no obvious political coalition or political capital to
pay lawyers more money on behalf of parents who might be possible
abusers,'' Green said. But, he added, ``the current system is not
merely unfair to them. It also hurts kids who stay too long in
undesirable foster care. And it hurts taxpayers who spend too much
for unnecessary foster care.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring national trends, the Family Court caseload in New York
City has grown by a third in the last decade alone, according to
the report. At the same time, the number of lawyers available to
represent the poor has shrunk by 15 percent. Lawyers carry a load
of up to 100 cases each. On days when there are no 18-B lawyers
available in a particular courtroom, judges frequently dispatch
their court officers to scour the building for a lawyer who may be
free to take on a case.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, in each borough, 10 to 20 cases are adjourned
because there are no lawyers available to represent a parent, the
report states, citing an interview with Lauria. On average, it can
take six months before the court can determine if charges against a
parent are substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the problem of representation is suggested by the
rare instances in which parents accused of child abuse win their
cases: 1.6 percent of the time, according to the public advocate's
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can know with certainty whether parents should prevail
20 percent or 50 percent of the time,'' Green said. ``But 1.6
percent is so stunningly low as to be a thermometer of the illness
of the system.''

AP STRUGGLED WITH DECISION TO PUBLISH MASSACRE STORY
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``It was a story no one wanted to hear.'' Those were
the opening words of The Associated Press' Pulitzer-Prize winning
report documenting the massacre in 1950 of hundreds of South Korean
civilians by U.S. troops at No Gun Ri. When they were crafted by an
editor during one of the numerous rewrites, the report's authors
found them an apt description of the response from AP executives to
their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Now attacks on the credibility of three witnesses have given the
words an even more ironic cast. U.S. News &AMP; World Report and Web
site Stripes.com are citing documents that undermine the
credibility of three of a dozen soldiers cited by the AP report.
All the soldiers' accounts dovetailed with those of two dozen
Korean survivors also cited by the AP.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment in April 1998 when the wire service's special
projects unit decided to check Korean civilians' claims of a
massacre, to the publication of debunking reports by an Internet
site and by U.S. News &AMP; World report, the No Gun Ri reporting has
been something of a battlefield in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, six months before the report's publication, wire
service executives moved to shelve it, according to a reporter and
an editor who worked on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to win, because we had such a powerful
story, powerfully reported and we were not going to let it be
killed. Period,'' said the reporter, Charles J. Hanley, who has
spent most of his career at The Associated Press, once serving as
deputy managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Port, who was the initial editor on the project until he
left the wire service in June, said: ``I'm surprised it took this
long for the attacks to begin. We expected it. I was certainly
ready for it. The reporters were ready. I am not sure the
leadership of the AP will ever be ready. They are too restrained in
defending their own work, out of a sense of remaining objective and
neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the No Gun Ri account will stand up under scrutiny, Jon
Wolman, the executive editor of the wire service, said: ``It's been
a complicated and important project, and we've always felt it
deserves full scrutiny. We're confident that the reporting is sound
and that the central information will be borne out by the
investigations by governments in both the United States and
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal struggle over No Gun Ri, as members of the
reporting and editing team describe it, reflected in part a clash
of cultures in a large and journalistically conservative
organization that sets fairness and balance as its core values.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflected the difficulty of adapting such values to
the messy and contradictory business of reconstructing 50-year-old
events.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the internal struggle account played out during the
year of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when a series of embarrassing
journalistic missteps had put the whole profession on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most publicized and criticized missteps also involved
accounts of witnesses of an apparent military atrocity: the
``Tailwind'' report, investigated and retracted by CNN, which
claimed that U.S. troops in Vietnam had used nerve gas in a mission
to kill defectors. In fact, in the aftermath of Tailwind, the No
Gun Ri team sent a memorandum to their superiors explaining how
their evidence differed from the material supporting the
discredited Tailwind report, according to two members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters on the No Gun Ri story were Hanley, Martha Mendoza
and Sang-Hun Choe; the editors directing the project were first
Port, who left to join APBNews.com, then Kevin Noblet, who left to
spend a year teaching at an Ohio college, and finally Nick Tatro,
deputy international editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a difficult and frustrating process,'' said Mendoza,
who is working in the AP's bureau in San Jose, Calif. ``None of
that takes away from the significance of the story, which is
something I'm very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Port and Hanley, the most consistent objections to
the project were raised by the former executive editor of the AP,
William Ahearn. Hanley said that at a meeting in the fall of 1998,
Ahearn was skeptical about the importance of the incident. Ahearn
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, on March 2, 1999, according to the two men,
Ahearn told the team that he did not believe that the account, by
then redrafted and re-reported several times over, should be
published. Port said he had appealed to Louis D. Boccardi, the
president and chief executive of The Associated Press, who
suggested that if further changes would damage the report, Port
should consider abandoning it. Boccardi also could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Port then talked to Wolman, then the managing editor. As Wolman
recalled, ``I know I told him it was an important story, and I was
sure we'd make it to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   It took six more months, however, for the report to be published
in its final form.

 ART DYNASTY'S SUIT OVER REPORTS OF NAZI DEALINGS IS REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A Paris appeals court has rejected a claim for damages
brought by the Wildenstein family, the New York-based dynasty of
international art dealers, against an American writer who in a
recent book described business dealings between the French-Jewish
family and Nazi officials during Germany's wartime occupation of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding a lower court ruling last year, the court said Friday
that it was up to ``historians and the public'' to judge the
allegations made by Hector Feliciano in his book, ``The Lost
Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of
Art,'' published in France in 1995 and in the United States in 1997
(Basic Books).
</P>
<P>
   In its written findings, the court went out of its way to praise
Feliciano's method of research and dismissed the Wildensteins'
argument that he had acted irresponsibly and negligently.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Wildensteins said the family was
``extremely shocked'' by the ruling and was studying whether a
further appeal was justified.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the court had not endorsed the charges contained
in Feliciano's book.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his home in New York, Feliciano
said: ``I used reliable documents. The lawsuit has backfired for
the Wildensteins.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the suggestion of collaboration related to Georges
Wildenstein, who died in 1963, the case was brought by his son,
Daniel, 82, his two grandsons, Guy and Alec, and Wildenstein &AMP; Co.,
which has its headquarters on East 64th Street in Manhattan. They
sought damages of 6 million francs, or $850,000 at current exchange
rates, as well as the removal of all references to the Wildensteins
in future editions of ``The Lost Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit formed part of a broader campaign by the
Wildensteins to improve their image after a wave of bad publicity
had begun to affect their business, one of the wealthiest and most
powerful in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   Most embarrassing was the tabloid coverage of messy divorce
proceedings involving Alec Wildenstein in New York three years ago.
But, apart from Feliciano's allegations, the Wildensteins'
reputation is also under attack in a separate lawsuit in New York
charging that after World War II the Wildensteins recovered several
medieval manuscripts looted by the Nazis from the home of a
French-Jewish art collector, Alphonse Kann.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Feliciano said that Georges Wildenstein had
business contacts with a well known Nazi art dealer, Karl
Haberstock, shortly before the war, immediately after the
occupation of France and sporadically during the course of the
conflict, even while in exile in New York. Feliciano's lawyer,
Antoine Comte, presented both the lower court and the appeals court
with documentary evidence supporting these charges.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing these documents, the appeals court said it could
not share the Wildensteins' claim that Feliciano's writing was
``manifestly erroneous.'' It said the documents prove that Georges
Wildenstein exchanged letters, did business and had meetings with
Haberstock.
</P>
<P>
   It said that ``it is also possible to deduce'' that Georges
Wildenstein maintained contact throughout the war with Roger
Duquoy, a former employee who ran the Wildensteins' Paris gallery
during the war and who also did business with Haberstock.

BLAZERS AND JAZZ ARE GETTING THE RESULTS THEY PAY FOR
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace was flying down the lane, cocking the ball back
as an earthbound Karl Malone watched futilely. Damon Stoudamire
scooted past a backpedaling John Stockton and laid the ball in with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time the Portland Trail Blazers were on their way
to postseason redemption, the Utah Jazz was writing its own
obituary, several years after most observers forecast its demise.
</P>
<P>
   Their second-round Western Conference semifinal has been rife
with symbolism the past week; the titleless, aging veterans who
simply don't have enough left versus the deeper, younger team that
may issue a sincere challenge to the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Utah-Portland series goes beyond merely the players.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's championship pursuit for much of the last decade was
about a small-market franchise that gave the others hope. Unlike
Minnesota or Orlando, the Jazz showed it could hold on to future
Hall of Famers, make a profit and still give Michael Jordan a
genuine scare. It was about a maverick owner like Larry Miller
trying to figure out his finances so he could pay Karl Malone
enough to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Portland is considered a small market, too. But the Blazers are
owned by one of the world's richest men, Paul Allen. Regardless of
a luxury tax that teams will have to pay if they go over a certain
threshold next season _ irrespective of a collective bargaining
agreement that makes it easier for teams to hold on to their own
free agents _ owners like Allen will pay for success.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the NBA has leveled the playing field for many of its
teams, it is in many ways still a league of haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary part of it is, Larry Miller has done a terrific
job,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said by telephone on Friday. ``He's
run it as a business rather than just a toy. I've always admired
him for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and Karl made a little more money as they got older,
which they should. They've stuck through all the tough times and
come back. I don't know if we'll ever see that again in this
league, players sticking with the same team that long. Patrick
Ewing is the only player I can think of right now who's like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, The Salt Lake Tribune pointed out the incredible
discrepancies in payroll and talent between the Blazers and the
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers spent an NBA-high $73.8 million on their
roster this season, $53.5 million to their starting five. They have
somehow acquired seven top-10 draft picks. In three more seasons,
Scottie Pippen will earn $19.7 million, Wallace will earn $17
million, Stoudamire will get $12.4 million and Steve Smith will
earn $9.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, meanwhile, spent $49 million this season. That is
nearly double the Utah payroll in years past. Malone, Stockton and
Jeff Hornacek combined to take up nearly $30 million of that
figure, money that Miller forked over partly for their longevity
and loyalty. Six of the players in their rotation were taken 28th
or lower in the draft. Howard Eisley, Bryon Russell and Hornacek
were all picked in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Allen's money, Bob Whitsitt, Portland's team president
and general manager, made some strong moves to acquire certain
players.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Utah has been completely outplayed. Greg
Ostertag went from being referred to as Chamberlain-like by the NBC
analyst Bill Walton one game to Frankenstein by one writer the
next.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2-inch Eisley has been forced to guard bigger guards,
and he just does not physically stack up. For all the big shots
Russell has made, he has missed many more.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek is retiring, but you wonder if Sloan is fed up enough
to finish the remaining year of his contract in 2000-1. Stockton
had to coax him into staying after the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you know something I don't, I'll be back,'' Sloan said.
``Now, can we still compete? I think so. These guys won 50-some
games this year. You get young guys and you work with them. They
get better. That's how it's always worked here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan added: ``You'd like to say it's unfair, but these guys
have played hard. They've given a lot to basketball in my opinion.
The losing, though, leaves a sorry taste in your mouth. At the same
time, you also understand the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan would never say it. But part of the reality is this: For
$24 million more than the Jazz, the Blazers bought themselves a
better team.

RILEY, VAN GUNDY FORM A MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As in every postseason, they have been playing politics the past
few days: Miami coach Pat Riley wondering aloud why the officials
are calling the games so tight and why Jamal Mashburn does not
receive as much respect from referees as players like Allan Houston
and Latrell Sprewell; and Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy countering
that the games are not called tightly enough, that Alonzo Mourning
is doing his share of dislodging his players, that the Knicks do
not have the same leeway.
</P>
<P>
   It is the usual postseason fare for these two. Yet the games
coaches play away from the court took on a very personal tone two
years ago, when the relationship between Van Gundy and Riley, his
former mentor in New York, changed for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   If the Heat and the Knicks were publicly feuding, the pupil and
the teacher were feuding privately: Riley taking shots at Van Gundy
for his woeful attempt at a peacemaking role in the Mourning-Larry
Johnson fight; Van Gundy seeing a cold, impersonal side to a man he
admired more than almost anyone else in the profession.
</P>
<P>
   But after last season's Game 5 playoff thriller, the tension and
ill feelings subsided, replaced by the same respect that once
characterized their working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a simple note Riley sent to Van Gundy via Federal
Express after Houston's shot sank his team. Through all the
conflict and adversity and uncertainty, ``You had a play,'' the
note read.
</P>
<P>
   Riley was so proud of Van Gundy's cool under fire, how he yelled
to his players from courtside to run the series-deciding play with
4.5 seconds left with no timeouts, and how his players responded.
Van Gundy carries the letter everywhere with him, along with two
notes from his father.
</P>
<P>
   As much as their relationship has been tested by the rivalry _
and will continue to be the next week _ Riley has now put in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of Jeff,'' he said last week. ``Nobody knows how
much the Van Gundys have helped me. Nobody. They think I've helped
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's brother, Stan Van Gundy, the Miami assistant, is Riley's
choice to take over the Heat after he retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff was the savior for me in New York,'' Riley said. ``The
work he did, what he could take off my desk, his ideas, his
commitment, his loyalty. When you're in this job, you got to have
those kinds of men.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said Jeff actually recommended Stan Van Gundy for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jeff called me about Stan, he said: `You're not going to
believe me. You think I'm just selling you my brother. Well, he's
better than I am. If you had any respect for me, I'm telling you,
he's better than I am.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People who throw these assistant coaches' names out there, new
blood out there, they have no idea what this guy is about,'' Riley
said of Stan Van Gundy. ``He's not about politicking. This guy is a
coach. Jeff is a coach. See, I wasn't a coach. That's why I
appreciate the two of them. Lifelong coaches. They've been saviors.
They've helped me to grow and do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflective about their days together in New York, Riley
remembered how he once staged a shouting match with Jeff Van Gundy
to make a point to his feuding Knicks players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those days I had to do something because they
were being very selfish and childish,'' he said. ``They were
bickering and yelling at one another on the court
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said to Jeff: `Look, I don't want you to be surprised.
When I start on you, I want you to give it to me like you've never
gave it anybody. I want all your venom. I want all your hate. I
want you to criticize me. I want you to be sarcastic. I want you to
swear, I want you to say: ``You don't want to know what you're
talking about, I've had it with you,'' just like these players.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the locker room, in front of grumpy Anthony
Mason, John Starks and Charles Oakley, Riley laced into his
assistant about an unfinished scouting report he deemed sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just like the players,'' Riley remembered saying. ``And
he started yelling at me. We're yelling at one another and the
players said, `What's going on?' We went on for three minutes. It
was a very, very uncomfortable moment for them. Then finally we
stopped yelling at one another and blaming one another, and I
looked at Patrick and I just stared at him. And stared at him. And
then he got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Is that how we are?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `That's exactly how you guys are. Did we make you feel
uncomfortable, Pat?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `God, yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how do you think you make us feel? How do you think you
make everybody else feel out there when they see a team of guys
yelling and screaming at one another, criticizing each other,
backbiting one another?''
</P>
<P>
   Riley smiled at the memory, especially Van Gundy working himself
into a frothing rage to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff had a ball with that one,'' he said. ``He was a little
bit nervous about throwing obscenities at me. But he did it,
because that's coaching.''

OFFERS TEST TEAM NEW ZEALAND'S ALLEGIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Dobbyn is New Zealand's answer to Bruce Springsteen, a
populist singer and songwriter whose homeland and countrymen are
the source of his creative wellspring. Last March, when the Team
New Zealand America's Cup squad paraded into an Auckland
amphitheater to accept their awards for defeating Italy's Prada
Challenge and defending the cup, a Dobbyn tune called ``Loyal''
provided the soundtrack for an open-air video montage of the crew's
nautical heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out in the battle, where does allegiance lie?'' Dobbyn sang.
``We are loyal. Keep it that way now.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Kiwis, Dobbyn's lyrics have since taken on a special
poignancy. For in the last two weeks, published reports in the
United States, New Zealand, Europe, and on the Internet have said
more than 20 Team New Zealand crew members have been offered
lucrative contracts to defect and sail in the next cup, in 2003,
aboard boats entered by overseas syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   One persistent storyline is that the American businessmen Bill
Gates, Jim Clark and Bill Koch _ either individually or in some
combination _ have formed a Seattle-based syndicate targeting Kiwi
sailors to make up the team's core crew. The reported offers,
collectively in the tens of millions of dollars, would test the
loyalty of the staunchest patriot, never mind a sailor with a
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, Clark and Koch have all denied any interest in mounting a
cup challenge. Nevertheless, there is evidence that
behind-the-scenes machinations are in full swing in Europe, and
other reports, wholly unsubstantiated, have named another
Seattle-based entrepreneur as a cup player.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to TNZ's inner circle says that the Kiwi skipper
Russell Coutts has received substantial offers from multiple
European-based syndicates. And Brad Butterworth, who has joined
Coutts in the New Zealand team's administrative ranks, has fielded
a seven-figure offer to plot onboard strategy for Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these stories is particularly surprising. Along with
the legendary turn-of-the-century captain Charlie Barr, Coutts is
the winningest cup skipper in history. And in the war of wits in
the 5-0 Kiwi sweep of Prada, Butterworth clearly outmatched the
Italian tactician Torben Grael, much to the disgust of the
syndicate chief, Patrizio Bertelli.
</P>
<P>
   But it was surprising to hear persistent rumors that the TNZ
grinders Craig Monk and Andrew Taylor, and the mastman, Matthew
Mason, were also in line for major paydays. Though all are
unquestionably superb sailors, they do not fill glamour positions.
In the National Football League and in the America's Cup, the men
in the trenches do not earn quarterback paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Such speculation has fueled the notion that a backer with an
unlimited cash supply is behind a major challenge, and the
spotlight was turned on the Seattle billionaire Craig McCaw, who
earned his fortune in the cellular-phone business.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw, a yachtsman who contributed $500,000 to TNZ's 2000
defense fund and who docked his boat at Koch's cup compound in San
Diego in 1995, seemed a likely candidate. But despite several
reports to the contrary, a McCaw operative last week insisted that
McCaw did not intend to field his own cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been discussed but it's gone no further,'' said Gary
Wright, a McCaw associate in charge of international projects, who
is based in the United Kingdom. ``We haven't put together anyone in
a syndicate or made a challenge. There's absolutely no basis for
lots of things being said in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright also stated that McCaw had no involvement with the New
Zealand lawyer Sean Reeves, a former TNZ member who is allegedly
recruiting Kiwi talent for an overseas syndicate. ``Certainly over
the next few years we may well get interested in some of this
stuff,'' Wright said. ``But for now we're flabbergasted that this
rumor has grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Should McCaw change his mind, he still has time. In a phone
interview from Monaco, Pierpaolo Gardella, the general-secretary
for the next challenger's association, said that potential
challengers had until March 2002, to announce their intentions.
Gardella also confirmed that, thus far, the only official challenge
to the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron has come from Prada.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no question that the Italians will continue to
pursue talent from the international ranks. In addition to
purchasing both boats sailed by the New York Yacht Club's Young
America campaign in the last cup, Prada has scored a major coup by
enlisting the services of the Hall Spars and ex-Young America
marine engineer Scott Ferguson to oversee mast and spar
development. Prada, which built six complete rigs for the recent
cup, will keep Ferguson busy.
</P>
<P>
   The cup scene in Europe surpasses anything officially under way
in the United States, although the news is chock full of innuendo
and tales of potential intrigue. Last week, the Swiss banker Pierre
Essig announced the formation of a syndicate that may be partially
funded by high-end Swiss watchmakers. And the pharmaceutical heir
Ernesto Bertarelli, who has both Swiss and Italian passports, is
said to be near an official campaign announcement, but must first
decide under which flag he will sail.
</P>
<P>
   As the crews take shape, there will no doubt be more than
passing interest in the veterans from TNZ When it comes to loyalty
versus opportunity, every New Zealander will be anxious to see if
the song changes, or the chorus remains the same.

 &HT;    OSHA WEIGHING PLAN TO RESHAPE THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, May 14.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Workers at the 911 center in Rochester, N.Y., used
to respond to emergency calls while seated in stiff chairs at
neck-straining work stations where lights glared down on their
computer screens. Almost 50 of the 119 employees reported serious
muscular problems. Nine required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Then the city built a new facility. Planners consulted employees
and installed chairs with special back supports and consoles with
adjustable lifts for monitors and keyboards. Each worker was given
controls for light, heat and air conditioning, not to mention a
switch to supply soothing ``white noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years after the center opened, claims for work-related
injuries have plummeted. Only one worker injury was reported in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Such success stories are at the heart of a long-simmering
national debate over whether employers should be required to follow
federal mandates on ``ergonomics,'' which means making workplaces
fit the workers. The goal is to prevent common on-the-job injuries
from repetitive action or over-exertion.
</P>
<P>
   A move by the Clinton administration to set ergonomics standards
reached its final phase last week as the Labor Department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration wrapped up public
hearings on a rule that would cover 27 million working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As of early May, OSHA had heard from 1,000 witnesses in hearings
held in Portland, Ore.; Chicago and Washington, and the agency had
a stack of more than 25,000 pages of public comments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's businesses would be affected, including
poultry plants, hospitals, package delivery services, mom and pop
grocery stores and funeral homes _ every sector except agriculture,
construction and maritime. Not surprisingly, hundreds of employers
are battling the new regulation, even as unions are urge its
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and their backers on Capitol Hill are offering three
chief objections:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandating ergonomics programs and standards would cost
billions more than the government estimates, they say. Although
OSHA has pegged the cost to industry at $4.2 billion a year,
business coalitions have put the cost as high as $100 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed analysis for the Food Distributors International,
which represents warehouses, concluded that the rule would cost its
members $26 billion a year. Even the U.S. Small Business
Administration reports that business expenses will be several times
as much as OSHA is predicting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government regulation is unnecessary, the foes say, since
repetitive stress injuries have sharply declined since 1994 without
new rules. For example, carpal tunnel syndrome cases, traced to
repetitive movements, have dropped by 31 percent over five years,
according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientific evidence is too unsettled to justify a rule now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-size-fits-all regulation that would deal equally
with a baker in Sacramento as it would with Dell Computers in
Austin or a bottling company in Peoria as well as a dance studio in
Miami,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla sponsored legislation to forbid OSHA from finalizing the
rule until the National Academy of Sciences has completed a
congressionally ordered study on ergonomics. His bill, which has
passed the House and now awaits Senate action, would delay
implementation until next year at the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker said he sees a ``race to the finish'' as the
administration tries to complete the rule before President Clinton
leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomic regulation has long been a top priority for labor
unions, who say the benefits will outweigh the expenses. Among
their arguments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ergonomics works, the proponents say, as evidenced by a 1997
study of five private companies by the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The report concluded
that these employers reduced injuries and illnesses at modest cost
by applying the standards of ergonomics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ergonomics programs can prevent many work-related
musculoskeletal disorders that currently cost employers as much as
$20 billion a year in compensation costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many workers have been seriously hurt while performing routine
duties that would be redesigned under the federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   At the OSHA hearing last week, Rebekah Rice, a slightly built
registered nurse from Washington, hobbled into the Labor Department
room leaning on a cane. She was unable to sit because of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Tearfully she told how she had sustained a career-ending injury
when she tried with only one helper to move a 350-pound patient in
the intensive care ward. She said she could have been spared her
ordeal if the hospital had been required to have specialized ``lift
teams'' or mechanical lifting devices.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla acknowledged the power of such testimony, but countered
that ``we have to look at the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rules were implemented and they put a hardship on
hospitals, there's a real possibility that patients would go
unattended because they'd have to check with OSHA before they lift
a patient off a bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting viewpoints are illustrated even by the case of
the Rochester 911 center. The American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees touts it as evidence that ergonomics
programs are effective and should be required by federal
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a textbook case on how to do things right,'' said
Jim August, the union's assistant director of research.
</P>
<P>
   But the center's director, John Merklinger, is less certain
about a federal rule telling employers what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautious to say there should be a mandate,'' Merklinger
said. ``However, I clearly see the benefit since we've done it
here, and the money savings'' for reduced injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they would be better spending the money on educating
business leaders about the benefits of an ergonomics program,'' he
said.

 &HT;    PROGRAM OFFERS TROUBLED WOMEN INMATES A 'NEW PATHWAY'
 &HT;    1070&AMP;add. For release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    With photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Calif. _ ``If I wouldn't have came(cq) to prison, I'd be
be dead right now,'' said Eshelle Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Following a therapy session, part of a ground-breaking program
aimed at helping female inmates, Scott said she was trapped in an
abusive relationship with a man who introduced her to witchcraft
and beat her nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   Depressed, she found comfort in drugs and killing animals. Angry
about a beating, she said, she once decapitated her boyfriend's
mother's cat and left it on the woman's doorstep. Finally, she was
convicted of burning churches and sentenced to a 63-month term.
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Correctional Institution here, Scott participated
in the inaugural class of New Pathways, a pilot program aimed at
addressing the special needs of female inmates who have been
physically or sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``best thing that ever happened to me,'' said the
25-year-old Corpus Christi, Texas, native.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for New Pathways was born in 1994 after a study here
found that 55 percent of the prison's inmates had been abused
physically or sexually as children or adults, said Dr. Davina
Kotulski, co-creator of the program.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of slowing a rapid rise in the national prison
population _ and an even faster rise in female inmates _ a team of
psychologists at the prison submitted a proposal to the Federal
Bureau of Prisons in 1998. The first New Pathways class started
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The program fits in with the bureau's plans of addressing
special needs for female inmates, said spokesman Daniel Dunne, and
prison officials here said it may be expanded to other prisons
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   New Pathways has four phases. In the first, which lasts 12
weeks, inmates are encouraged to open up and trust others. They
also learn techniques for managing anger and stress, such as deep
breathing and taking ``time outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phase focuses on helping the women recover from their
past traumas.
</P>
<P>
   They practice ``expressive art,'' making collages illustrating
their abuse and anger and playing games that encourage openness in
personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   In another exercise, each group member chooses a past traumatic
experience, and the classmates re-enact it as she watches. The
class then acts out the same scene with a positive twist.
</P>
<P>
   This allows the women to get ``feedback from group members and
it helps them see their own trauma,'' said Tracy Henderson, prison
trauma specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very challenging. It's very emotional. But it's one of
the most cathartic and healing aspects of the program,'' Kotulski
added.
</P>
<P>
   Phase three teaches the inmates ways to build their self-esteem
and think positively.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and final phase is after care. Until they leave the
prison, inmates who successfully complete the first three phases of
the program will meet monthly to discuss topics that encourage
continued development of the techniques they learned.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other prison reform programs, inmates volunteer for New
Pathways, said Dr. Stephen Formanski, chief psychologist at
FCI-Dublin. There is no financial incentive, nor are inmates'
sentences reduced for participating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Pathways' $8,000 price tag in its first year is far less
than the prison's $45,000 drug rehabilitation program, in which
most New Pathways clients also take part.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said New Pathways' unusual group setting is more
helpful than one-on-one therapies they've had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to have treatment and everything, but this
right here has been more treatment than I had ever had, and it's
helped me cope with a lot of things,'' said Jo-Lynn Anderson, 39,
who was sexually abused by her stepfather and physically abused by
her mother. ``For a long time I didn't want to share with anybody''
the problems she had experienced. Anderson was nearing the end of a
four-year sentence for drug distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in this group, it's taught me that other people have
problems,'' added Anderson, who prior to the program inflicted pain
on herself, breaking all her knuckles by punching her cell walls as
a way to relieve her mental pain. ``It might not be the same, but
we all have different problems and it really helped me to be able
to talk to these ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie, 40, who asked that her last name not be published, said
the program had transformed her into a new person. She was
convicted of using an automatic weapon during a bank robbery, the
latest in a series of offenses for which she has been imprisoned
over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My crimes over the years have gotten worse,'' said Debbie.
``Until I came to this program, my feelings were pretty much cold
and heartless as far as valuing other people's lives. I didn't
understand what empathy was until I went through this program. I
didn't realize I had victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that the crimes I did really affected other
people. It was a job to me,'' she said. ``I went to work every day
and I did these crimes and they were violent. But if I was to
continue the way I was going, I would have gotten released from
here and gone out and committed more crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Chacon, 24, of El Paso, Texas, also said she had gone
through a rebirth because of the program. Mental abuse and too much
responsibility forced on her by relatives led Chacon to sell drugs
to support her family, she said. She has served two years of a
three-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wouldn't have came(cq) here, many other things could have
happened to me out there, and I wouldn't have learned everything
that I learned about myself in here,'' she said. ``I didn't come to
realize who I was till I got here. I have learned a lot in this
group. I've learned that before you can give to other people you
have to give to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural set of classes ended April 28, and it is too early
to determine the success of New Pathways.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials are optimistic that many graduates will become
productive members of society. Kotulski said several have
aspirations, once they are free, to help women like themselves. But
officials realize the inmates are not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that every woman who graduates from this program
is going to go out and live a perfect life and be totally drug- and
crime-free and not go back to abusive relationships,'' Henderson
said. ``But at least I know that there are a few out there who know
how to get themselves out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said New Pathways may eventually be expanded to
other prisons around the country. Formanski said he has already
gotten calls from a few prisons, including the Federal Correctional
Institution in Bryon, Texas, that are considering starting similar
programs.
</P>
<P>
   None of its programs are structured quite like New Pathways, but
the state of Georgia has group therapy programs that officials say
have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``During each of these classes, inmates are able to talk about
their problems with other inmates who have similar problems,'' said
spokeswoman Abigail Morgan. ``It gives them another way them to
better cope with their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with reform programs at the nation's prisons and jails,
more people are being locked up. About 1,860,520 adults were
imprisoned in 1999, an increase of 60,000 over the previous year,
according to a recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report.
</P>
<P>
   The number of women prisoners doubled since 1990 to more than
87,000 in 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Scott, the convicted church burner, life will be
completely different when she is released. She plans to get a job,
a home and try to be a mother to her 3-year-old daughter who she
has seen once through a glass since giving birth to the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to her on the phone but she still doesn't know me, and
that's going to be very, very hard for me,'' Scott said.

 &HT;    'ANTIGRAVITY' MAY DOMINATE THE UNIVERSE, SCIENTISTS SAY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    Eds: Part three of the occasional ``Window on the Universe''
series.
 &HT;    With photos and logo.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although it has nothing to do with the evil
compulsions of science fiction villains, there appears to be, after
all, a dark side of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Something is causing the universe to expand _ not at the speed
scientists would expect from the Big Bang explosion that created
everything and flung it all apart, but faster. And faster.
</P>
<P>
   After locking horns with such thought-defying concepts such as
extra-spatial dimensions and ``dark matter'' that exists separate
from the ordinary stuff that stars and planets and human beings are
made of, cosmologists have taken up the idea of a ``repulsive''
force.
</P>
<P>
   Acting against the universal gravitational pull that causes
matter to be attracted to other matter, the repulsive force seems
to cause distant galaxies to be pushed away from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Some astronomers are calling the theorized repulsive force
``dark energy,'' but others prefer to call it ``repelling energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of this repelling energy _ if in fact it does
exist and is not merely the result of some astrophysical equivalent
of failing to carry the two _ does not mean that Newton's apple
will fall back up to the tree. Galaxies will continue to collide,
and meteors will continue to fall on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the repelling energy may overcome the force of gravity
only in great open areas of space, where galaxies are far apart and
have only weak gravitational attraction. In any case, the apparent
discovery has rocked the world of physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that there are fundamental issues that our physics
cannot explain,'' Shaul Hanany, an astrophysicist at the University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis, said last week. ``We have known that two
masses attract each other. Now we have learned that there are forms
of energy that repel, and we don't know what this energy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanany was one of the authors of an article published last week
in the Astrophysical Journal Letters(cq) describing measurements
made by a high-altitude balloon launched from the National
Scientific Ballooning Facility in Palestine, Texas, to study
something called the cosmic microwave background.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are convinced this dim glow of radiation, which
pervades all space, was left behind by the formation of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas balloon flight, a two-hour experiment in 1998,
measured something called the ``anisotropy'' of the cosmic
microwave background. The term refers to tiny but distinct
differences in the temperature of the microwave radiation at
various points in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Texas experiment, known as MAXIMA for
``Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array,'' were almost
identical to those from a balloon flight over Antarctica announced
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in late April.
</P>
<P>
   By measuring the side-by-side differences in the microwave heat,
both groups were able to produce a ``snapshot'' of small areas of
the universe a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in heat, both teams of scientists said, were
left behind by clumps of early, hot matter that eventually cooled
and expanded to become galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   However, in addition to these baby pictures of the universe, the
temperature measurements allowed scientists to make complicated
calculations that show what kind of matter and energy make up the
cosmos today, Hanany said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanany and other scientists from the University of California,
Berkeley, and universities in Italy, Portugal, Poland and England
said their analysis of the fluctuations convinced them that 60 to
65 percent of all the matter and energy in the universe consists of
the newly theorized ``repelling energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal matter and the energy associated with it _ heat, light,
and so forth _ make up only about 5 percent of everything, the
MAXIMA team reported. The rest appears to be something called
``dark matter,'' which evidently has nothing to do with ``dark
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the everything is expanding at an increasing speed
doesn't work with the traditional Big Bang concept, which had the
the universe more or less coasting along because of the original
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Under one set of assumptions, gravity would someday halt the
expansion and pull everything back together again into a ``Big
Crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other assumptions held that the expansion would go on forever,
constantly slowing but never quite stopping, until all matter and
energy had evaporated into nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is true, scientists now think.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, two teams of astronomers from several
universities announced that, after studying the light given off by
supernovas, the enormous explosions of stars, they had discovered
that the expansion is not slowing down at all. It is speeding up.
</P>
<P>
   The results staggered the astronomy world. Something _ some
called it ``antigravity'' _ is overcoming the force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The supernova experiments confirmed what astrophysicists had
already believed _ that space is being ``stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a car traveling on a rubber highway that is being
stretched. A car setting out on a 60-mile trip at a constant speed
of 60 miles per hour would not arrive in one hour, because the
distance would be stretched during the trip.
</P>
<P>
   As light from the stellar explosions plods along at its
customary speed of 186,000 miles per second, its arrival at the
Earth is delayed by the expansion of space.
</P>
<P>
   What was not expected was the discovery that light from the more
distant supernovas is being delayed at a greater rate that that
from the nearer. The further one travels, the faster space is being
expanded. The only explanation that works, Hanany said is that
repulsive ``dark energy'' of empty space is forcing everything
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the 1800s, people thought everything about the
universe was understood,'' he said. ``Immediately afterward came
quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of relativity, and they saw
how little they knew. Now we are in a similar position.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their ability to measure temperature differences of as
little as a one hundred-thousandth of a degree, the two balloon
experiments took their microwave ``snapshots'' of only a tiny patch
of sky.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center on the outskirts
of Washington are putting the final touches on a new satellite that
is to be launched next year on a mission designed to map the cosmic
microwave background across the entire sky.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, known as the Microwave Anisotropy Probe, will
provide the first detailed picture of the entire universe as it
looked 12 to 14 billion years ago. The results may or may not allow
for more precise calculations that could eventually explain the
nature of ``repelling energy,'' said NASA physicist Charles
Bennett, a principal scientific investigator on the project.
</P>
<P>
   And even if it does, it may not prove the existence of anything
that could be called ``anti-gravity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we may find is that it's just gravity, but gravity that
is behaving in a way that we're not accustomed to,'' he said.

TAUZIAT WIELDS THE PEN AS DEFTLY AS THE RACQUET 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The epigram that opens Nathalie Tauziat's new book about women's
tennis reads: ``One is not born a champion. One becomes one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an appropriate choice of maxim for a Frenchwoman who has
had to soul-search and tinker constantly to quell the rotating cast
of skeptics during her 17-year career. And even if Tauziat has
never quite succeeded in becoming a major champion _ her seven
singles titles have all come in relatively minor professional
events _ she has managed to achieve much more than anyone,
including she, would have predicted when she turned up in St.
Tropez at age 13 with unimposing technique and physique to train
with a little-known coach, Regis de Camaret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trained at least 15 other girls who had talent far superior
to what Nathalie had at the beginning,'' writes De Camaret, who
remains her coach. ``But she made it to the highest level thanks to
the intensity she managed to put into her work.''
</P>
<P>
   That intensity, along with the tardy but fruitful decision to
rush the net, has propelled her to a career-high No. 3 ranking last
week at an age, 32, when most tennis careers are already over. It
also helped her reach her first and only Grand Slam final at
Wimbledon in 1998, which would surely have had much more impact in
France if its soccer team had not been on its way to winning the
World Cup at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say I have done everything possible to remain in the
shadows,'' Tauziat writes.
</P>
<P>
   Her failings at the French Open have not helped either: she has
never made it past the quarterfinals in her nation's most
significant tournament. Mary Pierce's decision to represent France
despite her strong U.S. roots and accent also stole some of
Tauziat's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   But this book, a blend of autobiography, trenchant peer review
and informed advocacy, is a conscious effort by Tauziat to step
into the light. Written in French with the help of the reporter
Dominique Bonnot, the book is titled ``Les dessous du tennis
feminin'' (The Underside of Women's Tennis) and the cover features
Tauziat coquettishly clutching a pillow on a bed while dressed in a
nightgown. ``Les dessous'' also means ``underwear'' in French.
</P>
<P>
   It is an out-of-character pose, a tabloid pose, but though
Tauziat addresses most of the tennis topics that frequently receive
sensationalist treatment _ lesbianism on tour, overbearing parents,
teen-age burnout and the telegenic Anna Kournikova _ this is not a
paperback exercise in bottom feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Her thesis _ which her provocative cover photo strangely
reinforces _ is that style has triumphed over substance and that
the culture of celebrity and, above all, the players' agents are at
fault.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tauziat, the tournament directors have a
confidential list called ``the commitment list,'' which grades
players not by their ranking but by their marketability. Tauziat
says that some of the top 20 on the list, which includes the
teen-ager Alexandra Stevenson, who is not yet ranked in the real
top 20, receive bonuses for playing a certain number of events each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in the 1970s, aesthetics and charisma are winning out over
sporting performances,'' Tauziat writes, ``and we don't run much
risk of changing that around as long as the box office will put
Kournikova ahead of Lindsay Davenport only because she is
prettier.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, who has not won a tournament, earned more last year
than Davenport, who has won three Grand Slam titles. But Tauziat
does not let that injustice define her view of Kournikova. She
writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can speak without jealousy or nastiness, because I like her.
She is fun and rather nice, even if she unfortunately does not show
respect to everyone. In my opinion, she's already had enough of
being worshiped. Enough of always being told that she's the
prettiest, the best this, the best that. Even if she plays up her
charm and her physical attributes, the dream of her life is to play
tennis. It's her passion. A true one. What she wants is to finally
win a tournament and be recognized for that, or play in a Grand
Slam final, and it's for that reason I like her a lot. In the end,
we've arrived at an absurd situation where she has become the
victim of a system that she herself has helped develop more or less
willingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Squandered talent bothers Tauziat, who has not had the luxury of
squandering much of hers since she moved to France after spending
the first nine years of her life with her family in French-speaking
Africa. Her dislike of waste is the reason she has mixed emotions
about Yannick Noah, the charismatic Frenchman with the short
attention span who was captain when France and Tauziat won the Fed
Cup in 1997. ``The talent he had!'' she writes. ``He could have
been so much better! Why didn't he invest in the long term?''
</P>
<P>
   She sees the same tendencies in the newest French star, Amelie
Mauresmo, who reached the 1999 Australian Open final at 19 and has
since had flickering results. As for Mauresmo's decision to
announce her lesbianism, Tauziat accepts it completely, but is
uncomfortable with the public assumption that most women's tour
players have the same sexual preference. ``When the WTA and women's
circuit began,'' she writes, ``the proportion of homosexuals among
the top 10 was significant. Now there must be no more than two
among the top 10. But the idea that we are all more or less that
way is so powerful that one must always justify oneself. How many
times have I felt in the eyes of others this heavy and indelicate
question, `Are you or aren't you?' No, I am not, and I am neither
proud nor sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat is grudgingly complimentary of the Williams sisters,
writing: ``Luckily the Williamses are not (yet) great technically.
If they were they would be unplayable.'' But she has more unabashed
admiration for the ever-improving Martina Hingis, whom she supports
despite the Swiss teen-ager's chronic lack of diplomacy and
petulant performance in defeat against Steffi Graf in last year's
French Open final. Tauziat was in the locker room afterward holding
a sobbing Hingis while Hingis told her she was convinced she would
never win the title she wants most.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat suspects the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs
is fairly widespread and not being effectively combated by the
sport's governing bodies. She also does not like the tendency to
reduce tournament fields and squeeze out the marginal pros, a trend
pushed by top players' agents. She believes it will reduce the
talent pool from which stars emerge.
</P>
<P>
   But what she really dislikes is that she lost her only Grand
Slam final. She is convinced she lost it before the match even
began against Jana Novotna. ``I didn't tell myself, `Nat, this
final is yours for the taking,''' she writes. ``I told myself,
`Nat, you've made it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Tauziat will long watch the video of that 1998
Wimbledon final with regret, the fact that she lost explains why
she, unlike Novotna, is still playing, still trying to take the
ball a split-second earlier, still trying to make arriviste youth
wait its turn, still consumed by the labor-intensive process of
becoming.

A SUDDEN, VIOLENT MOMENT THAT STILL HAUNTS A LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Kermit Washington played 10 seasons in the NBA. He now
owns a restaurant in Vancouver, Wash.)  
 By KERMIT WASHINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro basketball is a different game these days, and it isn't
simply what happens on the court. When I see the way Latrell
Sprewell has turned around his image after the much-publicized
confrontation with his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, it reinforces my
belief that you can overcome something negative provided someone
wants to help you.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years ago, it was very different. You didn't have
the public relations machine you have now. Pete Newell and Red
Auerbach stood up for me and helped me stay in the NBA as a player.
But I was never able to live down the one mistake I made as a
player, or even explain it so that people would understand I wasn't
some kind of animal who would just turn around and hit someone for
no reason.
</P>
<P>
   The story began on Dec. 9, 1977. I was playing for the Los
Angeles Lakers. We were in the middle of a game in Los Angeles
against the Houston Rockets. It was your typical basketball game. I
was checking Moses Malone, something I did regularly because we
would always try to keep Kareem Abdul-Jabbar out of foul trouble.
As a player, I was expendable and Kareem was not. This didn't
bother me. It was an honor to play against one of the game's
greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   The situation started with a rebound that came off the board. It
would have been an offensive rebound if I had gotten it, but I did
not. There were two other people under the basket _ Kareem and
Houston's Kevin Kunnert. I turned to get back on defense and tried
to pull my way past Kevin. What I did would have been a foul if it
were caught, but it wasn't. As I tried to pull my way past Kevin,
he elbowed me in the face. For a second, I didn't know what had hit
me. When I realized I had been elbowed, I turned to him thinking it
had been an accident. His second reaction was not what I expected.
He turned and hit me in the face.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the first elbow was not unintentional. After he hit me, I
heard Kareem say, ``Oh no!'' He knew a fight was about to ensue.
Kevin and I scuffled, with not much damage to either side because
people had jumped between us. While this was happening, I saw Rudy
Tomjanovich running straight at me. After being attacked by
Kunnert, I did not think Rudy's intentions were good either. I just
saw someone running at me and reacted. My punch landed on his face
and he fell. As Rudy Tomjanovich fell that night, so did my
basketball career and a lot of the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   After everything stopped and I realized Rudy was hurt, I was
sorry I had hit him. Not knowing the extent of Rudy's injuries, I
drove home after being thrown out of the game. I tried calling the
hospital that night to apologize and check on him, but my calls
were turned away. I did not expect the reactions that followed
because I thought I had just been defending myself. Unfortunately,
Kunnert's elbowing and hitting me were not on film. The only parts
that were caught were Rudy running at me and my hitting him. I knew
I was in trouble. The news reports of my attacking Rudy were
everywhere, but there was no mention of Kunnert and his
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   I went to practice and played in the next game. The reports of
the story and Rudy's condition worsened. (He eventually needed
facial reconstruction surgery.) The clip of my turning and hitting
Rudy was played continuously all over the nation. I was portrayed
as an out-of-control player who attacked another player for no
reason. I knew something bad was going to happen. It did. The press
completely turned on me. I was fined $10,000 and suspended
indefinitely for three months without pay, a large sum in those
days of $100,000 annual salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But my nightmare was just beginning. Besides having no money, I
was public enemy No. 1. In 1977, racial diversity was almost
nonexistent; racial slurs about me became everyone's favorite. I
was humiliated. I was an embarrassment to myself and my family. Not
even the university I attended wanted anything to do with me.
Everyone who was once so proud of me now could not even say my name
in public.
</P>
<P>
   During my suspension, the Lakers never called me. My lawyer at
the time, David Falk, advised me not to comment on anything about
that night. I couldn't even defend myself to the public. A few days
later, as a result of the fight, I was traded to the Boston Celtics
with Don Chaney. Before I went to Boston, I had to meet with
Commissioner Larry O'Brien in New York. O'Brien made it clear that
I was not welcome anymore. His actual words were: ``We don't need
your kind in the league. You are not good for the league.'' I
realized then that if I wanted to continue playing basketball, I
would have to keep my mouth shut and not appeal my suspension or
trade. For reasons I now regret, I chose to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, I had to have FBI agents sit next to me at the games
for fear of being attacked. I was warned not to order room service
for fear of being poisoned. I finished the rest of my career
without incident and retired in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I have applied for various coaching jobs from high
school to the pro level, but have always been turned down because
no one wanted to be associated with my reputation, or with me. My
name stood for violence and bad publicity. I was blackballed
everywhere. I've made it this far only because I have owned my own
business, a restaurant. No one would hire me. I couldn't do summer
camps because parents didn't want their kids around someone like
me. Schools were hesitant to let me speak because all the kids ever
wanted to hear about was the famous fight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 23 years, the clip of my hitting Rudy is played
every time there is any type of violence in sports. I can't count
how many times it ran during the Sprewell incident and just
recently with the Marty McSorley hockey incident. Everything I've
ever accomplished in life is overshadowed by this incident. No one
stops to ask me about my charities or the work I do in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   I can't come back and play and have someone like a sneaker
company or the NBA start a marketing campaign to help me overcome
the one blemish on my resume. After I quit playing, guys who were
my best friends in the league would say, ``Kermit, we can't hire
you as an assistant coach because of the publicity it would get.''
I never drank, never did drugs, never got in trouble. I was an
academic all-American at American University, started Pete Newell's
camp for big men and helped run it for 10 years, started Project
Contact and have been doing charity work in African countries.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing against the league. I understand that 23 years
ago the NBA had a reputation to protect and that it felt it had to
sacrifice me. But all people are ever going to remember me for was
this one blemish.
</P>
<P>
   How do I make people believe that, yes, I did throw a punch that
I sincerely regret, but that it was in a fight that I didn't start?
How do I change the way people look at me every time there's a
violent act in sports?
</P>
<P>
   I took a lie detector test last month to prove I was telling the
truth. The doctor who administered the test said it was two to
three times higher than it needed to be to be an honest statement.
I hope this is the first step in salvaging my name and reputation.
When I die, I hope the legacy I leave behind is not one of
violence.

   OLY-WEIGHTLIFTER _ Savannah weightlifter Cheryl Haworth has

   SPORTS-POLITICS _ Most people expect the Vs. the Flag coalition
to march into Georgia as soon as their work is completed in South
Carolina. The object will be to force Georgians to remove the
Confederate flag from the State of Georgia flag, and the group will
try to accomplish that with sports boycotts, etc. The Sports vs.
Politics battle has existed throughout Olympic history, and it has
always been a volatile mix. From the 1936 Berlin Olympics to the
raised black-gloved fists in 1968 in Mexico City to the Jimmy
Carter-led boycott of the Olympics in 1980. But states also have
fought their battles _ Arizona had to adopt a Martin Luther King
day to keep the Super Bowl. Officials with the NCAA and NFL kept
close tabs on Louisiana, when David Duke was on the ballot for the
statehouse. And writers left the pressbox in the Georgia Dome
during the 1994 Super Bowl to protest the Georgia flag. We provide
the history lesson. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45.

   LEWIS-LAWYERS _ ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis is a criminal defense
lawyer's dream come true. Flush with a $23 million contract and a

his lawyers and, better, his is a case they can win. Ed Garland and
Don Samuel, Lewis' lead lawyers, are a ying and yang partnership.
Both have their own strengths. A look the ``dream team'' of sorts

ELIZABETH WILCOX, 84, PHOTOGRAPHER OF A HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Md., Vt., Wash., Mass.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elizabeth Wilcox, who took more than 100,000
sensitive photographs chronicling 35 years of medical care at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and then gave them to the
center, died on May 6 at a retirement community in North Branford,
Conn. She was 84 and had lived in New York and in Redding, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said her son Herbert B. Wilcox III.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Wilcox, known as Libby, was a professional
photographer known for her medical photographs, but she did her
work at the hospital as a volunteer; her husband, Dr. Herbert B.
Wilcox Jr., was long affiliated with the center. She also worked as
a freelance photographer for national magazines like Time and
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pictures like a writer writes,'' she once said. ``Each
negative is a note in the manuscript. After all, what photography
is, is to write with light.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 she and her husband, a retired associate professor of
medicine at Columbia University's medical school, gave the center
her collection of more than 100,000 photographic images, almost all
taken at the center.
</P>
<P>
   The collection also includes negatives, prints, and pages from
publications in which her photographs appeared with articles and
sometimes in advertisements, particularly medical advertisements.
The collection, which is named for her, is housed in the Augustus
C. Long Library at the medical center and is not on display to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection chronicles the history of this medical center
and looks in depth at every aspect of medical and nursing education
and the delivery of health care,'' said Dr. Pat Moholt, associate
dean for scholarly resources in Columbia University's health
sciences division, which includes the medical center.
</P>
<P>
   She said Wilcox ``was a very perceptive photographer and,
through photography, drew out the essence of a situation or of a
person.'' She added, ``Through her photographs you could grasp a
whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox began her work at the center in 1957 with a day-to-day
visual chronicle of clinical research relating to childhood
nephrosis, a kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, she photographed former President Herbert Hoover as a
patient there. After receiving pictures she had taken of him, he
wrote her: ``They are on the flattering side. But I can stand some
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same year she went to Liberia with students from the
medical school who spent two months at a leprosarium there.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1965 blackout, she rushed to the medical center and
spent the long night taking pictures. Those who see her blackout
photographs understand ``the complexity of the situation and the
urgency of what these committed people were trying to accomplish,''
Moholt said.
</P>
<P>
   A picture she took at the medical center during the blackout is
now on display at the Museum of the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   After Peggy Jo Kienast gave birth to quintuplets in 1970, Wilcox
was the only photographer permitted to take official pictures of
them at the medical center.
</P>
<P>
   She achieved early mastery of the computer as a tool to help her
index the collection given to the medical center.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Baltimore, she was the daughter of Dr. Gordon
Wilson, a physician, and Elizabeth Elliott Wilson, and she attended
Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, whom she married in 1937, died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her son Herbert, of North Hero, Vt., she is survived by
two other sons, Gordon of Seattle and Thomas of Concord, Mass.; and
five grandchildren.

University professor who twice flew small planes alone around the
world, died on March 17 in Tucson, Ariz. The cause was pneumonia.
He was 82 and lived in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Banfe (pronounced BAN-fee) was on leave from Pan American World
Airways, where he was a pilot, when he first circled the globe in
1958, at a time when such solo flights were far riskier than they
are with today's navigational equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He flew a Mooney Mark 20A, a low-wing, single-seater monoplane.
The 22,000-mile flight was supposed to take eight days. It ended up
taking 50 days and was riddled with mishaps _ 14 forced landings,
one of them in a grape arbor in Corsica _ because of mechanical
failures and bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Banfe flew in his stocking feet because it gave him a ``more
sensitive feel,'' his wife, June, remembered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he made his second flight around the world, to
celebrate Hawaiian statehood. His circumnavigation in a twin-engine
Beechcraft Bonanza was completed in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Solo flights like Banfe's were more common in the 1920s and
1930s, when aviation was still in its infancy. Yet even at the dawn
of the space age, such flights around the world involved
substantial risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to navigate was kind of limited,'' said Lee
Person, a retired NASA research pilot. ``Today you can get a little
GPS that you can hold in your hand that knows its way around the
world. He had some long areas to cross without more to aid him than
a compass and a prayer.'' (GPS, or global positioning system, is
the satellite-surveillance network that instantly feeds exact
coordinates to sailors and fliers.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his career, Banfe flew aircraft ranging from
the ungainly ``flying boats'' to Boeing 747s. His wife recalled
that in the early 1970s, Charles Lindbergh was a passenger, and
Banfe invited him into the cockpit to co-pilot the jet briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindbergh was quite old, and Chuck kept his knee on the yoke
to keep the plane steady,'' his wife said. ``He did it
inconspicuously, so as not to embarrass Lindbergh.''
</P>
<P>
   Banfe was born Aug. 23, 1917, in Chicago. His father was a
barber, and his mother, Mary, a housewife. Banfe graduated from the
University of Chicago in 1940, with a degree in English, and joined
the editorial staff of Esquire magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always loved flying; he wanted to be another
Saint-Exupery,'' his wife said, referring to the French author and
aviator. She said he learned to fly in the 1930s by taking lessons
from barnstormers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the United States entered World War II, Banfe joined the
Royal Canadian Air Force, where he learned to fly twin-engine
bombers. In 1942, he joined American Overseas Airlines, which was
later bought by Pan Am, and after the war flew missions for the
Berlin airlift, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Banfe was a pilot with Pan American for 37 years, and taught
business, technology and airline management at Stanford University
business school for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; their five children, Charles Banfe
III of Honolulu, Nicholas Banfe of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, Peter Banfe
of Columbus, Ohio, Susan Prince of Portland, Ore., and Juli Banfe
of San Francisco; and six grandchildren.

RED BULLET SET TO TACKLE FUSAICHI PEGASUS IN PREAKNESS
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a red bullet shoot down a flying horse?
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, can the speed horse Red Bullet ambush
Fusaichi Pegasus and destroy his chances of sweeping the Triple
Crown?
</P>
<P>
   He tried it once, in the Wood Memorial last month at Aqueduct,
but the flying horse surged past Red Bullet to win by 4\ lengths.
Then, while Red Bullet stayed behind in New York, Fusaichi Pegasus
flew past the field to win the Kentucky Derby by a length and a
half at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never once did I feel I could have won the Derby,'' the
trainer Joe Orseno said the other day before putting Red Bullet
aboard a van and shipping him to Pimlico for next Saturday's
Preakness. ``We felt he wasn't a horse on schedule for the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   But Orseno and Red Bullet's owner, Frank Stronach, apparently
feel that the extra five weeks has given their colt the time he
needed to take another shot at Fusaichi Pegasus. They even hired
Jerry Bailey, the country's premier jockey, to ride Red Bullet when
he takes the next step.
</P>
<P>
   The next step: the 125th Preakness at a 1 3/16 miles, which is a
sixteenth of a mile shorter than the Derby on a narrower track with
sharper turns. Only five horses may challenge Fusaichi Pegasus this
time, including only two of the colts he outran in the Derby: High
Yield, the D. Wayne Lukas star, who finished 15th, and Hal's Hope,
16th in the Derby after leading for most of a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Three others are committed to the Preakness: Hugh Hefner, second
in the Snow Chief in his last start; Snuck In, second in the
Arkansas Derby; and Red Bullet, second in the Wood. Four other
colts who were soundly beaten in the Derby may give it another
whirl in the Preakness: Impeachment (third), More Than Ready
(fourth), Wheelaway (fifth) and Captain Steve (eighth).
</P>
<P>
   But the fresh horse, the dangerous horse, figures to be Red
Bullet. He is a chestnut son of Unbridled, winner of the 1990
Kentucky Derby, and he reeled off three victories in a row this
year, his first at the races. On Jan. 8, he won by seven lengths at
Aqueduct. On Feb. 5, he won by 2{ at Gulfstream Park. On March 19,
he returned to New York and won the Gotham Stakes by half a length
over Aptitude, who then ran second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the
Derby. And on April 15, Red Bullet again outran Aptitude in the
Wood, but both finished well behind the flying horse.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno said he believed that the Wood was decided when Red
Bullet pressed the pace, only to save nothing for the critical
stretch drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have at least made him run to the wire,'' Orseno
said. ``Instead, he got away from us because we were out of
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Orseno stopped short of finding fault with Alex Solis, who rode
Red Bullet in the Wood. But when Solis picked up Aptitude for the
Derby, the die was cast. Orseno promptly signed up Bailey, and
said, ``I don't want to have to scramble for a rider if we go on to
the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   But standing in the path of all challengers is racing's latest
superstar, Fusaichi Pegasus, a son of Mr. Prospector and a grandson
of Danzig, bought for $4 million as a yearling by the Japanese
venture capitalist Fusao Sekiguchi. He did not race until last
December, when he lost by a neck at Hollywood Park after a troubled
trip. But since then, he has streaked to five successes in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus became the Derby favorite when he won the Wood
with a powerful drive through the homestretch that left Red Bullet
and Aptitude in his trail. Three weeks later, he became the first
Derby favorite to win the race in 21 years, since Spectacular Bid,
and he did it with style and strength. He is a large animal with
regal breeding and a smashing resume, and he has become the
favorite to go on and become the 12th horse to sweep the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The last three horses who won the Kentucky Derby _ Silver Charm,
Real Quiet and Charismatic _ also won the Preakness but fell short
of winning the Belmont Stakes in the final strides. But none of
them was the favorite in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Fusaichi Pegasus, a brilliant new star in the
new century. You will hear no argument from Lukas, who has entered
38 horses in the Kentucky Derby over the last 20 years and won the
race four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusaichi Pegasus is a deserving favorite,'' Lukas said, ``but
let's face it, he's not a wind-up toy. You're probably crazy to
pick against him. So, we'll try to upset him.''
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmakers agreed. They expected to make Fusaichi Pegasus
the heavy early favorite at perhaps 3-5 to win the Preakness. Those
are the same odds they quoted on Easy Goer before his loss to
Sunday Silence in the 1989 Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who won the Derby twice in the last four years, put
it into perspective for his horse, Captain Steve, as well as the
No. 1 challenger, Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusaichi Pegasus deserves to be the heavy favorite,'' Baffert
said. ``He's got a lot going for him with his breeding, his record
and the way he won the Derby.''

HARRIET LANGE RHEINGOLD, INFANT BEHAVIOR EXPERT, DIES AT 92 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., N.Y., Ill., Md.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harriet Lange Rheingold, a child psychologist and research
professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina, died on
April 29 at a retirement center in Chapel Hill, N.C. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold did not begin her specialized research until she was
45, after 20 years of patient care and undergraduate teaching. She
made a name for herself nationally in the next 20 years with her
work in developmental psychology.
</P>
<P>
   She focused on the social and exploratory skills of infants and
young children. Her interests ranged from infant sociability and
responsiveness to independent behavior and the development of
valued traits like sharing, helping and caring.
</P>
<P>
   Her teaching and writings helped to change the way psychologists
view normal infant behavior by helping to shape the recognition
that infants interact with their environment from birth. Her books
included ``The Infant Separates Himself From Her Mother,''
published by the American Association for the Advancement of
Science in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, she graduated from Cornell in 1928 with a
degree in philosophy and earned a master's in psychology at
Columbia in 1930. She then was a research fellow, psychologist and
assistant professor at Rockford College in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 she received a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of
Chicago. She was a research psychologist at the National Institute
of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., before joining the North
Carolina faculty as a research professor in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 she organized a symposium, ``Toward a Unified Science of
Behavioral Development,'' for the Society for Research in Child
Development. The same year she also addressed the 18th World
Congress on Early Childhood Education in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold is survived by her husband, Don W. Hayne, two sons,
six grandchildren and two great-grandsons. Her first husband, Dr.
Joseph Rheingold, a psychiatrist, died in 1978.

SAGGING SPIRITS FIND RESPITE IN SHRUBBERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfred Spurlock, shot in the head by the police
during a burglary, and in prison most of his life, did not know he
was HIV-positive until after he wandered drunk on railroad tracks
in New Jersey and got clobbered by a train that knocked him into a
pond.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the first sentence of an exceptionally depressing
hard-luck story.
</P>
<P>
   This is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock is one of a group of formerly luckless people, all poor
and infected with the virus that causes AIDS, who in the past year
have hung out on a balcony in the Bowery and witnessed the coming
of a paradise that replaced a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It's a garden center where Billie Holiday sings over
loudspeakers for young professionals who are hunting potted plants.
Weeping Japanese maples sell for $600. Hoes that Wal-Mart sells for
$14.96 sell in the former parking lot for $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelsea Garden Center is exactly the kind of place that
Spurlock and his fellow clients at the Bowery Residents' Committee
Adult Day Health Center would not be able to enjoy unless fate had
offered them a perch that looks down upon, among other things,
yuppies buying mulch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see people in there you don't even know existed,'' said
Eduvige Rosario, 39, who was told 15 years ago that he had the AIDS
virus. ``It is like seeing monkeys in the zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the greenery, more than the credit-card-carrying humanity,
that brings pleasure to the men and women who sit on a warm spring
afternoon, smoking cigarettes and gazing at a Thundercloud Purple
Leaf Plum tree (the tallest item in the garden store) swaying in
the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say without a doubt that the attitude of our clients has
changed since Central Park moved into the parking lot,'' said
Josephine Gilliam, a substance-abuse counselor at the center.
``They are more friendly, more open, and they started to rally
around each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no exaggeration, says Gilliam, who herself sits and
smokes on the second-story porch between counseling sessions and
admires the Thundercloud Purple Leaf Plum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch it blow in the wind, and my stress goes away,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stress usually goes up, not away, when businesses that cater to
the affluent rub shoulders on the Bowery with agencies that serve
the poor, the sick and the previously incarcerated. A dot-com
invasion has sent rents climbing in the neighborhood. Cheap
housing, even cheap bad housing, is increasingly scarce on the
formerly infamous skid row where fancy restaurants now sell grilled
paillard of veal for $18 a plate.
</P>
<P>
   But the adult care center at 317 Bowery is lucky. Four years
ago, just ahead of the dot-com curve, the center signed a lease
that guarantees 50 years of affordable rent, according to John
Sheehan, acting director of the center, which is financed by its
clients' Medicaid benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Garden Center, too, has had an atypical stress reaction.
Its owner, David Protell, moved last summer to the corner of Bowery
and Second Street not knowing who his neighbors would be and
certainly not anticipating that they would hang out on a reviewing
stand, eyeballing his customers and loving his shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had concerns about the neighborhood for all the obvious
reasons,'' said Protell, who was forced to move from Chelsea to
make room for an apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these people up there,'' he said, casting his eyes in the
direction of the smokers on the balcony, ``are excellent neighbors.
I am sure we amuse them. We are the animals in the zoo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Chelsea Garden Center has given a Christmas tree and some
plants to the day care center. Protell said he might be interested
in offering jobs, too, but that he has not yet been asked.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Spurlock, the man who got knocked into the pond by
the train, only to learn from doctors who put him back together
that he was infected with HIV?
</P>
<P>
   He has healed and, he said, has been clean of drugs and drink
since last July _ about the time the Chelsea Garden Center moved in
next door. Spurlock does not believe coincidence is causality, but
he loves looking at the greenery. He describes its arrival as ``the
best thing that could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One doleful concern of Spurlock and his fellow clients is the
long wooden shrubbery planters that they see stacked on the roof of
the garden center's office. On the edge of a parking-lot paradise,
the planters look like coffins.

PUTIN ASSERTS NEW CONTROLS OVER PROVINCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin moved Saturday to assert
sweeping control over Russia's far-flung and often headstrong
provinces, decreeing that they be organized into seven vast
administrative districts, each overseen by a powerful Kremlin
representative.
</P>
<P>
   It is Putin's second attempt in a week to rein in the 89
provinces, and it seems quite likely to stir protest among their
elected governors, some of whom rule like potentates.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the 10-page decree does not dilute the governors'
power, change province borders or weaken citizens' rights to run
local affairs. Mostly, it winnows down the current Kremlin
arrangement, which places a presidential envoy in every province,
in favor of a handful of administrators who oversee federal affairs
throughout huge swaths of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The decree states that the districts are being created to
streamline the unwieldy structure of relations between Moscow and
the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The order also grants the envoys considerable authority, at
least on paper, to carry out Kremlin decisions in their fiefs. It
makes it clear that they answer only to Putin, who has the sole
power to appoint and dismiss the envoys, to finance their local
operations and to determine how patronage is dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   The envoys' main task, the decree states, is ``the realization
by the organs of state power of the main directions of domestic and
foreign policy of the state, as determined by the president of the
Russian Federation.'' Among their other powers, the decree states,
is ``the right to enter any organizations on the territory of this
federal district.''
</P>
<P>
   Television news programs Saturday evening called the decree an
outgrowth of Putin's pledge in his presidential campaign this
spring to strengthen central control over the regions. Many
politicians and experts say the Kremlin ceded far too much
authority to the provinces in President Boris Yeltsin's tenure, to
the point where some governors felt free to ignore presidential
orders and federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin wants to make the state more manageable and more
monolithic, which he has declared more than once,'' a television
network, NTV, said Saturday night. ``Experience showed the
presidential envoy in a region depending more on the local
authorities than on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the envoys rely on local leaders for housing, favors and
even jobs for family members. Putin signaled last week that he
would no longer tolerate that.
</P>
<P>
   His decree explicitly shifts to his office the responsibility
for housing and supporting the new envoys. On Wednesday in the
provinces of Ingushetia and Amur, he suspended local laws that
conflicted with federal law and sent a letter to the Bashkortostan
legislature to urge it to bring the province's Constitution in line
with federal constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also announced that he was considering legislation to
restrict the governors' power, a proposal highly likely to meet
fierce resistance in many provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The new order establishes, in effect, regional capitals in the
seven districts and gives Putin the authority to set up staffs in
each. Among other powers, the envoys are responsible for putting
into effect all federal orders and presidential dictates,
coordinating executive agencies, monitoring law enforcement,
supervising all federal hiring and ``giving rewards and delivering
thanks from the president.''

REAL ESTATE: THE ELDERLY FACE HOUSING CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-story Tudor on tree-graced Maryland Road in the
Douglaston section of Queens, New York City, often reverberates
with the clamor and clatter of Frances Toner's dozen grandchildren
and four great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have friends on the block,'' said Toner, who has lived
in her four-bedroom house for nearly 60 years, ``which is why I
don't want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, precisely because she decided to remain in the big,
old house that her father bought for $10,000 in 1943 _ and is now
worth ``at least $350,000,'' she said _ Toner made what in legal
parlance is called ``a gifting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given the house to my children,'' Toner, 83, said, ``but
I can live in it until I die _ who knows when? _ or if I go into a
nursing home. I assume all the responsibilities for repairs and
taxes and insurance. It's all done in case I need Medicaid. If I
have to go into a nursing home it would not be considered my
property.''
</P>
<P>
   In many facets of her life, Toner, a retired schoolteacher,
reflects the range of choices, the possibilities and pitfalls, that
older people, along with their offspring, must be aware of _ and
sometimes be wary of _ in negotiating the added complexities of
real estate that come with age.
</P>
<P>
   Stay or sell? Move in with the children or stick by those dear
friends? Downsize in the suburbs or go co-op in the city? Head
toward warmer climes? Buy or rent?
</P>
<P>
   Take on new debt? If so, how does one evade the clutches of
predatory lenders? And just what are those newfangled reverse
mortgages?
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the questions typically confronting the healthy
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   If health declines, other complicated issues arise: If mobility
abates, is the right course to remodel the old house and hire a
home-care aide, or to move into some sort of assisted-living
accommodation? What if one spouse needs assistance while the other
does not?
</P>
<P>
   And how does one keep the government from ``taking the house,''
a common fear of the elderly, when Medicaid requires that most
assets be liquidated? Or keep the tax collector from clobbering the
children on capital gains?
</P>
<P>
   Such issues, to be sure, confront many people venturing into a
real estate transaction, not only the elderly. But they are of
particular concern to those who are likely to have lived in their
homes for decades, may be on fixed incomes, and may not be familiar
with the vicissitudes of the current market.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues for increasing numbers of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, one thing relevant about seniors is that there is
going to be more of us,'' said Professor Nicolas Retsinas, director
of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Retsinas said, 34 million Americans are 65 or older; in
1970, it was 20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even more spectacular,'' he said, ``is that the growth
will surge to almost 70 million by 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Harvard center released a two-year study,
``Housing America's Seniors,'' which, among other conclusions,
reported that people 65 and over, with ownership rates of nearly 80
percent, currently account for about one-quarter of all home
owners, and 1 in 10 home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One misconception about the elderly is that most of them live
in age-restricted housing,'' Retsinas said. ``The reality is that
most live in the same kinds of homes everybody else does.'' Ten
percent of the elderly live in age-restricted communities, the
Harvard report says.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, as the population ages, ``we're not going to be
immune from health and mobility problems,'' Retsinas said,
``decisions about buying and selling homes are something more and
more of the elderly will face.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the concerns raised in the report are that elderly people
are increasingly living in suburban, auto-dependent areas; that
they have had fewer children and, therefore, now have fewer primary
caretakers than previous generations had, and that access to
services will prove increasingly difficult for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge in the marketplace is that while seniors are
often not as well informed about their options, they increasingly
need homes that are modified to accommodate mobility
restrictions,'' Retsinas said, ``and because of that they are more
susceptible to predatory lending.'' At the same time, he said, ``as
tomorrow's seniors face choices of whether to stay or move, they
may not be as aware of revolutionary changes in housing finance
that have opened up an array of options.''

   Perhaps the most revolutionary development in the field of
housing finance for the elderly is the reverse mortgage, which
offers a range of possibilities for homeowners 62 or older,
particularly those who are equity rich but cash poor.
</P>
<P>
   By tapping into the long-accumulated equity of their home,
elderly people can remain in their residences while financing a
major remodeling _ perhaps installing wider doors for wheelchairs,
access ramps and grab bars. Or they can buy a new home and no
longer be fettered to monthly mortgage payments. Or take a lump sum
at the time the reverse mortgage is closed and use that money for
any personal project, or to pay medical expenses. Or they can
simply enhance their incomes with monthly payments into their
pockets or by drawing down a line of credit as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can really use it for anything,'' said Naomi Bayer,
director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, the federally
chartered home-financing corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse mortgages, which have been on the market for less than a
decade, require no repayment while the elderly person is living in
the house. ``When they no longer occupy the home, the loan is due
and payable with all the accrued interest,'' Bayer said. ``And any
heirs may repay it by either selling the home or with other
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a 75-year-old homeowner whose house is worth
$200,000 takes out a reverse mortgage at an interest rate of 10
percent and lives in the house for 10 more years, the borrower
could have access to a line of credit of about $100,000. The
borrower could either draw down that line of credit at will or take
monthly payments of about $900.
</P>
<P>
   If, at the end of the 10 years the full line of credit has been
used up, a total of about $200,000 would be owed _ including the
$100,000 the borrower received over the years, the closing costs of
$10,000 and accrued interest of about $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverse mortgages are structured so that the borrower will
never owe more than the value of their home at the time the house
is ultimately sold,'' Bayer said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scenario differs, somewhat, when a reverse mortgage is used
to buy a new home. ``Let's say they are 73 and sell their home for
$200,000,'' Bayer said, ``and they want to move closer to their
children and buy a smaller home for $150,000. They could get what
we call a Home Keeper loan in the amount of $65,000, and would
contribute $85,000 from the proceeds of the previous sale'' _
leaving $115,000 in liquid assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are using it to buy another home, they don't get money
for their current use,'' Bayer said, ``but it allows them to buy
the new home without monthly mortgage payments. And when they die
or move into other accommodations, the loan and the interest become
due and payable.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers should learn as much as possible about reverse mortgages
before making a decision, Bayer said. ``There are counseling
agencies approved by Fannie Mae that can provide individualized
information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They should decide themselves whether to take a reverse
mortgage. ``Get advice from family members, but don't let anyone
make up your mind,'' Bayer said. Borrowers should also insist that
all reverse mortgage funds be paid directly to them, she said;
``don't let anybody persuade you to sign over the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   And borrowers should choose themselves how to use the loan
funds. ``Sometimes seniors hear about reverse mortgages that offer
a particular product or service, like home remodeling or an
annuity,'' Bayer said. ``That decision is totally up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   PREDATORY LENDING: Targeting The Unsophisticated
</P>
<P>
   Some of these loan products are foisted on people by
unscrupulous lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The basic pattern, said Josh Zinner, coordinator of the
foreclosure prevention project for the elderly at South Brooklyn
Legal Services, ``is that people who are financially
unsophisticated are targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a contractor comes to the door ``making all sorts
of promises about helping with affordable repairs,'' Zinner said,
``and people end up with vastly inflated home-improvement
contracts, often for repairs that are not needed.'' The contractors
work in conjunction with mortgage brokers who refer the loan to
high-rate lenders. ``And then all sorts of fees and costs are piled
on,'' Zinner said.
</P>
<P>
   People are sometimes persuaded to consolidate other debt into
the principal of the mortgage so that it, too, is tied to their
home. ``If somebody had credit-card debt or a hospital bill, it's
all replaced by the high-rate mortgage,'' Zinner said. ``So people
end up with huge monthly payments they can't afford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't lose your home because of an unpaid hospital bill,''
he said, ``but if you can't pay the mortgage because the hospital
bill was added in, you can lose your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, to push the loan through and collect their fees,
mortgage brokers falsify income information on the loan
application, ``and the lenders who work with these brokers simply
look the other way,'' Zinner said. ``What results is a very high
rate of foreclosures with these types of loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers sometimes commit to a series of predatory loans,
Zinner said, ``until all the equity in their home is swallowed
up.''

   In 1986, Louise Nathan, 61, was the victim of a hammer attack in
her East New York, Brooklyn, home. She underwent years of therapy
to regain some ability to speak, read and write.
</P>
<P>
   That elicited no sympathy from three successive lenders who came
to the door of her three-story, aluminum-sided row house four years
ago. ``The first was a typical home-improvement scam,'' said Nancy
Slahetka, a staff lawyer with the foreclosure prevention project.
</P>
<P>
   The contract _ to install a new floor, a ceiling, a bathtub,
cabinets, and repair a faucet in the bathroom _ was for $34,900.
But the mortgage was for $60,000, with monthly payments of $711.
Nathan's monthly income, from Social Security, is $948, Slahetka
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broker got a $13,690 fee,'' Slahetka said. ``They paid off
her old mortgage, which only had $6,828 left and would have matured
in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, the first loan was ``flipped,''
Slahetka said, ``when the same broker got her to sign another loan,
for $75,000 at 10.95 percent. And there's a balloon payment of
$63,000 after 15 years.'' A balloon payment means that until that
point the borrower has, essentially, only paid interest on the
loan, and not the principal. For Nathan's second mortgage, the
broker got $4,100 in fees and commissions.
</P>
<P>
   And then came a third mortgage with a different broker, for
$28,563 at 12.59 percent. ``She says that when she signed the
papers she could hardly read and talk,'' Slahetka said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan said: ``They wanted to do things to the house they said I
wanted done. I feel bad about what it's doing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal Services is currently seeking to devise a workout plan for
Nathan's debt problems and, citing possible deceptive lending
practices, challenging foreclosure proceedings filed against her.

<P>
   THE REAL DEAL: Some Rules For Success
</P>
<P>
   Most real estate transactions are perfectly legitimate, which is
not to say that every party to the deal is not trying to maximize
profits. So Dominick Pompeo, who knows what houses should cost,
offers some basic advice _ good for buyers or sellers of all ages
but, particularly, for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times,'' said Pompeo, a former chairman of the New York
State Appraisal Board and the president of Diversified Valuation
Group, an appraisal company in South Ozone Park, Queens, ``older
folks purchased their homes or apartments 30, 40 years ago and are
not really up on current market conditions. There's the chance they
will go to a broker who is not as experienced in their particular
community as he or she should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1 _ go to a well-established local broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition,'' Pompeo said, ``if they should relocate to a new
community, our first advice is that they rent for a time, to see if
it suits their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   In that instance, because potential buyers are unfamiliar with
the local market, Pompeo recommends that they have an appraisal
done. But only by an appraiser who is certified or licensed by the
state and, again, can demonstrate experience in the community.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get burned choosing an appraiser,'' Pompeo said.
``They can be unscrupulous, biased, if they are retained by the
mortgage broker or the sales broker. Those individuals do not
realize their remuneration unless the deal is consummated, so they
may look for an appraiser who is willing to make sure the number
comes in at the contract value.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most appraisers were retained directly by lenders.
But now, with streamlined, computerized mortgage programs, brokers
are retaining them. ``And if the appraiser does not insure that the
deal is done they are not hired again,'' Pompeo said.
</P>
<P>
   When the elderly relocate, he said, ``they take their knowledge
and parameters about their own market and judge their new area by
their previous standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if they are coming from somewhere in the Northeast, where
prices tend to be higher,'' he continued, ``there's a possibility
they may pay more than the market commands and still think they are
getting a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are coming to this area,'' Pompeo said, ``they may get
sticker shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly shocking, said Sylvia Shapiro, is buying an
apartment in Manhattan. Shapiro, a real estate lawyer and author of
``The Co-op Bible'' (St. Martin's Griffin, 1998), said, for
example, that since her building converted in 1991, a one-bedroom
has jumped from about $130,000 to $360,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are several things a potential co-op or condominium buyer
should watch for. ``These pertain to most buyers, but are of
greater concern to people on a fixed income,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer should be sure the building ``has a history of fairly
constant maintenance and monthly charges, not huge spikes like the
Dow Jones,'' she said, and should find out if the underlying
mortgage is coming due. If the board has to refinance, Shapiro
said, ``that could result in a substantial maintenance increase and
put a crimp in a retiree's budget.''
</P>
<P>
   A building's ``personality,'' Shapiro said, should also be
considered by an elderly buyer. ``There's one building in my
neighborhood where I think you need an AARP card to gain
admission,'' she said. ``Different generations often have different
agendas. Depending on who holds the upper hand, these differences
can lead to skirmishes before the board.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   These days, with bidders outnumbering available apartments in
Manhattan, boards are being finicky in vetting an elderly buyer's
finances, particularly if someone is on a fixed income and may not
be able to afford additional monthly charges.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Baker, a retired State Department foreign service
officer who, tongue slightly in cheek, described himself as
``ancient, over the hill, falling apart,'' confronted that kind of
skittishness when he bought a one-bedroom in a co-op on East Ninth
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had rented for 23 years, a fourth-floor walkup,'' Baker, 65,
said. ``But the aches and pains, it was too much.'' He was paying
about $1,000 a month for the rent-stabilized apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out to rent another place and found absolute dregs in
my price range,'' Baker said. ``The worst was a one-room
efficiency; you came through the door and on the right was a
curtain with a john behind it, and on the left was a counter with a
hot plate and one of those mini-refrigerators underneath. They
wanted $1,750. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's broker then said that if he could make a down payment he
probably could buy an apartment and afford monthly charges within
his $2,000 limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other intelligent thing I've done in my life is a buy
a little house in Sag Harbor,'' Baker said. He paid $40,000 for
that two-bedroom cottage in Southampton, and it is now worth, he
estimates, $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a pension from the State Department and Social
Security, so my annual income without lifting a finger is
$65,000,'' Baker said. He also has a $5,000-a-year adjunct
professorship in United Nations studies at Long Island University.
``Not really the biggest slice of my pie, is it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, given the possibility of future maintenance increases,
that job became a bit of an issue before the board of the East
Ninth Street building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seemed to be concern about whether I would keep the job
or not; they kept asking for records,'' Baker said. ``From my
perspective, I have zero debt, a house fully paid for, a clean
credit record for 35 years, blah, blah, blah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, it all worked out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in early December, Baker made a $60,000 down payment on the
$195,000 apartment. With mortgage payments of $800 and maintenance
of $500, he said, ``That's manageable _ $1,300 for a clean
apartment, with elevators.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker is single, and does not have to worry about his heirs.
Others do.

</P>
<P>
   ESTATE PLANNING: Keeping the House, Minimizing Taxes
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when a husband and wife own a home and one spouse
dies, the home will automatically be owned by the surviving spouse,
and no estate taxes will be assessed. When the second spouse dies,
however, the value of the home will become part of the estate and
could be subject to estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal estate laws, every individual has a credit of
$675,000, which allows them to leave property valued up to that
amount to their heirs without it being subject to estate taxes.
That credit amount is scheduled to increase to $1 million in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   For many elderly people, however, the focus is not on what will
happen after they die, but on preserving their ownership through
the rest of what increasingly is a lengthening life span.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people,'' said Brian Treacy, an elder-law lawyer in
Rutherford, N.J., ``often have this paranoia about the government;
they don't want `the government,' in quotes, `to take my house.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It might be the hospital, a nursing home, the Internal Revenue
Service, ``they all blur together,'' Treacy said, ``and seniors
will go to great lengths to prevent `them' from getting their
property.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, perfectly legal lengths to which anyone is
entitled to go to protect their home for themselves, for a healthy
spouse or for their heirs _ precisely what Toner, in her stately
Tudor home in Douglaston, Queens, had in mind when she opted to
give the house to her children.
</P>
<P>
   Toner is healthy; her husband, Hugh, 84, recently entered a
nursing home. The ``gifting'' _ linked to what is called a
life-estate clause _ gives her peace of mind, she said, ``a sense
that I know it won't all go to the nursing home, that the children
will have something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they can't put me out,'' she said with a touch of glee.
</P>
<P>
   The papers were drawn up by Ronald Fatoullah, an elder-law
lawyer in Nassau County's Great Neck. ``Once Mrs. Toner's husband
was approved for Medicaid,'' Fatoullah said, ``we wanted to do
estate planning for her. Now the home is protected for herself,
should she ever need care, and for her children in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nursing-home costs can range from $80,000 to more than $130,000
a year, Fatoullah said, ``and if the home remains in the name of
the senior who has received Medicaid benefits, the government would
recoup dollar for dollar everything it spent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So if there was, let's say, $500,000 in Medicaid dollars spent
_ and that's not atypical _ there likely would be no home left,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Treacy, the lawyer in Rutherford, pointed out that the idea of
transferring a home to an adult child is a common and simple
transaction for any lawyer to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' he said, ``is that because that transaction is
so easy and incurs no expenses it is usually conducted without one
very important sentence: a life-estate clause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, in it's entirety, 23 words _ `The grantor reserves to
himself a life estate in the subject property for his use and
enjoyment for the entirety of his lifetime' _ that can mean a
difference of thousands and thousands of dollars in taxes that will
have to be paid by the children upon the house's eventual sale.''
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the burden of capital gains taxes comes into
play.
</P>
<P>
   Fatoullah offered a for-instance: ``A client comes into my
office and wants protection for the home, and one of the first
questions I ask is, `When did you buy the home and what did you
pay?' The response I typically get is, `Oh, we scrimped and saved
and the house cost $10,000 back in the 40's; and we got such a big
mortgage, for $8,000.'''
</P>
<P>
   What elder-law and estate-planning lawyers want to determine, at
that point, is the basis for capital gains taxes on the elder
person's home, which is calculated by taking the purchase price and
adding the cost of capital improvements (though not basic repairs)
that have gone into the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, a senior will say, `I just want to transfer my home to
my children,''' Fatoullah said. ``But that's a problem. When you do
that you are also transferring, along with the home, the senior's
low tax basis. Meaning that when the child goes to sell the home,
let's say for $350,000 or $400,000, it could trigger a huge capital
gains burden for the child _ the tax on the gain.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, someone bought their home for $10,000 back in
the 1940s _ as Toner's father did _ and $40,000 worth of capital
improvements were made throughout the years, the tax basis would be
$50,000. ``Which means that if the home is sold for $350,000,
there's a gain of $300,000,'' Fatoullah said, ``and the child will
be responsible for paying the capital gains tax, at varying
percentages, when the home is sold.''
</P>
<P>
   But with a life-estate clause, upon the death of the parent the
home would be reappraised, and the market value of the home at that
time would be become the new tax basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if that $10,000 home is valued at $300,000 when the parent
dies and the child sells it for that amount,'' Fatoullah said,
``then there is absolutely no capital gains tax involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a difference,'' he said.

<P>
   SOUTH NYACK, N.Y. _ Houses tell the stories of people who have
loved and suffered there, done their work and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   But few houses tell them as eloquently and insistently as the
white Victorian, with the gauzy curtains at the windows, shutters a
bit askew and tall hedges out front, where Carson McCullers,
literary prodigy and tortured invalid, lived for nearly half her 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   With McCullers' death in 1967, of a brain hemorrhage, the house
might have been turned into a museum, like Edward Hopper's
childhood home down the street. Instead, it lives on as an artists'
colony, a miniature Yaddo, which reverberates with the spirit of
its longtime owner.
</P>
<P>
   Its five apartments are home to a performance artist, a
sculptor, an essayist and two poets, who know they are keepers of
the flame. In fact, two of them, Constance DeJong, a performance
artist, and Jeanne Atkin, a sculptor, have explicitly honored
McCullers' memory by collaborating on an art exhibit, which opened
on May 6 at the Hopper Art Center here.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to subdivide McCullers' house into apartments _
work that her friend Tennessee Williams paid for _ was made while
the author was still alive but struggling with extraordinary
medical bills from a rheumatic heart, a series of crippling
strokes, cancer, cardiac failure and repeated onslaughts of
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to continue renting the apartments after her
death, first to ordinary tenants and eventually to artists and
writers, was made by Dr. Mary Mercer, who was McCullers'
psychiatrist at a critical time in her stormy life and gradually
became her protector and closest friend. Theirs was an improbable
bond, breaking all the rules of psychotherapy, but one both women
described as the most significant and loving of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, who is nearing her 90th birthday, bought 131 South
Broadway from the McCullers estate in 1968 lest she walk by one day
and ``discover the hedges cut down and the house painted purple.''
To her, it is a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care more about the house than the tenants,'' she said,
without apology, during an interview at her own Nyack home, on a
bluff overlooking the Tappan Zee Bridge. It is in the
psychiatrist's house that McCullers, after a lengthy writer's
block, wrote her final novel, ``Clock Without Hands,'' published in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   At 131 South Broadway, a sketch of the author, with elfin face
and haunted eyes, hangs in the foyer. A plaque outside quotes the
most famous McCullers line, ``They are the we of me,'' from
``Member of the Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden, which slopes east toward the Hudson River, was
planted this spring with viburnum, mountain laurel and 15 varieties
of hostas and opened to literary pilgrims, who come here to visit
the author's grave at Oak Hill Cemetery, also the resting place of
Helen Hayes and Ben Hecht.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer refers to the tenants as ``Carson's guests.'' That is
both an inspiration and a burden for DeJong and Atkin, the two
full-time artists in the house, as well as for Sandrea DeMinco, a
college librarian who writes essays; Carol Gannet, a social worker
and poet; and Kevin Quinn, a teacher who also writes poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Winning an apartment at 131 South Broadway, a choice location in
a Rockland County village that has recently added Rosie O'Donnell
and Jonathan Demme to its roster of celebrity residents, requires a
series of challenging interviews with Mercer. She is a
larger-than-life character in her own right, who quotes Sophocles
and Goethe in ordinary conversation and is rarely seen without her
signature strand of pearls.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews are not a formal test, but prospective renters
are queried on which works of McCullers they have read and what
they know about the author, whom Mercer and the tenants always
refer to as Carson, as if there could be only one person who
answered to that name.
</P>
<P>
   DeJong, 52, was the first artist in residence, here for 10 years
and more cynical than the rest about the aura of the house. She
recalled a newspaper interview around the time she moved here,
related to a theater piece she had just completed. DeJong was
afraid that the interviewer would focus on McCullers' work and not
her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to be hijacked by the mystery, the mythology,''
DeJong said. Still, she said, ``I had read everything'' long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women do read her at a certain age,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMinco, 51, came next, seven years ago, having read ``The
Ballad of the Sad Cafe'' during her ``sojourner summer between high
school and college.'' Reverently, she has since worked her way
through the complete McCullers oeuvre, including film adaptations,
biographies and Web sites devoted to her work.
</P>
<P>
   DeMinco has produced three essays since moving here. They are
her first published works. ``I believe her spirit permeates
everything,'' DeMinco wrote in Tea for One, a local literary
journal. ``And if I'm very, very conscientious and respectful, it
will visit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came Atkin, 40, who moved in half a dozen years ago. Her
first exposure to McCullers was a movie version of ``The Member of
the Wedding,'' which she watched on television the night she moved
into her first apartment, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan,
poised at the tender age of 18 to cast herself as a bohemian.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin was working at a bookstore and bought all the McCullers
books using her employee discount. More recently, at the Nyack
Public Library, she has seen photographs of Marilyn Monroe,
Tennessee Williams and Isak Dinesen, all friends of the author, in
what is now her living room.
</P>
<P>
   The tenants understand that their ``hostess'' was a prodigy who
published ``The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter'' at 23, a hopeless
romantic who twice married the same alcoholic man, a woman whose
bisexuality was an open secret and who worked and lived hard,
despite illnesses worthy of Job.
</P>
<P>
   ``She throbbed,'' said Atkin, who lives in the spacious
ground-floor apartment with the screened sleeping porch, where
McCullers spent her last few years, mostly bedridden. It was here
that the frail author, wrapped in a Persian dressing gown, dictated
her unfinished autobiography, ``Illumination and Night Glare,''
which was published last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DeJong, who describes herself as ``a person of language,'' makes
her home in the attic apartment, tucked beneath the slate-covered
mansard roof, where McCullers lived briefly with her husband,
Reeves, during their second try at marriage. Later he would kill
himself in Paris, after she refused a joint suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Biographers credit Mercer with keeping McCullers alive for an
extra 10 years by managing her medical care and looking after her
psyche. They were heady times for the psychiatrist, who traveled
with McCullers and met her famous friends. Mercer still speaks of
her in the present tense and shows a visitor the author's
silver-topped cane.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer wants the tenants to identify with McCullers' passionate,
heedless nature. When DeMinco first looked at her apartment, she
worried that the 3-by-4-foot kitchen would be inadequate for
someone who loved to cook and owned 100 cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercer said, ``Let your work feed you,'' DeMinco recalled.
She also noted that the apartment had no closet, just three pegs
for garments. ``Don't worry about the tangibles,'' Mercer said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMinco got rid of three-quarters of her cookbooks. She had a
cherry-wood cabinet built for her clothes. Mercer reviews her
unpublished manuscripts. From a cozy window seat, facing the river,
she looks out on blossoming dogwood, cherry and magnolia trees, the
last a gift to McCullers from the artist Henry Varnum Poor. DeMinco
swoons at her good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin has the hardest time escaping the ghosts because she lives
in The Apartment, as her housemates call it. When she moved in, 27
years after McCullers' death, the curling wallpaper was unchanged.
When Mercer called her ``Carson's guest,'' she knew the landlady
spoke from love and memory and meant no harm. Still, she did not
want to feel like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin made her own imprint with the candlesticks, menorahs,
napkin rings and hair sticks that she designs in pewter and
aluminum, several for sale in the Museum of Modern Art catalog. Her
dog, Delilah, romps through the sunny space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love her as a writer,'' Atkin said. ``But I also have my
own life, in my own house.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment that McCullers, a transplanted Southerner,
might well have shared. She moved here with her mother in 1945,
after her father's death, and never looked back. ``I was always
homesick for a place I had never seen, and now I have found it,''
she wrote. ``It is here, this house, this town.''

LAURIE BATTLE, EX-CONGRESSMAN LINKED TO A COLD WAR BILL, DIES AT
87
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ala., Va. Md.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laurie C. Battle, a former representative from Alabama who was
linked to an important piece of Cold War legislation, died May 2 at
Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. He was 87 and lived in
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Battle, a Democrat, served four terms in Congress, representing
Birmingham from 1947 to 1955. An opponent of Communism, he was best
known as the principal sponsor of the Mutual Defense Assistance
Control Act of 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, called the Battle Act, blocked the United
States from giving aid to countries that shipped goods ``of primary
strategic significance'' to the Soviet Union and other nations in
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave the president the authority to waive the ban, and
Harry S. Truman promptly notified Congress that several countries,
including Britain, Denmark, France and Italy, would continue to
receive aid from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Calvin Battle was born in Wilsonville, Ala. He received a
degree in psychology from Birmingham-Southern College in 1934 and a
master's in sociology from Ohio State University in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a laborer and clerk for a natural gas company
during the day and taught sociology at Ohio State at night. He
joined the Army Air Forces in 1942 and was sent to the Pacific,
where he rose to the rank of major, and was awarded a Bronze Star
Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Battle won his first congressional race in 1946 on a shoestring
budget. Once elected, he demanded strict ethical standards for
Congress, insisting that members must not solicit or take favors
from people trying to influence votes.
</P>
<P>
   After four terms, he ran for the Senate in 1954 but lost in the
Democratic primary to Sen. John Sparkman. He also ran for governor
of Alabama in 1958 but lost in a primary election that included
George Wallace and John Patterson, who went on to win a runoff and
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Battle worked in the insurance business in Birmingham and then
as a government relations representative and legislative consultant
in Washington. He was staff director and counsel of the House Rules
Committee from 1966 to 1976 and was a special adviser to the U.S.
League of Savings Associations.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Janis Hunt Battle, four
sons, two daughters, three brothers, three sisters and 19
grandchildren.

LAKERS DELIVER, BUT SEE NEED TO IMPROVE
</HEADLINE>
 By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The stars lived up to their billing. The supporting
actors delivered award-winning performances and the defense awoke
for a climactic finish. The Los Angeles Lakers also won on the
road, a place that suspiciously had brought out the playoff worst
in them.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, they weren't satisfied. Despite preserving a 105-99
victory Friday night over the Phoenix Suns with clutch free throws,
the Lakers sounded like Hollywood executives panning their own
blockbuster release.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson has them believing that perfection is the
only way to win a championship ring, and even with a 3-0 lead in
the Western Conference semifinals, he still has their rapt
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some measure of happiness may come Sunday if the Lakers can
sweep the Suns in Game 4 at the America West Arena. Then again,
anything less than a 30-point stomping might be viewed as weakness
in the Los Angeles camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can cut down on mistakes and turnovers, we can do what
we did in Game 1,'' center Shaquille O'Neal said, referring to the
Lakers' 105-77 victory in the series opener. ``It's not what
they're doing to us, it's what we're doing to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who owned a four-game road losing streak going into
Game 3, had hurt themselves with slow starts at Sacramento in the
previous round and suffered the consequences while being taken to
five games by the Kings. That was the case again on Friday night
during an 18-point first quarter in which the Lakers shot an
embarrassing 27.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they recovered their shooting touch, quickly rallied from 12
points down and beat the Suns for the seventh consecutive time,
including four games in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the joke in the locker room, that we're not a good
road team,'' O'Neal said. ``We still didn't play a great game. We
still had a lot of mistakes. But with six minutes to go, we just
clamped down and went to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' script was true to the usual story line. O'Neal
devastated the Suns with 37 points and 17 rebounds and put on what
for him was a free-throw shooting exhibition. The Suns tried
bearhugs from Oliver Miller and forearm shivers from Luc Longley,
but O'Neal made them pay, knocking down 9 of 15 foul shots (8 of 10
in the first half).
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant scored 25 points and provided a crucial spark with
6:08 to play. Driving down the lane for a basket, he was fouled by
Penny Hardaway and completed the 3-point play to pull the Lakers
into an 87-87 tie. From there, the teams traded leads until Bryant,
Glen Rice and Brian Shaw combined for six free throws to put them
ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, Kobe's play was a big lift for us,'' Jackson
said. ``It allowed us to catch up with them and turned it into a
six-minute game.''
</P>
<P>
   The backups helped bail out the Lakers, too. Robert Horry, the
ex-Sun whose exit from Phoenix was hastened when he threw a towel
in the face of Danny Ainge, then the coach, while coming out of a
game, silenced boos from the crowd with 15 points, 5 rebounds and 4
assists in 39 minutes. Horry began the Lakers' comeback early in
the second quarter with 8 points in 68 seconds, including two
3-pointers that quickly cut the Suns' lead to 30-26. Rick Fox also
came off the bench and scored all 6 of his points in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert carried us back in the ballgame singlehandedly,''
Bryant said. ``After that, it was like, OK, we know what happened
on the road in Sacramento, let's go and not let that happen again.
Just the experience of a sweep would be something for us. It would
show the rest of the league that we're learning to close teams
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway led the Suns with 31 points on 11-of-15 shooting. Cliff
Robinson added 23 and Rodney Rogers scored 15, but the Suns could
not match the Lakers at the free-throw line. The Lakers made 35 of
51 free throws while the Suns were 25 of 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're desperate right now, but it's not impossible,'' Hardaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said: ``It's a long weekend for them, waiting for that
Sunday game. That's the exciting part for us, the opportunity to
close them out.'' &QL;

MIAMI'S RESERVES STEP INTO THE VOID
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Alonzo Mourning was forced to the bench early in
the third quarter on Friday night after collecting 3 fouls in 23
seconds, Tim Hardaway tried to step into the void and provide the
Miami Heat with the spark they desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Hardaway, after trying and failing over the next two
minutes, walked slump-shouldered to the bench without a field goal,
and the Heat were falling further behind the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning and Hardaway had carried the Heat through the years of
this passionate rivalry, an inside-outside threat that seemed to
fade all the other players into the scenery. Now, they were both on
the bench and the Heat were trailing in Game 3, appearing ready to
fade out of the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   But then, a unit comprised of the undrafted rookie Anthony
Carter, the 37-year-old backup Otis Thorpe and Clarence
Weatherspoon, joined starters P.J. Brown and Jamal Mashburn and
began to chip away. Weatherspoon and Thorpe, both of whom had been
almost invisible in Game 2, drawing the ire of Heat Coach Pat
Riley, went to work inside.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon scored the next two baskets for the Heat, and then
Brown uncharacteristically started to shoot, scoring 6 of his 14
points in an 18-8 run that turned a 7-point deficit into a 3-point
Miami lead. Bruce Bowen would later join the unit, eventually
making the biggest defensive play of the game, deflecting an
inbound pass by Charlie Ward off Latrell Sprewell to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, Carter was doing the little things that a
rookie is not supposed to be able to do, carefully running the
offense and finishing the game with 10 points, 8 assists and just 1
turnover. That is, until he took over the hero's mantle with the
most unlikely of shots, a courageous drive along the baseline with
2.2 seconds remaining in overtime that the Knicks thought sailed
over the backboard as he was almost sitting in the first row,
giving Miami a 77-76 victory and a two-games-to-one lead in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the whole game plan, for the bench to step up and for
the other guys, like me, to step up,'' Carter said after the game.
``That's part of our job. That's what we get paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is unlikely that game-winning shots in the heat of the
league's most intense rivalry, with 19,763 fans screaming him down,
are in the league-minimum contract that Carter signed, it is
contributions like this from other sources that the Heat have been
searching for. And this resourcefulness is something that they may
need, with Hardaway wondering aloud after Game 3 whether he will be
available for Sunday's Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what team basketball is all about,'' Bowen said.
``Sometimes you're not going to have your guns. We don't have Tim,
but we can't just say: `Oh well, we don't have Tim, so we can't do
what we need to do. It's still up to us to make plays.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brown added about the Knicks' attitude when they faced this
unit: ``I knew they were going to exhale, think this is their
chance to get those guys. I think they did kind of relax and I just
kind of said: `Hey we're not going out like that. We're going to
fight. We're going to fight to the end.' I took a couple of shots
and it was feeling good. I think that was tremendous heart and
courage by our secondary guys to continue and keep the game going
and keep us in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Riley spoke about how he had stressed the
importance of his bench to the team, and joked about the
consequences if they did not step forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will hang them by their thumbs from the Freedom Tower on
Biscayne Boulevard,'' Riley deadpanned. ``So they know the
consequences are very dire if they don't perform a little bit
better. We need more out of Spoon and Otis and Bruce, and we have
to find the right balance of what starters are on the court with
them, what offense we are running to them. They're all capable.
They've been a very good bench for us. As a matter of fact, they
helped us win the first game. We need a little bit more out of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley pounded on the Heat through practice on Wednesday and
Thursday. And though his words seemed like a joke, the players
obviously did not want to find out if it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great tonight, our bench,'' Riley said Friday night.
``Otis played hard. Spoon played hard. I thought Anthony Carter,
playing the last 22 minutes of the game, played the game of his
young life, and we got the win. So we are pleased with that, but
there is so much more work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung in there. We played hard. We came up here to win and a
lot of people have been writing us off; we are not this, we are not
that, and our guys take that a little bit personal. It is a great
group.'' &QL;

STEVENS PIVOTAL IN SUCCESS OF NEW JERSEY DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Stevens is an 18-year veteran and Brian
Rafalski is a rookie, and they work well as a pair on the Devils'
defense. Their experience differential is not the only contrast
that makes them an odd couple of roommates during the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On the night before a game, Rafalski prefers to relax by
watching television shows like ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
because, he said, ``I get sick of watching hockey games every
single night.''
</P>
<P>
   His roommate has different preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I have to say, `Scotty, we're just not going to
watch another game,''' Rafalski said. ``He'll come up and point at
the TV and say: `This guy should have done this! That guy should
have done that!' He gets into it and then he's all wound up and
then it's hard to get him to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens laughed when he heard this tale. ``He's right,'' Stevens
said. ``Brian is pretty calm and cool. I probably watch hockey a
little too much and get caught up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In deference to Rafalski, Stevens has been using the players'
recreation room at the hotel to watch only two periods.
``Otherwise,'' Stevens said, ``I'm too wound up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils hope both men rested well Saturday night _ despite
the telecast of the Colorado-Dallas game _ because New Jersey plays
at 3 p.m. on Sunday in Philadelphia in Game 1 of the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the 36-year-old captain, was the team's central figure
in the first two rounds, a four-game sweep of Florida and a
six-game ouster of Toronto. He keyed on stopping Pavel Bure of the
Panthers and the combination of Mats Sundin and Steve Thomas of the
Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Flyers, his assignment will be more diffuse because
Eric Lindros, a big center, is out with post-concussion symptoms,
and Keith Primeau, another big center, is doubtful because of a
concussion. But forwards like John LeClair and Mark Recchi are
dangerous in different ways. As a group, the Flyers are bigger and
more rugged than the Devils' previous two opponents.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 1 inch and a sturdy 215 pounds, Stevens has led the
Devils with clean, solid body checks, many of them in open ice.
Despite this, he has only 4 penalty minutes in 10 games because he
has turned down invitations to extend hostilities beyond the
whistles of officials, sometimes skating backward with a tight
smile above his goatee as rival players taunt and challenge him.
This is remarkable for a man who got 283 penalty minutes one season
in his younger days with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got maybe a bit of a temper, sometimes,'' said Scott
Niedermayer, another Devils defenseman. ``Right now, he's really
got that under control. It takes a lot of discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Restraint like this will be especially important against a
Philadelphia team that is among the National Hockey League's
roughest. Ken Daneyko, another hard-hitting Devils defenseman, said
Stevens is ``like a shark who smells blood'' and ``has been our
physical and emotional leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, Daneyko and Niedermayer were Devils in 1995, when the
team won its only Stanley Cup. In recent years, the Devils have
made early playoff exits after good regular seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this year is very important to him,'' Daneyko said of
Stevens, ``because it's been a tough few years and he has taken a
lot of it to heart and some of the heat. He's taken some flak about
leadership and about maybe the way he's played in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well of late, and Scott Stevens deserves all the
credit in the world. He's been a real dominant force. We have
followed him. He has lifted us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has been a Devil since 1991 and the captain since 1992.
As a veteran with talent and free-agent leverage, he might have
made more money elsewhere, on a team with a higher profile. But he
chose to stay and work for Lou Lamoriello, a general manager known
for tight budgets and strict control of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Earning $4.152 million a season in the second year of a
four-year contract, Stevens might be getting less than he could.
Why did he choose to stay? ``I like the system, I like the team, I
like the travel,'' Stevens said. ``I've learned a lot playing here.
My kids are in school and doing very well. I'm very happy with
that, and that is important to me. I don't think it's worth moving
your children.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Donna, have three children under the age of 11.
John Hauser, Stevens agent, said, ``Money was important to Scott,
but he did not want to end up on a team and in a city where it was
unknown how his family would react to the town and the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser also said that Stevens also knew that with the Devils he
would have a chance to compete for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello, rarely one to gush about those who work for him,
said Stevens was a valuable example to teammates. ``He eats right,
he sleeps right, he works hard,'' Lamoriello said. ``I don't think
you'll see Scott Stevens go to a fast-food restaurant often. He
takes care of himself. It's not by accident that he plays the way
he does and sustains it night in and night out. He is, without
question, one of the elite players in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he tried to stay away from sweets and other dubious
food. Stevens has played in more than 95 percent of the Devils'
games since joining the team. Referring to Lamoriello, Stevens
said: ``Lou likes hard-working people and gritty guys who come to
play. The blue-collar type of hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens may also have benefited from playing with Rafalski, who
is quick and nimble and experienced from four professional seasons
in Scandinavia and four before that at the University of Wisconsin.
``He knows if he steps up, I'll be back there,'' Rafalski said.
``It allows him to be more active at the blue line. He reads me
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not known as an offensive attacker, Stevens has two
goals and four assists for 6 points in the playoffs, tied for third
on the team. Larry Robinson, who replaced Robbie Ftorek as coach
with eight games left in the season, said Stevens and other Devils
became too attack-oriented during the regular season. Robinson has
refocused Stevens' attention ``on doing the things that you do
well,'' such as checking and positional defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, Scotty got us some big goals in the first
series and made some great offensive plays in the last series,''
Robinson said. ``He's playing very intelligently. He's really taken
the leadership role and gone with it. He has shown by example.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer said that Stevens ``is not the most vocal guy
around'' but that he will speak to teammates when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the wide-eyed kid who broke into the NHL with the
Capitals in 1982, Stevens speaks now as if he has his eyes on the
prize. Comparing the Devils of 2000 with the champions of 1995,
Stevens said: ``We're similar. We're a close bunch of guys. We're a
focused and disciplined hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens added: ``It's the final four. It is pretty prestigious
and very exciting. We've eliminated a lot of those past doubts and
failures. We've won two big rounds. We're playing great hockey.
We're going to try and grab the next round. The stakes get higher
and higher now.''  &QL;

BERNHARD HEIDEN, COMPOSER AND PROFESSOR, DIES AT 89 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Mich.)   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernhard Heiden, a composer who was for many years chairman of
the composition department at Indiana University, died April 30 at
his home in Bloomington, Ind. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, he began writing music when
he was 6. As a child, he studied the piano, clarinet and violin, as
well as music theory and composition. From 1929 to 1933, he was a
student of Hindemith at the Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin. The
year of his graduation, he won the Mendelssohn Prize for
composition, but he earned his living principally as an orchestral
clarinetist until he moved to the United States in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Heiden settled in Detroit, where he joined the faculty of the
Art Center Music School, conducted the Detroit Chamber Orchestra
and worked as an arranger for a radio station. He entered the U.S.
Army in 1943 and became assistant bandmaster of the 445th Army
Service Forces Band. After he was discharged in 1945, Heiden
continued his studies at Cornell, where he received a master's
degree in musicology.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the faculty of Indiana University in 1946. He became a
professor emeritus in 1981. In addition to directing the
composition department, he helped start the Indiana University
Early Music Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In his own music, Heiden was a traditionalist who incorporated
the respect for form and structure that he learned from Hindemith
with an ear for rich sound and texture. Among his larger works were
an opera, ``The Darkened City''; a ballet, ``Dreamers on a Slack
Wire''; two symphonies; a triple concerto for piano, violin and
cello; a concerto for trumpet and winds; a violin concerto; and a
tuba concerto.
</P>
<P>
   His chamber music included sonatas and two string quartets, as
well as works for unusual combinations. These included a set of
variations for tuba and nine horns and a quintet for flute, violin,
viola, bassoon and bass.
</P>
<P>
   He also composed several vocal and choral works, including
settings of John Donne's ``Divine Poems'' and Louise Labe's
``Sonnets,'' as well as a film score, ``Conspiracy in Kyoto,'' and
incidental music for several Shakespeare plays. And he was a
prolific arranger. During his two years in the Army, he arranged
more than 100 works for military band.

J. EDWARD CAROTHERS, 92, METHODIST LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Colo., Vt., Maine, Calif.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. J. Edward Carothers, a retired minister and former
chief executive of national ministries for the United Methodist
Church, died on May 1 at his retirement home in Doylestown, Pa.,
near Philadelphia. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Carothers, who took a keen interest in theology's relationship
to economics, science and technology, published seven books, among
them ``Keepers of the Poor,'' published by the church in 1966;
``Can Machines Replace Man?'' (Friendship, 1966); and ``To Love or
to Perish: Technological Crisis and the Churches'' (Friendship,
1972), of which he was co-editor with Margaret Mead, Roger L. Shinn
and Daniel D. McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   He held a number of positions with the National Council of
Churches from 1952 to 1964, including member of the general board
and secretary of the department of church and economic life. He was
the drafting editor of major documents that the council issued on
labor policy, among them one in 1965 that called for the repeal of
statutes that outlawed union shops.
</P>
<P>
   Carothers was chief executive of his denomination's national
missions from 1964 to 1972, when he retired to teach, write and
serve as an industrial consultant on family welfare. He lectured at
Drew University in Madison, N.J., and at the Iliff School of
Theology in Denver, where he had earned his postgraduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, until last September, he wrote monthly reviews of
books on Christian theology, in a bulletin distributed by the
church's board of global ministries.
</P>
<P>
   John Edward Carothers was born in Las Animas, Colo., about 60
miles east of Pueblo, and graduated in 1930 from Asbury College in
Wilmore, Ky., before earning his master's and his doctorate in
theology at Iliff. He was ordained a minister in 1932 and served
congregations in Colorado, Vermont and New York. Even after rising
to national prominence, he regarded himself as a pastor first.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as chief executive of the church's national missions, he
established the Methodist Urban Service Training program to prepare
clergy for the ministry in a changing urban climate. In 1970, he
was named executive director of a task force on the future of
humanity and the role of the churches, a project sponsored by the
National Council of Churches and Union Theological Seminary in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Carothers is survived by his wife of 70 years, Leta Hicks
Carothers; two daughters, Bettie Lee Thomas of Portland, Maine, and
Joan Marsan Murphine of Laguna Beach, Calif.; seven grandchildren,
and four great-grandchildren.

REAL ESTATE: LETTING SELLERS DO THE SELLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y., Pa.)   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, people who wanted to sell their homes had two
basic options: they could list their home with a broker _ and in
most cases pay a 6 percent commission _ or they could avoid a
commission by putting a ``For Sale by Owner'' sign on the front
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with the Internet available to anyone with a
computer and a telephone line, the options have increased. Real
estate brokers say that homeowners can now fine-tune the marketing
of their house _ and determine the commission they will ultimately
pay _ by actively participating in the selling process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide sellers with the opportunity to market their homes
at a fair price and on their own terms,'' said Glenn Cohen,
president of YourHomeDirect.com, a real estate brokerage company
based in West Long Branch, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen says that his company offers sellers throughout New Jersey
various levels of service for commissions that range from 2 to 3.9
percent. He said that since his company's sales agents were both
licensed real estate agents and registered loan officers in New
Jersey, they could provide whatever level of service a seller and a
buyer needed.
</P>
<P>
   With YourHomeDirect's ``Seller's Choice Package,'' he said, a
company sales agents visits the seller's home to get an idea of the
size, location and condition. The agent then conducts an analysis
of sales of similar homes in the area to give the seller an idea of
the appropriate price range.
</P>
<P>
   Once the price is set and the property is listed with
YourHomeDirect, the company then advertises in major newspapers,
and lists home on its Internet site (www.yhd.com) and many of the
larger real estate Web sites and provides the seller with a yard
sign.
</P>
<P>
   The agent who visits the home will also photograph it to create
a virtual tour that can be viewed on the Web site. The listing and
the sign will usually have the company telephone number _ rather
than the owner's _ and a code number to allow prospective
purchasers who have seen the listing or the lawn sign to take the
virtual tour of the home on their computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prequalify all buyers,'' Cohen said, adding that once it
had been determined that the potential buyer was both serious and
qualified, the sales agent contacted the seller to arrange for the
house to be shown. ``Then it's up to the sellers to decide whether
they want us to show the house or whether they feel comfortable
showing it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Any offers that are made, Cohen said, go through the sales
agent, who then negotiates on behalf of the seller. If a deal is
struck, he said, the agent does all the things a full-service
broker would do, including preparing the necessary paperwork,
arranging financing if necessary and scheduling the usual
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   If a seller shows the house himself, Cohen said, YourHomeDirect
charges a 2 percent commission. If the seller prefers having an
agent escort buyers through the home, he said, the commission is 3
percent. And since YourHomeDirect is a licensed real estate broker,
it can also submit listings to the local Multiple Listing Service,
making it likely that local brokers will bring their potential
buyers to the property. The fee for the ``MLS Plan'' is 3.9
percent, Cohen said, adding that of that amount a 2.5 percent
commission is paid to the selling broker, and YourHomeDirect keeps
the rest as the listing broker.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that while his company was now licensed only in New
Jersey, he expected to be licensed in New York and Pennsylvania by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that allows sellers to choose the services they
want from a real estate broker is Help-U-Sell, a nationwide
franchise company with East Coast headquarters on in Syosset, Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``My company is based upon the premise that sellers can save a
tremendous amount of money by simply doing some of the work of the
sale themselves,'' said Rick O'Neil, president of Help-U-Sell. The
company's Web site is www.helpusell.com.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil said that the commission charged by Help-U-Sell
franchisees _ a flat fee agreed on in advance between the company
and the seller _ usually ends up being anywhere from 2.1 percent to
2.8 percent of the sale price. For that, he said, sellers get their
house listed on the company's Web site, a yard sign, and whatever
hand-holding they need once an interested buyer shows up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically do everything a full-service broker would do,''
O'Neil said, ``except show the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet-based company that caters to sellers who would
rather not pay a full 6 percent commission is the Realty Exchange
Network in Ossining, N.Y. ``What we're doing is creating a portal
that will provide instant access to discount real estate brokers
across the country,'' said James Troia, president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Troia said the company recently entered into agreements with 23
large discount brokerage companies in which the companies
automatically posted all their listings on the Realty Exchange
Network's Web site, www.REXnetwork.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the wave of the future,'' Troia said.
</P>
<P>
   One place that wave is unlikely to hit with any real force,
however, is Manhattan. Frederick Peters, president of Ashforth
Warburg, a Manhattan full-service brokerage, said that while
discount brokers who have access to a local Multiple Listing
Service might be attractive to some sellers, they would most likely
have little success in Manhattan's co-op and condominium market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process that brokers have to go through here is much more
complicated than it is in the suburbs,'' Peters said. ``You really
do need an experienced broker who is able to screen buyers not only
for sellers and lenders, but for co-op boards as well.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that it was unlikely that a discount broker who did
not have an intimate understanding of the co-op and condominium
market would be able to provide the level of service needed to
usher such deals through to completion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, even sellers of luxury homes outside Manhattan
have grown used to having their brokers provide them with copious
amounts of personal service and attention. And it is unlikely,
Peters said, that such sellers would be willing to compromise on
the level of service they are accustomed to in exchange for paying
a lower commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of people who can drive a car who don't mind
paying to have a driver,'' he said. ``It's really a question of how
you can best use your time.''

(Eds: In 2nd graf ``SETI'' stands for the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence program) 
By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dan Majerle heard a whistle and looked at Hue Hollins
the way Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson once did, with incredulity
and rage. A foul? You called that a foul?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a reach-in foul 20 feet from the basket, contact with
Patrick Ewing that SETI might not have detected, with 2 seconds on
the shot clock and 13.6 seconds in overtime and the Knicks and
Heat, after 52 minutes and 46.4 seconds, still tied at the bargain
basement score of 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I really didn't hit him,'' Majerle would say
after fate had heard his case and adjudicated in his favor. ``And
that's a tough call to make with the game on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing missed a free throw. Anthony Carter made what may very
well have been an illegal shot from the Dolan family seating area
and no-trespassing zone. The 41 minutes to which Majerle had
sacrificed a couple more octogenarian years of jogging by the
beachfront were not lost in the final entanglement of angles and
issues, in Miami's 77-76 victory in Game 3 of the Eastern
Conference semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The box score couldn't tell us all we needed to know about
Majerle and Allan Houston, about an exhaustive perimeter dance most
reflective of a series that perhaps will not be decided by sheer
talent after all. The box score could only tell us that Houston had
come home with his best game, on 24 points on 9 of 18 from the
field. He had ignited an explosion of sound in Madison Square
Garden with a face up 3-pointer that gave the Knicks a 73-71
overtime lead and left an exasperated Majerle staring at his bench
and wondering how much more of Houston's release space he could
steal. ``I've been saying for a while now that he's my toughest
cover,'' Majerle would say. ``Once he gets his legs under him, he
can just go up and score from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lewis Majerle, born Sept. 9, 1965, in Traverse City,
Mich., has never been a great professional basketball player. Like
most of the very good contemporary white players, his reputation
has at times exceeded his game. At his very best in the early
1990s, in Phoenix, he was worth about 17 points, six rebounds and
three assists a game. They called him Thunder Dan. He could shoot
from way out and had a strong, purposeful stride. He relished a
defensive challenge and didn't back away from the matchup with
Michael Jordan in the 1993 NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thunder Dan, my behind,'' Jordan snapped when the series was
over and Majerle had measured a clear second to a true basketball
great.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle played basketball in those days the way Lenny Dykstra
played baseball, and he, too, paid for his abandon with injuries,
with a body sapped too soon of offensive skill. He left Phoenix,
unhappily, for Cleveland. He migrated south to Miami, just in time
for the start of the Knicks-Heat wars. He is 34 now, healthy again,
but with more clouds than thunder in his sinewy, 6-foot-6-inch
frame. On the final possessions of a long, draining night, Houston
became obscured in Majerle's defensive cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how the Knicks wanted the ball in the pure shooter's hands,
leading by 75-73, needing a basket to put Miami away, maybe once
and for all, after pushing into overtime on Ewing's clutch jumper.
Latrell Sprewell had given up his dribble out front. Houston tried
desperately to create a passing lane.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle would not give him room. The Knicks took a timeout, and
ultimately settled for a shot they didn't want, a missed Marcus
Camby drive.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning tied the score with a baseline jumper. Now here
came the Knicks, waiting for Houston to break free of Majerle,
again on the left side. And Majerle wouldn't let Houston get away,
wouldn't let him breathe. The shot clock ran down. Ewing turned the
ball over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Jack Ramsay, the former Portland coach and Miami
television analyst would say. ``How often do you see defense where
the guy can't even go out 20 feet from the basket and get the
ball?''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Brown knew why. ``When you come down to this point of your
career,'' he said, ``every game becomes the game of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   In career twilight, Majerle has become, more than any other
player, more so with each passing season, the embodiment of Pat
Riley's Heat. There is no champion in this team. In Majerle, there
is only the heart of one.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat has the Knicks good and scared going into Game 4
Sunday. Miami is an outfit patched together with sticks and glue,
with offensive alignments that could be a Regis question for $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the following Heat players is capable of scoring a
basket in a crucial half-court set? a)Otis Thorpe. b)Anthony
Carter. c)Bruce Bowen. d)Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumstances of his defensive attrition, Riley could
forgive Majerle's 1-for-6 shooting Friday. He did have a game-high
seven assists and six rebounds and, of course, the final answer for
Houston on defense. And Anthony Carter somehow found the basket,
negating the cheap call that put Ewing on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle wasn't tired, he said, but he was counting on ``being
exhausted'' by morning. If he were home, he would have played 18
holes after practice Saturday. He would instead spend the afternoon
and evening relaxing, eating right, getting ready for Houston in
Game 4, which is a game the Knicks, of course, are certain to win
because Miami and Majerle cannot keep this up.
</P>
<P>
   They can't, right?

   UNIVERSE _ WASHINGTON _ Astronomers have for several years

matter,'' which we can't see or perceive in any way other than in
the gravitational pull it exerts on ordinary matter. Now, to
explain the strange way distant galaxies appear to be racing away
from us at ever greater speeds, they have come up with the concept
of ``dark energy,'' something that seems to be acting in defiance
of the usual laws of gravity. Without it, these faraway objects
should be gradually slowing down from the momentum of the ``Big
Bang.'' Instead, they are flying away at speeds that now approach
the speed of light. Dark energy may be a kind of reverse gravity,
cosmologists think. (Nesmith, Cox News Service). WITH LOGO.

blown up under the tread of an armored Israeli bulldozer that was
making room for a new border post a few hundred yards away. Israel
plans to pull out of southern Lebanon soon, and the road work is
under way. They're clearing mines, building new roads and, near one
Arab village, taking land for a new post. Residents founded these
farms to stake out the border in the 1940s. Now, they will lose
their buffer of Israeli-occupied land. They will be on the edge
again and wonder if it will be safe to go out at night, to use
their roads and whether they will be on the frontline of a lasting

   NEW-PATHWAYS _ DUBLIN, Calif. _ ``If I wouldn't have came(cq) to
prison, I'd be be dead right now,'' said Eshelle Scott. At a
therapy session, part of a ground-breaking program aimed at helping
female inmates, Scott said she was trapped in an abusive
relationship with a man who introduced her to witchcraft and beat
her nearly every day. Depressed, she found comfort in drugs and
killing animals. Angry about a beating, she said, she once
decapitated her boyfriend's mother's cat and left it on the woman's
doorstep. Finally, she was convicted of burning churches and
sentenced to a 63-month term. At the Federal Correctional
Institution here, Scott participated in the inaugural class of New
Pathways, a pilot program aimed at addressing the special needs of
female inmates who have been physically or sexually abused. (Turay,

   COXNET FOCUS 0513: THE NEW URBANISM -- One of the key buzzwords

advocates do not want to force you out of your subdivision and into

asphalt-heavy sprawl or of poorly planned density? (Goldberg,

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is certain that the 127
people who have been executed in Texas during his tenure were all
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that every person that has been put to death in
Texas, under my watch, has been guilty of the crime charged, and
has had full access to the courts,'' Bush said on the NBC News
program ``Meet the Press'' in February.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Texas, which under Bush has executed more people
than any other state, some of the officials who administer the
death penalty, reviewing the case records, considering inmates'
appeals and weighing final pleas for clemency, are not so sanguine.
These officials, who support Bush's presidential candidacy and
believe in the death penalty, said in interviews that they believed
Texas ran the risk of executing an innocent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the death penalty and I don't want to do anything
that will cause George Bush to lose the election,'' said Paddy Lann
Burwell, a retired Exxon manager who was appointed by the governor
two years ago to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which
reviews all clemency requests in capital cases and makes
recommendations to the governor. Still, in an interview at his
cattle ranch outside Westhof, south of Austin, Burwell voiced
concerns about the fairness of the state's judicial system,
particularly several cases in which he said prosecutors seemed more
concerned with scoring victories, in the form of capital
convictions, than with justice.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Burwell said, he thinks the system is conscientiously
administered. ``But I worry that we may execute an innocent
person,'' he said. ``Any person would know that is a possibility. I
think our system needs to be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the board, Tom Moss, a retired federal parole
officer, talked about his vote for clemency for Troy Farris, who
was executed for killing a police officer. The Farris case, Moss
said, was one of two cases in which he ``saw something that may
have indicated that they were innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Tauss, who has studied law, is also on the board. She
said she ``cried all day'' after Texas executed Farris. ``I wasn't
sure he should have been given the death penalty,'' she said.
``That's why I voted to commute.'' A majority of the 18-member
board would have to have voted for clemency in order to make a
recommendation of it to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Baird, a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
until 1998, was in Washington this week to announce the formation
of a national committee to prevent wrongful executions. Asked
whether he agreed with Bush that no one had been wrongfully
executed under his watch, Baird said: ``Everyone in Texas hopes and
prays that that's the case. I do not share his view.'' For such
certainty to exist, he added, ``You have to take the position that
this very fallible system has worked flawlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, along with other law enforcement officials and death
penalty lawyers, agrees that some of the conditions that have
created doubt elsewhere and have sent innocent people to death row
in other states _ especially bad lawyers, a lack of resources for
lawyers to mount a vigorous defense, and overzealous prosecutors _
exist in abundance in Texas. The state also has endemic problems,
including elected judges who are under political pressure to mete
out the death penalty and a speeded-up appeals process with an
unusually low reversal rate, which trouble some officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
   A System's Built-in Risks
</P>
<P>
   No one can point with certainty to a case in which an innocent
person has been executed here since Texas reinstated the death
penalty in 1976. Death penalty lawyers say it is almost impossible
to prove a dead man was innocent; once a person is executed,
crucial evidence that might prove innocence disappears and lawyers
and investigators want to put their resources into trying to save
clients who are still on death row.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look by The New York Times at a half dozen
executions carried out during Bush's tenure _ including interviews
with jurors, prosecutors, judges, witnesses and co-defendants still
on death row _ makes clear that a legal and judicial system rife
with these conditions creates, at the very least, the risk of an
innocent person being sent to death row. Although most of the
officials interviewed said they believed that the executed men were
guilty, they questioned aspects of the legal system that sent them
to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country there have been 87 exonerations in the last
27 years, more than a third of them in the last seven years. These
cases have prompted a growing national concern over executions. In
January, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who supports
the death penalty, announced a moratorium on executions while a
thorough review is conducted of the state's criminal justice
system. Ryan, who is Bush's state campaign chairman, described his
state's system, where 13 death row inmates have been exonerated
since 1987, 11 of them since 1994, as ``fraught with error.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven death row inmates were exonerated in Texas from 1983 to
1997 after evidence of witnesses who had lied, mistaken
eyewitnesses and prosecutorial misconduct led to the discovery of
their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, 13 states have had bills pending that would
have halted executions. Asked on ``Meet the Press'' if he would
consider following the lead of Ryan, Bush said he would not. Asked
why he thought Ryan had taken the action, Bush answered: ``Maybe
they've had some problems in their courts. Maybe they've had some
faulty judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined an interview request for this article. His top
criminal justice policy adviser, Johnny Sutton, answered questions
about Bush's criminal justice record and some specific capital
cases in a lengthy telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the harsh reality of the death penalty
and we take that responsibility very seriously,'' said Sutton, a
former prosecutor. ``This is probably the most important thing we
do in state government. The governor takes it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite glaring examples of bad lawyering at the trial level in
Texas, including at least three widely publicized cases of lawyers
who have slept through the proceedings, the state appeals court has
reversed only eight death penalty cases in the last five years,
while affirming the convictions and death sentences in 256 cases,
according to court statistics. This is the lowest reversal rate in
capital cases in the country. In contrast, Florida, which ranks
behind Texas with the nation's third-highest death row population,
has a 50 percent reversal rate. Illinois' rate is nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Farris case, the one that caused Tauss of the parole
commission to break down into tears, the Court of Criminal Appeals
said there was no forensic evidence to link Farris to the crime or
to support the testimony of the two key witnesses against him. But
the appeals court upheld the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an unusual move, seven members of the state parole
board voted for clemency, but 10 opposed it and one abstained.
Farris was executed in January 1999. During Bush's tenure, the
parole board has granted clemency to only one death row inmate,
according to the board's statistics; as of the end of April, it had
rejected 68 clemency petitions.

<P>
   Texas Leads in Executions
</P>
<P>
   Since George W. Bush took office in 1995, Texas has put to death
more than twice as many people as the next state, Virginia, with
52, and more than all the executions put together in the next four
states _ Missouri with 31, Oklahoma with 21, South Carolina with 20
and Arizona with 18. Texas has 12 executions scheduled for May and
June. The state has 462 people on death row, second only to
California, with 561 death row inmates (California, in contrast,
has executed eight people). Ann W. Richards, the liberal Democratic
governor who preceded Bush, presided over the executions of a
then-record 50 death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike juries in many states, those in Texas do not have the
option of life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been praised by victims' rights groups. ``The families
of victims want resolution,'' said Dianne Clements, the president
of one group in Houston, Justice for All. Her 13-year-old son
Zachary was killed nine years ago in an accidental shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer number of executions in Texas, a fiercely
pro-death-penalty state, has attracted criticism. The cases of two
Texas death row inmates, David Spence and Odell Barnes, drew
considerable national attention around the time of their executions
(Spence was sent to his death in 1997, Barnes two months ago).
Questions about their innocence were raised by their lawyers and
news organizations. In the Spence case, one of the state's
investigators expressed doubt after the trial about Spence's
involvement in the murder for which he was convicted. In the Barnes
case, there were questions about forensic evidence. There were
accusations of police misconduct in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases examined by The New York Times also raise lingering
questions of possible innocence. More broadly, the cases expose
systemic failings in the administration of the death penalty in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One of those failings is a pattern of overzealous prosecution.
In the case of James Lee Beathard, for example, who was executed in
1999, the prosecutor, in a subsequent trial, branded the chief
witness against Beathard a liar and offered a different version of
who committed the murders.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of legal resources available to murder defendants in
Texas may have sealed the fate of David Castillo, an impoverished
high school dropout, who was convicted of murdering a liquor store
owner. Castillo's defense was hampered by the court's refusal to
give him an additional $600 for an investigator, and his
court-appointed lawyers failed to prepare character witnesses who
might have persuaded the jury to spare his life. He was executed in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush vetoed a modest indigent defense bill that its
backers said would have improved the quality of representation in
criminal cases. It would have given counties the authority to set
up public defender offices, which only a handful now have, and
curbed the power of judges to appoint their friends and campaign
contributors to represent indigents. For a small-town practitioner,
these appointments can be a lucrative source of income; to remain
in the good graces of the judges who dole them out, some lawyers
feel bound to move cases quickly. The bill would also have required
that a lawyer be appointed within 20 days after a person is
arraigned. There is no limit now.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his veto at the time, Bush said, among other things,
that the bill would not improve legal counsel for the poor. Asked
about the bill on ``Meet the Press,'' Bush said he could not
remember it, though he insisted that he was ``for public
defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas also puts a premium on the speed of its executions, aided
by an appeals court that rarely overturns capital cases and a
clemency board that has voted only once to stop an execution.
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on speed hurt Jerry Lee Hogue. Although there was
strong evidence, including two eyewitnesses, that he had committed
the arson-murder for which he was convicted, on the eve of his
scheduled execution nearly 20 years later a law enforcement
official had gnawing doubts. The official, Joseph Stewart, an arson
investigator in Wichita Falls, arrested a man for a different arson
who it turned out had been at the arson for which Hogue had been
convicted. The arsons seemed disturbingly similar, Stewart said in
an interview, and he called Bush's office several times, pleading
for a reprieve of 30 days in order to pursue the new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a defense lawyer, I'm a Texas peace officer,'' said
Stewart, a death penalty supporter who has voted for Bush and has
been in law enforcement since he was 21. For this reason he thought
Bush would listen to him. He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said that the governor had rejected Stewart's entreaties
because ``the jury decision was right.'' The execution of Hogue on
March 11, 1998, left Stewart with grave doubts about how the death
penalty is administered. ``Being in law enforcement, I am not
against the death penalty,'' he said in an interview in the county
building in tiny Crowell. ``I had always assumed there was a good
set of checks and balances. I was pretty disillusioned afterward.''
</P>

<P>
   A Blow to Death Row Inmates
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the state has appointed all death row inmates'
lawyers for post-conviction review. But the Court of Criminal
Appeals controls the list of those lawyers, and many highly
qualified death penalty lawyers are not on it. There are numerous
instances of court-appointed lawyers missing crucial deadlines and
filing habeas petitions that raise few if any legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Baird, who served on the appeals court from 1989 to 1998 and
reviewed hundreds of death penalty cases, said, ``Even in cases
where the lawyers did care and worked hard to represent their
clients, they were not given the resources necessary to make that
representation effective.'' Baird, a Democrat, was defeated in his
bid for re-election to the court and is now teaching law.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, death row inmates in Texas had access to a federally
financed resource center, whose lawyers handled post-conviction
appeals, helped pro bono firms with those appeals, and monitored
all death cases in the system to make sure that everyone had a
lawyer. The Texas resource center, which helped several death row
inmates gain exoneration, closed after Congress eliminated its
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Semel, who directs the American Bar Association's
Death Penalty Representation Project, finances two lawyers for the
nonprofit Texas Defender Service, but she said that her effort
cannot begin to make up for the loss of the resource center.
</P>
<P>
   Other states provide considerable resources to death row inmates
seeking to prove their innocence. Most states, for example, have
post-conviction offices. Illinois put state money into a
post-conviction office after its federal resource center closed.
Illinois also has a tradition of private law firms working pro bono
on capital cases. In addition, a journalism class at Northwestern
University specializes in investigating the innocence claims of
death row inmates. With this system in place, evidence has been
uncovered that has led to the exonerations of 13 death row inmates
in Illinois since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Parole Board Criticized
</P>
<P>
   The Texas pardons and paroles board, another institution that is
supposed to safeguard against the execution of the innocent, has
been criticized for meeting in private, voting by fax and not being
required to give reasons for decisions. The board members are
appointed by the governor to six-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on a lawsuit filed by death row inmates in December 1988,
Judge Sam Sparks of the U.S. District Court in Austin called the
board's procedures ``appalling,'' and held that they barely met the
minimal procedural safeguards required by the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board would not have to sacrifice its conservative
ideology to carry out its duties in a more fair and accurate
fashion,'' the judge ruled. The judge said it was up to the Texas
Legislature to make any changes. Bush said he saw no need for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the rate of clemency is so low, lawyers may not
always put their full energies into applying for it, said a former
lawyer in the governor's general counsel office from 1989 to 1998,
Jim Sallans, who reviewed hundreds of clemency petitions in capital
cases. He said he ``supports the way Governor Bush handles clemency
in capital cases,'' and he said he had no doubt that all those
executed under the governor were guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But he faulted the preparation of many clemency petitions and
the quality of legal representation for some death row inmates
making their final pleas for mercy. ``Too many clemency petitions
were hastily prepared, and poorly written,'' Sallans said. ``The
attorneys would often call up and ask us for a response, and we
would politely tell them that we were doing our best with what
little they had submitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has never witnessed an execution, weighs all clemency
petitions, as well as all other cases set for execution, sometimes
several days, or more, before an execution, sometimes the morning
of the lethal injection. His powers to act are limited by the
recommendations of the parole board, except that he may grant a
30-day reprieve on his own. He has never done so.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, unlike many other states, there is no office in Texas
that systematically tracks the cases of the nearly 500 condemned
inmates. As the pace of executions quickens, with 20 scheduled to
die over the next four months, the handful of death penalty lawyers
struggle to keep abreast of as many cases as possible.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Maurie Levin, who runs a one-person branch of the
Texas Defender Service in Austin that handles death penalty
appeals, with financing from the American Bar Association's Death
Penalty Representation Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters keep calling, asking, ``Got an innocence case?'''
Levin said the other day. She threw up her hands in frustration.
``How would we know?''

 MCCULLERS' HOME NURTURES NEW GENERATION OF AUTHORS AND WRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating to remove photo note) 
By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH NYACK, N.Y. _ Houses tell the stories of people who have
loved and suffered there, done their work and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   But few houses tell them as eloquently and insistently as the
white Victorian, with the gauzy curtains at the windows, shutters a
bit askew and tall hedges out front, where Carson McCullers,
literary prodigy and tortured invalid, lived for nearly half her 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   With McCullers' death in 1967, of a brain hemorrhage, the house
might have been turned into a museum, like Edward Hopper's
childhood home down the street. Instead, it lives on as an artists'
colony, a miniature Yaddo, which reverberates with the spirit of
its longtime owner.
</P>
<P>
   Its five apartments are home to a performance artist, a
sculptor, an essayist and two poets, who know they are keepers of
the flame. In fact, two of them, Constance DeJong, a performance
artist, and Jeanne Atkin, a sculptor, have explicitly honored
McCullers' memory by collaborating on an art exhibit, which opened
on May 6 at the Hopper Art Center here.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to subdivide McCullers' house into apartments _
work that her friend Tennessee Williams paid for _ was made while
the author was still alive but struggling with extraordinary
medical bills from a rheumatic heart, a series of crippling
strokes, cancer, cardiac failure and repeated onslaughts of
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to continue renting the apartments after her
death, first to ordinary tenants and eventually to artists and
writers, was made by Dr. Mary Mercer, who was McCullers'
psychiatrist at a critical time in her stormy life and gradually
became her protector and closest friend. Theirs was an improbable
bond, breaking all the rules of psychotherapy, but one both women
described as the most significant and loving of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, who is nearing her 90th birthday, bought 131 South
Broadway from the McCullers estate in 1968 lest she walk by one day
and ``discover the hedges cut down and the house painted purple.''
To her, it is a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care more about the house than the tenants,'' she said,
without apology, during an interview at her own Nyack home, on a
bluff overlooking the Tappan Zee Bridge. It is in the
psychiatrist's house that McCullers, after a lengthy writer's
block, wrote her final novel, ``Clock Without Hands,'' published in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   At 131 South Broadway, a sketch of the author, with elfin face
and haunted eyes, hangs in the foyer. A plaque outside quotes the
most famous McCullers line, ``They are the we of me,'' from
``Member of the Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden, which slopes east toward the Hudson River, was
planted this spring with viburnum, mountain laurel and 15 varieties
of hostas and opened to literary pilgrims, who come here to visit
the author's grave at Oak Hill Cemetery, also the resting place of
Helen Hayes and Ben Hecht.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer refers to the tenants as ``Carson's guests.'' That is
both an inspiration and a burden for DeJong and Atkin, the two
full-time artists in the house, as well as for Sandrea DeMinco, a
college librarian who writes essays; Carol Gannet, a social worker
and poet; and Kevin Quinn, a teacher who also writes poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Winning an apartment at 131 South Broadway, a choice location in
a Rockland County village that has recently added Rosie O'Donnell
and Jonathan Demme to its roster of celebrity residents, requires a
series of challenging interviews with Mercer. She is a
larger-than-life character in her own right, who quotes Sophocles
and Goethe in ordinary conversation and is rarely seen without her
signature strand of pearls.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews are not a formal test, but prospective renters
are queried on which works of McCullers they have read and what
they know about the author, whom Mercer and the tenants always
refer to as Carson, as if there could be only one person who
answered to that name.
</P>
<P>
   DeJong, 52, was the first artist in residence, here for 10 years
and more cynical than the rest about the aura of the house. She
recalled a newspaper interview around the time she moved here,
related to a theater piece she had just completed. DeJong was
afraid that the interviewer would focus on McCullers' work and not
her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to be hijacked by the mystery, the mythology,''
DeJong said. Still, she said, ``I had read everything'' long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women do read her at a certain age,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMinco, 51, came next, seven years ago, having read ``The
Ballad of the Sad Cafe'' during her ``sojourner summer between high
school and college.'' Reverently, she has since worked her way
through the complete McCullers oeuvre, including film adaptations,
biographies and Web sites devoted to her work.
</P>
<P>
   DeMinco has produced three essays since moving here. They are
her first published works. ``I believe her spirit permeates
everything,'' DeMinco wrote in Tea for One, a local literary
journal. ``And if I'm very, very conscientious and respectful, it
will visit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came Atkin, 40, who moved in half a dozen years ago. Her
first exposure to McCullers was a movie version of ``The Member of
the Wedding,'' which she watched on television the night she moved
into her first apartment, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan,
poised at the tender age of 18 to cast herself as a bohemian.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin was working at a bookstore and bought all the McCullers
books using her employee discount. More recently, at the Nyack
Public Library, she has seen photographs of Marilyn Monroe,
Tennessee Williams and Isak Dinesen, all friends of the author, in
what is now her living room.
</P>
<P>
   The tenants understand that their ``hostess'' was a prodigy who
published ``The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter'' at 23, a hopeless
romantic who twice married the same alcoholic man, a woman whose
bisexuality was an open secret and who worked and lived hard,
despite illnesses worthy of Job.
</P>
<P>
   ``She throbbed,'' said Atkin, who lives in the spacious
ground-floor apartment with the screened sleeping porch, where
McCullers spent her last few years, mostly bedridden. It was here
that the frail author, wrapped in a Persian dressing gown, dictated
her unfinished autobiography, ``Illumination and Night Glare,''
which was published last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DeJong, who describes herself as ``a person of language,'' makes
her home in the attic apartment, tucked beneath the slate-covered
mansard roof, where McCullers lived briefly with her husband,
Reeves, during their second try at marriage. Later he would kill
himself in Paris, after she refused a joint suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Biographers credit Mercer with keeping McCullers alive for an
extra 10 years by managing her medical care and looking after her
psyche. They were heady times for the psychiatrist, who traveled
with McCullers and met her famous friends. Mercer still speaks of
her in the present tense and shows a visitor the author's
silver-topped cane.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer wants the tenants to identify with McCullers' passionate,
heedless nature. When DeMinco first looked at her apartment, she
worried that the 3-by-4-foot kitchen would be inadequate for
someone who loved to cook and owned 100 cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercer said, ``Let your work feed you,'' DeMinco recalled.
She also noted that the apartment had no closet, just three pegs
for garments. ``Don't worry about the tangibles,'' Mercer said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMinco got rid of three-quarters of her cookbooks. She had a
cherry-wood cabinet built for her clothes. Mercer reviews her
unpublished manuscripts. From a cozy window seat, facing the river,
she looks out on blossoming dogwood, cherry and magnolia trees, the
last a gift to McCullers from the artist Henry Varnum Poor. DeMinco
swoons at her good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin has the hardest time escaping the ghosts because she lives
in The Apartment, as her housemates call it. When she moved in, 27
years after McCullers' death, the curling wallpaper was unchanged.
When Mercer called her ``Carson's guest,'' she knew the landlady
spoke from love and memory and meant no harm. Still, she did not
want to feel like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin made her own imprint with the candlesticks, menorahs,
napkin rings and hair sticks that she designs in pewter and
aluminum, several for sale in the Museum of Modern Art catalog. Her
dog, Delilah, romps through the sunny space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love her as a writer,'' Atkin said. ``But I also have my
own life, in my own house.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment that McCullers, a transplanted Southerner,
might well have shared. She moved here with her mother in 1945,
after her father's death, and never looked back. ``I was always
homesick for a place I had never seen, and now I have found it,''
she wrote. ``It is here, this house, this town.''

REAL ESTATE: COMBINING A DATA CENTER WITH A `TELCO' HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEONIA, N.J. _ A deceptively bland-looking building in this
Bergen County suburb about 35 minutes from New York could become
one of the engine rooms of the Internet if the plans of its
operators are realized.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most visible part of the Internet is the
fast-growing companies with clever names and oscillating stock
prices. And perhaps the least visible can be found behind locked
and well-guarded doors.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world of the electronics boxes and powerful
computers, known as ``big iron,'' that house the information
available on the Net and provide two-way access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Infocrossing Inc. say they are combining operations
of traditional data centers, which house and service computers for
client companies, with the telecommunications hotels that have
sprung up because competing companies find it convenient to be
physically near one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the Internet sits,'' Joseph Germanotta, the
president of Infocrossing, said during a recent open house in
Leonia, just across the George Washington Bridge from New York.
``Here is where the servers, the routers and the switches are.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the interior of the building, much of it still vacant,
has wire cages filled with electronic equipment, and a control room
to monitor operations and fix problems as they arise. The Internet
data center occupies 15,000 of the 30,000 square feet the company
has leased in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Like the so-called ``telco hotels'' that have developed in New
York, notably at 111 Eighth Ave. and 75 Broad St., Infocrossing
offers clients multiple choices of carriers and elaborate
assurances that operations will be sustained on a 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week basis.
</P>
<P>
   Data centers are similar to telecommunications companies from a
real estate standpoint, said Paul Pariser, one of the principals in
Taconic Partners, the owner of 111 Eighth Ave.
</P>
<P>
   They require raised floors capable of bearing heavy loads and
lots of electrical power and cooling capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But he said some tired old industrial buildings, particularly in
other cities, are being marketed as telecommunications headquarters
despite their limitations. ``You see derelict buildings in
neglected areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William G. Cohen, an executive vice president of Newmark &AMP;
Company Real Estate, who is marketing 75 Broad St., said the
building is nearly full, largely with telecommunications companies.
He said some of the companies there are adding data-center
operations to their telecommunications businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonia building is equipped with auxiliary generators and
batteries to keep equipment running in case of a power failure or
brownout.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a ``meet me'' room in the building where customers
can connect to a number of carriers, including Bell Atlantic, MCI
Worldcom, Level 3, Teligent and Winstar.
</P>
<P>
   Having multiple carriers, with high-capacity fiber lines on
premises, means that carriers will have to compete with one another
for the business of the dot-coms and other Internet companies that
have their equipment in individual cages in the building, said John
Stewart, Infocrossing's senior vice president for real estate.
</P>
<P>
   And having the multiple carriers allows the company to build
redundancy into the communications system, which is an important
feature for companies that are literally out of business if
communications equipment fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Bell Atlantic line is cut, we can transfer them to Level
3 to minimize the time of outage,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Germanotta said, ``We have multiple on-ramps to the
information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the extensive telecommunications connections in the
building means that a tenant company can increase its capacity
quickly if its business takes off. ``We can provide the equivalent
of one telephone line to thousands of telephones lines,'' Stewart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Lonstein, the chairman of Infocrossing, which was formerly
named Computer Outsourcing Services Inc., said the company plans to
build a network of 20 Internet data centers like the one here to
participate in the growth of online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is publicly traded on Nasdaq, recently
received an investment of $60 million from an affiliate of Deutsche
Bank and from Sandler Capital Management, which specializes in
communications investments, to build the network of centers.
</P>
<P>
   The service the company offers is to take over what amounts to
Internet companies' technological back offices and to keep the
systems up and running, allowing the clients to concentrate on
building their businesses. Infocrossing gets paid for the use of
its space and services, but Infocrossing and concerns like it
contend that grouping the equipment of many companies in one place
and sharing services lower costs for the individual Internet
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It cites a study by Sun Trust Equitable Securities Research,
which found that a simple Web site would cost $42,500 to set up and
$12,400 a month to operate if an Internet company did it alone.
</P>
<P>
   But since a service center already has battery backup, fire
walls to protect data from outside intrusion and technical support
in place, the study said that using a service center would spread
start-up costs across many clients and would reduce the monthly
costs to $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to telecommunications capacity and technical
competence, there is a lot of emphasis at Infocrossing's building
on physical security. Guards are stationed at the entrances around
the clock and they escort visitors to their destinations. The
windows are even covered by metal-mesh screens.
</P>
<P>
   Security is important, particularly for companies that handle
sensitive personal financial information, said Mark Zona, the chief
technical officer for Market Technologies Corp. of Wilton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Market Technologies, which handles credit screenings on
individuals for insurance companies and other financial
institutions, has six very large computers known as servers at
Infocrossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to be able to pass an audit by credit bureaus,'' Zona
said. ``Our business hinged on passing that audit, because
otherwise they would not give us data.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the biggest concern for people in his line of work is
the potential for identity theft: The thief learns enough about
somebody else to pose as that person and run up debts under the
assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   Physical security is important, of course. ``Data is data,'' he
said. ``If someone could pick up the tapes from a drive, they could
take thousands of identities.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic security is also important. Zona said that executives
at Infocrossing arranged for a secure telecommunications link
between the machines in New Jersey and Market Technologies' home
office in Connecticut to keep anyone else from gaining access to
the company's data.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, Infocrossing's vice president for real estate, said the
company decided to open its first Internet center in Leonia because
it was the corporate headquarters, even though Leonia is not close
to the main fiber corridors in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an `out of the box' location,'' he said. ``We had to
make a commitment to the fiber providers to bring fiber to this
site.'' He said it cost the telecommunications companies $250 to
$300 a foot to install high-capacity fiber lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other cities we are going to look for buildings that are
located along fiber routes,'' he said.

NFL AND ASSISTANT COACHES AT ODDS
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service      
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFL could soon face one of its most difficult challenges, as
an association made up of dozens of head coaches and hundreds of
assistants is preparing to file a lawsuit against the league early
next month seeking improved working conditions and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   While there remains a solid chance the situation could soon be
settled without court action, several owners and members of the
association believe a legal battle may be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, assistant coaches have been fighting for
better benefits packages and an earlier retirement age. And while
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has been open-minded about the demands
of the assistant coaches, ownership has been reluctant, and the
slow pace of negotiations for an agreement has irked the assistant
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, members of the NFL Coaches Association, which
represents 18 head coaches and more than 400 assistant coaches,
said they recently informed the league that unless an agreement is
reached by the beginning of next month, the association would file
a lawsuit seeking improved retirement and benefit packages. The
suit might also allege age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL maintains that it knows nothing of a possible lawsuit
and is hopeful an agreement can be reached with the association.
The issue will be revisited at the owners' meetings later this
month in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches suing owners _ their employers _ would lead to a rather
uncomfortable if not bitter situation. Action on the field would be
unaffected, but it would be impossible for the chemistry among
ownership, management and coaches not to be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the coaches association say they have been all but
forced to consider taking legal action, because ownership has
reacted slowly to their concerns. It is true, however, that the NFL
and the association have had amicable discussions, and the league
respects Larry Kennan, the association's executive director. And,
in fact, some progress has been made on several of the more minor
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But on the larger differences there remains a considerable gap.
The association began as a way to address the concerns of assistant
coaches, a group that does not have the same financial certainties
as head coaches, who make more money and have long-term, guaranteed
contracts. Kennan, a former longtime assistant coach who used to be
the offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots, was the
catalyst who turned the organization from a squabbling group into a
powerful, unified force.
</P>
<P>
   The association says that assistants are fired, on average,
every one to three years, and fewer than 7 percent of the coaches
in the league are age 60 or older. Since benefits begin at 65, most
never see their full retirement package. The association wants a
system in which a coach can collect benefits when his age and years
of service add up to 75.
</P>
<P>
   The association also wants to establish health insurance for
retired coaches and working contracts to run through March, as
opposed to February, when they usually expire. Why? The association
says that when assistant coaches are fired, it usually occurs in
mid-January, immediately following the season, and most contracts
end in February, so the fired assistants basically get a two-week
paycheck. That money must last until another job opens up, which
could be months away. The association wants its members to have a
larger cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are also asking that independent arbitrators, as
opposed to the league, settle contract disputes. They also want a
$250,000 life insurance policy to carry over into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the association maintain that making the changes
they want would cost around $250,000 a team, about the same price
to sign a low-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coaches are certainly not crying that they are
destitute. They know they make good money, even if their salaries
have not risen in proportion to the athletes they coach. In 1982,
the average player earned $150,000 a year, while the average coach
made $50,000, a 3-to-1 ratio. Now the average player earns about a
million dollars a season, to the $130,000 a year for the average
coach, which is an 8-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Drew Bledsoe recently filmed an
instructional football video, the proceeds of which would help
former assistants facing financial difficulty and not eligible for
pension and medical benefits. It seems remarkable in this age of
skyrocketing franchise values and $10 million players that former
coaches would need assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem for owners, several said last week, was that if
they give the assistant coaches what they wanted, then the trainers
might be next in line, or the office secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   But few in football _ not even the players _ put the sort of
hours into the job that assistant coaches do. Their work ethic
places them in a special class. Most owners realize and appreciate
this fact. The association hopes that the few owners who do not,
soon will.

 THE BEST OF THE '90s; HOW MUCH FOR FISHER?; MONITORING FREE
AGENCYBy MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame Board of Selectors has been asked by the NFL to
pick the team of the 1990s. So far, about one-third of the votes
are in and there are only a handful of unanimous choices. They are:
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver, Cris Carter and Jerry Rice; guard, Bruce
Matthews; running back, Barry Sanders; defensive end, Bruce Smith
and Reggie White; defensive tackle, John Randle; linebacker, Junior
Seau; cornerback, Deion Sanders; and safety, LeRoy Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Other voting leaders by position include quarterback Brett
Favre, tight end Shannon Sharpe, offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman,
center Dermontti Dawson, kickers Morten Andersen and Gary Anderson,
punt returner Deion Sanders and kick returner Michael Bates.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching leaders are Marv Levy, Bill Parcells and Mike
Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   How Much for Fisher?
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest blunders of the off-season is happening in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fisher, one of the game's brightest head coaches, has a
year left on a contract that will pay him $1 million a season. That
is a lot of money, but by NFL standards, for the coach of the
defending AFC champions, it is the equivalent of earning minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had been in negotiations with the Titans' owner, Bud
Adams, looking for a new contract that would pay him about $2
million to $2.5 million a year, a fair amount, but those talks
recently broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher wants a new deal from Adams before the coach leaves for
vacation in June, or he will not talk contract until after this
season. Waiting that long would be a disaster for the Titans, who
would have to sign him for even more as a free agent or risk losing
him.
</P>
<P>
   There is one man who is probably watching the situation closely,
and hoping Tennessee blows it with Fisher. His name is Charley
Casserly, general manager of the Houston franchise, which does not
play until 2002. Casserly would love to swoop in and steal Fisher
from the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the Titans will work something out with Fisher
before his deadline. If not, and if Fisher does end up leaving, it
will be Tennessee's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring Free Agency
</P>
<P>
   While, in some instances, free agency may be hurting some teams
in the game _ see Keyshawn Johnson leaving the Jets for Tampa Bay _
it may not be hurting the sport as much as many think. Free agency
started on March 2, and so far 105 unrestricted and restricted
players have changed teams, which is only about three players a
team. ... Denver continues to monitor the Steve Young situation in
San Francisco. If the 49ers release him, the Broncos will very
likely try to gobble him up. Meanwhile, running back Terrell Davis
has looked great in spring workouts as he attempts his comeback
from reconstructive knee surgery.

REAL ESTATE: PUTTING `THAT GREAT STREET' BACK INTO STATE STREET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Mich., N.Y.)  By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After 20 years of on-again off-again urban renewal
efforts, State Street, which was for generations Chicago's premier
retail area, appears ready to reclaim its heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the JMB Realty Corp. unveiled plans for a new $251
million mixed-use project on a square block across from Marshall
Field's, the department store. The project will include a
five-story retail mall anchored by a Lord &AMP; Taylor department
store, a 34-story tower containing condominiums and a Marriott
Suites Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which is to break ground by the end of the year and
is expected to be finished in stages starting in 2002, is the
climax of what has already been an extraordinary year on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Directly across Randolph Street from JMB Realty's project, a new
theater and dormitory complex for the School of the Art Institute
is nearing completion. It includes a 17-story tower as well as a
renovated former office building that will have 34,000 square feet
of retail space.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks to the south, Sears, Roebuck and Co., which has
been absent from State Street for 17 years, is preparing to open a
large new store on the first five floors of a recently renovated
office building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a number of national chains and local retailers _
including Kinko's, Radio Shack, Potbelly Sandwich Works and Nuts on
Clark, a candy and nut shop _ have recently signed leases in other
buildings on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at State in four years,'' said Tyrone Tabing, an
assistant planning commissioner and the point man for the
redevelopment of the street, ``it will be a dramatically different
street than it is today. And it's dramatically different now than
it was four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be an understatement. In the early '90s, State Street
``was being kept alive on a ventilator,'' said Bruce Kaplan, the
president of the Northern Realty Group Ltd., a large real estate
company in the Loop. ``It was in horrendous condition,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After a century-long run as the most prominent retail district
in Chicago, if not the Midwest, State Street went into a decline in
the '70s and '80s. That decline was brought on by the rise of
suburban shopping and the simultaneous development of nearby North
Michigan Avenue as the new retailer to the carriage trade.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing significantly to State Street's decline was the
urban renewal project in 1979 that closed the street to vehicles
and turned it into an enormous _ and usually deserted _ pedestrian
mall.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '80s, State Street, which had boasted seven major
department stores a decade earlier, was down to two: Marshall
Field's and Carson Pirie Scott. What little specialty retailing
that remained was increasingly of the fast-food and adult-bookstore
variety.
</P>
<P>
   There matters stood until the early '90s, when two things
happened. The first was a housing boom, which resulted in some
12,000 new apartments in and around the Loop. The second was the
city's willingness to jump-start the redevelopment process on State
Street. It approved $44 million in incentive grants to 10
developers, and in 1996, a $25 million streetscape improvement
project that reopened State Street to auto traffic, spruced it up
with numerous planters and added lampposts and subway entrances
with a turn-of-the-century look.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been striking. Statistics complied by the
Northern Realty Group show that annual rents for retail space on
State Street have doubled in the last five years, to $52 a square
foot, while the vacancy rate is just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The street now has 2.5 million square feet of retail space; 1.6
million of that is accounted for by Marshall Field's and Carson
Pirie Scott. In addition, another 750,000 square feet is under
construction or on the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail is driving the street, and it's driving it harder every
week,'' said J. Paul Beitler, the chairman of Douglas
Elliman-Beitler, the developer of the Sears project. Beitler is
also the developer, along with the Prime Group, of Dearborn Center,
a new 1.8 million-square-foot, 37-story office building under way
at the corner of State and Adams Streets, which will have 100,000
square feet of retail space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loop is becoming a 24/7 living environment, and people
need somewhere to shop,'' Beitler said. ``State has become a
community center. The whole emphasis is on providing the kinds of
goods and services that you find in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sears project is often mentioned by developers and real
estate brokers as an example of what State Street will be like in
the future. Sears opened its first store on State Street in 1932,
at the corner of State and Van Buren Streets. The building still
exists, but it is now occupied by Robert Morris College, a business
school. The new Sears store, scheduled to open next spring, is four
blocks farther north, at the corner of State and Madison Streets
and diagonally across State Street from Carson Pirie Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think State Street customers tend to be a little more
mainstream and mass America than those on Michigan Avenue,'' said
Milton Mooney, the senior vice president for Sears stores in the
north-central region. ``We're going to merchandise the space in a
way that will play to the strengths of that market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The store, which is costing about $30 million, will have 250,000
square feet of space, about twice as much as an average new Sears
store, Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   The just-announced Lord &AMP; Taylor project is also being described
as one that will harmonize with the newly residential character of
the Loop. The project brings to a close a troubled chapter in the
street's redevelopment. JMB has owned the site for over a decade,
and it has been vacant _ except for a Commonwealth Edison
substation and an ice-skating rink in the winter months _ for
nearly that long.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bluhm, the chairman of JMB, said that the collapse of the
real estate market in the early '90s led to the cancellation of an
office project planned for the site. Several other projects also
came and went. ``Then the city decided it wanted more retail to
energize State, so our project changed to reflect that,'' Bluhm
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new project, which is being designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox
Associates, the New York architectural firm, has a distinctly
modern look, a departure on a street where most of the buildings
date from the 1920s and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The new building nearing completion as part of the School of the
Art Institute project across Randolph Street is an echo of the
architect Daniel Burnham's historic Reliance Building, now called
the Hotel Burnham, a block south at the corner of State and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Institute's architect, Larry Booth of Booth Hansen &AMP;
Associates in Chicago, said he very much had turn-of-the-century
Chicago architecture in mind when he designed the project. ``I feel
like Louis Sullivan and Daniel Burnham and John Root are old pals
of mine,'' Booth said, ``and this was my chance to join the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, which is costing about $55 million, will have
34,000 square feet of retail space, 300 dormitory rooms, two movie
theaters for the Art Institute's Film Center and a legitimate
theater that has been leased to the Noble Fool comedy troupe.
</P>
<P>
   The retail anchor for the project will be Borders Books, which
will open a 30,000-square-foot store on three levels next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted to be on State, based on what's been going on
there for the last few years,'' said Alex Lelli, the vice president
for development of the Borders Group Inc. in Ann Arbor, Mich.
``There's a lot of activity both during the day and at night and on
the weekends. It's a very attractive street.''

 By SARA RIMER and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is certain that the 127
people who have been executed in Texas during his tenure were all
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that every person that has been put to death in
Texas, under my watch, has been guilty of the crime charged, and
has had full access to the courts,'' Bush said on the NBC News
program ``Meet the Press'' in February.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Texas, which under Bush has executed more people
than any other state, some of the officials who administer the
death penalty, reviewing the case records, considering inmates'
appeals and weighing final pleas for clemency, are not so sanguine.
These officials, who support Bush's presidential candidacy and
believe in the death penalty, said in interviews that they believed
Texas ran the risk of executing an innocent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the death penalty and I don't want to do anything
that will cause George Bush to lose the election,'' said Paddy Lann
Burwell, a retired Exxon manager who was appointed by the governor
two years ago to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which
reviews all clemency requests in capital cases and makes
recommendations to the governor. Still, Burwell voiced concerns
about the fairness of the state's judicial system, particularly
several cases in which he said prosecutors seemed more concerned
with scoring victories, in the form of capital convictions, than
with justice.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Burwell said, he thinks the system is conscientiously
administered. ``But I worry that we may execute an innocent
person,'' he said. ``Any person would know that is a possibility. I
think our system needs to be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the board, Tom Moss, a retired federal parole
officer, talked about his vote for clemency for Troy Farris, who
was executed for killing a police officer. The Farris case, Moss
said, was one of two cases in which he ``saw something that may
have indicated that they were innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Tauss, who has studied law, is also on the board. She
said she ``cried all day'' after Texas executed Farris. ``I wasn't
sure he should have been given the death penalty,'' she said.
``That's why I voted to commute.'' A majority of the 18-member
board would have to have voted for clemency in order to make a
recommendation of it to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Baird, a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
until 1998, was in Washington this week to announce the formation
of a national committee to prevent wrongful executions. Asked
whether he agreed with Bush that no one had been wrongfully
executed under his watch, Baird said: ``Everyone in Texas hopes and
prays that that's the case. I do not share his view.'' For such
certainty to exist, he added, ``You have to take the position that
this very fallible system has worked flawlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, along with other law enforcement officials and death
penalty lawyers, agrees that some of the conditions that have
created doubt elsewhere and have sent innocent people to death row
in other states _ especially bad lawyers, a lack of resources for
lawyers to mount a vigorous defense, and overzealous prosecutors _
exist in abundance in Texas. The state also has endemic problems,
including elected judges who are under political pressure to mete
out the death penalty and a speeded-up appeals process with an
unusually low reversal rate, which trouble some officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
   No one can point with certainty to a case in which an innocent
person has been executed here since Texas reinstated the death
penalty in 1976. Death penalty lawyers say it is almost impossible
to prove a dead man was innocent; once a person is executed,
crucial evidence that might prove innocence disappears and lawyers
and investigators want to put their resources into trying to save
clients who are still on death row.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look by The New York Times at a half dozen
executions carried out during Bush's tenure _ including interviews
with jurors, prosecutors, judges, witnesses and co-defendants still
on death row _ makes clear that a legal and judicial system rife
with these conditions creates, at the very least, the risk of an
innocent person being sent to death row. Although most of the
officials interviewed said they believed that the executed men were
guilty, they questioned aspects of the legal system that sent them
to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country there have been 87 exonerations in the last
27 years, more than a third of them in the last seven years. These
cases have prompted a growing national concern over executions. In
January, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who supports
the death penalty, announced a moratorium on executions while a
thorough review is conducted of the state's criminal justice
system. Ryan, who is Bush's state campaign chairman, described his
state's system, where 13 death row inmates have been exonerated
since 1987, 11 of them since 1994, as ``fraught with error.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven death row inmates were exonerated in Texas from 1983 to
1997 after evidence of witnesses who had lied, mistaken
eyewitnesses and prosecutorial misconduct led to the discovery of
their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, 13 states have had bills pending that would
have halted executions. Asked on ``Meet the Press'' if he would
consider following the lead of Ryan, Bush said he would not. Asked
why he thought Ryan had taken the action, Bush answered: ``Maybe
they've had some problems in their courts. Maybe they've had some
faulty judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined an interview request for this article. His top
criminal justice policy adviser, Johnny Sutton, answered questions
about Bush's criminal justice record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the harsh reality of the death penalty
and we take that responsibility very seriously,'' said Sutton, a
former prosecutor. ``This is probably the most important thing we
do in state government. The governor takes it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite glaring examples of bad lawyering at the trial level in
Texas, including at least three widely publicized cases of lawyers
who have slept through the proceedings, the state appeals court has
reversed only eight death penalty cases in the last five years,
while affirming the convictions and death sentences in 256 cases,
according to court statistics. This is the lowest reversal rate in
capital cases in the country. In contrast, Florida, which ranks
behind Texas with the nation's third-highest death row population,
has a 50 percent reversal rate. Illinois' rate is nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Farris case, the one that caused Tauss of the parole
commission to break down into tears, the Court of Criminal Appeals
said there was no forensic evidence to link Farris to the crime or
to support the testimony of the two key witnesses against him. But
the appeals court upheld the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an unusual move, seven members of the state parole
board voted for clemency, but 10 opposed it and one abstained.
Farris was executed in January 1999. During Bush's tenure, the
parole board has granted clemency to only one death row inmate,
according to the board's statistics; as of the end of April, it had
rejected 68 clemency petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has never witnessed an execution, weighs all clemency
petitions, as well as all other cases set for execution, sometimes
several days, or more, before an execution, sometimes the morning
of the lethal injection. His powers to act are limited by the
recommendations of the parole board, except that he may grant a
30-day reprieve on his own. He has never done so.

LENDING CRACKDOWN SAID TO FALL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ga.)   By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When government regulators announced recently that
they were protecting homeowners by cracking down on an abusive
nationwide lending company, Margaret C. Roundtree hoped they would
intervene to save her home in Queens from foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did expect to get some help,'' said Roundtree, 68, a
hospital technician. ``But nothing has been done.'' So now she
faces the loss of the house where she has lived since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Three federal agencies settled their joint lawsuit against her
lender, Delta Financial Corp. of Woodbury, on March 30. They
portrayed their decision as an industrywide warning to the booming
but loosely regulated market in high-cost loans.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for victims like Roundtree say the officials let
Delta off the hook. The critics also say the federal settlement
gave no help to the thousands of suffering borrowers, many of whom
have been forced into foreclosure or bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   And consumer groups are also attacking Delta's earlier
settlement with two New York state regulatory agencies. While the
state did extract some restitution for victims, critics say the
amount is merely a token, considering Delta's $1 billion-a-year
operation. Only a fraction of the victims will be aided, and
nothing will go to those who must lose their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta operates in 26 states, and in New York it grew to become
the largest subprime lender, a type that makes high-cost loans to
people with limited credit ratings. But critics called Delta a
predatory lender that focused on minority neighborhoods. Its
victims, often elderly women, were targets of high-pressure pitches
for loans with exorbitant fees and interest that they could not
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the complaints, regulators accused the company of
violating various lending and civil rights laws. But the
settlements of those charges have frustrated Delta's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta admits no wrongdoing and agrees to comply with the law _
which it's supposed to do anyway _ while many victims are stuck
with horrendous loans for years to come, and people who already
lost their homes and their life savings are completely left out,''
said Sarah Ludwig, director of the Neighborhood Economic
Development Advocacy Project, a nonprofit group in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Alan M. White, the supervising attorney of Community Legal
Services in Philadelphia, said, ``These settlements send exactly
the wrong message to the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials defend their decisions, saying they
imposed heavy sanctions and stopped the abuses now, avoiding years
of litigation and possibly keeping thousands more from being
victimized. The restitution is the most ever won in the U.S.
banking industry, the regulators say. Delta also agreed to
restrictions beyond statutory requirements and is subject to civil
and criminal penalties for new violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many companies where five agencies come down on
them and get this kind of redress,'' said David Medine, an
associate director at the Federal Trade Commission, one of the
agencies. ``This is not just a slap on the wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Another agency, the Department of Justice, said, ``This suit
sends a clear message that the United States won't tolerate
discrimination or illegal lending practices.'' The Department of
Housing and Urban Development declined to reply to the critics. But
earlier, Secretary Andrew Cuomo praised the settlement, saying,
``Lenders and mortgage brokers are put on notice by this settlement
agreement that HUD and the federal government are prepared to fight
for borrowers who are being victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   The first official to go after Delta was the state attorney
general, Eliot Spitzer. At first he tried to place Delta in
receivership because ``we cannot trust them to abide by any
agreements,'' but eventually his office settled. His civil rights
chief, Andrew Celli, said: ``We started with one goal, to change
the way the largest subprime lender in the state does business, and
we met that goal. We made a conscious choice to reform this
industry going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   His deputy, Mark Peters, added: ``Delta is now bound by a
265-page code of conduct, requiring a whole bunch of things the law
doesn't require.'' For example, refinancing fees are limited,
credit-card debt consolidation is allowed only if the borrower
benefits, and a borrower must have enough income to cover
repayments with money left for essentials like food and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer pushed for $6 million in restitution, which the Banking
Department raised to $7.25 million, plus 525,000 shares of Delta
stock it valued at nearly $5 million. ``The governor instructed us
to obtain the maximum amount of restitution to the victims,'' said
the acting bank superintendent, Elizabeth McCaul. ``We took the
most from the company we possibly could,'' achieving ``by far the
largest consumer restitution'' ever in banking.
</P>
<P>
   Under that settlement, 600 Delta borrowers were recently offered
reductions in their monthly payments of $50 to $400, or 5 percent
to 40 percent, McCaul said. In addition, foreclosures were halted
for 75 homeowners, who will also be offered reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Delta issued this statement: ``While Delta does not believe it
has done anything wrong, it has acceded to these agreements in the
best interests of our shareholders, customers and the communities
we serve. Delta is committed to maintaining the best fair-lending
practices in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the restitution pales in contrast to the victims' losses and
Delta's billions of dollars in loans, critics say. The
reduced-payment benefits end when borrowers die, sell their homes,
refinance or are foreclosed. And the value of the Delta stock has
shrunk to barely $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny money, all flash and no cash,'' said Patricia
Sturdevant, director of the National Association of Consumer
Advocates, a nonprofit group. ``This case sets a dangerous
precedent for going soft on lenders who are cheating people out of
house and home. The message is that crime pays.'' Since the federal
agencies won no restitution, she said, there is no aid for victims
outside New York.

</P>
<P>
   The regulators should have gotten $30,000 to $40,000 per victim,
said William Brennan Jr., a lawyer for the Atlanta Legal Aid
Society who specializes in lending abuse cases and is familiar with
lawsuits against Delta. ``These settlements end up being window
dressing to make it look like the regulators are doing their job,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the settlements were court-approved, there is no
apparent recourse to challenge them. Despite their long efforts
against predatory lending, consumer groups say they were not
consulted on the actions. The federal agencies filed their suits
against Delta and _ simultaneously that same day _ announced their
settlements with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing, the critics say, is a state requirement that
victims who accept restitution must promise not to seek any other
legal redress. They cannot sue Delta, and if they eventually face
foreclosure, they will not be allowed to raise a defense in court
that their loans were improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's terrible, terrible,'' said Lee Squitieri, a Manhattan
lawyer who is organizing a class-action suit for Delta borrowers.
He is seeking to release them from bad loans, get compensation for
excessive charges and impose punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the restitution offers that the critics have heard
about are for $50 a month. ``It's not nearly enough,'' said Nancy
Slahetka, a lawyer who fights foreclosures for South Brooklyn Legal
Services. Those offers are not only paltry, she said, they are also
too few. ``There are thousands of victims, not hundreds.''
</P>
<P>
   Each case has its own details. Roundtree said she fell behind on
her bills when she was out of work because of two car accidents and
her resulting hip surgery. Her lawyer, Jeffrey Rosenberg, said she
was talked into a loan of $92,000, ``far more than she needed,'' to
pay her debts, plus $20,800 for a home-improvement contractor, with
cash supposedly left over for her. The interest rate was 12.15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Roundtree said she reluctantly signed blank papers when sales
people threatened that ``they were going to take my house away.''
Soon after, she said, she tried to invoke her right to cancel but
was ignored. She never got the final papers, she said, and most of
the promised renovations were never done.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically Delta did not originate the loan, the
company was involved at the outset and took over the loan at the
closing, the lawyer said. Inevitably, the payments fell into
arrears, and now Delta is demanding $137,000 or the house.

AFTER FUROR OVER BOOK, A WELCOME EPILOGUE  
 NEW STRATEGY IN GAME OF DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The obvious question: In her cheerful new life as a
teacher at a Queens County school with students from 40 cultures,
does Ruth Sherman, known for teaching a book called ``Nappy Hair''
to a class in Brooklyn, still use the book? Do her new students
learn about the little girl with ``the nappiest, the fuzziest, the
most screwed up, squeezed up, knotted up'' hair in the world?
</P>
<P>
   Or did the threats from parents that caused the white teacher to
change schools keep her from teaching what she had hoped would be a
diversity-affirming book?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Sherman, 29, does not teach the book by Carolivia Herron
that caused such controversy in 1998. Not yet, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not because I have anything against it,'' she said,
adding that the book is still in her library. ``I haven't gotten a
chance to do a unit like that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents at Public School 75 in Brooklyn objected to her use
of the book and, calling her a racist, threatened her.
</P>
<P>
   In her new school, Sherman, who married in the meantime and
enjoys the relative anonymity of her new name, has not looked into
teaching other books that might ruffle feathers. ``I do
second-guess everything now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy also affected her teaching style. ``I was
extremely open-minded before, and I'd look through a child's eyes.
Now I think, `This one might be insulted, this one has a little bit
of an attitude about this,''' she said. ``Something as simple as a
child's book might offend someone, which is something I never
thought about before. It is a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I will do anything in my power not to insult or
disrespect anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new school feels like home now. ``I joke around all the
time, I want a T-shirt that says `I died and went to P.S. 131,'''
she said. ``It's heaven here.''
</P>
<P>
   New Strategy in Game of Duck, Duck, Goose
</P>
<P>
   They've tried shaking them. They've tried baking them. They've
tried spraying the home fields with goose-repelling grape juice.
Now they've added three border collies with a fervent work ethic.
And still, it's a dead heat in the continuing battle of Canada
Geese vs. The People of Clarkstown.
</P>
<P>
   For a while there, the score was tilted in favor of the People,
in their attempts to rid their grassy areas of goose droppings. In
1996 and 1997, Clarkstown, in Rockland County, got permission from
the state to round up a total of 451 geese and convert them to
gooseburgers for the homeless and elderly. But in 1996 the meat was
contaminated, and in 1997 the elderly complained that it was tough.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the plan wasn't worth the hassle. It reduced the number
of nests in the parks, but it brought out animal-rights protesters,
and people complained that new geese would move in to replace the
cooked ones.
</P>
<P>
   The town is now resorting to an earlier goose-fighting
technique, addling eggs by shaking them and piercing them, so they
will not hatch. And now, dogs belonging to Mary Felegy of Fair Game
Goose Management Services patrol the town's parks daily, running
and swimming after the birds.
</P>
<P>
   There is less ``goose grease'' in the parks, said Charles
Holbrook, the Clarkstown supervisor. ``The dogs keep the geese off
the park property, which is good, but in reality they're just
chasing them to someone else's property, so it's not really a
solution,'' he said. And it costs $36,000 to chase the geese, but
only $10,000 to catch them and prepare the meat, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Felegy said the parks were cleaner now. ``It's safe to sit
on the grass,'' she said, ``it's safe to slide into home base, and
you can bounce your basketball on the court without it coming up
covered in green, slimy goo.''

The debate over the Miami Heat's 77-76 victory with 2.2 seconds

many. Of course, the New York Knicks still believe the basket
should have been waved off, and the Miami Heat still insist it was
good as called. Jeff Van Gundy talks to reporters at the Knicks

   (NYT9) WASHINGTON -- May 13, 2000 -- ERGONOMICS-COX-2 --
Businesses large and small are up in arms over ``ergonomics''
standards proposed last fall by the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration. If passed as law, OSHA says 27 million workers
would be affected by the new rules involving repetitive motions,
awkward reaching or heavy lifting. OSHA said the rules would cost
businesses about $ 4.2 billion a year to implement, while saving $
9 billion annually through increased productivity and lower
absenteeism. Industry groups responded that the cost would be much
higher. A worker in a Washington, D.C. food warehouse stacks crates

Formosan subterranean termites with an insatiable taste for
irreplaceable historic structures have been devastating New
Orleans' French Quarter, drawn to its moist porous bricks and

government's $15 million effort to thwart the Formosan, the most
destructive species of termite in the world, capable of building
colonies of up to 10 million writhing white bugs, which devour an
average of 1,000 pounds of wood a year. (Nicole Bengiveno/The New

The debate over the Miami Heat's 77-76 victory with 2.2 seconds
left on Friday raged anew on Saturday. Anthony Carter's
game-winning shot from behind the backboard was questionable to
many. Of course, the New York Knicks still believe the basket
should have been waved off, and the Miami Heat still insist it was
good as called. Jeff Van Gundy talks to reporters at the Knicks

Businesses large and small are up in arms over ``ergonomics''
standards proposed last fall by the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration. If passed as law, OSHA says 27 million workers
would be affected by the new rules involving repetitive motions,
awkward reaching or heavy lifting. OSHA said the rules would cost
businesses about $ 4.2 billion a year to implement, while saving $
9 billion annually through increased productivity anlower
absenteeism. Industry groups responded that the cost would be much
higher. A worker in a Washington, D.C. food warehouse stacks crates

action or over-exertion. Industry groups have stated that the cost

 &HT;    Suspects enlist top legal teams
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis is a criminal defense lawyer's dream.
</P>
<P>
   The All Pro NFL linebacker can pay mountainous attorneys' fees.
His case has generated the kind of sensational publicity most
lawyers crave. And, even better, his case may be one his attorneys
can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exhilarating time,'' Ed Garland, Lewis' lead attorney,
said recently. ``It's a great challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Smooth, cunning and calculating, Garland has for decades been on
everyone's short list when a high-profile criminal indictment hit
town. That is, if the defendants could afford him.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with a $7 million signing bonus, Lewis can.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and co-defendants Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting are
charged with murder and aggravated assault in the stabbing deaths
of two men after a night of post-Super Bowl partying. Their trial
starts Monday with jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants have assembled what amounts to be a dream
team of Atlanta defense lawyers: Garland and partner Don Samuel
lead the Lewis team; Bruce Harvey and David Wolfe represent Oakley;
and Steve Sadow will work with Miami lawyer John Bergendahl on
behalf of Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   While the array of legal talent is impressive, the lawyers will
have to achieve a delicate balance during the trial. They will have
to aggressively defend their own client without antagonizing the
co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   If one defendant tries to blame another, the trial could
suddenly become treacherous for all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense lawyers hate a case where multiple defendants have an
incentive to point the finger at one another,'' Atlanta lawyer Jack
Martin said. ``Usually, in that situation, everybody goes down in
flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these lawyers possess strong personalities that could
lead to a few clashes during trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got three defendants with excellent lawyers, all of
whom have strong egos,'' Atlanta lawyer Craig Gillen said. ``I
think it will be vital their theories do not clash at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, disharmony in the defense camp has surfaced, such as
the unsuccessful motions by Lewis and Oakley for separate trials.
But the lawyers appeared to get along amiably Tuesday during lunch
shortly after a pretrial hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' team of Garland and Samuel compliment each other well.
Garland revels in the spotlight and has a way of connecting with
jurors. In the courtroom, he can look into a jury box and not have
the jurors feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best trial lawyers in the country and an
extremely charming guy,'' famed lawyer F. Lee Bailey said. ``And
he's got that very rich Southern accent that he has no desire to
get rid of at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland, 58, is the son of Reuben Garland, a theatrical
courtroom lawyer and orator who died in 1982. The elder Garland was
known to feign heart attacks in court and infuriate judges who
sometimes cited him for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal thing about my father was that he was a free
human being,'' Garland said recently. ``He was without fear. So
when he defended someone, the thought never crossed his mind about
what someone thought about him _ only what actions by him would
help his client.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland has his own brand of zealous advocacy, although he is
more measured and accommodating than his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, 46, is a bit more reserved. The scholarly half of the
team, he is a walking encyclopedia of criminal defense law, having
written books on federal and state court decisions. Many defense
attorneys have at least one of the books an arm's reach away in
their office.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Assistant District Attorney Sheila Ross Finley
took the occasion to bring Samuel's book to Tuesday's motions
hearing and quote from it in successfully arguing an issue before
Judge Alice D. Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel is often seen leaning back at the defense table, twirling
a pen as he conjures up innovative legal theories. He is a master
at winning over judges when arguing the finer points of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, he fills in all my weak spots,'' Garland said
recently with a hearty laugh. ``If Don had any, I'd fill those
in.''
</P>
<P>
   A high point in Samuel's legal career occurred in the
sensational federal trial of millionaire James Sullivan, accused of
hiring a hit man to kill his estranged wife, Lita. After
prosecutors rested, Samuel argued for a directed verdict, saying
there was insufficient evidence for the case to reach the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Marvin Shoob wanted to defer a ruling, but Samuel argued
that he had to decide it right away. Shoob agreed and then granted
the motion, acquitting Williams and stunning prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel won a big victory in the Lewis case, too, convincing
Bonner that allegations of prior assaults by the linebacker cannot
be put before the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Garland is sparing little expense in his defense. He employs a
troupe of private investigators, led by Joe Pagani, once second in
command of the Internal Revenue Servies' criminal investigations
division. Other members of the Lewis legal team are highly regarded
Atlanta lawyer Tony Axam and certified jury consultant Jana Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Sadow, 46, once worked for Garland and, he admits, got his first
case by swiping a phone message off Garland's desk. Sadow returned
the call and was hired to represent a man charged with the fatal
shooting of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The jury accepted Sadow's self-defense arguments and acquitted
his client. The young prosecutor trying the case was Paul Howard,
now Fulton County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Intense, brash, gifted with an almost total recall, Sadow first
wanted to be a lawyer at age 11 while watching the TV courtroom
drama ``The Defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stabbings case, Sadow is co-counsel to Bergendahl, who
was initially hired by Sweeting and then brought Sadow into the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the ponytailed Harvey and the shaggy-haired Wolfe will
share duties in Oakley's defense. The two men have tried numerous
cases together.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, 49, is one of the city's most prominent lawyers. He
recently was appointed as one of the lawyers defending Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin, the former '60s radical once known as H. Rap
Brown who faces death penalty charges in the killing of a Fulton
County sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, who has tried his hand at stand-up comedy, won acquittals
in the state and federal corruptions trials of Atlanta police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said a mutual respect helps both lawyers during trial.
``We both have total confidence in each other,'' he said. ``If
Bruce is examining a witness, I know I don't have to worry about it
and can study up on the one coming up next. It's a great luxury.''

   In the stabbings case, Sadow is co-counsel to Bergendahl, who
was initially hired by Sweeting and then brought Sadow into the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the ponytailed Harvey and the shaggy-haired Wolfe will
share duties in Oakley's defense. The two men have tried numerous
cases together.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, 49, is one of the city's most prominent lawyers. He
recently was appointed as one of the lawyers defending Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin, the former '60s radical once known as H. Rap
Brown who faces death penalty charges in the killing of a Fulton
County sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, who has tried his hand at stand-up comedy, won acquittals
in the state and federal corruptions trials of Atlanta police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said a mutual respect helps both lawyers during trial.
``We both have total confidence in each other,'' he said. ``If
Bruce is examining a witness, I know I don't have to worry about it
and can study up on the one coming up next. It's a great luxury.''

SOUTH AFRICA'S MBEKI TO PRESS US COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA _ President Thabo Mbeki, preparing for his first state
visit to the United States in a week, said Saturday that he would
challenge US political and business leaders not to disengage from
his troubled continent.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Saturday with a small group of foreign correspondents,
Mbeki said that in particular, the United States should do more as
the world's only superpower to eradicate global poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shortage of capital in the world economy, but we
are failing as a human society to take advantage of what exists
indeed to address all of these problems associated with poverty
around the world,'' he said. ``The capacity is there. The country
that needs to take a lead in addressing this type of issue is the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki will make his trip, which includes a stop in Britain, at a
time when old conflicts have flared up again across Africa. In
addition to the wars in Angola and Congo, political violence has
spread across Zimbabwe, rebels have captured and killed UN and
regional peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone, and Ethiopia has gone
back to war with its neighbor, Eritrea. Soldiers from Rwanda and
Uganda, normally allies, have turned their guns on each other
inside Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The South African leader, who will be in the United States from
May 22 to 26, will meet with President Clinton, Congress, and both
presidential candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush. He will also
travel to San Francisco, Austin, Texas, and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges he faces in the United States, Mbeki said,
is to ensure that investors and the public in general do not lose
sight of progress amid the chaos. ``There is a mood which sees
Africa as one entity,'' he said. ``Despite the battles we are
carrying out here to build a better society, the way the Nigerians
are trying to do something for themselves, to change their
situation for the better . . . we tend to get overshadowed by these
spectacular bad things, and so you get a kind of pessimism that
persists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do about Africa?'' he said. ``Not to deny the bad
things that are happening, but also not, then, to allow that those
bad things overshadow the . . . work that is being done? What
additional things do we need to do to assist in this process of
African renewal?''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki spent much of the meeting defending policies on AIDS and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself a champion of the notion of an African
``renaissance,'' Mbeki has drawn fire from critics at home for not
denouncing turmoil in Zimbabwe, where progovernment mobs have
invaded hundreds of white-owned farms and have turned against
members and supporters of the opposition ahead of parliamentary
elections, due before August. At least 18 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has been accused of coddling Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, who, analysts say, has encouraged the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki said he had sent a delegation from his African National
Congress Saturday to speak with Mugabe's party and the opposition
Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the first time that the South African governing
party has engaged Mugabe's political opponents publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, Mbeki has decried the violence in Zimbabwe,
and he said he has urged Mugabe to allow election observers to come
in as soon as possible to monitor the process. But he has rejected
the criticism that by not making more forceful comments publicly
about Zimbabwe's crisis, he is sending a mixed message to his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our neighbor,'' he said. ``I have said to Mugabe we
must have an end to the violence, that there must be the rule of
law, land reform, and transparency. But we need a comfortable,
cooperative approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about AIDS, an issue on which he has drawn criticism
for inviting scientists to debate, among other points, whether HIV
caused the disease, Mbeki said he had dispatched his health
minister to Geneva to discuss a deal announced last Friday by
pharmaceutical companies to slash the costs of their antiretroviral
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the cost reductions, he said, the South African
medical community did not have the capacity to administer
complicated, daily treatments throughout the country.

KNICKS CANNOT AFFORD TO DWELL ON GAME 3
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One year _ almost to the day _ after Allan Houston's
magical jump shot bounced high off the rim and fell majestically
through the net, sending the Miami Heat to a devastating
first-round playoff exit, the New York Knicks find themselves
dealing with a crushing circumstance of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The improbable game-winning baseline runner that the Miami
rookie Anthony Carter bounced into the rim with 2.2 seconds left on
Friday gave the Heat a 77-76 overtime victory. It was the type of
shot that can send an opponent spiraling into emotional oblivion.
To the superstitious, it must have seemed like payback.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between Carter's shot and Houston's shot,
which came in Game 5 last year, is that the Knicks have a chance to
regroup this year in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Victims of
a knockdown rather than a knockout, the Knicks face only a 2-1
deficit in this best-of-7 series rather than a summer of
nightmarish flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they can put the discouraging loss behind them when
they take the floor for the most critical contest of the series
thus far, Sunday's Game 4 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to gather ourselves and not get down,'' Latrell
Sprewell said after Friday's game. ``Right now, guys are really
down and upset, so we need to channel all of this frustration in
the right direction. There's no doubt about it that it's tough.
Guys are frustrated and upset. There's no other way to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the frustration came from the manner in which the Knicks
lost, the anger stemmed from the teamwide feeling of injustice. The
Knicks believe that Carter's shot flew over the back of the
backboard before hitting the rim and therefore should have been
ruled illegal and called off. The officials never considered the
Knicks' argument and, in fact, were more concerned with whether
Alonzo Mourning tipped the ball into the rim while it bounced
within the cylinder. Initially, they called the basket off because
they thought Mourning had touched the ball, but they quickly and
correctly reversed their call, as replays showed that he did not
interfere with the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Replays seemed to be inconclusive in determining whether
Carter's shot went over the backboard, but the Knicks were
convinced, disputing the officials' no-call to a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it on replay,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``It was
definitely a shot from behind the backboard. They got the right
call for the wrong reason. Unfortunately, that is how it is. They
called it no good and they called it for goaltending, which is
wasn't. But the ball was shot from behind the backboard, which
should result in our ball out of bounds on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as clear as day on the replay.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their exasperation, the Knicks wisely admitted to being
done in by more than a wild prayer of a shot. They scored seven of
the first 10 points of overtime to take a 75-71 lead and the
momentum with 2 minutes 13 seconds remaining, but could not hold
on. They were beaten badly on the backboards, losing the rebounding
battle by 45-34 and allowing Carter to grab seven rebounds from his
point guard position.
</P>
<P>
   They blew a golden opportunity to open a large lead in the
second half, failing to capitalize on Mourning's foul trouble when
he went to the bench with four fouls with 8:13 left in the third
quarter. Leading by 44-40 when Mourning left, the Knicks actually
trailed, 58-57, when he returned 11 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   With Mourning, an All-Star center, on the bench, the Knicks
should have broken the game open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the turning point really,'' said Marcus
Camby, who blocked six shots but had just four points and five
rebounds in 32 minutes. ``I think we started to think that the game
was over. We never took advantage when he went out of the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything positive the Knicks can take out of the
game it is that Houston and Sprewell seemed to solve the Heat
defense. After being slowed offensively over the first two games,
they combined to score 47 points. Sprewell attacked the basket hard
to earn 11 foul shots (he made them all) and scored 23 points, and
Houston made 9 of 18 field goal attempts to score a game-high 24.
Mourning scored 23 for the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, who shot just 36 percent in the first two games,
continued to struggle, hitting just 4 of his 10 shots in scoring
nine points, but he nearly overcame his lack of productivity by
canning a game-tying 17 footer with 2.6 seconds left in regulation.
A hero at that point, Ewing floundered near the end of the overtime
period, missing 1 of 2 free throws with 13.7 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   While his made foul shot put the Knicks ahead, 76-75, it left
the door open for Carter's heroics, which in addition to costing
the Knicks the game and the home-court advantage, may very well end
up costing them the series.

YANKS LOSE AGAIN TO TIGERS, AND CAN'T BLAME WIND
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Hot dog wrappers drifted by like tumbleweeds inside
Comerica Park Saturday, bouncing and hopping from right field to
left. When fly balls went into the air, the players turned
helplessly, as if caught in the whirl of dust devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers are still learning about their new home, and it may
be that the wind will never blow the same way it did on this spring
afternoon _ steady, from the southwest and over the right-field
wall, curling along the upper decks of the park. If this is the
norm, however, players will draw comparisons with Mother Nature's
favorite haunt, San Francisco's Candlestick Park, where pop flies
were an entertainment staple before the Giants escaped this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit beat Andy Pettitte and the Yankees, 6-3, and would have
done so with or without the wind. But first impressions are still
being formed about Comerica Park, and on this first warm day game
of the season, players on both sides waged war with the wind, some
losing and others prevailing. ``I have never seen fly balls move
like that,'' Yankees right-fielder Paul O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have lost the first two games of this series to
the last-place Tigers (11-23) and three straight overall, will try
to salvage the final game Sunday, with Orlando Hernandez set to
face the former Mets pitcher Dave Mlicki. The Yankees are 22-12 and
are on a pace to win 105 games, but they continue to struggle to
score runs, and to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   If Houston's cozy new Enron Field is the Rhode Island of
ballparks, then Comerica Park is Alaska, an expanse of outfield, so
large that the outfielders must play a little deeper than they
might in other parks. That dynamic was complicated by Saturday's
wind: Comerica Park is built into the ground and right field is
mostly unguarded by structure, so that the breezes and gusts blew
unencumbered into the outfield and wreaked havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Positioned deep in right field, O'Neill could not reach the
bloop double Dean Palmer hit in the second; in most ballparks,
O'Neill could have kept Palmer from reaching second. Three batters
and one walk later, second baseman Jose Macias _ unknown to
Pettitte before Saturday's game _ rolled a grounder inside the
first-base line, and by the time O'Neill retrieved it deep in the
right field corner, Macias had a two-run triple. Pettitte prolonged
the inning with the second of his two throwing errors, and Detroit
carried a 4-1 lead into the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the fourth, Palmer lifted a high pop toward
right field. Pettitte began moving off the field, assuming this
would be the last out. O'Neill set himself in right field, for what
looked to be an easy play. The second baseman Chuck Knoblauch never
moved.
</P>
<P>
   The ball suddenly dropped; it had hit the wall of wind blowing
in from right field. ``It was like a duck that was shot and went
right down,'' said Lee Mazzilli, the first base coach.
</P>
<P>
   And it fell about 100 feet from O'Neill, closer to Knoblauch
than the right fielder. ``I had absolutely no chance,'' O'Neill
said. ``I wouldn't have caught that ball even if you told me where
it was going to drop. It's like it took off sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Another run scored. O'Neill kept looking around in right field,
staring at the fluttering flags built high above the center field
wall, shaking his head. Pettitte was relieved two outs into the
fifth inning, having allowed six runs on 10 hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams hit a high fly toward left in the sixth inning
and began sprinting toward first, knowing left fielder Rich Becker
might be fooled by the wind. Before the game, Becker asked
teammates about the wind's effect on fly balls in Comerica Park,
and manager Phil Garner replied, honestly, that he had no idea.
They haven't played enough games here to know.
</P>
<P>
   Becker moved in for a moment, started backpedaling, faster and
faster, and the ball fell about five feet behind him. Williams was
at second base, Becker was charged with an error _ mistakenly,
manager Joe Torre thought, given the adverse conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This is Comerica Park. There's no place like home, Dorothy once
said, and she lived in a pretty windy place, too.

 &HT;    Tragedy spurs congresswoman to fight back
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sound of C-SPAN follows her as she flits around
her office, which makes perfect sense. You can't exactly tune in to
Oprah from your office on The Hill, although she does allow herself
a couple of flickering candles. She's got staff here and staff
there _ young kids who think the world of her. Hillary's picture is
hanging on the reception-area wall. Newt's birthday card is framed
in her inner-office.
</P>
<P>
   She has a view of concrete government offices from the giant
window behind her.
</P>
<P>
   She has a heart that hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy has just finished her lunch, the
one quiet moment she allows herself each blurred day of her life.
She's a wisp of a woman, and here's how to stay fit the Carolyn
McCarthy way:
</P>
<P>
   Leave the house where you raised your only son. Leave the house
where you gardened with your husband. Leave your best girlfriends
and your local hardware store and your favorite pizza joint.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss it all goodbye, including your anonymity. Especially your
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't be forced into it the way she was.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, 56, came to the U.S. House of Representatives in the
worst way possible: through murder. Her husband and son were shot
on the Long Island Rail Road on Dec. 7, 1993. Her husband, Dennis,
died. Her son, Kevin, lived. On Dec. 6, everything was fine and
dandy at the McCarthy household on Long Island. They'd just gotten
back from their annual trip to Vermont. They were getting ready for
Christmas. She loved her job as a nurse. Kevin now had a job at
Dad's office in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Then father and son hustled out of their offices at Prudential
Securities in New York and onto the 5:33 train out of Penn Station.
Suddenly, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, she's still a nurse. She's still a mother. But, through
life's frantic design, Carolyn McCarthy is a whole lot more. A
member of Congress. An enemy of the National Rifle Association. A
made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   All of those things _ tragedy and joy alike _ have put her at
the front of today's Million Mom March, a day-long outcry in
Washington and 67 other cities that has been engineered mostly by
America's women. The message? This country has to get control of
its guns. McCarthy acquired this belief the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   The second-term representative sits amid the televised drone of
Washington at work, her Washington now. And she talks. About that
day.
</P>
<P>
   She was at a Christmas concert with some friends. She was
heading home. The car radio was off. She always did that _ drive
time was her alone time, like her lunches are today. She walked
into an empty house. She noticed the guys hadn't put up the
Christmas tree. The phone started ringing. There'd been an awful
massacre on the train. People with white stricken faces started
streaming into her house, streaming into her life.
</P>
<P>
   She stops. She remembers. She reminds herself to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Because she's getting to The Part.
</P>
<P>
   The Part where her boys didn't come home.
</P>
<P>
   A LIFE CHANGING TRAGEDY
</P>
<P>
   The floor of the subway. That's the first thing Kevin McCarthy
talked about when he opened his eyes in the hospital bed. The
floor. And Dad? Where is Dad? His mother, Carolyn, a nurse, soothed
him, quieted him. She told him he was going to be fine and that was
all that mattered right now. And then she started. She moved his
legs. She moved his fingers. She moved just about anything that
could move even when her dear child flinched with pain.
</P>
<P>
   She had already lost one man in her life. She was not about to
lose the other.
</P>
<P>
   The father and son had just begun a whole new chapter of their
lives when they kissed her goodbye that Tuesday morning. Kevin was
still living at home, an only child content within the careful
confines of where he'd grown up. He had graduated from college with
a degree in hotel management and had played around with a couple of
jobs. But only recently had he started working with his father.
``It was a very special time for the two of them,'' Carolyn says.
</P>
<P>
   They would take the subway to and from work, father and son,
looking handsome in their two-piece suits. They would discuss
business in the back yard. Dennis McCarthy had always been the big
voice in the family; everyone loved him _ his humor, his outgoing
personality. Carolyn and Kevin had always been two peas in a pod,
the two quiet mice.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives had been so regular, so predictable, so mundane.
Tennis and church and dinner with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything changed:
</P>
<P>
   Gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   They began just after the train pulled from the station. One
minute, everyone was packed on the subway, briefcases and Christmas
packages piled at their feet. The next second, it was a war zone.
His name was Colin Ferguson, and he was out to settle his imagined
scores with the world. He pulled a semi-automatic gun from his gym
bag and started firing at point-blank range. An expectant mother. A
young Christian woman who had just lost her husband to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A father. A son.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, six people were dead, 19 injured. The
housewife from Mineola had to bury one and teach another how to
walk again. Today, gun advocates like to suggest to her that if
someone else had had a gun that day on the subway, maybe they could
have stopped the madman. Maybe they could have shot Ferguson dead.
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy is convinced otherwise. She's done her homework,
looked at the reports, read the witness statements. ``There was too
much confusion for anybody to know who was who,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW LIFE IN WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   I 'd like to thank Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, Sen. Chuck Schumer,
Bill and Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. They have made me see the
light. After 30 years of gun ownership, they have forced me to join
the NRA. I could have used that $35 on something else, but because
of them I had to use it to uphold my rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Letter to the editor, New York Daily News, March 24, 2000
</P>
<P>
   At first, they were always catching her by surprise. In a crowd.
In the halls of her congressional office building. At community
meetings in her home district. They were forceful. McCarthy
describes them as mean and rude and threatening. Now when she
addresses a crowd, she can pick them out in one glance. Recently,
they've started sending women. The NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I just let them be rude the way they are and let the
audience turn on them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Funny things happen when you leave your old life and start a new
one in Washington. It's not just that you're walking four and a
half miles a day and forgetting to eat right. It's not just that a
trip to the grocery store back home can take double the time.
Constituents like to talk!
</P>
<P>
   It's that _ suddenly, without any special schooling _ you find
yourself meeting with people you'd only before read about in the
newspaper. The president. Teddy Kennedy. Sarah Brady. Your Rolodex
is filled with the names of powerhouses. By the time Rosie
O'Donnell called _ the day after the Columbine shootings _ McCarthy
knew just what to do. She told her staff she wasn't voting on
anything that day. She was going on Rosie. The two women, now
friends, are scheduled to speak today in Washington, before an
expected crowd of more than 150,000. Supporters are hoping for a
national turnout of 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who ever had a mother is invited to march,'' McCarthy
likes to tell anyone she sees.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of running for Congress didn't come to her until Kevin
was out of the hospital. Indeed, she thought of nothing but him all
the way through the long 12 months of hospitalization and
rehabilitation. ``Dennis was gone. There was nothing I could do
about Dennis,'' she says now. She threw herself into Kevin's
recovery. Sometimes, the nurses thought she was nuts. But she
didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, after her son's release from rehab, she threw
herself into Long Islanders Against Gun Violence. She made her
first trips to Capitol Hill. She felt her first rush of rage at the
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Then her congressman, Republican Dan Frisa, voted against a ban
on assault weapons. McCarthy was livid. A reporter from the New
York Daily News stumbled upon her in a stairwell after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you mad enough to run for office?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get an Irish woman mad enough, she'll do anything,'' she said.
In May of 1996, she announced her candidacy in the back yard of her
modest Mineola home, relying on advice from her friends and family
_ a group she coyly called her ``kitchen cabinet.'' Her plan? Run
against Frisa as a Democrat, even though she was a lifelong
Republican. It worked, and she was reelected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She's half-way through her second term, and while nursing is a
good preparation for life, what could have prepared her for this?
The pretend smiles in the hallway, the back-stabbing on the House
floor. She tries hard to play the game the way she thinks it should
be played. She tries hard to be kind and sensible and strong. She
tries hard to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell my staff that when I start acting like a
politician, they need to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Cecelia Prewett, her communications director, ``She's just
precious, isn't she? She's so real.''
</P>
<P>
   KEEPING THE PROMISE
</P>
<P>
   We have an opportunity in Washington to stop playing games. That
is what I came to Washington for. I am sorry that this is so very
hard for me. I am Irish, and I am not supposed to cry in front of
anyone. But I made a promise a long time ago. I made a promise to
my son and to my husband. If there was anything that I could do to
prevent one family from going through what I have gone through and
every other victim that I know have gone through, then I have done
my job.
</P>
<P>
   Let me go home. Let me go home.
</P>
<P>
   _ McCarthy speech on the floor of Congress, June 17, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Her speech came _ after much choreographed delay, her staff
insists _ at 1:30 in the morning. Even before the speaker of the
House gave her two minutes of floor time, she knew it was going to
be the toughest speech of her life. She was right. The Gun Show
Loophole Amendment was her baby. It made so much sense! Guns kill
30,000 people and cause 100,000 injuries in America each year.
Those deaths and injuries cost the health care industry $2.8
billion annually. The government foots half that bill. She passed
the statistics out like candy. She lined up her votes.
</P>
<P>
   She explained it all until she was beyond blue in the face:
</P>
<P>
   She was not trying to take guns away from anyone. Hunters could
hunt. Protectors could still protect. All she wanted was a waiting
period when people bought guns at trade shows. It was that simple.
But in the end, her not-so-quiet politicking wasn't enough. Even
her fellow Democrats split off from her. The next week, Minority
LeaderDick Gephardt, D-Mo., sent her a handwritten note. She found
out later it was straight from his heart; his staff didn't know a
thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were magnificent,'' Gephardt wrote. ``I have never heard a
better speech on the floor in my 22 years. You made us all proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The victories are slow, which is to say they are very much
cherished. Both the House and Senate versions of the latest
Juvenile Justice Bill contain provisions that require child safety
locks on all new guns, something she's fought for since she came to
Congress. She's helped get more money allocated for tracing guns
used by juveniles who commit crimes. And she wants Congress to
instruct the U.S. Department of Education to collect data on gun
violence in their schools, then start classroom programs about guns
and safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to make a difference,'' she said during a recent
luncheon speech. ``I just didn't know it would take this long.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what McCarthy has learned about guns and politics.
``Nothing is going to change until we reach out and get everyone
involved,'' she says. Her treasured prototype for today's march is
not the woman with the dead sister or murdered son. It's the mother
who is simply scared out of her wits. The mother who stands beside
her child, not on the emotion of a grave.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the National Mall, the nurse with the sweet grandbaby
and a second on the way, will pull back her hair with her trademark
scrunchee, and she'll give a speech. About a father. About a son.
About an Irish mother who's not in Mineola any more.
</P>
<P>
   She'll look at the sea of faces. She'll hear the applause.
</P>
<P>
   She'll remember to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always takes me right back to that moment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That moment when her two boys didn't come home.

A PEEK AT POSSIBLE NBA FIRST-ROUND PICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While tears erupt from Dick Vitale's good eye, the NBA has
declared its underclass in session.
</P>
<P>
   Right, today is the deadline for players who have yet to
extinguish their college eligibility to officially tell the world
they intend to compete for even more loot than a top-ranked alumnus
can stuff into the folds of an unsanctioned, off-campus burrito.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these status-quo-disturbing rascals will skip college
completely, just like baseball star Ken Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Some can't speak English, but they believe the NBA is a good
excuse to escape from Europe. A few prospects who can speak English
will end up doing 5 to 10 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Some will refuse to ``hire'' an agent, realize they aren't
first-round timber, then withdraw their names before another
deadline on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Some will stink. Some will achieve greatness. Others will become
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   With another week before the lottery Ping-Pong balls deliver a
draft order, it would be foolish to stir up a mock draft now.
</P>
<P>
   So we're crawling to within an inch of foolish by serving up a
preliminary look at possible first-round sections in tier-group
fashion. Your mileage may vary. Defections and individual workouts
eventually will alter this list by, oh, 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And away they go:
</P>
<P>
   1-4, not necessarily in this order: Kenyon Martin (Cincinnati),
Marcus Fizer (Iowa State), Stromile Swift (LSU), Chris Mihm
(Texas).
</P>
<P>
   5-9: Courtney Alexander (Fresno State), DerMarr Johnson
(Cincinnati), Darius Miles (East St. Louis, Ill. HS), Morris
Peterson (Michigan State), Joel Przybilla (Minnesota).
</P>
<P>
   10-17: Iakovos Tsakalidis (AEK, Greece), Mateen Cleaves
(Michigan State), Jerome Moiso (UCLA), Erick Barkley (St. John's),
Quentin Richardson (DePaul), Etan Thomas (Syracuse), Keyon Dooling
(Missouri), Mike Miller (Florida).
</P>
<P>
   18-23: Desmond Mason (Oklahoma State), Hanno Mattola (Utah),
Chris Carrawell (Duke), Scoonie Penn (Ohio State), Hidayet Turkoglu
(Efes Pilsen, Turkey), Speedy Claxton (Hofstra).
</P>
<P>
   24-29: Soumaila Samake (IBL), Jamal Magloire (Kentucky), Jason
Collier (Georgia Tech), Jamal Crawford (Michigan), Donnell Harvey
(Florida), Chris Porter (Auburn).
</P>
<P>
   Bubble: Mamadou N'Diaye (Auburn), Michael Redd (Ohio State),
Corey Hightower (Indian Hills JC, Iowa), Ernest Brown (Indian Hills
JC), Schea Cotton (Bosco Tech, LBCC, Alabama), Jason Kapono
(Artesia HS, UCLA), JaRon Rush (UCLA), Dan Langhi (Vanderbilt),
Jimmie ``Snap'' Hunter (Life College, Ga.), Fred Hickman (CNN/SI).
</P>
<P>
   If your son is not ranked to your specifications, blame the many
scouts consulted before this list was compiled. Then buy the kid
some ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Another pre-draft wild card is held by DeShawn Stevenson
(Washington Union HS, Fresno), a shooting guard with superhero
athletic ability. A Cliff Notes look: verbally declared for the
draft; received a qualifying college-board test score, announced he
would honor his commitment and play at Kansas; test score reported
to be over 500 points higher than the previous result, provoking a
possible demand to retake the test, the results of which would not
be known until long after today's NBA deadline. So Stevenson is in
limbo; but if he re-enters the draft in time for a few private
workouts, he still could be selected midway through Round 1, three
scouts insist. ... The aforementioned list includes a 20-year-old,
6-foot-8 Turk named Hidayet Turkoglu, described by one personnel
director as a mini-Toni Kukoc. Not sure if that's praise or an
indictment. ... Iakovos Tsakalidis, as was written here several
weeks ago, is a 7-2, 20-year-old center from Soviet Georgia (where
he's known as Tsakalov) with Greek citizenship. ...
</P>
<P>
   According to emissaries of agent David Falk, Clippers free agent
Maurice Taylor could end up in Miami. Well, not without accepting a
fraction of Mo's market value, or working a sign-and-trade with the
Clips involving P.J. Brown. Not bloody likely. ... According to six
NBA talent snoops, it's a good thing Jason Kapono has 3-point
range, because he'd be a long shot for selection in the first
round. ... ESPN.com has reported that Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins
turned down an offer to coach the Clippers. That's a hoot, says one
Clipper spokesperson, who doubts that owner Donald T. Sterling even
knows who Huggins is. ... According to a league source, Clips GM
Elgin Baylor may not be anti-Mike Fratello, after all. Baylor
simply wants to hire someone responsible enough to do the job, and
Fratello may qualify. Sterling probably agrees, but still figures
to have a difference of financial opinion. ...
</P>
<P>
   One NBA personnel sharpie said four of his colleagues reverently
closed their notebooks after watching Dominguez High junior Tyson
Chandler for only one quarter during a recent tournament in
Virginia. Three scouts (out of three asked) think the 7-foot Don -
with added strength and additional low-post chops - could be the
first pick in the 2001 draft. ``I like him more than (Darius) Miles
right now,'' said one scout, ``and Miles could go top five in
June.'' ... While he remains a solid candidate to replace Larry
Bird in Indiana, Pacers assistant coach Rick Carlisle does have
history with the new regime at Vancouver. General manager Billy
Knight just left the Pacers, while Chuck Daly who was hired for
some mystery front-office Grizzlies job had Carlisle on his
coaching staff at New Jersey. ... With not quite enough assistant
coaches to declare war on a small country, the Mavericks last week
hired Sidney Moncrief. While allegedly being groomed to replace Don
Nelson in the big chair, Moncrief (according to sources beyond our
control), also will be the official coach in charge of defensive
rotation on the north end of the floor every other Tuesday. ...
Cincinnati lottery locks Martin and Johnson are booked for Pete
Newell's Big Man Camp, scheduled for August in Hawaii. These
Bearcats, represented by L.A.-based agent Dan Fagan, have been
Staples Center guests of Corie Blount, the Phoenix Suns forward
with a Bearcat pedigree. ... A reporter for CNN/SI doesn't vote for
Shaquille O'Neal as the league MVP, then receives death threats.
Lenny Wilkens says he was offered the Wizards' head-coaching job,
then admits his announcement was premature. Many NBA watchdogs
believe the Wizards job qualifies as the death threat. ... Agent
Bill Duffy reports that Joey Przybilla (ranked in our top 9) has
added nine pounds to his 7-1 frame, but while reducing his body fat
by six percent. More importantly, Przybilla the Minnesota sophomore
who bolted late last season - is living in northern California and
investing hours in developing a low-post game. ... A recently
published favor (not here) for Darrick Martin (St. Anthony's HS,
UCLA) announced the backup Sacramento point guard's interest in
returning to the Clippers. Martin's only shot to suit up with the
Clips would require changing his first name to Kenyon.

Moceanu able to dream once again
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dominique Moceanu couldn't sleep. So what else was
new?
</P>
<P>
   She hadn't slept in days. She had hardly any money in her purse,
just a few changes of clothes thrown into an overnight bag and
nowhere to go. She stood there, scared, peeking through the
curtains of a motel room that some friends rented for her under a
false name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that him?'' she thought to herself as a car that looked
like her father's slowly rolled through the parking lot. ``Ohmigod,
it's him.''
</P>
<P>
   She nervously shut the curtains, sat down on the edge of the bed
in the dark room and buried her face in her hands, crying
uncontrollably. Her stomach churned, and she couldn't keep her
hands from shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, the scene never changed; only the motel rooms
did. As she ran for personal freedom and a say in her own life, the
world that once seemed to be hers was crashing down on Moceanu's
tiny shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified of my own father,'' Moceanu said. ``That was
the saddest part. I had had enough. I was so tired of everything.
All I ever wanted to be was a daddy's little girl, but I never
could.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a world-class gymnast, a gold-medal winner, a superstar
with the brightest and happiest of personalities. But for years she
had suffered under a secret torment until she simply could not take
it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the athletes who will face the nation's media this
weekend at the United States Olympic Committee Media Summit, none
figures to be grilled and prodded more than this beautiful
18-year-old gymnast whose ugly tale of oppression and misguided
ambition spun out of control in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu's successful lawsuit for emancipation from her parents
made worldwide headlines and made her dream of making the 2000
Olympic Team a long shot. But she will be here today, taller and so
much different than before, but ready to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Shoulders back, chin up. We've seen the classic gymnast's pose
before, but on Moceanu it no longer is something done only for
judges.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a symbol for her life. Come on, world, take your
best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Her story was a complex one that never seemed to end. As reports
about Moceanu's personal life spun out of control, every time she
turned on the TV there were more images of her standing in a
Houston courtroom fighting back tears and solemnly taking a stand
against the father whom deep down she loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love him,'' Moceanu said, ``but it was hard liking the
things that happened. I loved gymnastics, and I still do. It's my
whole life. It's all I want. But he acted like I was a machine. I
know in his heart he's good, and he had good intentions, but things
just got out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 Games, during which Moceanu helped lead the
United States to its first-ever team gold medal in gymnastics, the
pressure heaped upon her by her parents grew outrageous. She smiled
and struck the happy, confident pose for the judges, but everything
she did was monitored closely and critiqued.
</P>
<P>
   Where she went. What she ate. How she trained. Her father
screened telephone calls and ridiculed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I was allowed to leave the house, sometimes my father
would send my mother to follow me to make sure no one corrupted my
mind,'' she said. ``I was like, `Guys, I want the gold medal more
than anyone, but I want to have a life, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the Games, the pressures did not subside as Moceanu had
hoped. During a post-Olympic tour, she earned more than $100,000
doing gymnastics exhibitions with the ``Magnificent Seven.'' But
she knew little of the great sums of money she was earning, knowing
only that her father controlled everything to the point that she
said he forged her name on numerous endorsement contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (Olympic teammates) were talking about investing in stock
with the money they were earning, and I was like, `What's stock?'''
she said. ``I was totally in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   With his daughter's money, Dumitru Moceanu financed a
75,000-square-foot gym in northwest Harris County. He continued to
push his daughter to train and make appearances and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial for emancipation, testimony revealed that
Dumitru Moceanu physically abused Dominique and squandered much of
the money she had earned. The gym ultimately closed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Dominique rented a small apartment near Spring High
School, Dumitru Moceanu continued to telephone his daughter asking
for forgiveness and for her to come home. Often, he would wait
outside her high school and confront her or follow her to the
apartment in his car.
</P>
<P>
   A restraining order was placed against Dumitru Moceanu and
police later found cause to investigate him for a murder-for-hire
plot against one of the friends who helped Dominique run away and
then-coach Luminita Miscenco. The investigation and restraining
order eventually were dropped, but trying to find her way to
Sydney, Moceanu hopped from gym to gym and coach to coach,
anguishing about the bold strike for freedom she had made.
</P>
<P>
   She went from Orlando, Fla., to Colorado Springs, Colo., to
Cincinnati, where she now trains with 1996 Olympic coach Mary Lee
Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream began so innocently, but the innocence vanished,''
Moceanu said. ``My life was twisted and split into all these
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Moceanu knows what to expect this weekend. More than 300
members of the media from across the United States and several
other nations will want to know more. They'll want to dissect the
story, delve into the past and talk about all those agonizing
memories.
</P>
<P>
   But Moceanu says its time for everyone to move on. Her Olympic
dream for 2000 is alive and well despite it all. She wants to stand
there in front of the cameras again and make a stand.
</P>
<P>
   Look out, world _ Dominique Moceanu is in the best shape she's
been in since winning the Goodwill Games all-around gold in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After so many setbacks and not training for months because of
the ordeal with her family, Moceanu now is looked upon by USA
Gymnastics officials as a legitimate contender to make another
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she's doing it for herself. This time, she is nearly
a foot taller than the pixie who captured the world's imagination
in 1996. And how could she not grow up in so many other ways, too?
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu agreed to talk about her troubled past for this space
only because she wants to put it to rest once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to discuss it anymore because it's a chapter
that is over,'' she said. ``It's a closed subject. I've moved on,
and I hope everybody else can respect that and move on, too. My
whole life right now is about reaching the next dream. My whole
focus right now is on making it to Sydney. It's all I live for.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu's mother, Camelia, and sister, Christina, have moved
into an apartment with her in Cincinnati. She has begun rebuilding
her relationship with her father and says Dumitru has been
supportive and respectful of her right to live and train on
different terms than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She visits Dumitru on trips back to Houston, but mostly she
speaks with him by telephone, and only rarely does the subject
matter turn to gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship is kind of in neutral right now,'' she said.
``He's letting me live and train. He's really been great about it.
You know, neither of us can change what has happened, but we're
letting it be. When this is all over, I want him back the way I
know he can be. That will be my next goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, her present dream is all she wants to talk about.
Only three months ago, Moceanu was considered a long shot to make
the team. But under Tracy's guidance, she has blossomed into what
team coordinator Bela Karolyi has called ``a real contender.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Proving people wrong just feels so good,'' Moceanu said. ``I
know a lot of people thought I didn't have a chance after
everything that happened. They wrote me off. But just being there
on the Olympic team one last time would be the perfect end to the
story. I want to leave on a good note. It's so much harder when you
get older and you grow up. But you know, I'm pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   She has had to be.

AVOIDING PENALTIES IS CRUCIAL FOR DEVILS AGAINST FLYERS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Eastern Conference finals between
the Devils and the Flyers that will start Sunday afternoon in
Philadelphia will be decided on physical strength, goaltending and
special teams, with the special teams perhaps the key factor in the
best-of-7 series.
</P>
<P>
   While the Flyers have been the most effective team in the
Stanley Cup playoffs with the man advantage, the Devils have been
the most efficient at killing penalties. They extinguished all 20
Toronto power plays and have allowed just one goal in 34 power
plays in the playoffs for a remarkable 97.1 efficiency. The only
power-play goal the Devils allowed was to Florida's Pavel Bure in
the fourth game of the sweep of the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have had such remarkable success thwarting the
opposition with the man advantage, avoiding penalties against the
Flyers is a priority for the Devils. With John LeClair and Mark
Recchi leading the way, the Flyers have been deadly on the power
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penalties is a no-no for us,'' Bobby Holik said after Saturday
afternoon's practice before the Devils traveled to Philadelphia.
``They're too dangerous on the power play, and we don't want to put
ourselves in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers have scored 13 goals in 52 chances (25 percent) with
the man advantage for almost half of their total playoff goal
production of 29. LeClair leads the team with four power-play
goals, while Recchi and the rookie Simon Gagne are next with two
each.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair leads the Flyers with six goals in the playoffs, and his
10 points are second to Recchi, who has three goals and nine
assists for 12 points. Recchi plays the point on the power play,
and his quarterbacking ability has been a key to its success.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are good hockey players,'' Devils defenseman Scott
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play them tough because they capitalize on their
opportunities,'' said Stevens, who will be paired with the rookie
Brian Rafalski against Philadelphia's top line.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was the best player in the first two rounds for the
Devils. He said he was looking forward to the series with the
Flyers ``because they are more of a rivalry'' than Toronto and
Florida. ``It's almost like the Rangers,'' Stevens said, ``and,
personally, I go back a long way against them when I was in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and the Devils have lost just once in their last eight
games to the Flyers. They beat Philadelphia four of the five times
the teams met in the regular season, but only once since Brian
Boucher, the rookie sensation, became the No. 1 goaltender for the
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win in the playoffs without goaltending and special
teams,'' said Ken Daneyko, who pairs with Stevens on defense on the
Devils' primary penalty-killing unit, which has John Madden and Jay
Pandolfo at forward. Claude Lemieux and Sergei Nemchinov are the
other two forwards killing penalties, along with defensemen Scott
Niedermayer and Vladimir Malakhov.
</P>
<P>
   While the Devils are healthy with the exception of Krzysztof
Oliwa, who was not expected to play in the playoffs, the Flyers are
without Eric Lindros, who has been out with a concussion throughout
the playoffs, and Keith Primeau. Primeau practiced with the Flyers
Saturday, however, and there is an outside chance he will play
Sunday. If not in Sunday's first game, Primeau will most likely
play on Tuesday in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure he will play sooner or later,'' Devils coach Larry
Robinson said. ``They are more physical with him, but what makes
them so good is that their power play is so dangerous. Our penalty
killers will have to do their best against them.''

DRIVEN AND OPTIMISTIC, THE CLASS OF 2000 PREPARES TO GREET THE
WORLD  
</HEADLINE>
 BC- GRADS-FUTURE -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR and LYNN FRANEY, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Call them the click, click, click class,
raised to the fast pace of pagers, cell phones, video games, the
Internet and the TV remote control.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, thousands of members of the Class of 2000
_ possibly the most scrutinized graduates in generations _ will be
handed their high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the students, and they will tell you they are focused,
ambitious, confident and optimistic about their future. They also
say they are more worldly, independent and technologically savvy
than graduating classes of just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are nowhere near as naive about what happens in our
world,'' said Nadia Curren of Northeast High School.
</P>
<P>
   That self-assessment is backed by research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-agers today are optimistic, recognize they're going to
have several different jobs during their lifetime and are very
competitive academically,'' said Barbara Schneider, a University of
Chicago professor and co-author of The Ambitious Generation:
America's Teenagers, Motivated but Directionless. The book is based
largely on a comprehensive study of 7,000 teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could they be studying more? Sure,'' Schneider said. ``Could
they be kinder to each other? You bet. But these are not slackers,
these are not kids that do not have dreams, and to me that's very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers who have watched the class since it entered
kindergarten in 1987 worry that the pace of life and the
bombardment of media and computer images are taking a toll on these
children of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   They say students might be too busy for their own good. Many
teens are overscheduled _ after-school play has given way to jobs,
community service, sports and other activities. That is especially
true for girls today, compared with their mothers and their
grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists, counselors, parents and others are still anxious
about the all-too-familiar dangers of alcohol, tobacco and teen
pregnancy. But new perils, including school massacres and hate
crimes, now crowd into their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   They also worry about the pressure students place on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these teens have grown up with two working parents, or
parents involved in multiple marriages and divorces. They have
learned to fend for themselves and take responsibility at a younger
age.
</P>
<P>
   Many have their own cars and their own incomes, and spend many
more hours with their friends than with their families.
</P>
<P>
   They are bull-market babies accustomed to the prosperity of a
soaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   All that has made them believe they are more self-reliant. But
some observers worry that the newfound independence is creating a
generation that is too materialistic, less civil and less
respectful of adults' wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Even teens themselves say a decline in social and moral values
is the biggest problem confronting their generation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is no surprise to an age group immersed in the images
of Jerry Springer, the O.J. Simpson trial, the presidential sex
scandals and the murderous rampage at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mentally older than even the senior class of ten years
ago because of what we've witnessed,'' said Taryn Hodison, senior
at Lincoln Prep High School.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to members of the Class of 2000, and they'll tell you
they can feel the pressure to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I sit down and think, `Gee, I'm going so fast,
everything around me is going so fast,'' said Angela Liu of
Pembroke Hill School. She won a four-year scholarship to attend the
University of North Carolina and already has earned credit for 11
college courses. ``Sometimes I feel like I just can't relax and
breathe. But it's so exciting _ just the things happening around us
right now. We have so much opportunity to learn things and get
involved in things.''
</P>
<P>
   And most plan to keep on learning.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company that administers the ACT college
entrance test, three-fourths of the Class of 2000 said two years
ago that they would go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Marybeth Kravets, president-elect of the National Association
for College Admission Counseling, said students today saw college
as essential, not an educational bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finding that, statistically, the ability to make a
living is directly related to how much education you have,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the competition for admission to prestigious schools is
growing, and teens seem more fixated on grades than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   That trend troubles Kravets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep reminding parents that these are 16- and 17-year-olds.
We need to let them be 16 or 17.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu sees another disadvantage to students being so driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``People become way too competitive and try to bring others down
and really hurt other people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some even break the rules to get ahead in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent survey of high achievers conducted by Who's
Who Among American High School Students, 80 percent of students
admitted cheating in school. More than half of those said they
considered cheating no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to members of the Class of 2000, and they'll tell you
they're a diverse, creative, independent bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I describe our class, I don't try to put people in
groups,'' said Melissa Hollon of Grandview High School. ``We're
flexible. We fluctuate from one group to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollon's parents divorced when she was in the sixth grade, and
she has lived since then with her mother. Hollon said she had
worked for several years and usually came home on weeknights by 11
p.m. and on the weekends by 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Young people today seem more independent and focused, agreed
Dennis Schemmel, director of the UMKC Counseling and Placement
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seems to be coming earlier,'' Schemmel said.
``There's lots of opportunities for these kids to see the bigger
world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But some high school counselors say the students have been on
their own for so long that they have an inflated sense of
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see that they feel they can do things, but they don't want
to be responsible for them,'' said Bob Tessman, counselor at Blue
Valley Northwest High School. ``They think they're more mature than
they are.'' Adjusting to change
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the members of the Class of 2000, and they'll tell you
they will thrive in a digital, high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   The ACT survey found that the most popular career choices for
the class of 2000 were science-related.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the changing times, almost as many females as
males are interested in careers in science and mathematics, an
increase from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Barrows, a Grandview High counselor, said the boom in
computers and technology had positive and negative effects on the
Class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good part is we have some independent learners who seek
out things,'' she said. ``But it does create less of an attention
span for traditional kinds of things _ a little more impatience to
get to some relevant things.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Pinizzotto, dean of the new Missouri Academy of Science,
Mathematics, and Technology, said some students today were too
dependent on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe, `If we can't find it technologically, we aren't
going to find it,'' he said. ``They want information
instantaneously. If they can't find it on the Web, they oftentimes
won't go to the library, even though there's so much more detailed
information in the library.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Swagerty, teaches the multimedia class at Broadmoor
Technical Center in Overland Park. Formerly an accounting teacher,
he has had to learn the programs right along with the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've noticed more than anything else from the Class of
2000 is that they're able to adjust to change so much faster and so
much easier,'' he said. ``They were raised in an era where change
was the norm. They're more flexible. In the real world, there's
change in workplaces too, and a whole lot of it is being driven by
technology. These students are going to fit in just fine with that
world.''

STUDENTS' FUND-RAISING DRIVE GIVES KEMPER MILITARY SCHOOL NEW LIFE
 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- KEMPER-SAVED-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY OSCAR AVILA, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOONVILLE, Mo. _ This year's graduates of Kemper Military School
and College received more than diplomas from school President
Edward Ridgley on Saturday. They also earned his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   At the school's commencement, hundreds officially learned that
Kemper's 156th graduating class would not be its last. By
bombarding alumni with written pleas, students helped raise about
$650,000 in the last two weeks, enough to keep Kemper open for the
next academic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for me,'' Ridgley said, his voice
breaking. ``Your actions and conduct over the last two weeks have
proven a great example for all of us. You inspired me and many
others. For that, I thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will proudly move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgley's announcement turned what could have been a sad final
chapter for Kemper into a day of celebration at the oldest military
school west of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper's crisis was made public May 1, when officials announced
that the school would close unless it raised $1.3 million. Students
wrote hundreds of letters and posted pleas on the schools Web site,
www.kemper.org.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account the recent fund raising, the board of
trustees voted unanimously Friday to keep the school open. The
school plans a reduced summer schedule but a full academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials offered few details on how the additional $650,000
would be raised but said some expenses would be cut. In addition,
they think that, based on the success of the students' fund
raising, more donors will come forth.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of the reprieve began circulating Friday night, but the
official word did not come until the graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday students _ most dressed in dark-blue coats, pressed
white slacks and shiny black shoes _ marched crisply to their seats
as the commandant barked orders. They saluted as they passed school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the ceremony, an officer shouted, ``Dismissed!''
Students immediately hurled their hats to the heavens. The band
broke into a lively song, punctuated by gun salutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These students have a lot of soul,'' said graduate Andrew
Kulas of Titusville, Fla. ``I knew they would pour out all their
blood, sweat and tears to keep the school open.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, alumni and officials said the crisis had strengthened
the ties among the Kemper community. Tradition is never far away at
the school, where plaques commemorate alumni known as ``old boys.''
Even first-year students can rattle off a list of prominent
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton, a graduate of Wentworth Military Academy
in Lexington, conceded in his commencement address that after the
announcement, ``anything I have to say today is anticlimactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Skelton urged the students to keep their tradition alive and
never back away from doing their duty in life.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Mackey of Kansas City, a first-year junior college
student, said he thought it was his duty to help keep the school
alive.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled seeing boxes of letters to alumni in the school's
mailroom. At Kemper, he said, he feels part of something important.
The sacrifices of previous students are never far from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our duty to uphold the standards they set,'' Mackey said.
``It was our duty, and our privilege, to keep the school open for
them. It's also for the students coming 10 years down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   John William Rhodes III, a 1961 graduate, does not know any of
Kemper's current students. His son graduated in 1989, but he
considers all of Kemper's students part of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes came to Boonville this weekend from Grand Rapids, Mich.,
with the assumption that Kemper would close. His mother died
recently, and he had hoped to honor her by establishing a
scholarship at Kemper. Because of the possible closure, he feared
he would never get that chance.
</P>
<P>
   He thanks the current students for giving him the opportunity.
Now he plans to repay future students with the scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not know them, but we all feel the connection of
Kemper,'' Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said he hated Kemper at first but now loved the school
deeply. That is a common sentiment among students and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Pieper, the high school's valedictorian, said she clashed
with teachers in her early days. But she said that rebellion had
turned into respect for Kemper, especially in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was once in my prayers that Kemper would close,'' she told
the crowd. ``I now pray that it will always remain open.''

MARCHING MOMS SEEK TO UNLEASH COLLECTIVE CLOUT ON CONGRESS  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY By DAVID GOLDSTEIN, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mother's Day or not, the Republican-led Congress is
unlikely to give the moms gathered in Washington today what they
want _ tougher gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how many thousands show up.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year brimming with causes and marches. How long
will the political voltage last after the TV cameras are turned off
the Million Mom March?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a recent poll shows two out of three women think
gun control is more important than the rights of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Up there in the Capitol, current gun legislation is tightly
corked. Any congressman swayed by the movement on the mall can
expect a flush and angry National Rifle Association to write checks
for their opponent this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the so-called soccer moms _ suburban Republican
and independent women _ voted Democratic in 1996, as did the
so-called waitress moms _ blue-collar women _ in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It is two years later, and guess who is worried about how women
voters _ particularly the married ones _ are leaning? Al Gore, the
Democratic candidate, despite his calls for strict, new gun
measures.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Clinton rooted for the mothers and their
cause, contending that the gun lobby ultimately would be ``no
match'' for their passion and organization. But he warned that the
``nationwide fight won't be over tomorrow, no matter how many
match.''  &LR; brk:Hoping for an effect
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to save lives, march supporters argue.
</P>
<P>
   But if even new gun laws do not materialize, perhaps political
power will.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous power once a collective of women set
their minds to change something, especially when they feel it is
related to the safety of their family,'' said Swanee Hunt, director
of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voices heard today will be those of mothers who have
lost family members. Others will express fear that their own
children could become victims of random gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   But with each public shooting _ in a school, an office or a
restaurant _ the emotional debate and polarization grow more
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Require gun show background checks, many demand. Enforce the
laws we have now, others say.
</P>
<P>
   As the marchers gather on the mall, a gun rights group, the
Second Amendment Sisters, will be staging a counterdemonstration
nearby. Its keynote speaker will be Suzanna Gratia Hupp, a Texas
lawmaker who lost her parents when a gunman killed 23 persons in a
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   And Barbara Ledeen, executive director of the Independent
Women's Forum, a nonpartisan policy group, views the Million Mom
March as a ``cynical manipulation of women's desire to protect
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The march organizers look to Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
which started out as a small, grass-roots group by one mother whose
daughter was killed by a drunk driver. It has caused a sea change
in attitudes toward drinking and driving, ushering in new laws and
limits on what is considered publicly acceptable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would never have thought of being able to defeat someone
because they voted against lowering the legal limit for drunk
driving, and now you can,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control supporters also point to the defeat last year in
Missouri of a proposed law to allow the carrying of concealed
weapons. Women voters in Kansas City and St. Louis apparently
helped reject the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Lynn Martin, a Republican from Illinois, was less
convinced that the march would do all that its supporters
predicted. Martin, who voted against gun control in her decade in
Congress, also wondered whether the march, with all the hoopla
surrounding it, was ``turning into a kind of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the marchers can build momentum, said Harriett Woods, a
former Democratic lieutenant governor from Missouri and veteran
women's political activist, ``they could have a tremendous
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, it could be like the Million Man March,
which was a one-day sensation.''  &LR; brk:Powerful voting bloc
</P>
<P>
   This year it is the so-called supermoms _ women juggling work
and children _ who could decide the election.
</P>
<P>
   White men have tended to vote Republican in recent elections,
leading Democrats to rely heavily on the gender gap. `` Women's
issues,'' such as education, health and safety worked well for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush appears to be upsetting those
equations. His approach of ``compassionate conservatism'' on issues
from schools to Social Security has neutralized Democratic attacks
on his record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has strong support among mothers in general, while Gore
does best among unmarried, retired and minority women. A Los
Angeles Times poll last week showed Bush leading by two points
among women, by 15 points among men.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and gun control advocates have tried to paint Bush as being
in the NRA's pocket. He signed a bill allowing concealed weapons in
Texas and does not favor lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has retaliated, again alleging hypocrisy by Gore, who was
more supportive of the NRA as a senator from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's stance on guns _ from a proposed ban on Saturday night
specials to a call for photo licensing of handgun purchasers _ is
one reason he appears to be driving away white men voters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a survey by the Pew Research Center showed a
sharp increase in men favoring gun rights over regulation, probably
a reflection of campaigns by Second Amendment proponents.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush announced in a televised interview Friday that Texas
would begin to distribute free trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show Bush is ahead among women voters on
education, which Republicans believe is a bigger advantage than gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, said Dana Bartimus, the Million Mom March coordinator for
Kansas and Kansas City. Women are ``much more likely to jump ship
for one party or another if a candidate speaks to the cause that
really touches them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in voting for education if you think your
child might be dead. That's the reality. That has scared women down
to their very core.''

KANSAS HIGHWAYS AND ROAD MAPS ENGENDER PASSION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Now comes the summer season, travel, and the
chore of folding and unfolding the Kansas Department of
Transportation's outsized highway map, the guide to Interstate 70,
U.S. 281, Kansas 156 or even some solitary back road.
</P>
<P>
   The map has blue highways, which indicate paved county roads.
Purple _ unpaved. Black and red _ U.S. and state routes. Green _
interstates. Gold _ the Kansas Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   An attractive map. Colorful, functional, informative. Although
sometimes awkward.
</P>
<P>
   For some, though, the map is an instrument of impending doom.
Especially out-of-staters who view the passage across Kansas as
equivalent to spanning the Stygian creek or running, over and over,
the movie version of ``In Cold Blood,'' with its endless highways,
flat land and telephone poles. Kansas, for some, is to be endured.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Richie Kennedy, a senior studying computer science at
the University of Kansas here. Want to know about Kansas roads? Ask
Kennedy. He knows where they are.
</P>
<P>
   All of them.
</P>
<P>
   And more.
</P>
<P>
   Take Kansas 96, favored by generations of drivers to go from far
southeastern Kansas all the way to Tribune on the far western edge
of the state. This year the eastern half of Kansas 96 was lopped
off the map and replaced by a new designation called U.S. 400. Now
Kansas 96 runs only west of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy knows something about Kansas 96 most don't. Its
designation comes from a telephone number, specifically that of
F.W. ``Woody'' Hockaday's auto parts store in Wichita back in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Before seven-digit dialing and area codes, Wichita
``automobilists'' asked the central operator for ``96.'' Hockaday
provided everything from a Model T's planetary gear to upholstery
for a rumble seat,
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Hockaday, incidentally, is voluminously chronicled
at the State Historical Society in Topeka. He bought the first
ticket at Kansas City's new Union Station, marked Kansas roads at
his own expense (his ``H'' signs cleverly led back to his
emporium), once tried to jump in a car carrying President Franklin
D. Roosevelt so he could ``shine his shoes'' and died in a Missouri
sanitarium in 1947, age 63. His name was put forth in the 1950s as
one fitting for the new toll road between Kansas City and Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   So Kennedy knows that. Then there's Kansas 1, a route most
Kansans don't even know exists. Kansas 1 runs 13 miles north from
the Oklahoma border, through the wondrously named hamlet of
Buttermilk, and to just south of Coldwater in Comanche County.
Kansas 1, says Kennedy, was once far more conspicuous on Kansas
road maps, running all the way from Oklahoma to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Does Kansas 12 strike a bell? A few years ago Kansas 12 was
supposed to carry motorists from Interstate 435 west to Kansas 7.
That plan was axed when the Department of Transportation turned
over the road to Shawnee, which called it Shawnee Mission Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to Kennedy, Kansas 12 once spanned the state from
Cherokee County in the southeast to Morton County in the southwest
and was a feeder route for the Dust Bowl refugees heading west in
their old jalopies, looking for work and a better life. In the
1930s, Kansas 12 was renamed U.S. 160.
</P>
<P>
   Then, says Kennedy, there's Kansas 238, a true oddity. When the
Missouri river flooded in 1951, it left behind an oxbow called
Browning Lake. To get to St. Joseph's Rosecrans Memorial Airport, a
motorist must take U.S. 36 to west Elwood, Kan., turn north on
Kansas 238, cross the oxbow and re-enter Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy thinks that Kansas 238 is an example of how road maps
aren't just large pieces of paper with colored print on them. Road
maps, he says, are stories.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kennedy is the first to admit that a zeal for Kansas
highways is hardly on a plane with presidential politics, the
latest Hollywood epic, or a $360 million-dollar lottery drawing,
events that fascinate the media.
</P>
<P>
   But then Kennedy subscribes to the theory that lots of people
have other, interior lives than the ones they're pigeonholed with.
While he intends to make a living from computer science, he says
he'll still have a zest for roads, road signs, trains, sports, and
the ins and outs of local radio.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Kennedy has created a good-sized Web site,
www.route56.com, that showcases his avocations.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the site is revealing, The 20-year-old Lawrence
native admits to being taken by U.S. 56, (old 50-North) that cuts a
bias across Kansas from Mission Hills to Elkhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the green signs,'' said Kennedy. ``Years ago
they experimented with white numbers on green signs, then went to
black on white. I still think the green signs look a whole lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   On Kennedy's Web site the armchair motorists can type in a route
number and see where it goes, what counties it passes through, what
roads it intersects with, view photographs and find a smattering of
the history behind the road.
</P>
<P>
   Such as Kansas 10, the Lawrence to Kansas City road for those
who want to avoid tolls on the Kansas turnpike. Kansas 10 once ran
all the way to Herington in the middle of the state. And parts of
it were north of the Kansas river.
</P>
<P>
   Or U.S. 24. It used to be U.S. 40 North. U.S. 69? For a number
of years it was U.S. 73 East.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also likes what he calls remnants, such as Kansas 8. On
the map that road is clearly visible northwest of Smith Center,
where it runs 16 miles from Kensington to the Nebraska border. But
look down at the bottom of the map, Kennedy says, and there's a
tiny, 1.7-mile-long stretch of road _ also numbered Kansas 8 _
running from Oklahoma to the town of Kiowa.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, reveals Fred Holthaus, a cartographer for the
Transportation Department, the state is limited to 10,000 miles of
road by legislative statute. That's a lot of roads _ the third-most
in the nation _ and it takes some jiggling to keep the mileage at
that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Add a road, and we have to turn the old road over to a county
or city,'' he said. ```But usually it works out about even. We
build a bypass, say, around Pleasanton, and we take off the road
that used to pass through town.''
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to the 10,000-mile rule, adds Holthaus, are
roads to state lakes. They are exempt from the count.
</P>
<P>
   The longest state routes are Kansas 4 and Kansas 9, both
starting in Atchison County and running well over 300 miles out to
western Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   And the shortest route? That honor goes to Kansas 247 at Ellis,
which is 649 feet in length from I-70 to the Ellis city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's the kind of stuff Kennedy and the thousands who have
visited his Web site like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spend some time on it,'' said Kennedy, ``and you'll never get
lost. I guarantee it.''

AMERICANS BECOME MORE EAGER TO UNDERGO COSMETIC SURGERY  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JULIUS A. KARASH and JOYCE SMITH, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Spurred by rising disposable incomes and an
ongoing obsession with youth, more and more Americans are climbing
onto surgical tables for face lifts, liposuctions and other
cosmetic surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Demand more than doubled between 1997 and 1999, to 4.6 million
surgical and nonsurgical procedures, according to a survey by the
American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And while women account for the great majority of cosmetic
procedures _ 89 percent were performed on females in 1999 _ men and
even teen-agers are growing markets for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Geraghty, a Kansas City plastic surgeon, said the surge
in cosmetic procedures was largely due to greater awareness by
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are articles and advertisements for cosmetic surgery in
every magazine and newspaper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening in Overland Park, Kan., more than a dozen
people showed up for wine, hors d'oeuvres and a cosmetic surgery
seminar presented by plastic surgeon John Michael Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn showed his audience before-and-after slides of patients
who had undergone procedures such as breast implants, breast
reductions and liposuction, or the removal of fat.
</P>
<P>
   Such procedures can lift a person's self-esteem, Quinn said. ``I
think it's important that, six months or six years down the road,
you feel that you got your money's worth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we care to admit it or not, looks are a major component
of our everyday decisions on how we spend our money. And Madison
Avenue knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers take these 16-year-olds and make them look like
they are 21, and even then they are airbrushed,'' said Georgianna
Reid, who operates an international cosmetics company in Kansas
City. ``Then they go crazy over them. Why, after a certain age, do
they make us feel like we are over the hill?''
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that too many consumers are getting cosmetic surgery
for the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Zerbe, a psychiatrist and professor at the Menninger
Clinic in Topeka, Kan., said interest in cosmetic surgery was
``certainly related to our youth-obsessed culture. We all want to
be one of those 50 most beautiful people on the cover of People
magazine, and we're not going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Zerbe said some of those seeking cosmetic surgery were afflicted
with body dysmorphic disorder, an obsessive preoccupation with an
imagined or slight defect in appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery industry frequently generates controversy.
While people seldom die in cosmetic surgery, some tend to look at
such deaths differently than, say, someone dying in heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This difference in outlook occurs because cosmetic surgery is
the patient's choice, Geraghty said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week women's health advocates sharply criticized a
government ruling that saline-filled breast implants made by two
California companies could stay on the market despite warnings that
they broke open at ``alarmingly high'' rates.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said statistics were limited regarding medical
complications that resulted from cosmetic surgery. In 1998 the
group now known as the American Society of Plastic Surgeons
reported that out of 24,295 liposuctions performed by
board-certified plastic surgeons, there were 70 cases that involved
significant complications, representing less than 0.3 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing legions of cosmetic surgery patients point up
that many of us flinch when we see wrinkles and bulges in our
mirrors. More and more, we are willing to get our skin stretched
and our fat sucked out to improve the way we look.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bottom was about an inch or two lower than it was 10 years
ago, and I had a little paunch,'' said Shawn Bergen, a 38-year-old
Prairie Village, Kan., resident who recently had body contouring
and upper eyelid surgery. ``They were minor flaws, but they
bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   Advances in techniques, such as laser technology for skin
resurfacing, have blossomed amid the bumper crop of cosmetic
surgery patients. Geraghty said that laser technology was less
painful and was safer than older methods, and that patients
recovered from it faster.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors include better overall surgical techniques that
use local anesthesia, Geraghty said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the growing demand, more and more physicians are
performing face lifts, eye lifts, tummy tucks, liposuctions and
breast augmentations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery,
some of the most popular procedures performed in 1999 were chemical
peels, laser hair removal, liposuctions, breast augmentations and
face lifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing growth in all segments of our cosmetic surgery
practice,'' said Thomas Faerber, an Overland Park cosmetic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this work lucrative, with typical procedures costing
thousands of dollars, but those who perform them typically get paid
in cash because health insurance companies do not cover most
cosmetic surgeries. Some consumers take out personal loans from
companies formed specifically to finance cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While some choose cosmetic surgery to feel better about their
appearances, such procedures also can help patients with
disabilities or those dealing with the impact of accidents or
cancer surgery. Other patients have business reasons to improve
their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendant June Young, who had cosmetic surgery in Kansas
City, works in a youth-oriented industry and felt she would be
taken more seriously if she looked younger.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons are just personal. Some people have cosmetic
surgery because they feel they are aging much more quickly than
their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said she had cosmetic surgery to get rid of what she called
a ``tired appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Faerber said many of his patients were going through a major
change, such as a divorce or new job.
</P>
<P>
   And more men are going under the cosmetic knife, laser or
suction tube. Last year 11 percent of cosmetic procedures were
performed on men, according to the American Society for Aesthetic
Plastic Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Faerber said some men were doing this in response to competition
from younger men on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Other men just want to look and feel better. ``I was putting on
weight in areas that made me feel terribly uncomfortable, and I
couldn't take it off,'' said Steve Bolton, who owns a Kansas City,
Kan., engraving business with his mother and his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton, 46, had liposuction in 1998. ``Right off the bat, I lost
7 pounds,'' he said. ``And I feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite many patients' being happy with their results, critics
still raise concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Peter S. Obetz, a Kansas City lawyer who specializes in medical
malpractice cases with the firm of Bartimus, Frickleton &AMP; Presley,
said prospective patients ``should not be swayed by a physician's
yellow pages ad or by the appearance of their building. You can
have a flashy, beautifully decorated building in a nice
neighborhood, and that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get
good quality care.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some members of the industry say they are bothered by some
marketing strategies. Some of that marketing is geared toward
teen-agers, who currently represent only a small percentage of
cosmetic surgery patients.
</P>
<P>
   Geraghty said he was opposed to breast augmentation or
liposuction being performed on teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a travesty,'' Geraghty said. ``They haven't lost their
baby fat. They're not at their height of maturity physically and
mentally and emotionally. And if they have a complication, it would
be very hard for them to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Geraghty decried what he called the ``sleazing'' of
cosmetic surgery. By that, he said, he means ``false advertising,
too much hype, selling unnecessary procedures to patients and being
driven by the dollar rather than a good surgical result.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons themselves caution prospective patients not to expect
too much from cosmetic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone puts too many expectations on the surgery, that can
be disappointing,'' Faerber said. ``It can make them feel better
about their appearance, but it won't guarantee them a new job or a
new spouse.''

MISUNDERSTOOD EDMONDS STARS IN ST. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jim Edmonds loved the Angels and hated them at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his emotions were mixed when he was traded March 23
to the Cardinals. He was crying one minute, celebrating the next.
</P>
<P>
   And now, to no one's surprise, Edmonds is becoming a superstar.
He's at the top or near the top of almost every offensive category
in the National League: Eleven homers, 28 RBI, .406 average, 34
runs, 31 walks, .532 on-base percentage, .792 slugging percentage,
etc., etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   And now a six-year, $57-million contract with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds always has been a megastar waiting to happen. The Angels
knew it and so did everybody else in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Angels fielded so many calls about Edmonds and
why his name popped up in trade rumors so often. Edmonds always
said he would have liked assurances from the front office he
wouldn't be traded. But those assurances never came until the very
end, when it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Former GM Bill Bavasi never gave Edmonds that security because
in the business of baseball it doesn't make sense. He learned that
from his father, Buzzie, the former Dodgers and Angels GM.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzie watched over the years how Edmonds was handled and how
Edmonds reacted to his situation. And he thought about contacting
Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen (Mickey) Mantle, Duke (Snider) and (Willie) Mays,''
Buzzie said last year when Edmonds was still an Angel. ``(Edmonds)
can catch the ball like all of 'em. I was going to write him a
note, but I didn't. I wanted him to know I went through the same
thing with Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every two weeks, the New York papers said Duke was going to be
traded. Duke wanted me to assure him I wouldn't. But I said I
couldn't do that. What if somebody offered me two 20-game winners,
and I made the trade? Then you'd call me a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was an All-Star and won two Gold Gloves while with the
Angels, but he never reached his potential. A lot of it had to do
with injuries, which played a big role in what his teammates
thought of him.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels in recent years were broken up into distinct cliques,
and one of those cliques couldn't stand Edmonds' demeanor. Dave
Hollins, Gary DiSarcina, Darin Erstad and coach Larry Bowa were the
old-school, down-in-the-dirt hardballers. You get hit by a pitch,
you rub some dirt on it and keep going.
</P>
<P>
   They'd see Edmonds crash into the wall making a catch, roll
around like he was hurt, then get up and smile. It drove them
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   They misunderstood Edmonds, just as it seems he misunderstood
the Angels' front office, whether Bavasi was in the GM's seat or
Bill Stoneman.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing his name mentioned in rumors didn't necessarily mean he
was being shopped, or unwanted or unappreciated. It meant teams
were asking about him. And when you're a team that has four
outfielders, one of whom isn't a favorite among teammates, word
gets out.
</P>
<P>
   But Edmonds seemed to look at it as being unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   If Edmonds was unwanted and the Angels didn't know his value,
Stoneman would have traded him to the A's for a package of
minor-leaguers when he had the chance. Instead, Stoneman held out
and got pitcher Kent Bottenfield, an All-Star and 18-game winner in
1999, and second baseman Adam Kennedy, who is hitting .304 and is a
top candidate to win the AL Rookie of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels knew what they had in Edmonds. After all, they could
have traded him for Mark McGwire a few years ago and didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Edmonds and McGwire are teammates. Both grew up in Southern
California, Edmonds in Diamond Bar, McGwire in Claremont. Both have
children living in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is the single-season home-run champion and shooting for
Hank Aaron's all-time record. Edmonds is house hunting in Missouri.
Meanwhile, Edmonds' name and face are larger than life on the
outfield fence at Edison Field, because the fans voted him onto the
Angels' all-time team.
</P>
<P>
   Right up there alongside Chuck Finley. The Indians' Chuck
Finley. But that's another story.

ON A WINDSWEPT SCOTTISH HILL, MOTHER RECALLS LOST CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKERBIE, Scotland _ Sarah Philipps and Julianne Kelly fell to
earth here, on a wee hill that the local folk call Powhaffet.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Dec. 21, 1988, when a terrorist bomb blew apart
Pan Am Flight 103, Philipps and Kelly, college roommates, were
hurtled into space, 31,000 feet above the ground, strapped into
their seats.
</P>
<P>
   While the 257 other passengers and crew were each scattered,
alone, into the troposphere, Sarah and Julianne, two self-described
Boston girls, remained strapped side by side, falling silently
toward the sleepy town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   Across the North Sea, less than 1,000 miles away as the crow
flies, the two men accused of planting the bomb that killed the the
259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground
in Lockerbie are standing trial.
</P>
<P>
   The legal proceedings, held at a former US air base in the
Netherlands, seem a world away from the sheep pasture where
Philipps and Kelly came to rest, face down in the frost-covered
grass, their seats on top of them.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Philipps, Sarah's mother, sat through two weeks of
testimony at Camp Zeist, her emotions on a roller coaster. She
stared at the two suspects, reputed intelligence agents of Libya
whose motive is said to be an abiding hatred of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She took notes and tried not to take it personally when Bill
Taylor, the chief defense counsel and Scotland's most prominent
defense lawyer, suggested that the suspects should be acquitted
because authorities had not done a good enough job sealing off the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   But here, at that very crime scene, Elizabeth Philipps seemed at
peace with herself and that awful night more than 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She comes here every year, usually with her husband and two
sons. But Saturday she was alone, pulling on her wellies and
tramping across the hilly moors for more than a mile until she
reached the precise spot, amid bleating sheep and singing larks,
where Sarah and Julianne landed. It is a pilgrimmage as sacred to
her as any Muslim's walk to Mecca, as any Christian's visit to the
Holy Land, as any Jew's touch of the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah was from Newton, Mass., and Julianne from Dedham, Mass..
They were 20 and did everything together on the Syracuse University
study-abroad program in London. They lived together. They went to
museums and galleries together. They took the train up to Edinburgh
together.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in the middle of this pasture, a cairn, a mound of
stones, which marks the place where Sarah and Julianne came to
rest. It is a traditional memorial, a marking suited for the
windswept moors where Scottish rebels once built cairns for their
warriors who had died at the hands of the English.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Elizabeth Philipps knelt and began rebuilding the
cairn, partially collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think it would be taller,'' she said. ``But when it's
windy, the sheep lie behind it for shelter, and they knock it
over.''
</P>
<P>
   She used scissors that friends from Lockerbie, Bill and Jess
McTaggart, had lent her to trim back reeds that have obscured the
cairn. She paused to listen to the larks. Whenever she comes here
the larks sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nicer than a graveyard,'' Elizabeth Philipps said,
tossing the reeds into a pile.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, nine miles away, she had placed a bunch of roses at the
gray wall with black names that forms the Garden of Remembrance.
Sarah Susannah Buchanan Philipps' name is mispelled on the wall.
There is a ``z'' instead of a second ``s'' in Susannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it our Scottish variant,'' Elizabeth Philipps said,
shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Philipps walked over to a headstone for Sarah and
placed a dime and two Dutch coins at its foot. Five fir trees
stand, like sentinels, on either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah was always looking for money,'' she said, offering a
mother's explanation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Shakespeare sonnet on Sarah's headstone: ``Shall I
compare thee to a summer's day.'' Elizabeth Philipps likes it
because it contains a line that suggests as long as that poem
lives, ``so too shall you live.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wall, Sarah's name is next to Alex Lowenstein's. Sarah
and Alex met on the study-abroad program. They liked each other.
They were flying home on the same flight. A year after they died,
Ervin Philipps, Sarah's father, went to a gathering of victims'
families and stared hard at a man he recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Lowenstein,'' Erv Phillips said to a friend he had not
seen since they were children in Manhattan. ``What are you doing
here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a son on the plane,'' Peter Lowenstein replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a daughter,'' Erv Philipps answered, before the two men
fell silent, unable to say any more.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the authorities returned the journals that
Sarah and Alex had kept. Both had written fondly of each other.
There was a spark. Both died not knowing their fathers were
childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   An act of barbarity brought Elizabeth Philipps here for the
first time, but it has been the humanity of this place that has
kept bringing her back. The people of Lockerbie are decent folk.
Ladies in the town ironed the rumpled clothes of the dead that had
been recovered from the fields, trees and rooftops. The women
mailed the clothes back to America, with humble notes, apologizing
that it was all they could do.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Philipps has never felt sorry for herself, has never
asked why Sarah, why their family. She struck up a correspondence
with a newspaper columnist whose college student son had thrown
himself to his death from a dormitory window while under the
influence of LSD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envy you,'' he told her, ``because you have the other
families. I feel so alone.''
</P>
<P>
   If she feels alone in the pasture where her daughter died,
Elizabeth Philipps doesn't show it. She sometimes fights back
tears, and sometimes talks to her daughter, the chit-chat they
loved to exchange in their kitchen back in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   A jet flew overhead, on its way from Heathrow to America, as Pan
Am Flight 103 did nearly 12 years ago. As the jet's dull roar
faded, the only sound was the wind, which sometimes sounded like
waves lapping up against the shore, and the larks, who always grace
Elizabeth Philipps with song.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Sarah's hill,'' she said, turning to survey the land
where her baby, her youngest, fell. ``She died here, next to a good
friend, surrounded by good friends. This is Sarah's hill.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Straight Talk Express back for one night
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They surrounded him: USA Today, The Washington Post, U.S. News &AMP;
World Report, the Houston Chronicle, the Chicago Tribune, the
Philadelphia Inquirer, The Associated Press. Heck, even Weekly
Standard writer Tucker Carlson, fresh from captivity in Vietnam
(where he was briefly detained while traveling with McCain), was
there.
</P>
<P>
   Over smoked salmon, veal and just-done filet, the one-time
denizens of the Straight Talk Express leaned in. . . . Would he
confirm the story or wouldn't he? That he would he endorse his
former rival the very next morning.
</P>
<P>
   He did confirm it, of course. And it seems somehow fitting that
Sen. John McCain, the man who granted virtually unprecedented
access to political reporters, decided to dine with them the night
before his much-touted meeting with Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters gathered at the Carlton, a swanky-enough
Pittsburgh restaurant, along with McCain, Rick Davis, the former
campaign manager advising Bush, political director John Weaver,
spokesman Todd Harris, administrative assistant Mark Salter and
campaign aide Lanny Wiles.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain said good night, the hardiest souls headed across
the street for more drinks in the chandeliered lobby of the Westin
William Penn Hotel, scene of the next day's summit. Even Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer, who crashed and then never seemed to stop
spinning, was welcome.
</P>
<P>
   McCain hasn't ruled out another run for the White House. He made
it clear in an e-mail sent Wednesday to the approximately 120,000
folks on his database that he remains committed to being ``the
torchbearer of the reform crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Monday night feel poignant for message man Harris, like
it was the end of something?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to me,'' he said. ``It didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   STATES DIVIDED OVER PRIMARY PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders set up a battle between big states and small
states over the GOP's primary calendar last week, in a dispute that
could result in a floor fight at the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The approval by the Republican National Committee's Rules
Committee is the first step toward party acceptance of a
population-based plan for presidential primaries and caucuses. It
calls for voting to begin with less populous states and relegates
the largest to the back of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The committee agreed on starting dates for the four groups of
states in the inverted pyramid plan. The smallest could vote no
earlier than the first Tuesday in February with the other states
given start dates of the first Tuesdays in March, April and May.
The original time frame of March to June was moved up in response
to big-state opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several large-state leaders said the nomination race will
be over before their primaries or caucuses are conducted _ even
though 47 percent of the delegates would be chosen in the final
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a `big state vs. everybody else' battle. We feel we're
getting the short end of the stick here,'' said Ohio state Chairman
Bob Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Among other states voting against the plan were such political
powers as Texas, California, New York, Florida and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   SYNAGOGUE AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY?
</P>
<P>
   What if Jewish people wrote more country music?
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, speaking to a group of Jewish activists
last week, noted his presidential campaign is headquartered in
Nashville, Tenn., and dished up what he called the latest top
``Jewish country-and-western'' tunes to come out of Music City:
</P>
<P>
   No. 4: ``I was one of the chosen people until she chose somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 3: ``The second time she said `Shalom' I knew she meant
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, ``I've got my foot on the glass, now where are you?''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to the No. 1 song title, Gore sang out: ``Mommas,
don't let your ungrateful sons grow up to be cowboys when they
could very easily just have taken over the family business that my
own grandfather broke his back to start . . . that doesn't mean
anything now that you're turning your back on such a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   WHITMAN APPARENTLY NOT ON SHORT LIST
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was asked about vice-presidential candidates in an
interview with the Lifetime women's cable channel Friday, he had
notably different reactions to two names, suggesting that he was
concerned about appearing too open to the idea of a running mate
who supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Elizabeth Dole, an opponent of abortion rights, was on
his list, he said that she was and then praised her as ``a good
friend of mine who has had a great career.'' But when asked about
Gov. Christine Whitman of New Jersey, who supports abortion rights
and whose selection would undoubtedly provoke many religious
conservatives, Bush's response seemed conspicuously restrained.
``There's a lot of people on the list,'' he said.

METS RID OF RICKEY, BUT WOES REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The New York Mets got rid of one major distraction
in Saturday's expected releasing of Rickey Henderson, but it
doesn't solve every problem on the team or in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who lost to the Atlanta Braves in the National League
Championship Series last season, went out and got lefty Mike
Hampton to bolster the staff and were expected to give the Braves a
fight in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mets are 19-19 and in fourth place. They trail
Florida and Montreal, and it's not just Henderson who's expressing
concern over what's transpiring.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Armando Benitez, who signed a four-year, $22-million deal
during the offseason, is off to a hideous start and was bypassed
for John Franco in a closing situation last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Benitez said. ``All I know is that
(manager Bobby Valentine) better respect me. I give (Valentine)
respect, and he better respect me, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would Bobby do that to me? I don't deserve that. I love
John and have nothing against him. But I don't think Bobby should
have got me up in the eighth and then have me sit down so somebody
else could save. What is that?''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Benitez allowed a grand slam to Preston Wilson,
who took his time rounding the bases and then jumped on home plate.
Wilson said he was delivering a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benitez always goes through his antics (a finger-snap), so I
made sure I did that,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mets grew tired of Henderson's act and got rid of
him after Saturday's loss to Florida. Earlier in the week,
Henderson said Valentine ``didn't have a plan'' to keep the Mets in
pursuit of the Braves and the Mets, ``aren't a family right now,
we're not a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The already out-of-control issue spun crazily Friday and
Saturday. Henderson didn't run out a ball he thought was a home run
in Friday's game against Florida, and he caught heat from Valentine
afterward. Henderson said he'd do the same thing again.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, Henderson took umbrage to something
written in the New York Post about the at-bat and yelled at a
reporter. Henderson, who was hitting .219 with two RBI, was
released after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``After considering everything that happened (Friday and
Saturday), something had to be done,'' Mets general manager Steve
Phillips told reporters in New York. ``I think the reasons are
fairly obvious. No matter how much talent you have, if you continue
to create problems and situations, you wear out your welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive offenses: Like nearly everyone else in the game,
Montreal manager Felipe Alou understands the number of runs being
scored in baseball is ridiculous. But he also knows where the
problem lies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because there are bigger and stronger hitters, but
rather there is such a shortage of pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is pitching,'' Alou said. ``We are
desperate looking for pitchers everywhere. We look for them on
rafts washing up (on) shore in Florida. We're looking for them in
Korea, Japan, Australia. That tells you the whole story. Don't tell
me it's the juiced baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not producing enough pitching. When we go
to Japan or Korea or guys defecting from Cuba, I never hear about
anybody looking for sluggers.''
</P>
<P>
   What pitch count?: Phillies ace Curt Schilling came off the
disabled list and, in his second start in his return from shoulder
surgery, pitched a complete-game shutout for his 100th career win.
He allowed 11 hits but threw 125 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up that if a pitcher has a chance for a shutout,
you want to give him a chance to go for it,'' Phillies manager
Terry Francona said. ``Because of the (rehab) program he went
through, he's probably prepared to throw more pitches now than any
of our other pitchers.''

SCIOSCIA: PUDGE BEST CATCHER EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Ivan Rodriguez was the MVP in the American League
last season, and he did it playing the toughest position in
baseball - catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Why he won the award was simply a matter of his overall effect -
offensively and defensively - on any given game.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia caught more games than anybody in
Dodgers history. He ended his career in 1994 while with the
Rangers, though he never got into a game with them. But he did have
a chance to work with a young Rodriguez, then 22 and already a
three-year major-league veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw how much pride he took in catching, you knew it was
just a matter of time,'' Scioscia said. ``We talked a lot about the
importance of handling pitchers and setting hitters up. He was
already on his way. There was no doubt he had the capability of
being a great catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez does it better than anybody now, but where does he
stack up all time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only talk about the guys I've seen, like (Johnny) Bench,
(Carlton) Fisk, (Mike) Piazza, (Gary) Carter and Lance Parrish,''
Scioscia said. ``Bench was the best from that whole group.
Comparing Bench and Rodriguez, Bench had more power. But when you
take everything into consideration, in my book, (Rodriguez) is the
best of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's durable - he's been doing it since he was 19, and he's
showing no signs of slowing down. As for calling games, John was
doing it at an early age. Pudge is acquiring that. They never had a
great pitching staff in Cincinnati, so it says a lot for what John
did for them.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Rodriguez stand out more than anything is his arm.
Opposing managers have to alter their game plan when Rodriguez is
behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the best arm I've ever seen,'' Scioscia said. ``And
that includes Steve Yeager. I never thought I'd see an arm stronger
than Yeager's, but Pudge is lights out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, at 28, still has 10 years or so left in his career,
and Scioscia says there is one more measuring stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pudge retires, it's important when we judge him to count
how many championships he has under his belt,'' he said. ``He's
capable of doing it. I just hope it's not at our expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorable save?: Texas' John Wetteland became the 12th pitcher
in baseball history to get 300 saves when he saved the Rangers'
13-11 victory Friday night over the Angels. But Wetteland probably
won't be eager to tell his grandkids about the milestone moment.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland entered the game with two on and two out in the eighth
inning, the Rangers leading 11-7. He gave up an RBI single to Darin
Erstad then got the third out when Adam Kennedy flied deep to
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers increased their lead to 13-8 in the top of the
ninth, but in the bottom of the ninth, Wetteland yielded a homer to
Mo Vaughn, a double to Tim Salmon and a homer to Garret Anderson to
make it 13-11. He finally got the save, but not before the Angels
had another baserunner and brought the tying run to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fortunate,'' Wetteland said. ``I've worked this
hard for a save lots of times; there are 300 of them in my career,
so you're going to have a lot of these - even more than I care to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, Seattle: He's a future Hall of Famer who seems to
wear out his welcome everywhere he goes. But Rickey Henderson,
released by the Mets, could be headed for the Northwest and find
himself in another pennant race with the Mariners, who are short on
outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Rickey once before (in Toronto), and there were times
then when I thought he might be finished,'' Mariners GM Pat Gillick
told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ``Obviously, he wasn't. But
you don't know how much you are going to get from him. There's
always a chance that you could get a real good burst of 30 or 60
days, something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella was the Yankees manager when
Henderson made a stop in New York in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Twins manager Tom Kelly recently got his 1,000th
career win, all with the Twins. His most memorable? Win No. 96.
That was the win that clinched the AL West in 1987, Kelly's first
full season. ... Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez has only five
losses in 1999-2000, and two have come vs. the Devil Rays. Martinez
was beaten by Dave Eiland last season and Steve Trachsel this
season. ... Royals outfielder Johnny Damon had a streak of leading
off the first inning with a hit in 10 consecutive games. According
to the Elias Sports Bureau, it's the longest such streak in 25
years.

CONTINENTAL RIFT IN CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for the kinder, more diplomatic Ryder Cup competition
that had been promised in the aftermath of last September's WWF
mentality at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Van de Velde, of all people, delivered a few salvos that
have torn apart the myth that the Europeans are able to compete
with the Americans in large part because of team harmony. What set
off Van de Velde was the naming of Mark James as an assistant to
captain Sam Torrance in 2001. Yes, the same Mark James who, as
captain last September, apparently lost his team roster and didn't
discover that Van de Velde, Jarmo Sandelin, and Andrew Coltart were
part of the team until Sunday's singles matches, at which time he
sent them out as sacrificial lambs against Davis Love, Phil
Mickelson, and Tiger Woods, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect me to be pleased at Mark James being involved in
the next Ryder Cup,'' Van de Velde said before the start of this
week's Benson &AMP; Hedges International, being contested,
coincidentally, at The Belfry, where the 2001 Ryder Cup will be
played.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's criticism of James has been consistent for
months, but it took on added intensity when the Englishman was made
part of the 2001 picture. Ian Woosnam is the other assistant, and
having a trio of Brits is something Van de Velde doesn't
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were six continental players on the team last year and
there have been many since 1979 who have played a big part in our
success,'' said the Frenchman, who is playing regularly in the US
this year and proving a huge hit with fans because of his humor and
accessibility. ``But there have only been three continental players
involved in the captaincy. We continentals think differently than
the Brits. You should have somebody there who understands us. We
are more fiery, more temperamental than the Brits.''
</P>
<P>
   James did take a huge gamble last September, not playing three
team members until the singles and thus wearing down key personnel
such as Jesper Parnevik, Sergio Garcia, Paul Lawrie, Lee Westwood,
and Darren Clarke. It was a gamble that backfired when the rusty
rookies went out early and got trounced, adding to the US momentum.
</P>
<P>
   While Van de Velde overlooks the fact that it is common for a
captain to lean on a countryman (Seve Ballesteros picked Spaniard
Miguel Angel Jimenez in 1997), he has a point. If Torrance has
Woosnam, why does he need a second? Particularly James, who managed
to alienate not only the three players he benched, but also
Bernhard Langer (who should have been the captain's pick over
Coltart to begin with) and Robert Karlsson (who was higher in the
standings than Coltart and also felt snubbed).
</P>
<P>
   Give Van de Velde credit, too, for speaking out in 1997 _ even
when he wasn't a team member _ for the shabby treatment afforded
Miguel Angel Martin. The Spaniard had earned a spot on the team,
but a hand injury gave Ballesteros an opening to oust Martin in
favor of Jose Maria Olazabal. After Van de Velde expressed his
displeasure, other European players followed suit, though Martin
was never returned to the competitive team.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of this comes 16 months before the first tee ball
will be struck in the next Ryder Cup, and most likely the flap will
settle down. Torrance, for one, wishes it never started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sooner Jean had come straight to me, rather than told
the world,'' said Torrance, who nonetheless defended his choice of
James. ``Let me say it is a European team: Woosnam is European,
James in European, and Van de Velde is European. I don't care about
personalities. I want them to play their best golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is all Van de Velde wanted to do in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed last year that the captain didn't have
trust in me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My suspicion is the new captain won't, either.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Driver hits a red light
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers can get the meters running, because the first of
what figures to be many lawsuits was filed last week by Callaway
after the Royal Canadian Golf Association ruled that its ERC driver
was nonconforming, agreeing with the US Golf Association. The
controversial club, with a loft of 11 degrees, had been turned down
by the USGA, which cited the infamous ``springlike effect,'' though
Callaway has never tried to sell the club in this country. It has
been on sale in Japan and other parts of the world, where the
governing body is the Royal &AMP; Ancient, not the USGA. The R&AMP;A has
said it will examine the club further before rendering a decision.
Meanwhile, you have to wonder what to believe when one player
(Eduardo Romero) said he hit it 25 yards farther with the ERC while
Golf Digest released a study that reported a minimal difference.
The magazine recruited a PGA Tour player for its test, and he
delivered nine solid drives with a new ERC (9 degree loft) and nine
with the Callaway Hawk Eye; the ERC got about 7 yards more. Even if
Romero is to be believed, then the added distance didn't help him
much, for the Argentine made seven bogeys and a double bogey to
finish well down the list at last week's French Open. Apparently,
the ERC is of no help on the greens, where Romero needed at least
32 putts in three of the four rounds . . . Of course, if and when
the ERC silliness is settled, don't look for Laura Davies to grab
one. She played all 72 holes at last week's Philips Invitational
without once hitting a driver . . . Old-time New England names Joe
Carr, Bob Menne, and Jay Dolan are overseas this weekend, taking
part in the Irish Seniors Open. Bruce Fleisher also is taking a
week off from his American tour of duty to join Christy O'Connor
Jr. in the event at Tulfarris GC.

   We bring you the struggles of the young and old alike. The names
you will recognize _ Justin Rose and Ballesteros _ for they are
quite often making news for the wrong reasons. Rose, the teenager
whose dramatic near-win at the 1998 British Open prompted him to
turn pro, did not earn a spot in this weekend's Benson &AMP; Hedges _
and for good reason. He has missed the cut in eight of his last
nine starts and has qualified for weekend play just five times this
season in 14 attempts. His best finish? A 29th. Four times in 37
rounds he has shot 80 or worse, and as he approaches his 20th
birthday (July 30), he's got to be wondering how it all came
together so easily those four days at Royal Troon. Maybe, in
hindsight, it would have been better in the long run had it not
gone so well that year. As for Ballesteros, his round of 87
Thursday in the Benson &AMP; Hedges featured back-to-back triple
bogeys; most players at that level will play an entire season
without making two triples. He also finished with the dreaded
snowman (that's an 8, folks) on the par-4 18th. For the day,
Ballesteros made more bogeys or worse (nine) than pars (seven) . .
. Chad Campbell returned to the winner's circle at a Hooters Tour
event last week, giving him four victories in five weeks and five
for the season. The former UNLV star has earned $109,682.22, which
is $78,000 clear of the next best on that circuit. Old friend
Andrew Morse of Needham finished in a tie for 36th last week and is
well down the money list (49th, $4,690) . . . Officials at Augusta
National announced that they had donated more than $3 million to
various charities, including $1 million to The First Tee.

   Paul Parajeckas, the head pro/superintendent at Woburn CC, will
play in a qualifier Monday for next week's Senior PGA Tour stop in
Kansas City. ``It's the hard road, but you have to follow your
dream,'' said Parajeckas, who turned 50 April 26. He's been the
most dominant club pro in recent years at the NEPGA level, or since
his friend Dana Quigley left to find fame and fortune with the
over-50 gang. And what advice did Quigley provide? ``He said to do
it, because you belong out here, but he said whatever happens (in
the qualifier), don't get discouraged because there'll be plenty
more chances,'' said Parajeckas, who figures he'll try at least
five and perhaps as many as seven of these Monday qualifiers. Only
three spots are available each week, with the fields sometimes as
deep as 144 players, which prompts Parajeckas to carry one thought
with him: ``Try and shoot 67 or 68 and win the thing.'' . . . The
titanium will be out in force Monday when 96 teams (that's 192
golfers) tee off in the 20th State Four-ball Championship at
Walpole CC. Dean Godek of Agawam Municipal and Alistair Catto of
The Orchards will try to defend their title (they also won in 1989)
against a stellar field that includes four-time winners Jon and
Carter Fasick. Other former champions teeing it up: Burton Page and
Ken Whalley (1985), Steve Tasho and Bruce Chalas (1988, 1994), Cy
Kilgore and Bill Jenks (1995), and Jim Ruschioni with son Jason
(1996) . . . Entries for the State Open topped off at 501, which is
about what the Mass. Golf Association expected given two factors
that worked against getting a lot of participants: 1. the handicap
index was lowered from 4.4 to 2.4; 2. the tournament will be at the
Country Club of Pittsfield, which eliminates many club pros from
Eastern Mass. since they can't commute and are unable to commit to
three days. Three former winners of the event _ Kevin Johnson,
Geoff Sisk, and Fran Quinn _ did not submit applications, choosing
instead to concentrate on their BUY.com Tour seasons . . . The New
England PGA's weekly television show will make its debut next
Sunday in three time slots: 7 a.m. on Channel 56, 11:30 a.m. on
Channel 10 in Providence, and noon on NESN. Pros throughout New
England will be profiled and offer instructions in the show's
10-week run . . . Some pretty hot stuff Thursday by the Quashnet
Valley duo of Bob Chase and Kevan Evangelista, as they combined for
a 63 to win the Cape Cod Chapter NEPGA pro-pro stroke-play event.
Evangelista carded five birdies in a six-hole stretch at Ballymeade

KNIGHT'S TIME UP IN INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reports are coming in from all precincts. Former players,
assistant coaches, secretaries, members of the sports information
staff, even family members. All are linked to Indiana University
coach Bob Knight, and from what we have been hearing over the past
several weeks, the linkage is not necessarily good.
</P>
<P>
   Knight is back home in Indiana, reportedly having cut short a
fishing vacation in the Bahamas to hear what the university's
trustees have to say about all this.
</P>
<P>
   The board will meet Sunday morning in Indianapolis and the
rumors are running rampant. It could come up with everything from a
dismissal to a reprimand to a shrug of the shoulders that life will
go on as it has for the past two decades at Indiana, where Knight
runs the show the way he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   Knight bashing has become popular. Knight threw a vase in the
direction of secretary. Knight attacked his son in a family
argument. Knight physically attacked his sports information
director. Knight kicked IU president Myles Brand out of practice.
</P>
<P>
   These stories have surfaced from time to time, and they are
usually followed by the opposing forces lining up against each
other. The Knight loyalists, apologists _ whatever you want to call
them _ talk about how Knight's players graduate and they don't
break the rules, two things often missing among the elite of
college basketball. His critics say he is a control freak, a bully,
and much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are right. Knight can also be charming and engaging
when he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   What he has been recently, however, has been mysterious. Even
his friends don't know what to make of the man now. Said one coach
who has known Knight and coached against him for years, ``I think
he's a good guy. I like him. But do I understand what he does, why
he acts the way he acts? I haven't a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line seems clear. At 59, Bob Knight still has many
productive years left in coaching. No one argues his basketball
acumen, which ranks with the game's best.
</P>
<P>
   But lately even that has come into question. One of the
trademarks of Knight's teams has been the ability to improve as the
season progresses, peaking in March when the NCAA tournament
arrives. All great coaches strive for that trait in their teams.
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Jim Calhoun has been particularly good at getting
his teams ready in March in recent years, a prime reason why the
Huskies kept closing in on the Final Four the past 10 years, a
trend culminating in their national championship in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for IU, March has been a one-and-done type of
affair lately, with the latest setback coming when the Hoosiers
were knocked out by Pepperdine, 77-57, in the first round this
year. That followed a second-round loss to St. John's a year ago, a
second-round loss to UConn the year before that, a first-round loss
to Colorado the year before that, a first-round loss to Boston
College the year before that, and a first-round loss to Missouri
the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing is to see the difference in Indiana teams
from December, when they seem fresh and eager, as compared with
late February when they seem lifeless and dazed. It's almost as if
they are saying, ``We've had enough of this guy for this season.
Let's just end it and get back to normal college life.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight backers contend that the firestorm is completely outside
the program. Sophomore guard Dane Fife told the Indianapolis Star
last week that if Knight resigned or was fired, he would be gone
from Indiana almost as quickly. ``It's a done deal with me,'' Fife
told the Star. ``I came to Indiana University to play for Coach
Knight. If they force him out, I'm gone, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Knight will be gone when all of the meetings are
finished remains uncertain. He is not about to step down of his own
volition, as evidenced by his statement Saturday. And chances are
the trustees will not take the quantum leap and fire a coach who
has a record of 763-290 and has done it cleanly, while maintaining
the school's academic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   So that leaves IU, as has been the case when Knight's other
moves have become public, in a state of limbo. Only this time, the
focus is much more intense and the national outcry is louder that
the school must control someone who seems clearly out of control.
</P>
<P>
   What IU must understand is that it is still the dog in this
case, not the tail. Yes, Bob Knight has done some marvelous things
for IU and brought the school fame and a modicum of athletic
fortune. But he has also brought some more ominous, malodorous
debris on the school and its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ whether it be a president, a coach, or a sportswriter _
is bigger than a great country, university, or newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana needs to say goodbye to Bob Knight and move on, thanking
him for his contributions and looking forward.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup may be painful, it may be ugly. But it needs to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   For the good of Bob Knight, for the good of the players, and for
the good of the school.

GASTON SPECULATION NOT A HARD SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is the business home of Paul Gaston, the man who
runs the show for the Boston Celtics. He has consistently,
unequivocally, and emphatically stated that he will continue to be
that man.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, are we hearing that he is at least listening more
intently to offers?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he sees skyrocketing prices ($280 million for
the Mavericks and half of their new arena) and, well, he always has
said he has a ``fiduciary duty'' to stockholders, most of whom are
friends or family.
</P>
<P>
   But there also might be a legitimate basketball reason. We can
only speculate, but, a year from now, Gaston might well be without
a coach, without a basketball operations staff, and with the ideal
opportunity to cash in his chips.
</P>
<P>
   We know Larry Bird is interested in becoming part of a new
ownership group. He told the Globe that in February. He has
expressed an interest in building a team, another ``signal'' that
he's ready and willing. He has not given much of a hint as to what
he will do next season. Another ``signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston has said the team is not for sale, and Celtics financial
boss Rich Pond reiterated that position on Friday. But could Gaston
turn his back on $300 million or more? Would that be in the best
interests of stockholders? Would it take $400 million? There's a
lot of money out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul runs it as a business,'' Pond said. ``In that regard, if
someone came to him with an extraordinary offer, he would have to
consider it. But as far as I know, there's no real hard-and-fast
number on what that would be. I can't venture a guess as to what it
would be, but it would have to be more than Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that the Celtics do what we expect them to do next
season, which is to say they play hard but fall short of the
playoffs. (They did finish seven games behind No. 8 Milwaukee this
season.) Let's take Rick Pitino at his word _ always a risky
proposition _ and say that he leaves and takes his people with him.
What does Gaston do? Hire Brian Hill? Del Harris? Don Chaney? Bill
Hanzlik? Dick Motta?
</P>
<P>
   Gaston is, above all, a businessman. The Celtics would be a
mess. They'd be capped out and have limited trading opportunities.
But they'd still be the Celtics, which means $$$. That would seem
to be an ideal time to sell. The new group, with a reputable,
credible front man like Bird, would be given serious honeymoon
time, such as Michael Jordan is now getting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Celtics could get hot next season, make the
playoffs, fill the FleetCenter to the rafters, and Pitino would
stay right where he is. Which do you think is more likely?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After sale, you get change
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Grizzlies are under new ownership, and former
Pacers coach, Pistons assistant, and general gadfly Dick Versace is
actually running the operation. That's a scary thought. Meanwhile,
former boss Stu Jackson, who was on life support for basically the
whole season, jumped before he was pushed, landing a job in the NBA
office. ``Honestly, the whole year was bizarre,'' Jackson said.
``There were two sales. There were some real extreme circumstances
we had to deal with. There was uncertainty all season that
surrounded the team.'' How bizarre? Well, even before the second
sale to Chicago-area businessman Michael Heisley was consummated,
the new boss had his men scouting for the Grizzlies, even though
Jackson was still, theoretically, in charge of the basketball
operation. ``It was unnerving to see that,'' Jackson said. ``But
(personnel director) Larry Riley and his staff rose above all that
and remained dignified and professional. All my staff did. So did
the players and the coaching staff.'' Jackson said he knew there
would be major changes. ``That's part of the deal when you change
owners,'' he said. ``It would be abnormal for it not to happen.''
But the new boss has the same large problem as the old boss _
making a go of it in Canada. ``There are issues, big issues, in
Canada,'' said Jackson. ``The exchange rate is a major, major
deterrent. The players are paid in American dollars, but all your
revenue is in Canadian dollars. It's tough.'' Players also are
taxed at a higher rate in Canada, which the NBA always has
downplayed, comparing it to high-tax places like New York. ``They
can say that, but it's not the same,'' said Jackson. ``It's not
even close.'' The Grizzlies also are finding it hard to generate
revenue from broadcasting and sponsorships; Jackson said the team
is last in the league in both departments. He noted that Toronto at
least is a major corporate headquarters city, so it has the
advantage there in sponsorship money. Vancouver might as well be
Medicine Hat . . . In their playoff history, the Utah Jazz have
been swept, 3-0, by a No. 7 seed, lost another best-of-fiver after
leading, 2-0, and nearly blown a 3-0 lead to an eighth seed before
prevailing in seven games. But one thing they have never done is
get swept in a best-of-seven series. Unless something dramatic
happens in the Delta Center Sunday, that distinction will end.
Portland won the first three games of the series by margins of 19,
18, and 19 points. (Utah has lost its last 13 playoff games in
Portland.) The Blazers are making the Jazz look like a bunch of
grumpy old men, which, of course, is what they are. Even the
normally supportive Utah fans got frustrated in Game 3, during
which Utah fell behind by 21, rallied to tie the game, then
collapsed in the fourth quarter. There actually were boos directed
at the estimable John Stockton, which might have been a first. You
have to wonder what will happen to the team. Jeff Hornacek is
leaving. Stockton and Karl Malone will be back, another year older,
and the team historically has trouble attracting free agents. Then
again, speculating on the demise of the Jazz has been an annual
rite for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two MJs in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis to the Wizards? The New York papers were in a lather
last week over that possibility. Jarvis hosted a charity function
in New York and guess who was the featured speaker? None other than
Jordan himself, the basketball boss of the coachless Wizards.
(Wonder if MJ gets $50,000 a pop, like Pitino.) Jarvis interviewed
last year for the Washington job, which went to the
since-jettisoned Gar Heard. Jordan wants a coach in place before
next Sunday's lottery, even though the Wizards' pick, which
probably will be No. 6, will be assigned to the Bulls unless it's
in the top three. (Seasoned cynics figure the NBA will find a way
to get the Wizards into the top three as a favor to MJ and to keep
him interested.) . . . The Suns got a first-hand lesson in home
cooking in the waning seconds of their Game 2 loss to the Lakers at
the Staples Center, and it could have dramatically affected the
outcome of the series. With Phoenix leading by 1 point, Penny
Hardaway drove to the hoop and was taken down by the newly minted
MVP, Shaquille O'Neal. There was no call on a clear foul. The
Lakers then won the game on a great shot by Kobe Bryant. The Suns
went back to Phoenix down, 0-2. ``It's frustrating,'' said coach
Scott Skiles. ``All year long, we've had trouble getting to the
foul line for whatever reason. So I guess maybe that reputation is
hurting us or something, and we're just not getting them. That was
clearly a foul. But it's just one of those things. I mean, they can
point to plays that are clearly fouls on us. It's not like there's
any conspiracy or anything. It was just, in my opinion, a call that
should have been made.'' But it wasn't, and probably won't be, when
the MVP is deemed to be the perpetrator. Just ask Larry or MJ . . .
Have the Blazers finally turned it around and started to look like
the 45-11 team that opened the season rather than the 14-12 team
that finished? Center Joe Kleine thinks so. ``Definitely,'' he
said. ``I think our defense, even in the bad stretch, stayed
decent. We were still rotating and trapping pretty well, although
it's much better now. Offensively is where the big difference is.
We're moving the ball and executing so much better. Our spacing is
100 percent better. We're much crisper. Guys are getting open,
getting the ball, and knocking down the shot.'' Kleine is not on
the playoff roster; the team kept Gary Grant, fearing an injury to
backup guard Greg Anthony (who didn't miss a game all season). That
may come back to haunt them if they meet the Lakers in the
conference finals. Kleine represents a big body and, more
important, six fouls. ``It wasn't my decision,'' Big Joe said.
``I'm disappointed, but if that's the worse thing that happens to
me in my life, I should be OK.'' And it could be a good omen for
Portland. In 1997-98, Kleine appeared in 46 games for the Bulls.
But he was kept off the playoff roster and watched in civvies as
Chicago wrapped up the NBA title in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kicking football around
</P>
<P>
   Longtime basketball agent Steve Kauffman is branching out. He
represents Brian Urlacher, the New Mexico linebacker who was taken
by the Chicago Bears with the ninth pick in the recent NFL draft.
Kauffman says it's too early in the process to notice any
difference in bargaining, but he did note that the Bears are coming
out to see him at his Malibu office to talk contract. That's a
difference . . . You can't blame Minnesota for feeling jinxed. The
Timberwolves won 50 games, but that was good enough for only the
sixth seed in the talent-heavy West. (It would have tied for third
in the East.) They recorded the best record within their division,
going 18-6, including 6-2 against Utah and San Antonio. Then they
pushed Portland in four tough games; their three losses were by a
combined 15 points. And they're out in the first round for the
fourth straight year. ``There's no question there's frustration on
our part,'' says coach/GM Flip Saunders. ``We definitely want to
take that next step.'' . . . Pat Riley says he wonders when Jamal
Mashburn will start getting calls the way Allan Houston seems to
get them. In a bit of referee-baiting, the always calculating Riley
said, ``I don't think he gets the benefit of the doubt at all. I
don't think the officials look at Mash yet the way they look at
Houston. He gets manhandled and he's got to earn his. Everything
Allan gets is off a touch. You touch him, he's on the line. It's
probably going to take Mash a couple more playoffs before he gets
that kind of respect.''

   Emptying Out The Desk Drawer Of The Sports Mind:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not exactly the type who sleeps with the Daily Racing Form
under his pillow, but even I know that anything over 15 horses on
the track is stupid and dangerous. Are the people at Churchill
Downs waiting until they have a fatality or what?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody pulls up 15 feet ahead of the pack in a sneakaway
situation and launches a 3-pointer. Throw that scene out, and the
basketball segments of ``Love &AMP; Basketball'' ring pretty true.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason odds on Steve Trachsel throwing 17 consecutive
scoreless innings against Pedro and El Duque were about the same as
those of Drew Bledsoe leading the NFL in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that Conseco Fieldhouse in downtown
Indianapolis is the greatest place ever constructed in which to
play the sport of basketball. End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, let the record further show that despite the
presence of Camden Yards, Jacobs Field, and all the other new
cash-cow ballparks, Joe Average Fan has never been served better by
any park than Dodger Stadium these past 38 years. What? No luxury
boxes? Tough. The corporate bleeps, who cares about them?
</P>
<P>
   What was true in December is still true today. No team in the
NBA has more good players than the Portland Trail Blazers. Their
series with the Lakers could be an epic.
</P>
<P>
   Most underpublicized baseball shockeroo: Mike Mussina (career
.618 winning percentage) is 1-4 with a 4.78 ERA. He's only 31, and
nobody is saying he's hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   We here would argue Pedro over Randy, but who can deny that the
sight of an unshaven 6-10 guy, with his hair flying and a snarl on
his face, is the best show in all of baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Earth to Fred Hickman: Even if we follow your ``Where would the
Sixers be without Iverson?'' reasoning, please enlighten us as to
how far the Lakers would have gotten this year with John Salley and
Travis Knight at center. Face it, Freddy. You've made a fool out of
yourself for all sports eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Since everybody is now piling on in L'Affaire Bob Knight, it's
time for me to confess that I once saw him kick over a bench at
Madison Square Garden while he was coaching at West Point some 35
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I hereby propose a constitutional amendment to prevent Steve
Young from playing any more professional football.
</P>
<P>
   The following truths we hold to be self-evident: That expansion
_ not free agency, not arbitration, not anything else _ is the
single biggest reason for the aesthetic decline of our four major
professional sports, and that making freshmen eligible to play
college basketball and football was the single biggest mistake the
NCAA made during the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Shaq. I gotta admit that when a man quotes Aristotle when he
accepts his MVP award, it may be time to stop ragging him about
once having said, ``I've been a winner at every level _ except
college and pro,'' especially when he'll soon be rectifying Part B.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks vs. Heat: Iran-Iraq, with a dose of Hitler vs. Stalin on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   Leader in the clubhouse for Most Disgraceful Stat of the New
Millennium would have to be Toronto's six shots on goal in Game 6
against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   If both Jason Varitek and Derek Lowe make the All-Star team
(it's certainly conceivable), does that make trading them for a
registered arsonist the greatest transaction since Seward bought
Alaska?
</P>
<P>
   Don't kid yourself. Bobby Orr knows that, absent Ray Lussier's
stunning photograph, his game-winning goal to complete a sweep of
an expansion team would be lucky to rate in his personal top 10
career highlights.
</P>
<P>
   What's even more aggravating about not having a Martin-and-Woods
duo to grace our summer afternoons and evenings is that neither one
of them would have a chance to succeed in today's homogenized
broadcast world.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone out there has a video of the young Arvydas Sabonis in
action, would you please make me a copy? He's still pretty good,
but what we're looking at now is 40 pounds, two Achilles' tendon
operations, and a rumored vat of vodka beyond the point at which he
was said to be a Bill Walton with 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Got no problem with Elton Brand and Steve Francis sharing Rookie
of the Year, but be advised that in five years the best player in
the Class of '99 may very well turn out to be Andre Miller.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me, you wallow deeper and deeper in self-pity
with each playoff-less NBA season. I'd give anything to be inside a
hot, sweaty, sizzling Garden for another May game with the Sixers
and June game with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilt 100-point basketball fiasco gives me a rush. There are
few more despicable areas of modern American life than the world of
sports memorabilia, and people who participate in it deserve to be
taken for a long, long ride.
</P>
<P>
   Attention, Bud Selig: I'd estimate that 30 percent of would-be
base stealers called out by umpires because the throw was in the
vicinity of second base are, in actuality, safe. Do something about
this.
</P>
<P>
   Is it just me, or is it possible they should get someone other
than sister Cheryl to interview Reggie Miller after one of his
boffo playoff performances?
</P>
<P>
   The single most inexplicable and aberrational baseball act in my
lifetime remains Tim Wakefield's 14-1 run five years ago. No
knuckleball pitcher ever has, or ever will, do anything like that
again, and I don't care if they play baseball for 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Mother's Day to Mary Ryan. I haven't forgotten how you
made sure I got to ballgames even after Dad died.

   BALTIMORE _ His arm felt fine. He had his usual stuff, and even
on his best days, Mike Trombley freely admits, he's not going to
throw the ball past anyone. He lives by location, not power. When
he's on, he can mix up his pitches, hit spots, keep the hitters
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, it works.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday wasn't one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my loss out there today,'' said Trombley, after serving
up no fewer than three eighth-inning homers in the Orioles'
dispiriting 5-1 loss to the Red Sox. ``I mean, it was all my loss _
it wasn't anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Trombley, the pride of Wilbraham, Mass., entered with two outs
in the eighth, the fast-fading Orioles clinging precariously to a
1-0 lead. Mike Stanley stepped to the plate with a runner on first
and cranked Trombley's 1-and-0 breaking pitch over the left-field
wall. Red Sox, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung a curveball there,'' said Trombley. ``I was trying to
bring it inside, but it got over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme was established. Three pitches later, Scott Hatteberg
sent Trombley's 2-and-0 delivery screaming over the wall in left.
Red Sox, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a (splitter) that I wanted down and away,'' said
Trombley. ``Again, right over the middle of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   After then hitting Wilton Veras with a breaking pitch, Trombley
watched the weak-hitting Donnie Sadler knock a first pitch out of
the park, again over the wall in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fastball that I wanted to keep away from him,'' said
Trombley. ``Every one of them was over the middle of the plate.
It's tough to do that. If I went out there to throw batting
practice, I don't think you could give guys that many. But, hey, it
was me who was throwing 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   These are lowly times, once again, for the beleaguered
Baltimoreans. They have lost six straight, 10 of their last 11,
five straight in their beautiful ballpark. More people came to
Camden Yards Saturday (48,579) than for any regular-season game in
the park's eight-year history. Well into the top half of the
eighth, the Orioles were doing fine by the hometown crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But in a hail of fat, soft-serve, silver-platter offerings (``I
all but put Stanley's on a tee,'' said Trombley), Baltimore saw its
record fall to 16-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the effort wasn't there, physically and mentally,'' said
Baltimore manager Mike Hargrove, Cleveland's skipper last year when
the Red Sox drummed the Indians out of the playoffs, ``I'd have
lost all my hair, and I'd be down four quarts of blood by now. It
just seems like every time we make a mistake right now, it gets
capitalized on.''
</P>
<P>
   In Trombley's case, it was a series of mistakes _ curve, sinker,
fastball _ that turned into rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one out away from heading into the ninth with a one-run
lead,'' said Hargrove. ``Then, before we take a deep breath . . .
five runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Trombley, 32, has almost seven years of big league service. He
signed here as a free agent after spending all his career with
Minnesota, with a lifetime mark of 30-33. Following his days in
Wilbraham, he went to Duke and then toiled four seasons in the
minors before making the Twins. He's known bad days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sent to the minors a few times in my career,'' he
said. ``So my confidence level has been low before, and, yeah, this
bothers me. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not disappointed by
what happened. That's as disappointing a game as I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day is still a couple of weeks away, but the Orioles
again are showing signs of sliding off the American League East
landscape. They've been outscored, 25-5, the last three days by the
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the media after the loss, Hargrove was asked if
the latest defeat was the low point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know,'' he said. ``We haven't played tomorrow yet.''

NORMAN IS RIGHT ON THE NUMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Here's a guy who's No. 1 on the planet, and protests that
he's not No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The name is Magnus Norman, a name that doesn't mean much even in
his homeland, Sweden. Nevertheless, he took over the tennis
penthouse Saturday _ denying even while ascending _ by crashing the
final of the Italian Open with a 6-3, 6-0, victory over Australia's
Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   That won Norman a championship date Sunday at Il Foro Italico.
He'll battle in the amber dirt against the titleholder from Brazil,
Gustavo Kuerten. Kuerten beat the 1997 champ, Spaniard Alex
Corretja, with weighty serves and massive forehands, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved,'' said Norman, perhaps the most outgoing Swede
ever to grace the courts. ``I thought about it a lot. I knew I'd
move into No. 1 if I won the match. But I'm not really No. 1. Not
with guys like Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, and Yevgeny Kafelnikov
around. But I'm excited, thrilled to be in front.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like double-talk, it's because Norman and his
colleagues on the ATP Tour have begun leading double lives. Theirs
is now the brave, and maybe confusing, new world of the Champions
Race that began in January.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years, the tennis standings/rankings were measured by
``Blinky,'' the ATP computer, based on results over a rolling
12-month period. That pecking order continues only as the entry
rankings list, telling a player where he stands in the matter of
getting into a tournament and where, if anywhere, he'll be seeded.
Everybody wears two numbers, and for Kuerten they're a little
different also: No. 6 in the race, No. 4 in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter respect, Norman is No. 3, behind Agassi and
Kafelnikov. But the Champions Race was instituted in the hope that
fans can follow the game on a daily basis, from beginning to end of
the season. Each win has a point value and counts in the day-to-day
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the hard-working Swede, toiling in his 11th tournament
(winning one, New Zealand), surged ahead of Agassi, a third-round
loser here to Slovak Dominik Hrbaty. Agassi had headed the mob for
11 weeks. Norman is the fifth to hold first place.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrice Santoro of France had a brief tenancy at the pinnacle,
one week, the first. Hewitt supplanted him for two weeks, then
Kafelnikov took over for four, followed by Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten can't bump Norman from the top by winning Sunday. But
his victory elevated him from eighth to sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, a lanky 6 feet 2 inches, once fancied himself a pretty
fair hockey player. He was even better at the Scandivanian game of
bandy (hockey with a tennis ball substituted for a puck). But best
at substituting a racket for a hooked stick to slap huge forehands.
He will be 24 in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot but pleasant afternoon, he was a 62-minute disaster for
the 19-year-old Hewitt. Running the last seven games, winning 23 of
29 points in the second set (four of them aces), Norman reached
match point. There, a weary Hewitt squelched four match points. But
he was done in by a roaring forhand.
</P>
<P>
   Norman shook his head and said, ``They don't seem to care much
about me at home (even though he helped Sweden win the 1998 Davis
Cup). I haven't seen a Swedish reporter at any tournaments. Maybe
they were spoiled by so much success of Bjorn Borg and Mats
Wilander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was negative about the race when it was announced, but I
like it now. The lead will change hands but I'm going to try my
best to stay in first.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd help his cause by becoming the third Swede to win the
Italian, following Borg (1974, '78) and Wilander (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Corretja, dropping one position to seventh, said, ``The race
seemed strange at the beginning, but now I like it. The way Magnus
is playing, he is the true leader.''

DRIVERS HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ The third-generation Jarrett heard about the
tragedy that struck the fourth-generation Petty Friday, and, for
the remainder of the day, qualifying for Saturday's Busch 200
didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just kind of lose focus, or at least I did,'' said
24-year-old Jason Jarrett, son of 1999 Winston Cup champion Dale
Jarrett and grandson of two-time NASCAR Grand National champion Ned
Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Jarrett spoke less than an hour before Saturday's race at
New Hampshire International Speedway, the day after 19-year-old
Adam Petty, grandson of NASCAR legend Richard Petty and
great-grandson of NASCAR pioneer Lee Petty, died after suffering
head trauma in a practice-run crash.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, like many drivers, offered condolences to the Petty
family. Jarrett's race ended with a crash on Lap 128 in Turn 3,
just to the left of the site of Petty's wreck. Jarrett was able to
walk away. He said he wasn't preoccupied with thoughts of Petty,
``but of course, my thoughts have been with the family all weekend.
It seemed the longer the race went, the better our car got. We kept
making adjustments in the pit stops. And then 20 laps before we got
into that wreck the 20 car (Mike Borkowski) hit me, and I guess 20
laps later he felt he needed to do the same thing. It ended our day
quick because it tore the car up bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I want to do is send my condolences out to
the Petty family. It was hard to focus today, and obviously, some
of the other drivers out there can't focus anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the drivers entered the race with a show-must-go-on
mentality, saddened by the tragedy but determined to put it behind
them long enough to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know where it did happen until I went to qualify,''
said Tracy Gordon, who competed in the second race, the Busch 125.
``I went into the third and fourth turn and I said, `Oh, there's
where he went in, right there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It did take my concentration a little bit. It's always on your
mind. It could have been any of us, I guess. But if you're thinking
of that stuff, you're not pushing it as hard. We'll be thinking of
him always but we have to race from the mind-set that we're not
doing our jobs if we do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy LaJoie was among many drivers who said they leaned on
their faith to help them accept the loss of what many believed to
be a rising star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that the man upstairs has a plan for
everybody and when it's your time to go, it's your time to go,''
said LaJoie, of South Norwalk, Conn. ``It's just hard to figure
sometimes why He would take such a young talented person with a
wonderful life ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said he turned to family members for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my grandfather this morning, and he always has
something good to say,'' said Jarrett. ``He said, `There's nothing
you can do. Go out and be your best today, concentrate on just
getting better, just like you have every other week. And you can
deal with (the tragedy) after the race.' I pretty much got into
that mind-set after talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett did say, however, that Petty's crash made him think back
to an accident he had at Memphis Motorsports Park in October, where
he broke several bones in his foot during a practice session.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers spoke about their past accidents, which appeared
serious, but from which they were able to emerge without
life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three weeks ago, my car got into a wreck twice with very
hard shots. I probably wrecked harder than Adam's was,'' LaJoie
said. ``And I played golf (the following) Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two deaths in this series that have been very
prominent NASCAR names,'' he said, alluding to the loss of Clifford
Allison (son of racing legend Bobby), who was killed in an event in
Brooklyn, Mich., in 1992. ``And when that does hit, it hits hard.
Those are very prominent names in our community. But when you look
at the ratios of safety, I think it's safer being a race car driver
than it is driving on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jarrett, LaJoie also suffered a wreck Saturday, but his was
more severe. He and Buckshot Jones made contact on Lap 87 and
LaJoie smacked into the area where Petty hit. LaJoie walked away
from his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's OK,'' said LaJoie's father, Don, while standing in front
of the infield care center. ``He doesn't remember being taken out
of the car, so he was knocked unconscious. They're taking him to
the hospital for a CAT scan (which came back negative).''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, LaJoie emerged on a stretcher, with an IV in his
right arm and an oxygen mask over his mouth, and was taken via
ambulance to the hospital. He was released later with only
seat-belt bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Robison, a chaplain for Motor Racing Outreach, said he was
asked Friday to take part in a prerace memorial service for Petty
Saturday. He said many of the drivers shared stories and what Petty
meant to them. Robison said it was the first time he has had to
address an on-track death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks are not scared or worried for Adam as much as they are
for everybody else around the situation, for the family,'' he said.
``Everyone is concerned for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very traumatic for the whole community. I think I
heard LaJoie say earlier you never know what can happen out on the
track at any time. I think they are more aware of that than at any
time in their career.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty's tragic death is the second in a week for the racing
community. Christian Lovendahl, the 27-year-old crew chief for
driver P.J. Jones, was killed in an automobile accident May 5 in
Mooresville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Robison and others said the two tragedies have affected not only
the drivers and crew members but their families.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Bodine, the wife of driver Todd Bodine, said she spoke with
her brother-in-law, Geoff, about a serious accident he suffered but
was able to walk away from in a February truck race at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have walked away, and he did, and he's wondering
how come he's here and Adam's not,'' she said. ``I guess when you
get involved in the sport, you know what the dangers are. But when
it does hit, it hits hard. And it hits every family in our
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the dangers there are. We've all thought about that
for the last 24 hours. But as wives we also know our husbands have
a job and that's part of the job.''

FEDEWA PULLS OUT VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Saturday's Busch 200 Grand National race at New
Hampshire International Speedway came down to the final three laps,
as the red flag came out after Dick Trickle's car caught fire and
Ted Christopher spun into the wall in Lap 194.
</P>
<P>
   But that was OK with pole sitter Tim Fedewa, who took the lead
on the restart and went on to capture his fourth Busch Series
victory and $42,060, a day after the tragic death of driver Adam
Petty during a practice run at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Fedewa held the lead most of the way, from Lap 16 through Lap
130. After the restart, Fedewa raced to the front again, making a
move to the inside off Turn 3 in Lap 198 and passing points leader
Jeff Green.
</P>
<P>
   There were five lead changes and 10 cars had to drop out in a
race before 24,000 spectators, a few thousand fewer than normal.
Kevin Harvick led until Lap 15, Fedewa was in command from 16 to
130, followed by Buckshot Jones from 131 to 191 and Steve Park from
192 to 197.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I didn't want to lose,'' said Fedewa, the 14th
different Busch winner at NHIS. ``I became more aggressive than I
usually have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Jeff is upset with me, but Jeff was quite clean. I was
very concerned about No. 10 (Green). I went low and went around
Jeff, while Casey (Atwood) and Steve (Park) both ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   With 80 laps remaining, Fedewa pitted. He didn't get back into
the top 10 again until Lap 160, when he raced into seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real good race for me, I led most of the race,''
Fedewa said. ``And then I pitted, getting new tires. The tires
worked out well for me, though. I feel good about our team and
we're on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Green finished second, taking home $35,385, and remained atop
the Busch Series standings with 1,793 points. Green was taken aback
by Fedewa's maneuver, one he thought was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to protect my point lead and he went by me, I
guess because he's not in the point battle,'' Green said. ``I was
quite disappointed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Keller came in third, good for a check of $28,725. Jimmie
Johnson was the top rookie, finishing 13th and earning $13,950.
</P>
<P>
   It was Fedewa's first Busch victory since winning in South
Boston, Va., July 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a tough season for Fedewa, who had had no top-10
finishes coming into the race. He was 30th in the points standings
and even failed to qualify for a race last month in Los Angeles.
``When you have a bad day, you go home,'' Fedewa said. ``But we've
changed things in this car, making it work, after we had a terrible
car at one point.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't just looking for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this race wanting a top-10 finish badly,'' said
Fedewa, whose previous best finish at NHIS was a sixth in 1993.
``And I wound up doing better, getting the win.''

LOVE TIED WITH HUSTON IN BYRON NELSON CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The harder Davis Love III tries to win, the more
difficult it seems to become.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting his worst round of the GTE Byron Nelson Classic, and
seeing a four-stroke lead disappear, Love was tied with John Huston
heading into Sunday's final round. Huston shot a three-under par 67
and moved to 10 under par for the tournament (200), even with Love,
who struggled to a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Love's one-over-par round left the door ajar for a
host of pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik, who shot 68, moved to seven under par, just
three strokes off the lead. Phil Mickelson, who shot 68, was in
fourth at six under par, while three players were tied for fifth at
five under par _ Mark Brooks, Bob Estes and Paul Stankowski.
</P>
<P>
   All of them will begin Sunday in the hunt, while Love, who has
not won since April 1998, found himself in danger of squandering
another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Since his last victory at the MCI Classic, Love has 25 top-10
finishes and six second-place finishes, but no victories. That is
enough to make any player lose confidence, but Love said he was
looking forward to Sunday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to shoot one over par, but this wasn't the kind
of day where I have to go back and wonder what's going on,'' said
Love, who started Saturday at 11 under par, four strokes ahead of
Huston. ``I drove the ball really well, and I made some putts. I
just didn't hit the ball close that often, and I misjudged a few
shots because of the wind. It was unbelievable how far the ball
went on some shots, and that made it difficult just to step up and
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another difficult scoring day on the TPC at the Four
Seasons, as the wind blew in the opposite direction from Thursday
and Friday and forced players to adjust. The front nine was
particularly tough, and club selection was an inexact science.
</P>
<P>
   How much did things change? On Friday, Parnevik reached the
green of the 390-yard No. 4 using a driver and a sand wedge.
Saturday at the same hole, Parnevik used a driver and a 5-wood.
</P>
<P>
   But Huston, a five-time PGA Tour winner, made just one bogey and
remained calm in the blustery conditions. He birdied the par-5 No.
7, made a 10-foot putt for birdie at No. 10, then hit a great sand
wedge to 5 feet at No. 11 to set up another birdie. That moved
Huston to nine under par, one stroke behind Love. And when Love
bogeyed the 14th hole, while Huston made a 15-foot putt for birdie,
Huston took a one-stroke lead for the first time in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   However, Love responded with a birdie at the par-5 16th hole,
hitting a splendid bunker shot to 2 feet on his third shot.
</P>
<P>
   Both players made par over the final three holes, and they will
be paired again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play well, I feel I have as good a chance to win as
anyone,'' said Huston, whose last victory came in October 1998 at
the National Car Rental Golf Classic at Walt Disney World in
Florida. ``When you haven't won in a while, it gets a little
harder. But you still have to play your game. With five or six
holes to go, you can't get caught up in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, Sunday will be a key moment for Love, with
players like Parnevik, Huston and Mickelson in pursuit, on a course
where the wind can be a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   Love has been waiting for a final round that ends with people
congratulating him, rather than consoling him. And he hoped that
his wait was almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil and Jesper got right back where they wanted to be, and
John did what he wanted to do _ catch up,'' Love said. ``It think
it will be a good race tomorrow.''

   LOUDON, N.H. _ A red rose in a vase of yellow and purple flowers
stood atop the short, white cement wall that runs along the outside
of the track at New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers were not far from the entrance to Turn 3 and the
spot where Adam Petty, the 19-year-old member of auto racing's most
grand family, crashed and died from head trauma in practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Purvis smacked the wall early in Saturday's Busch 200 Grand
National race, not far from where Petty hit.

   And shortly after Purvis's crash, Randy LaJoie went into the
wall at about the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie was taken by ambulance to Concord (N.H.) Hospital for
precautionary reasons and later released with only bruises. Purvis,
with an Adam Petty No. 45 sticker on his chest along with a black
ribbon, walked out of the infield medical center and checked out
his damaged car.
</P>
<P>
   A private memorial service for Petty will be held Monday at High
Point (N.C.) College
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty, Adam's father, was in Europe with his wife, Patti,
when he heard about the death of his oldest son. The Petty family
also suffered a loss April 5 when Lee Petty, Adam's
great-grandfather and a NASCAR pioneer, died at age 86.
</P>
<P>
   The Petty family did not release a statement Saturday, nor did
NASCAR say what caused Petty's car to hit the wall. His car was
inspected and released to his team Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation around the track continued to be that the throttle
on Petty's Sprint PCS Chevrolet stuck and, although he slammed on
the brakes, it was not enough to keep the car from speeding into
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could have been it,'' said Mike Helton, a NASCAR vice
president and its chief operating officer. ``But we don't speculate
on causes. There's no point. It's more a process of reviewing what
parts and pieces did and didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR may inspect the car and circumstances further and then
review the information with the crews, Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in this together when we work on safety issues,'' he
said. ``It's whatever we can do to make things better. That's how
we got to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Petty family gathered in North Carolina to grieve, NASCAR
carried on. It's the mentality that put the drivers back on the
track Friday evening for one last round of practice.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment of silence before the race, which had an
estimated attendance of 24,000, a few thousand below normal, and
the NASCAR car-hauler drivers did a last lap in Petty's memory
after the day's racing ended. ``It was a really hard day to
concentrate out there,'' said Jason Keller, who finished third. ``I
got thinking about a lot of things you probably shouldn't be
thinking about in a race car. I knew Adam real well and we've had a
lot of fun. I know he was watching us all today. This one's for
Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Keller and Petty were giving each other grief in
the press room before practice. Petty gave Keller a hard time about
his upcoming 30th birthday, while Keller gave it right back,
focusing on Petty's youth. He would have turned 20 July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Jason, I really didn't want to get in that race car
today,'' said Jeff Green, who placed second. ``Adam being 19 years
old, that's a devastating blow to our sport. And him being such a
class guy. Nothing bothered Adam. He always had a smile on his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiles were maybe a little easier to come by Saturday than the
day before, said Tim Fedewa, who took the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Friday), I didn't feel so good about anything,'' Fedewa said.
``Today, I was thinking more about how Adam enjoyed life. If we can
enjoy life half as good as he did, we'll be doing pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the thoughts were of Petty and Keller in the press
room Friday or of Petty's first Winston Cup race last month in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what most impressed me, qualifying his first time
out,'' said driver Joe Bessey. ``He qualified and his father
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were thoughts of last year and Petty's first
appearance here. Petty laughed about being clean-cut, as opposed to
his father, who sports long hair and earrings. He talked of being a
vegetarian and racing go-karts from age 6, while his younger
brother, Austin, preferred airplanes, and younger sister,
Montgomery Lee, rode horses.
</P>
<P>
   And he talked of being a Petty in the world of racing and how
his father took the pressure off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's an awesome racer and I've learned more from him,''
Adam said. ``But when he came along the fans and media and everyone
expected him to be the next Richard Petty. About halfway through
his career people realized there wasn't going to be another Richard
Petty. There will never be another Richard Petty, so the pressure
eased up. There isn't any pressure on me. I just want to go out
here and make a name for myself and come out and win a lot of
races.''

PRECAUTIONS DIDN'T CHANGE RESULT

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Moments before his Sprint PCS Chevrolet slammed
into the concrete wall at Turn 3, Adam Petty stood on his brakes.
He tried desperately to avoid a rapid deceleration. But tragically,
the worst-case scenario occurred Friday afternoon as Petty died
strapped into a car that went from approximately 150 miles per hour
to 0 in a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New Hampshire state medical examiner's report,
``The cause of death was blunt impact injuries to the head.''
Another medical source said the body showed no visible signs of
injury, leading to the conclusion that all injuries were internal.
Concord (N.H.) Hospital spokeswoman Eileen Male said, ``The autopsy
was done (Friday) evening and in deference to the family's wishes,
(Petty's body) was returned to North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's findings seemed to confirm what other
drivers and crew members thought all along: the head trauma
resulted from the force of a sudden stop being absorbed by Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit pretty hard. What happens when you have one of those
kinds of accidents is the car stops, but your internal organs don't
stop,'' said Dennis Chamberlain, a crew member for the Stanley
Tools Chevrolet driven by Saturday's Busch 200 winner, Tim Fedewa.
``Your body is taking all the force. You've got the seat belts
holding your body in, but from your neck up is free. What will
happen is it throws your head forward or stretches your neck like
18 inches because of the impact when you hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Johnny Allen, car chief for the Bob Evans Chevrolet of
Randy LaJoie: ``It's just like someone hitting you in the head with
a sledgehammer. If you've got a helmet on, it don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   For many in the racing community who remember Ernie Irvan's
near-fatal wreck in August 1994 that left him in a coma for three
days with a cracked skull and brain contusions, the Petty crash was
eerily familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Adam was a freak deal,'' said LaJoie, prior
to crashing in Turn 3 in the Busch 200, ``but we've seen it happen
before. Ernie Irvan cracked his skull from the inside out when he
hit. His body stopped and his brain continued and cracked his
skull.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers and crew members cited a long list of crashes as
reference points, trying to reason through what Petty experienced.
The few members of the racing community who talked about the fatal
crash blamed the car, though it was believed a stuck throttle
doomed Petty. Instead, drivers and crew members applauded the
efforts of NASCAR to make cars as safe as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his peers preparing for the Busch 200, Petty was
surrounded by equipment designed to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helmets and fireproof suits, a cage of padded
roll bars protects drivers. Thick netting covers the driver's side
window, preventing the force of a crash from ejecting the driver.
The driver's door is padded. Custom-made seats with a five-point
harness ensure drivers don't slide around as they race. Panels on
the right and left side of the seat help prevent legs from being
snapped during crashes. A bar runs down the center of the
windshield to prevent it from collapsing on the driver in an
accident. And a fire extinguisher is always within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do everything humanly possible to make these things
safe. The car did its job,'' said Allen. ``With deals like (Petty's
crash), the human body's not made to take those kind of licks. You
could say maybe the car was built too sturdy, but what do you do
then? You build a less-sturdy car, then it caves in on you and
kills the driver. It's kind of a Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Absence of abundant debris from Petty's crash indicated the car
was sturdy and, upon hitting the wall, did not absorb much of the
impact. According to crew members, cars are built sturdier for
short tracks. Some speculated that the sideways angle at which
Petty slammed into the wall also may have prevented the car from
taking more of the blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of want the car to collapse and absorb some of the
impact,'' said Keith Plaza, a crew member with the Baywatch
Chevrolet of driver Bobby Hamilton Jr. ``That way the body doesn't
have to do all that, which is probably what happened. It was a
freak kind of thing.''

49ERS ZERO IN ON SACKING THEIR QB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How is Bill Walsh going to fix the 49ers and decide what to do
with Steve Young and Jerry Rice if he can't even figure out who's
calling him on the phone?
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the San Francisco general manager said he had been
contacted by the NFL and been told the league was looking into
tampering charges against the Denver Broncos for allegedly having
illicit conversations with Young.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he said, ``Only fooling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Walsh said, ``We feel it was
unfortunate that we brought the National Football League into this
matter. They have indicated no reason to explore this situation,
and we certainly accept their dictates. We acknowledge their
position that the Denver Broncos have not been in contact, directly
or indirectly, with Steve Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact of the matter is, Walsh doesn't want the aging quarterback
in San Francisco anymore, so why don't the 49ers cut the baloney
(which doesn't go well with wine and brie, anyway) and release
Young on June 1 to ease the salary cap problems his contract is
causing?
</P>
<P>
   Young, soon to be 39 years old, met last week with Walsh and
head coach Steve Mariucci to discuss his future.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has already said that Young will have to take a hefty pay
cut and pass two neurological exams because of his repeated
concussions, and still might not be brought back.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who recently married, says he's unclear on whether he'll
play next season but knows that if he wants to, there's a job for
him in Denver working for old friend Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci says, ``Gee whiz, I'll do whatever Steve wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Young would be safer in Denver than in San Francisco,
where the offensive line is full of holes. Young has lost some of
his legendary elusiveness and no longer can take a hit the way he
used to.
</P>
<P>
   So why is this dragging on?
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting last week, Walsh said, ``We're going to do
everything we can to have it work in Steve's best interest and
within the framework of the planning for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded more than a little conciliatory, until he added
that keeping Young and Rice another year could be done but ``at a
terrible cost to the ball club. We might even be short players.''
</P>
<P>
   What Walsh is saying should be clear to someone as bright as
Steve Young. He's saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   What Young needs to do is stop trying to decide whether to
return to the 49ers and start trying to decide whether he wants to
play in Denver, because in the end that will be his only option.
</P>
<P>
   That or retiring to a rather good life as an attorney, unless he
just wants to retire to a golf course and live off the millions
he's made.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy with a lot of headaches, the last option seems the
intelligent way to go.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In suspense
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots remain interested in free agent defensive lineman
Mike Frederick, but their chances of landing him hinge neither on
the player nor on his former team, the Tennessee Titans. Frederick,
an unrestricted free agent, was offered a contract by the Patriots
for the veteran's minimum salary, $440,000, and given no deadline
to accept it. He continues to work out with the Titans voluntarily
after signing an injury protection form. Tennessee would still like
to keep Frederick. He accepts that he will be earning the minimum
wherever he plays, but wants to sign with the team that gives him
the best chance of making the final roster. In that regard, the key
to his future is neither the Patriots nor the Titans but rather
Tennessee's Josh Evans. Evans recently was suspended for a year by
the league for violating its drug policy. He has appealed, and he
and the Titans believe he has a strong chance of winning or at
least having the ban reduced. At the moment, Evans counts $2.4
million against the Titans' salary cap because of the appeal. If he
loses, that would be reduced by half, leaving Tennessee enough
money to sign Frederick and likely provide him a roster spot. If
Evans wins, however, he returns to the team and Frederick might
well decide to head for New England. The fact that Tennessee
drafted two defensive linemen is also a consideration for Frederick
. . . No one with the Patriots is saying much publicly, but running
back Robert Edwards reportedly is running again. Not like he used
to, but under 5.0 seconds for the 40-yard dash, according to a
source in the organization who should know. No one yet believes
Edwards will play next season, but that remains his secret goal.
The terrible knee injury he suffered more than a year ago probably
has ended his career, but you have to give him credit for trying.
And trying and trying. Maybe he'll pull it off in 2001 . . . Pity
poor Fred Miller. The ex-Rams offensive tackle, who signed a big
free agent deal with Tennessee this winter, is still haunted by the
five false starts called against him on national television last
October when he faced Titans rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse. At
last week's Titans mini-camp, he twice was called for the same
infraction and was forced to run extra laps. Looking on the bright
side, the only time he has to see Kearse now is in practice . . .
The Titans have yet to offer head coach Jeff Fisher a new contract,
although they insist they're working on it. Fisher has a year to go
on his present deal and has told friends if he doesn't have a new
contract by mid-June he's likely to coach out his final season and
take his chances on the open market. That would be wise, because
the new Houston entry wants to hire a veteran NFL coach, and what
could be better than bringing Fisher back to Houston, where he ran
the Oilers before Bud Adams moved them to Tennessee?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's caught on
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to become a star quarterback, but
indifference isn't usually one of them. But that was the case with
Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner. In 1985, when Warner was a freshman at
Regis High in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, football coach Jim Padlock had a
problem: No one was trying out for quarterback. Lacking volunteers,
Padlock asked some guys to throw, and a tight end threw the
farthest. His name was Kurt Warner. To this day, Warner says he
never wanted to be a quarterback. He considered himself a receiver
until Padlock unlocked his future for him . . . NFL mania seems to
know no bounds, and the Dallas Cowboys are trying to cash in on it.
You now can go to the team's Web site and buy game-used shoes,
socks, and cleats, and a practice jersey of Emmitt Smith or Troy
Aikman. More than $100,000 in sales already has been rung up, with
the cheapest item being a $19.99 pair of Smith's socks. A pair of
his cleats is a far healthier $999.99, while Aikman's game shoes go
for $1,999.99 . . . Not every team would be happy to see its
running back report to mini-camp nearly 30 pounds heavier, but the
Bears reportedly are happy that Curtis Enis came in at 258 pounds,
up 28 from last season. The Bears believe the added bulk will help
him avoid the injuries that have plagued him since being drafted in
the first round in 1998 . . . Barry Sanders won another small
victory over the Lions last week when arbitrator Sam Kagel ruled
that Sanders does not have to pay Detroit interest on the portion
of his signing bonus he must repay because of his early retirement.
Under the ruling, Sanders owes the Lions $1.833 million by July 29.
In March, Sanders paid the Lions $83,000 for the 1999 season
because Detroit had withheld a $1.75 million payment to him. But
now he's into the Lions for big money, and some of his former
teammates believe that will drive him back to training camp this
summer . . . The Arizona Cardinals have decided to spare no expense
in trying to win. Finally. The team recently hired a nutritionist,
a physical therapist, two massage therapists, a chiropractor, and a
neuropsychologist. How about hiring some protection for quarterback
Jake Plummer instead? . . . The chances of Deion Sanders ending up
with the Washington Redskins increased last week when he walked
away from the Cincinnati Reds' Triple A affiliate in Louisville
after being asked to extend his stay there another 10 days. Sanders
insisted he had already done that once and wanted to return to the
big leagues. When the Reds refused to promote him, Sanders returned
to Dallas to continue rehabilitating his knee on his own. It is
expected that the Cowboys will release him after the June 1
deadline for salary cap reasons, and if he is free to play the
entire 2000 season without conflicts with his baseball job,
Washington is eager to hire him. The Reds are not going to release
Sanders, though, so unless he retires he could still return to
baseball next season if his surgically repaired knee is healthy.
What's oddest about this story is that Reds general manager Jim
Bowden, a big Sanders booster, doesn't believe he's healthy enough
to play every day for the Reds. If he can't play baseball, how is
he going to play football? . . . How's this for strange genes?
Cleveland Browns cornerback Anthony Malbrough weighs 178 pounds.
His half-brother, nose tackle Jerry Ball, oftens weighs twice that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grieving in Cincinnati
</P>
<P>
   While the Bengals have made clear their intention to release
reluctant wide receiver Carl Pickens, as per his demands, they have
yet to do so because they're insisting that he repay a portion of
his $3.5 million signing bonus of a year ago and that the players'
union drop its grievance against the team. The NFLPA is insisting
the Bengals should lose their right to designate a franchise player
because of the way they handled Pickens's holdout. Thus far the
NFLPA is refusing to back off its grievance, saying Pickens was the
team's franchise player and you can't get that designation back for
four years just because you release him. Meanwhile, agent Marvin
Demoff has asked for a face-to-face meeting with Bengals owner Mike
Brown and his brother Paul to discuss the future of running back
Corey Dillon, also a reluctant Bengal. Cincinnati has offered
Dillon a five-year, $18.3 million deal, but he wants $5 million per
season . . . Pity old friend Michael George. After he wined and
dined Florida State's Peter Warrick for months and spent an
estimated $500,000 on preparing him for his draft workouts, Warrick
jumped to another agent, ex-Laker Norm Nixon, because Nixon's wife,
choreographer and actress Debbie Allen, convinced him they could
get him a future in entertainment. How about in football first? Now
George is on the hot seat at SFX, the huge management company that
bought him out several years ago and now employs him, even though
he did nothing but work his tail off to sign Warrick and then care
for him. A rival agent said last week, ``I feel for the guy. I've
been through it. The players can get away with this because the
contracts they sign with agents are all one way. The NFLPA doesn't
care if they sign with five different guys. They go after the
agents and couldn't care less what the player does.'' In Warrick's
case, he waited until after he was drafted and then dumped SFX for
Nixon, after which the ex-Laker guard decided to bring in somebody
who actually might know what he's doing in a contract negotiation.
Hence the entry of Jimmy Gould, who is also the agent for Patriots
wide receiver Terry Glenn. Nixon and Gould are meeting in Los
Angeles next week, while the Bengals are hoping a deal can be
worked out that allows Warrick to begin informal workouts with the
team on Tuesday. Quarterback Akili Smith has volunteered to stay in
Cincinnati next week to work out with Warrick if he's on hand . . .
New Tennessee offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger has decided
that he will call his plays from the sideline rather than from the
press box, as many offensive coordinators do. This is
Heimerdinger's first job as a play caller after working in Denver
for Shanahan, who handles those duties himself. Unlike most
coordinators, Heimerdinger is not bringing in his own offense. He's
using the one quarterback Steve McNair used to lead the Titans to
the Super Bowl last season. To make it easier on his players, he's
learning their terminology instead of making them learn his.
``Sometimes I'll tell a player something and he'll look at me like
I'm crazy,'' Heimerdinger said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deja vu
</P>
<P>
   How's this for eerie? In 1995, Lew Bush replaced David Griggs in
the San Diego Chargers' starting lineup after Griggs died in a
one-car auto accident in Florida. Now Bush is replacing Derrick
Thomas in the Chiefs' lineup after the Kansas City linebacker died
following complications from a crippling car accident during the
offseason. ``I try not to think about it,'' Bush says . . .
Speaking of oddities, what on earth is the University of Alabama
thinking in awarding a posthumous bachelor's degree to Thomas? Of
course, awarding a degree to a dead man isn't too far off from what
happens in big-time college football programs every year . . . The
only NFL player to die in Vietnam will be honored by the Bills this
fall when Bob Kalsu's name is added to the team's Wall of Fame at
Ralph Wilson Stadium. He played only one year in the NFL (1968) and
was killed in action in 1970 while serving as an Army first
lieutenant . . . It's amazing what ends up in court. The Cleveland
Browns and NFL Properties sued a Los Angeles apparel company last
week over the right to the term ``Dawg Pound.'' Honest. The suit
claims that Hawaii-Pacific has attempted to extort millions from
the Browns and NFL Properties by trying to trademark the name used
to describe the denizens of the end zone seats in the old Cleveland
Stadium when the real Browns were playing there. The Browns claim
the company has demanded they stop using the name on licensed
merchandise. The Browns claim the name is a part of their history
dating back to the 1980s. Then again, those Browns moved to
Baltimore under cover of darkness a few years back, didn't they?
And no one from the NFL sued to try and stop them. That seems to be
the essence of Hawaii-Pacific's argument. They claim they were
using the name before the Browns were. Shouldn't these people have
something better to do with their lawyers?

&HT;    HALL HAS A DIFFERENT FRAME OF REFERENCE ON ORR'S POSE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Glenn Hall was the St. Louis goalie minding the cage that hot
Mother's Day afternoon, May 10, 1970, when Bobby Orr knocked in the
return pass from Derek Sanderson and clinched the Bruins' first
Stanley Cup in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   The famous shot of Orr flying through the air, frozen in time,
remains one of the most famous sports pictures in history. It
received prominent play around the Hub and throughout Canada last
week, the 30th anniversary of Orr's flight through time.
</P>
<P>
   But the 68-year-old Hall, who lives in Stony Plain, Alberta,
prefers something less sensational for his walls. Hall's favorite
picture is one of Lionel Conacher, who played for four NHL clubs in
the '20s and '30s, long before Hall broke in with the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the dressing room, and his skates are loaded with snow
and his nose is pushed off to one side,'' said Hall, describing his
framed shot of Conacher. ``It's a beautiful picture. It's what
hockey is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hall can't distance himself from the picture of Orr,
snapped that day by Record-American photographer Ray Lussier. Over
the years, he figures, he's signed thousands of copies. He likes to
kid Orr, suggesting it was the only goal the Bruins' legend ever
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, local memorabilia dealer Phil Castinetti was at Hall's
door, toting 510 (remember, May 10) copies of the famous
black-and-white photo. For a fee, Hall signed every one of them, as
did Noel Picard, the Blues' brushcut defenseman who in the picture
appears to have sent Orr flying with a pitchfork lift of his stick.
Castinetti is selling the 510 framed copies, each of them also
signed by Orr, at his Sportsworld collectors shop in Everett for
$510 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   According to Castinetti, ex-Bruins defenseman Ray Bourque bought
the first one, and received limited edition copy No. 77. Another
ex-Bruin, Dave Reid, one of Bourque's Colorado teammates, also
bought one, along with seven other Avalanche, including Joe Sakic,
Peter Forsberg, and Patrick Roy. Bourque, who will turn 40 in
December, is old enough to remember Orr's Cup-winner, but most of
the 1999-2000 Avalanche, including ex-BU Terrier Chris Drury,
weren't even born yet.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of thousand miles away, the good-natured Hall wonders
about all the fuss over an old black-and-white photo. He was in
Boston for the 1996 NHL All-Star Game at the FleetCenter, named an
honorary captain, and he spent days signing the Orr photo.
</P>
<P>

   Janney gets his due
</P>
<P>
   Rich Scimone, agent for Craig Janney, reports that the ex-Bruin
recently picked up the $3.6 million he had coming in disability
insurance, relating to the blood clot in his leg that forced his
retirement following the 1998-99 season. Janney, 32, will spend the
summer on Cape Cod and explore postcareer opportunities . . .
Ex-Canadiens coach Jean Perron could be back working behind a bench
next season, this time for the Moncton Wildcats in the Quebec
(Junior A) League . . . Plans aren't finalized, but the Bruins' '70
Cup-winning team is hoping to hold a 30-year reunion this September
at the FleetCenter. It would be similar to the recent Bill Russell
soiree, but this time the Vault no doubt would be burstin' at the
seams. Word around town is that Sept. 8-9 are the tentative dates .
. . The free agent pool, which opens July 1, is rather shallow this
year. The Bruins could have some interest in Gary Roberts ($2.5
million last year with Carolina), Lyle Odelein ($1.7 million,
Phoenix), and maybe Mathieu Schneider ($2.75 million, Rangers), but
none of them is much more than a limited contributor at this point
in his career. Far more intriguing is next year's potential class,
which includes Sakic, John LeClair, Jeremy Roenick, Peter Bondra,
and Rob Blake . . . Just wondering: If Wayne Gretzky is serious
about buying the Coyotes, does that mean bodyguard Dave Semenko
also would be part of the deal? ``I support whatever he does,''
said Glen Sather, the Great One's former boss in Edmonton. Asked by
a reporter if Gretzky has his phone number, Sather said, ``Yes, he
does.'' Speculation began immediately that Gretzky would want to
hire Sather as his GM. But Sather refuses to comment on that
speculation, which has run rampant for weeks, in connection with
the GM vacancy with the Rangers. Sather has two more years
remaining on his Edmonton deal, worth $1.9 million (US funds) per
year . . . Bruins short-timer Joey Mullen likely will hook on as an
assistant coach in Pittsburgh for next season, aiding new head man
Ivan Hlinka. Former Bruins goalie Eddie Johnston, who had been
behind the Penguins bench to aid Herb Brooks, will go back to
helping GM Craig Patrick in the front office . . . Anders Hedberg,
ex- of the Toronto front office, interviewed last week to become
the Flames' new GM. Meanwhile, the Flames find out Monday what
percentage of their season ticket-holders have committed to the
2000-01 season. Ownership has seen 1,500 new applicants pledge for
season tickets but wants 5,000 prior to June 30 or the club will be
put up for sale.

   Pricey club

   The Red Wings next season must pay Chris Chelios, Brendan
Shanahan, Steve Yzerman, and Nicklas Lidstrom $28 million _ equal
to or more than what a handful of clubs paid this season for their
entire rosters. Ouch. Headed toward a payroll of around $55
million, the Wings must begin to let some of the old guard go, and
that likely will include Igor Larionov and Larry Murphy. Larionov
is an unrestricted free agent July 1. Ditto for Murphy, unless he
agrees to sign on for substantially less than the $3 million he
played for last season . . . Tampa Bay boss Rick Dudley has until
June 1 to sign Brad Richards, who led the Quebec League in scoring
this season with a gaudy 186 points. Richards was the 64th pick in
the '98 draft _ the year the Lightning took Vincent Lecavalier No.
1 _ and he has blossomed into a scoring phenom. Keep in mind,
however: Richards was a fourth-liner for Team Canada at the World
Junior Championships at midseason. He is quick but lacks grit . . .
Swapped to New Jersey late in the season for Odelein, ex-Tabor
Academy star Deron Quint, picked 30th overall in the '94 draft,
should be having the time of his life right now with the
Cup-contending Devils. However, only days after arriving at Exit
16W, Quint was booted from the roster, for what GM Lou Lamoriello
described as conduct unbecoming a member of the club (i.e. he
missed a practice and was late for a team bus). Lamoriello said
Quint would never wear the uniform again. Once targeted as a top 10
pick in the draft, Quint is only 24 and has the skills to be a
regular NHL contributor. His agent, ex-Bruin Brian Lawton, wouldn't
get into specifics about his client's future, other than to say
Quint was back living in Arizona and remained eager to resume his
career. If the Bruins are going to lose Don Sweeney as an
unrestricted free agent, Quint could be someone to consider. He has
some real upside. The impression around the league is that he has
to grow up and be more selective about the company he keeps . . .
Keith Tkachuk was released from the hospital Friday after
undergoing surgery on an ankle and a knee. The ankle repair was
expected, but the knee procedure was somewhat of a surprise.
According to Tkachuk's Boston-based agent, Bob Murray, doctors
drilled holes in the knee, hoping to promote healing via increased
blood flow. Tkachuk is expected to be on crutches for about a week
and then begin a rehab process that could take another 8-9 weeks .
. . Czech star Jiri Dopita, a Bruins draft pick in '92 (No. 133
overall), could sign with the Panthers this offseason. His Czech
club has folded, and while he could play again in Prague, the
high-scoring forward finally may decide to come to North America.

   Sergei searching
</P>
<P>
   Word around Causeway Street is that Bruins winger Sergei
Samsonov is looking for a new agent. The three-year deal he signed
as a rookie, now expired, was negotiated by Jay Grossman . . .
Don't be surprised if the Sabres make Doug Gilmour, 37 years old
next month, available in the June expansion draft. But the price
tag would be high for either Columbus or Minnesota. Gilmour's
2000-01 salary is $6 million, and half of that will be paid by
Chicago, but only if Gilmour remains in Buffalo. Any club that
acquired him would have pay the full $6 million . . . Strange but
true: Former Needham High star Robbie Ftorek, canned as Devils head
coach late in the season, has been in the Meadowlands stands for
all but a couple of the Devils' home games. ``Because I love hockey
and I love the Devils,'' explained Ftorek. ``I've been pulling for
some of these guys for the better part of nine years. I think it's
important to support them.'' Ftorek missed games only if his son,
Sam, was playing for the Augusta (Georgia) Lynx in the ECHL on the
same day . . . Hard not to root for Flyer defenseman Andy Delmore,
the first rookie blue liner to pick up a hat trick in the playoffs.
Delmore sat in Northlands Coliseum for more than six hours in June
'94, his draft year, and never heard his name called. ``You know
what they say, hindsight is 20-20,'' said Al Murray, the Kings'
chief scout. ``But at the time, Delmore didn't hit anybody and was
really an erratic player.'' Philly signed Delmore as a free agent
in '97. After nearly three years in the minors, and at age 23, he
is blossoming. It underscores once more, said Murray, how very
difficult it is to forecast how teenagers will develop . . . Wonder
if the last holdup in the agreement to send NHL players to the Salt
Lake Olympics was a clause that specified that all furniture in
rooms occupied by Team USA players must be bolted to the floor.

1980 WAS THEIR SUMMER OF DISCONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Kemp still hears it, 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell someone you were on the 1980 Olympic team,'' he says.
``And they say, `Yeah? How did you do?' And you say, `Well, you
know, we didn't go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The United States team didn't go to Moscow that summer because
President Jimmy Carter wanted to protest the Soviet Union's
invasion of Afghanistan. Kemp and 500 fellow athletes were named to
the team. They're on the US Olympic Committee's alumni list.
They're considered Olympians. But they didn't go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always an explanation, a footnote that goes along with
it,'' says swimmer Craig Beardsley, who was favored to win a gold
medal in Moscow. ``I feel like I have to defend myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades after the boycott, millions of Americans can't quite
remember what did and didn't happen in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole team doesn't remember,'' says basketball player Carol
Blazejowski, now general manager of the WNBA's New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   But for the athletes who were kept home, the sense of shock, of
loss, of betrayal, of anger, endures.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have it taken away, it was like the death of a loved one,''
says Kemp, who was odds-on to win a gold medal in freestyle
wrestling. ``There's nothing you can do about it. You deal with it,
but you're never quite right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 1980 US athletes, such as hurdler Edwin Moses,
already had won gold at Olympus. Some of them, such as diver Greg
Louganis, would win it at Los Angeles four years later. But for
more than 200 of them, such as Kemp and Beardsley and Blazejowski
and hurdler Renaldo Nehemiah and cyclist Greg LeMond and coxswain
Holly Hatton, Moscow was their only chance.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Lost Generation, Olympians who never got to Olympus
and aren't quite sure that they deserve the label. Charlie
Altekruse, a rower on the 1980 team, once said he felt as if he had
a doctoral degree from a bogus university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody considers me an Olympian,'' says LeMond, who had a
strong chance at a gold in the road race that year. ``If you didn't
compete in the Olympics it was, `Well, you were on the 1980 team,
but so what?' ''
</P>
<P>
   What gnaws most at the Lost Generation, though, is that their
sacrifice went for naught. The boycott fizzled, as most of
America's staunchest allies _ Great Britain, France, Italy,
Australia, and others _ competed anyway. The Soviets easily topped
the medal table, gobbling up gold that would have gone to
Americans. Carter, who critics said was using the boycott as a
cheap election ploy, was turned out of office by Ronald Reagan. And
the Soviets led a counter-boycott that decimated the 1984 Games in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing,'' says Beardsley. ``No results on this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Politics intervenes
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing but loss, especially the loss of innocence.
The athletes had believed that the Olympics were sacred, that they
were beyond politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so young, so naive,'' says Nehemiah, who is now director
of worldwide track and field for Octagon, a Washington-area sports
marketing and management firm. ``The red-white-and-blue felt so
much a part of me. I never thought seriously that we would boycott.
I took it as propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the USOC voted formally to keep the athletes home in
April, the sports bodies still held trials, the athletes still kept
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was real,'' says Kemp, who now owns a Ford
auto dealership in Minnesota. ``I thought at the last minute we
would go. Dan Gable was coaching us. He said, `Don't look at the
newspapers. Just keep training.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The athletes couldn't imagine that the Olympics would be
disrupted because of international politics. Hadn't the 1972 Games
continued even after the Israelis were slaughtered by terrorists at
Munich? Weren't wars supposed to stop when the flame was kindled?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was superpowers playing with athletes like they were
playing chess,'' says LeMond. ``But in the scheme of the Cold War,
it was such a minor move.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carter first mentioned the boycott, two weeks after the Red
Army went into Afghanistan in December 1979, it was near the end of
a long list of proposed sanctions, such as deferred SALT talks,
restricted trade, curtailed fishing privileges.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Kremlim defied Carter's Feb. 20 deadline for a
pullout, the boycott moved to the top of the list. The Soviets
could buy American computers and wheat from somebody else, but they
couldn't get the US Olympic team on the spot market.
</P>
<P>
   So when the International Olympic Committee flatly refused to
move the Games out of Moscow, the White House told the USOC that
the boycott was on. The decision, Carter declared, was ``final and
irrevocable.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's say we do the bare minimum, the USOC athletes' council
suggested. We'll arrive at the Games at the last minute. We'll just
have a token flagbearer march in the opening ceremonies. We'll
bypass the medal ceremonies. We'll skip the closing ceremonies. In,
compete, out.
</P>
<P>
   No means no, the White House replied. We'll pull your passports
if we have to. It's a national security issue. If the Olympians
stayed home, Carter promised he would give them Congressional
medals and see that they had an alternate Games to compete in. If
they insisted on going to Moscow, it was all but unAmerican.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hypocritical,'' volleyball player Debbie Green said
then. ``Our winter athletes were described as heroes. We were the
most unpatriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   After the USOC voted not to go, the White House hosted an
Olympic Honors Day for the athletes. ``For being reluctant Great
Americans,'' rower Tiff Wood mused. Some of them posed with Carter;
others, notably the female rowers, refused to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were passionate that this was wrong and we were being
robbed,'' says Hatton, who coxed the eight and now coaches the BU
women's crew. ``I had stickers made up that said, `I'm here to make
sure this never happens again,' and I handed them out to anyone who
would wear them. Someone said that it wasn't the appropriate place
to do that. And I said, we shouldn't even be here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Watching and waiting
</P>
<P>
   How could their star-spangled dream have become a nightmare?
Right up until the eve of the opening ceremonies in July, some
athletes thought a miracle might happen. The Red Army might
withdraw. The IOC might move the Games. Carter might back down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they could compete as independents. Maybe they could
compete for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were training in Ratzeburg near the East German border
where we could see the guard towers and we had this crazy idea,''
Hatton recalls. ``Let's row over and get ourselves arrested and ask
the East Germans to force us to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unthinkable that the Games could begin without the
Americans. When they did, some Olympians couldn't bear to watch.
Others couldn't bear not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reluctantly watched because I felt it was my turn,'' says
Nehemiah, who saw East Germany's Thomas Munkelt win the 110-meter
hurdles in the slowest time since 1964. ``I needed to see what I
was missing, as painful as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Nehemiah made his point a couple of weeks later when he blew
away the Olympic medalists in a London meet. Beardsley set a world
record in the 200-meter butterfly at the US nationals that would
have won by a body length in Moscow. But Lord Killanin wasn't there
to give them a gold medal and nobody raised their flag. The
five-ringed parade had passed without them.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of the US athletes vowed to chase that parade all the way
to Los Angeles and claim their places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot boycott our own Games,'' figured volleyball player
Rita Crockett. ``I don't care what anybody says.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, like sprinter Evelyn Ashford and swimmer Rowdy Gaines,
the golden ring came around again in 1984. For others, the moment
had fled forever. Kemp lost to Dave Schultz in the wrestling
trials. Beardsley missed the swimming team by one place.
</P>
<P>
   Others couldn't hang on for another quadrennium. Peter Schnugg
had tried for three Olympic water polo teams. In 1972, when the US
won the bronze medal, he was the 13th man on an 11-man squad. In
1976, he'd made the team and the team hadn't qualified. In 1980,
he'd made the team and the team hadn't competed. He was 29 now.
``Gotta go to work sometime,'' Schnugg concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Nehemiah eventually went off to play for the NFL's San Francisco
49ers and won a Super Bowl ring. Blazejowski signed with the
Women's Professional Basketball League. LeMond turned pro and won
the Tour de France three times. Hatton took a coaching job at BU.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but ifs
</P>
<P>
   They are the Olympians with explanations, with footnotes, caught
up in an unfortunate convergence of time and circumstance. Some are
still bitter about the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll never forgive Jimmy Carter for doing that,'' says
Nehemiah.
</P>
<P>
   Others have chalked it up to chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the way the dice came up,'' shrugs Beardsley.
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Army had stayed home . . . If Carter hadn't been
president . . . If the Lords of the Rings had moved the Games to
the UN parking lot . . . If the East Germans had arrested the whole
team . . .
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years and the ifs still haunt the Lost Generation _ and
always will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that stays with you,'' says Beardsley. ``You
can't shake it. Everyone carries some emotional baggage from 1980 _
and some questions they'll always have.''

TOO MANY HURDLES FOR MARATHONERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the ``wrong'' people (Christine Clark and Rod DeHaven)
have won the Olympic marathon trials, limiting the Americans to one
man and one woman in Sydney, maybe the USA Track and Field people
will use their heads next time and hold the races on a pancake-flat
course (like Chicago) on a weekend in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   That way, it's much more likely that one or more runners will
meet the ``A'' qualifying standard for the Games. And if they
don't, they'll still have at least six months to do it elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sorry state of American marathoning, it was silly to
hold this year's trials on hilly courses in Charleston, S.C., and
Pittsburgh. When both days turned out hot, slow times were
inevitable. Clark ran 30 seconds slower than the women's ``A''
standard of 2:33; DeHaven was 90 seconds slower than the men's
2:14.

   Greece makes a change
</P>
<P>
   All it took was three years, two inept presidents, and a wakeup
call with a two-by-four from the Lords of the Rings for the Athens
organizers to do the obvious: put Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki,
who directed the bid committee for the 2004 Summer Games, in
charge. ``Now she is the president _ finally,'' exulted
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch,
after the 44-year-old Angelopoulos-Daskalaki replaced the
beleaguered Panagiotis Thomopoulos. At the top of
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki's priority list: venue construction, hotel
rooms, and a host TV broadcaster. The IOC has given Athens 100 days
to get back on track . . . You'd think that IOC vice president
Kevan Gosper of Australia would be lying low while the Olympic
ethics commission investigates whether he took a family ski junket
to Salt Lake City on the bidders' tab. Now, he's embroiled in
``Sophie's Choice,'' the controversial selection of his 11-year-old
daughter, Sophie, to be the first Australian to carry the Olympic
torch after the flame was kindled in Greece last week. He
subsequently apologized for what he called ``fatherly pride'' and a
``lapse in judgment'' . . . Next challenge for the Lords of the
Rings, who are still grappling with doping: what to do about
Internet broadcast rights. Should the IOC sell them separately? Or
bundle them with television packages? If so, will it have to
rewrite NBC's $3.5 billion deal, which runs through 2008? All of
that will be discussed at a New Media summit in November at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland. ``At the moment,'' says Samaranch, an
Old Media guy, ``we are lost.''

   So-so showing
</P>
<P>
   The US men's ice hockey team took a three-minute snooze against
the Slovaks in Thursday's world quarterfinals, gave up three goals,
and ended up being bounced from the tournament after going 4-0-2 in
its first six games. Still, it wasn't a bad showing by the
Americans, who had only 13 NHLers on the roster. And it was
dramatically better than the disgraceful walk-through turned in by
the host Russians, who lost four of their six games and were hooted
off the ice in St. Petersburg. Not that they expected to make the
award stand, which hasn't happened in six years. But losing to the
Swiss? The Latvians? The Belarussians? Now that they're cashing NHL
paychecks, many Russians consider playing for the motherland to be
beneath them. Meanwhile, the Czechs and Slovaks joust for the gold
medal Sunday . . . Managing the US Olympic baseball team (all minor
leaguers for the first time) will be ex-Dodger manager Tommy
Lasorda, who'll wear his old No. 2. Lasorda, now a senior vice
president with the ball club, vows he'll bleed red-white-and-blue .
. . Clutch effort by the US women's water polo team, which edged
Hungary by a goal at the last-chance Olympic qualifier in Sicily to
earn a ticket to Sydney. And a crowning moment for 39-year-old
Maureen O'Toole, the squad's grande dame, who unretired for the
second time when the women's event was added to the Olympic program
and made the team. Missing from the six-nation field will be Italy
and Hungary, the last two world champions . . . Turns out that the
US Olympic track cycling events were just for practice. None of the
victors met the tough new time standards, which are pegged to world
medal levels. (Erin Hartwell, who won medals in the kilo at the
last two Games, has switched to pursuit this time after knee
surgery.) So the coaches will choose the entire team in July . . .
Bittersweet victory for Bill May, who won the solo, duet (with
Kristina Lum), and team titles (with the Santa Clara Aquamaids) at
the recent US synchronized swimming championships but is banned
from the Olympics because he's a he. ``This is one small step for
me, one giant step for mankind,'' declared the 21-year-old May,
only the fourth swimmer in 55 years to post a sweep.

   New job for Schultz
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, who stepped down as USOC executive director this
year after the job was changed to CEO, has turned up as chair of
MAI Sports, a Kansas-based marketing and consulting firm. ``After
50 years in the business, I knew I couldn't quit cold turkey,''
says the 70-year-old Schultz. ``But I'm not going to do this 60
hours a week.'' . . . The 12 gymnasts named to the US Olympic team
at the August trials at the FleetCenter may not all compete in
Sydney. If the international federation approves the use of
alternates for ``tactical'' substitutions, USA Gymnastics probably
will ask the USOC for the right to replace anyone who's not on form
at the Games . . . With nandrolone positives off the charts _ 343
last year _ sports federations such as track and field and swimming
are looking into whether athletes may be unwittingly ingesting the
banned steroid with food or herbal supplements. Meanwhile, the best
way to beat a positive nandrolone test may be to say you ate meat
from uncastrated pigs. That was the alibi used by long-distance
swimmers from Spain and Slovenia after they were nailed at a meet
in Brazil . . . Looks like a sellout for the US Olympic track and
field trials, which will be held in Sacramento in July. By last
month, the organizers had already sold 13,000 all-event packages
for Cal State-Sacramento's 23,000-seat stadium. Single seats go on
sale Monday. Call 1-877-873-9690, toll-free, for details . . . That
Colombian shooter who killed two armed assailants on the road home
from practice recently wasn't a garden-variety 49-year-old
marksman. Bernardo Tobar will be competing in his fifth Olympics at
Sydney. His specialty: rapid-fire pistol . . . Hanging up the sled
after 16 years, three Olympics (a historic silver at Nagano), an
overall World Cup title, and 26 international medals is US luger
Gordy Sheer, who teamed with doubles partner Chris Thorpe for the
last dozen seasons. Sheer, who is 28 and recently married, says he
can't give it 100 percent anymore. Thorpe says he'll keep sliding .
. . Why can't newly independent East Timor compete in Sydney?
Because the former Indonesian province doesn't have the required
five sports federations to qualify. That's why the IOC turned
thumbs-down last month . . . Most inventive anti-Olympic display so
far: The ``Bondi Warriors,'' who don't want a temporary 10,000-seat
volleyball stadium built on their famed beach, buried themselves up
to their necks in the sand . . . How does skater Michelle Kwan feel
about being named one of People magazine's ``50 Most Beautiful
People''? ``Flabbergasted,'' says the world champ. ``Obviously
they've never seen me going to an 8 a.m. class wearing a baseball
cap with no makeup.''

PROMISING CAREER NOW JUST A MEMORY

<P>
   Almost everyone seemed to agree that Adam Petty had a bright
future as a NASCAR Winston Cup driver. He had, after all, the Petty
pedigree. Though he was still in his second season on the Busch
Series circuit, there was no doubt that Winston Cup was Adam
Petty's destination.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely known in the garage area that Petty Enterprises
was grooming the 19-year-old son of NASCAR veteran Kyle Petty as
the next heir to the throne after he made his Winston Cup debut
last month at Texas Motor Speedway. But that event was quickly
overshadowed when Lee Petty, the 86-year-old patriarch, died three
days later.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the auto racing community mourned the loss of another
Petty when Adam died of head trauma he sustained in a crash during
practice for Sunday's Busch 200 at New Hampshire International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   While Lee Petty's passing was not unexpected _ he had been in
failing health since a Feb. 9 stomach operation _ Adam Petty's
death was jarring because he was so young, so talented, and so full
of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brightest stars often shine for a brief period of time,''
said Eddie Gossage, general manager of Texas Motor Speedway, where
Petty made his Winston Cup debut in the DirecTV 500 April 2. ``I'm
glad my last memory of Adam was only a week ago, laughing and
cutting up as we took part in the annual Kyle Petty Charity
Motorcycle Ride Across America. Adam was always smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam inherited that infectious smile from his father, Kyle, and
his grandfather, Richard Petty, but Friday he brought so many to
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam and I were joking around this morning right before
practice, and then to have this happen is unreal,'' said Winston
Cup driver Steve Park, who competed with Petty on the Busch
circuit. ``This hurts. I was on the motorcycle ride with Kyle the
week before last, and we raised a lot of money for charity. The
Pettys do a lot for other people, and it hurts that we can't do
anything for them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   All anyone could do for the grieving Pettys was offer
condolences and fond remembrances. The immediate outpouring was
reminiscent of that following the tragedies endured by Bobby
Allison, who lost two sons _ Clifford, who was killed while making
a practice run in his Busch car at Michigan in 1992, and Davey, the
popular Winston Cup driver who was killed in a helicopter crash at
Talladega, Ala., in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have someone so young and with such a bright future ahead
of him die like this is a hard thing to swallow,'' said NASCAR
driver Johnny Benson. ``The Petty family has helped build this
sport. It goes back to Lee, Richard, and Kyle, and I know it would
have continued with Adam. They are almost like royalty in our
sport. For a family that has done so much to this sport and then to
have this happen is just terrible.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Going bump in the night
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart spent last Saturday night stewing in the garage
area at Richmond (Va.) International Speedway. A pit-road collision
with rookie driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. had knocked Stewart out of
the lead and back to 23d with 40 laps to go. It was a cosmic
collision of sorts, between last year's star rookie and this year's
rising comet and front-runner for the Raybestos Rookie of the Year
Award.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. became the first repeat winner on the Winston Cup
circuit with his triumph in the Pontiac Excitement 400. It was his
second victory in 16 career starts and came just four races after
his first Winston Cup triumph, in the DirecTV 500.
</P>
<P>
   But it came at Stewart's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart tried to put the frustration of this sophomore season in
perspective when he calmly discussed the incident during Tuesday's
Winston Cup teleconference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just racing luck,'' said Stewart, whose No. 20 Home
Depot Pontiac suffered a flat left rear tire when it was clipped by
the right front fender of Earnhardt's car as the rookie pulled into
heavy traffic on pit road during a late-race caution period. ``I
haven't had any racing luck all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, though, Stewart wasn't as composed. When he
pulled into the garage, he gunned his engine loudly. When he
climbed out, he was told to report to the NASCAR hauler. He stomped
off for his postrace tete-a-tete with sanctioning officials and was
followed by a swarm of media looking for an angry sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine you're playing against Shaquille O'Neal and you go up
to slam dunk the ball and Shaq slams the ball in your face,''
Stewart said. ``Nobody sticks a microphone in your face and says,
`Well, how does that make you feel?' They always finish the game
and then they have a 15-minute period to cool off and they go in
and do interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have that luxury in our sport. As soon as we get out
of the car, people are sticking microphones in your face. If I got
out of the car and I wasn't upset about what happened, I wouldn't
be driving Winston Cup. Nobody would want me in their race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mad because it was Dale. I wasn't mad because I felt
like he did anything wrong. I was just mad at the circumstances.
The next day I went fishing and I was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I still disappointed? Yeah. Was I mad about it anymore?
Not at all. I found a way of looking at the positive side of it,
and the positive of it was that we ended up in the Top 10. To come
from 23d to eighth in the last 35 laps was a pretty good
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   As runner-up Terry Labonte stated afterward, Stewart had the
best car on the track at the end of the race. But as taxing as this
season has been _ with 3 DNFs in 11 starts _ Stewart knows there
are many miles left to go, beginning next weekend with The Winston
all-star race at Lowe's Speedway in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those nights that we thought everything was
going to go our way and, in the end, we had some bad luck,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More miles to cover
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR announced that it will be expanding to two new markets
next year, with races at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Ill., and
Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kan. Both venues, still under
construction, will be 1.5-mile triovals. ``The addition of these
two major markets promises to make the 2001 season an exciting
one,'' said Mike Helton, senior vice president and chief operating
officer for NASCAR. ``We hope even more new fans will join with
existing fans to enjoy another breakthrough year for our sport. The
addition of the Kansas Speedway and Chicagoland Speedway provides
two great new markets for the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, the NASCAR
Busch Series, drivers, teams, and sponsors.'' . . . While expansion
may be all well and good, it no doubt will take a physical toll on
drivers and their crews, prompting some car owners to expand their
operations to include more employees and, possibly, entertain the
idea of having split crews. ``When you move to these number of
races, the problem is that the strain (of running 36 weekends) goes
to the crews who are on the road,'' said Joe Gibbs, who fields cars
for Stewart and Bobby Labonte, the current Winston Cup points
leader. ``When you think about it, these guys are on the road from
Thursday to Sunday. I think the drivers _ they have more free time
and are on their own schedules with their own jet planes _ I think
they can do it. But I think the people we run the risk of wearing
out and running down and kind of messing up somebody's life would
be the crew chief.'' And the way Gibbs sees it, ``There is no way
you can take the pressure off him, if he's got to go to these
races, because he's the one who's got to make everything happen.
So, as a consequence, what we need to do as a race team is find
ways to give them a break. It's going to mean more people and more
money being spent and, of course, that's going to drive up budgets,
but I don't see any way around it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Double feature
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Robby Gordon announced last weekend that he
was going to attempt double duty May 28 by driving the Indy 500 and
the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Clearly, Gordon believes he has
some unfinished business at Indy, where last year he ran out of
fuel and fell out of the lead with less than a lap to go. He will
drive a car fielded by Indy Racing League owner John Menard. ``It's
been a topic we've thrown around for months between myself, John,
and Mike Held (Gordon's Winston Cup owner),'' said Gordon, who was
thwarted in a similar effort three years ago with Team Sabco owner
Felix Sabates when the Indy 500 was rained out. ``We didn't want to
take any focus away from our Winston Cup effort because that's
where we're putting our future. But there's an off-week in May
that's very convenient to make this happen.'' Gordon will use that
date to qualify during the Indy 500 time trials next weekend.
``With the cars John Menard and Tom Knapp put on the track, all I
have to do is show up with my helmet and drive,'' said Gordon.
``Greg Ray has done all the preseason testing and he's quick;
hopefully that's a good sign for me. Honestly, if I wasn't going to
Indy I'd probably be racing something else.'' . . . Before Gordon
proceeds with his Indy-Charlotte Memorial Day shuttle plan, he may
want to heed the advice of Stewart, who pulled off the double play
but had this to say: ``It was very physically demanding and that's
the No. 1 reason why we decided not to do it again this year. The
Indy 500 started at 11 o'clock in the morning and the 600 didn't
end until around 11 at night. So, about 1,100 miles and 12 hours
later, there wasn't much of me left.'' . . . When the Winston Cup
circuit arrives at NHIS July 9 for its first of two visits to the
mile oval this season, Patriots fans might recognize the burly
jackman of Elliott Sadler's No. 21 Citgo Ford. It's none other than
Tim Goad, 34, the former defensive lineman who played seven seasons
in Foxborough after being drafted in 1987 out of North Carolina.
After his 10-year NFL career ended with the Baltimore Ravens in
1996, Goad, who grew up in rural Virginia as a huge NASCAR fan,
joined the Wood Brothers crew in September 1998. Now he spends his
Sundays wrangling in the NASCAR pits instead of toiling in NFL
trenches.

RILEY UPSET WITH HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Riley was not a happy man Saturday. He talked a
lot more like a coach staring at a 2-1 deficit rather than one
holding a 2-1 advantage in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   His concerns? The attitude of his team. Beneficiaries of a
controversial call at the end of Game 3 on Friday night, the Miami
Heat reported for practice Saturday at Madison Square Garden with
what Riley said was a ``b.s.-loose attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be classic Riley playing the role of master manipulator
or it could be that he saw something that legitimately concerned
him. The Heat won Game 3, 77-76, in overtime, and can take a
commanding 3-1 lead over the Knicks with a victory Sunday in Game
4.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that would make Riley happy. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat watched film for about an hour, then went through a
brief practice. Riley was snippy from the start, whether the topic
was Anthony Carter's disputed game-winner, the status of Tim
Hardaway, or the frame of mind of his battle-hardened team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of it. We're all tired of it,'' he said. ``We're
tired of a lot of things. We're tired of having an advantage and
giving it back. We're tired of winning and relaxing and thinking
we've got something. I'm tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of players' attitudes about, `OK, we got a leg up on
them and (Sunday) we're going to come back and not play with the
same type of ferocity.' Somewhere, we gotta be men and step up and
put some big-time pressure on this team. That's what our
opportunity is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! And he won Game 3. The Knicks, meanwhile, were in somber
mode at their workout, which was more talking and watching than
playing. Coach Jeff Van Gundy stressed that his team has to start
rebounding _ Miami is killing the Knicks at both ends _ while also
admitting they are still reeling from Carter's behind-the-backboard
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down,'' Van Gundy said. ``But we can't stay down.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Latrell Sprewell, ``We're disappointed. You work that hard
to get that close and it slips away from you at the end. It's
tiring mentally. It drains you. That's why we didn't do too much
(at practice). Guys are a little down. They're tired, low on
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's game-winner came with 2.2 seconds left in overtime. He
was behind the basket when he lofted a floater that hit the rim
like dead weight and settled in. Some replays appeared to show the
ball going over the backboard, which would make it an illegal shot.
Van Gundy said after the game that it was ``clear as day'' the shot
should not have counted. He hadn't changed his mind Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by what I said. But I want the team to start looking
forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, too, was trying to do the same thing. Riley said the
referees' decision was a ``good no-call'' and added, ``I'm not
going to get into it. Whether or not it crossed, barely, or
whatever, the game is over with. And to hell with them. That's it.
We're 2-1. The home-court advantage doesn't mean anything., We're
moving on to Game 4 and they can lament all they want.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway shot some Saturday and said his sore left foot was
improved. It's hard to see how it couldn't be. ``I'm going to ice
it,'' he said. ``It's sore. But I'm playing.'' He sat out the final
22 minutes of Game 3 while Carter led the attack . . . Riley's
correct about home-court advantage not meaning much. In the 20
playoff games between the Heat and the Knicks, the teams are 6-6 in
Miami and 4-4 in New York . . . Bruce Bowen was not credited with a
steal on the final possession of Game 3, even though he deflected
the inbounds pass intended for Sprewell. ``I just reacted to his
cut,'' Bowen said. ``It happened too quick to even think I'm going
to get a hand on it.'' And the steal? ``That's OK. I'll take the
win.''

HEARD FROM WITH THE LONG BALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Red Sox sat quietly in their dugout at Camden
Yards. At times they watched in silence as a skyscraper of a man _
a 6-foot-6-inch pitcher nicknamed JJ _ tried to no-hit them. It
didn't take long for them to realize that they were missing their
favorite, 24-hour, heard-in-two-languages, walking soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pedro Martinez. On Friday the Sox needed his
right arm to secure a win. Saturday against the Orioles, they
didn't need a complete-game, 15-strikeout two-hitter. They needed
his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting there and, I think it was Andy Sheets who
said, `Get Pedro out here; it's too quiet,' '' Donnie Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   So the call was made to the clubhouse, where Martinez was
watching the early parts of what became a 5-1 Sox win. His
teammates heard him coming through the tunnel before they saw him,
just as you can hear a subway train seconds before it screechingly
arrives at its station.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox could hear that Martinez already was chatting in English
and Spanish as he walked toward the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it was Spanglish,'' Scott Hatteberg said. ``When we're
struggling, we always like to have him around to loosen things up.
I think he's got the Energizer bunny beat with all his energy. It's
unbelievable. He uses all of his own material, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez not only talked to his teammates, he talked to JJ
(Jason Johnson) as well. He reminded the 26-year-old pitcher that
he was throwing a no-hitter. As baseball fans know, there's one
subject that a man with a no-hitter in progress doesn't want
mentioned: a no-hitter in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Before a breeze blew into the park, more than 48,000 fans were
exposed to what felt like desert heat. The Sox must have looked to
the mound and saw a mirage of a young Nolan Ryan. In his first 5
2/3 innings, Johnson had given up no hits and five walks. He was
backed by a single run, Brady Anderson's third-inning homer, which
looked as if it would be enough. After walking Troy O'Leary in the
sixth, he gave up a Mike Stanley single.
</P>
<P>
   The game was never the same. Soon, Martinez was not the only one
talking to and about the Orioles. And, in the eighth, everyone
would have understood if Baltimore reliever Mike Trombley had begun
talking to himself.
</P>
<P>
   By the top of the eighth, Johnson had thrown 115 pitches and was
out of the game. The Orioles turned the ball over to Buddy Groom
and then summoned Trombley. Pinch runner Manny Alexander was on
first when Trombley took the mound for his warmup pitches. Stanley,
who was at the plate, chatted with Hatteberg during the short
break.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Stanley: What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg: He usually throws me splitters. That's what I'm going
to look for.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley: I think I'm going to sit on a first-pitch curveball.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch was not a curve, but as Hatteberg said, ``I
don't think Stan-o had a plan for the second pitch, so he stayed
with his plan for the first.'' As Stanley predicted, the curveball
came. It was not a good one. Stanley caught it and sent it 367 feet
over the left-field fence. When Orioles fans saw that, they had
conversations of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They went something like this: (Expletive)!
</P>
<P>
   It was 2-1 and, unfortunately for starter Jeff Fassero, he
couldn't win the game. The 37-year-old lefthander has pitched well
in his last three starts. Saturday, he walked one Oriole and gave
up the homer to Anderson. Even that was not a bad pitch. It came on
a 3-and-2 count. Fassero and his catcher, Hatteberg, had two
options on the pitch. Hatteberg believes they chose the best one,
but Anderson was able to connect anyway.
</P>
<P>
   (Brief tangent: You should hope that the new Fenway Park is
nothing like this place. Aesthetically, it is beautiful.
Competitively, it is a disgrace. Power alleys of 364 and 373? Scant
foul territory? Every inning is batting practice here.)
</P>
<P>
   As Hatteberg walked to the plate, following Stanley, he kept
thinking of Trombley's splitters. He got it on a 2-and-0 pitch. It
was another home run. Trombley, from Wilbraham, Mass., was being
called lots of creative names at that point. It was 3-1. You could
tell he was frustrated. He couldn't control his breaking pitch. So
when he hit Wilton Veras with a curve, there wasn't a lot of
movement in the Sox dugout. Just a few words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one guy moved to the top step of the dugout,'' Stanley
said. Anyway, why charge the mound? It's better to hit a guy's
pitch rather than his face. Sadler and Veras understood that.
Sadler understood it so well that he started to have a conversation
with himself.
</P>
<P>
   It went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Sadler: This guy is struggling. The fans are on him. I know he
wants to throw a strike. I'm going to look for a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler to Sadler: Good point, Donnie.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Sadler got a first-pitch fastball and pulled it to
left. ``I'm a small guy,'' the 5-foot-6-inch Sadler said, ``I'm
usually not looking for off-speed stuff to pull.'' He got
underneath the fastball and helped it travel 375 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Trombley is also the pitcher who gave up ninth-inning homers to
Darren Lewis and Jeff Frye last June 14. Neither man has homered
since then. He has now allowed five memorable late-inning Sox
homers in less than a year. He doesn't feel good about that. But at
least he's done it against the perfect group of guys. They
obviously love to talk among themselves and the reliever has given
them plenty to discuss.

APPIER'S EXPERIENCE A PLUS TO A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While his teammates watched TV, played cards and
joked in the locker room, Kevin Appier was working out in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   When his teammates moved on to the dugout they initiated
sunflower seed-spitting contests and swung from the edge of the
dugout roof like children on monkey bars. Appier simply shook his
head as he walked past on his way to the outfield, where he would
do some running.
</P>
<P>
   Since being traded to the youthful Oakland Athletics late last
season, Appier has found a team in which his maturity is
appreciated almost as much as his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, this is the same Kevin Appier who once had a
reputation as being temperamental, who wasn't always receptive to
older players trying to guide him in his early years with the
Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a decade makes.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Lancaster native is in his 11th major-league
season. He enjoys the enthusiasm and relaxed atmosphere of the A's
- traits he believes will help him reach the playoffs for the first
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But he also realizes it is his time to do what players like Mark
Gubicza, Floyd Bannister and Charlie Leibrandt did for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am,'' Appier said. ``They come to me, the pitchers
do. The younger guys come to me and I'll offer advice - even if
they don't ask for it sometimes. So yeah, I'm to that age where I'm
the mentor type.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old, I admit it. I was the youngest guy for so many years.
It feels weird, but there are some older guys here, some veterans.
I think it's a real good blend between youth and veteran guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relaxed, but in a good way. Not relaxed, like lazy, but
relaxed where your actions are good and very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Appier began the season 3-2 with a 4.06 ERA before a strained
right forearm put him on the disabled list. He returned Saturday to
start against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander's career got off to a rocky start when he went
1-4 with a 9.14 ERA in six games in 1989, but he emerged as the
Royals' ace in 1990 after injuries to Bret Saberhagen and Gubicza.
He won at least 13 games in five of the next six seasons and was
named to the American League All-Star team in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his success came from realizing he didn't have to strike
out everyone. Experience and building confidence has also helped.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing that experience and getting young players to keep
believing in themselves when they struggle is one of the biggest
impacts Appier tries to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things have gone bad for a while, to still know that
you're a good pitcher is really humongous,'' Appier said. ``When
you're young and you first came into this game, say you have a
rough month. Well, a lot of guys instantly start doubting whether
they even belong here at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came up, I was getting beat up, my arm was tired
and I didn't know if I was good enough to stay here. Then, '90 I
had a real good year and that's when I felt like I belonged here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when it seems like the advice he gives isn't sinking in,
Appier persists in giving it. He remembers how much he picked up as
a young player despite perceptions of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to them more than they thought,'' Appier said. ``I
wasn't very good at communicating back then. I definitely paid
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm more mature, I'm realizing how important that
was.''

SOX DO YARD WORK, RAKE IN 4TH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Don't swing at a single pitch. Understand?
</P>
<P>
   The No. 4 batter in the Red Sox lineup couldn't believe what he
was hearing Saturday. Then again, Derek Lowe has had far more
experience as the Sox closer than he has had as the team's cleanup
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I was shocked when they told me, `You're up third,' ''
Lowe said. ``And when (pitching coach) Joe Kerrigan came over and
said, `Don't swing,' I thought he was kidding. Then he said,
`Really, don't swing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was little cause for Lowe to take his bat off his shoulder
in the ninth inning, not after Mike Stanley, Scott Hatteberg, and
Donnie Sadler hit home runs in the span of six pitches from
Baltimore reliever Mike Trombley the inning before, lifting the Sox
to a 5-1 win. It was Boston's fourth straight win and sent the
Orioles to their sixth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon that began with the Sox begging for a hit _ they
went 5 2/3 innings before Stanley singled for their first hit off
starter Jason Johnson _ they ended the day with Lowe obeying orders
not to swing.
</P>
<P>
   And while it may have been risky business for Jimy Williams to
manage himself out of a DH, it was a disaster for Orioles manager
Mike Hargrove to summon Trombley.
</P>
<P>
   Trombley, brought in to face Stanley with two out and Brian
Daubach aboard on a single off lefty Buddy Groom, hung a 1-and-0
curveball to Stanley, who smacked it into the left-field seats to
give the Sox a 2-1 lead. The next batter was Hatteberg, making just
his seventh start in 33 games, and he hit a 2-and-0 splitter to the
same destination.
</P>
<P>
   Trombley hit Wilton Veras with his next pitch (a breaking ball;
no need to call Frank Robinson), and after a visit from pitching
coach Sammy Ellis, Sadler went deep on the first pitch he saw for
his first hit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's homer gave the Sox a trifecta on the same day the
Dedham (Mass.) High marching band strolled down Pratt Street here
in the Preakness parade. The Dedham kids made sweeter music than
the chorus of boos that cascaded down on Trombley, the Western
Massachusetts native (Wilbraham) who was buried by the biggest
regular-season crowd in Camden Yards history, 48,579.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tough when it happens at home,'' Lowe said of Trombley,
who was with the Twins last June when he gave up back-to-back shots
in the ninth to Darren Lewis and Jeff Frye, Frye's being Boston's
only walkoff homer of the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for the guy,'' Lowe said. ``What happened was good for
us, but you don't wish that on anybody. But fans are going to do
what they're going to do. Boston fans do some crazy things, too.
But as players, we've all been there, and it's not a good
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who gave up four hits in two innings but escaped jams in
the eighth and ninth, was offered little sympathy in the Boston
clubhouse after his four-pitches-and-out at-bat against Orioles
reliever Mike Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best thing he could have done there,'' said
Daubach, who improved his average against lefties to .300 (6 for
20) with his eighth-inning single off Groom. ``His helmet looked
nice and shiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg, who had been robbed of hits by Orioles first baseman
Jeff Conine before he connected off Trombley, has seen Lowe taking
batting practice in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great golfer,'' Hatteberg said, ``but he can't swing a
baseball bat. As bad as it was, he did go up to the plate with a
game plan. The plan was don't swing the bat. But he didn't fool
anybody. He was flopping around out there, no (batting) glove, no
nothing. Pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe did show big-league potential as a hitter after his whiff,
however, tipping his cap to the fans applauding him behind the
visitors' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were giving me a mock cheer,'' said Lowe, whose two
innings of scoreless work made a first-time winner out of Rich
Garces, who entered in the seventh after Jeff Fassero walked
leadoff hitter B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to have fun with the game. That's why I tipped my cap.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Lowe could recall getting a hit was in spring
training two years ago. Naturally, he remembered the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearwater, against the Phillies, Tyler Green was pitching,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a clubhouse where Pedro Martinez chirps that he'd like to
come back as Nomar Garciaparra if given the chance, Lowe admitted
he would have liked to take a hack. And that was even without some
needling from Frye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff came over to me and said, `Hey, that's not going on the
back of Kerrigan's baseball card, it's going on yours,' '' Lowe
said. ``0 for 1 with a strikeout.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real takeaway, Hatteberg said, is that the Sox won again
without Garciaparra and Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's huge,'' Hatteberg said. ``It happened last
year, too. When your stars are out, other guys step up when they
need to. Fassero gave us a chance. We've got to win these games,
and today was a good indication we have the guys who can do it.''

SUNS FACED ADVERSITY ALL SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Phoenix Suns, or what's left of them, did not ask
for blindfold, last cigarette or final request - say, Michael
Jordan coming out of retirement?
</P>
<P>
   They know the numbers as well as anyone. They enter today's Game
4 against the Lakers down 0-3 in their best-of-seven series. And
not one team in the NBA history has ever come back from 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   That's zero in 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   So they skipped practice Saturday, had a nice lunch together at
a local restaurant and then met the media, stoically acknowledging
their ambitions have been scaled down.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it's real simple - we just need to win one ballgame,''
Suns veteran Kevin Johnson said. ``And that's what we're trying to
do at this point. We're not trying to look at winning the series,
because that obviously seems insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can win just one ballgame and force a Game 5, I think
we'll be very content with that at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   For Phoenix, overcoming adversity this season has become a
practiced art. This time, though, even the grittiest of Suns feel
slightly lost in the Lakers' shadow. They've been reduced to
wondering what might have been, talk of their character, and their
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can stay healthy, maybe we can have the best record in
the league,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said. ``We won 53 games and did
that with one of our players (Tom Gugliotta) almost dying, a
coaching change, injuries to Penny (Hardaway), Shawn Marion,
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the whole team has been hurt at some point besides
Rodney (Rogers). That just shows the character of this team, that
no matter what the circumstances are, we're going to try and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Suns have seemed a marvelous collection of
pieces, never quite taking form. But this year, the pieces kept
coming and going.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, the Suns lost Hardaway, the
high-profile new addition at the center of their offseason buzz,
with a sore right foot. He missed the first 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he came back, the Suns had a new coach. Danny Ainge
decided after 20 games he wanted out to be with his family, and
assistant Scott Skiles was promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Marion, their No. 1 draft pick, hurt his knee Dec. 5 and missed
the next 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   Starting forward Tom Gugliotta survived a life-threatening
seizure, came back and then tore his left knee up and was lost for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days later, Kidd - their best overall player - broke his
right ankle. Kidd returned in the playoffs against San Antonio but
is almost trying to rehab the knee in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And now Cliff Robinson, who became their leading scorer (18.5
points per game) amid all the injuries, twisted his ankle Friday
and is questionable for today's game.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive the Suns, if they feel just a tad snake-bitten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't let ourselves get caught up in that all year, and I
don't think we will now,'' Robinson said. ``If I can go, I'll go.
But if I had to go out there and play right now, I wouldn't be able
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who has been in a few of these games
against teams down 0-3, hardly expects Phoenix to suddenly play
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll come out with guns blazing, playing nothing to
lose and everything to gain, upset-minded, show their dander or
their courage,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then as the game gets more and more difficult, doubts
start to form. Close-out games are very difficult. You have to be
able to hang around, and usually find a way to win in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway said the Suns have figured out how to beat the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If possible, you have to play a perfect game,'' he said.
``Less than 10 turnovers, make 50 percent of your shots, go to the
foul line more than them and outrebound them. Because nothing is
going to be given to us. That's how you have to beat the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality, it can be ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand it's a tough situation to be in and just have to
take it one game at a time,'' Robinson said. ``It's a cliche, but
at this point, that's all we can fall back on.''

Love, Huston tied for Byron Nelson lead 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Prevailing winds shifted directions yesterday at
the GTE Byron Nelson Classic. So did front-runner Davis Love III,
whose inability to control his approach shots at the Four Seasons
Resort caused him to backtrack to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the player who held the largest 36-hole lead in
tournament history has frittered away a four-stroke advantage and
finds himself tied with John Huston heading into today's final
round. A group of nine players remain within six strokes of the
co-leaders, who stand at 10-under par after exhibiting different
tolerance levels for withstanding northerly wind gusts to 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Huston held firm, scrambling his way to a 67 despite missing
seven greens in regulation. Love struggled. He pumped four approach
shots into greenside bunkers, airmailed two greens in the final
five holes and collected just two birdies after making nine in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let a lot of people back into this thing,'' Love said after
a third-round 71. ``I haven't played here enough to see the wind
blow from that direction. I lost that confidence of just hopping up
there and knowing it was going to go the right distance every time.
I got surprised on some shots and I started second-guessing
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, who blistered the TPC course for an opening 66 while
playing in 38 mph southerly winds, found himself playing yo-yo with
his approach shots after yesterday's 180-degree shift in wind
direction. He was long at No. 12, short at No. 13, long at Nos. 14
and 15 and short at Nos. 16 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   Love shot even par over his final 13 holes by leaning on his
short game but surrendered four strokes to Huston. The last of
Huston's four birdie putts, a 15-footer at No. 14, briefly bumped
Love out of first place for the first time since Thursday. Love,
however, answered with a birdie from a greenside bunker at No. 16
to knot matters heading into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Huston said he could sympathize with Love's struggles to control
his approach shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to pick the right club,'' Huston said. ``At
times, it would be almost calm, and then it would start blowing
pretty hard. That made it a tougher wind than what we saw earlier
in the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts call for similar conditions today, with one
significant twist. The anticipated 18 mph gusts will come from the
south, after a one-day taste of northern exposure. If it happens,
final-round charges from back in the pack are not out of the
question, said Mark Brooks, a Fort Worth resident who stands in a
five-way tie for fifth, at 5 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind keeps blowing like this, anyone at 4 under or
better has a chance,'' Brooks said. ``If it blows 30 mph, the guys
at 3 under may have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That group includes Tiger Woods and David Duval, the top two
players in the world golf rankings. They will be paired at 11:56
a.m., marking the first time Woods and Duval have played together
in the final round of a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could make a serious run at Love and Huston, golf's
dynamic duo must first pass the likes of Jesper Parnevik (7 under),
Phil Mickelson (6 under) and a three-player knot at 5 under that
includes Brooks, Bob Estes and Flower Mound resident Paul
Stankowski.
</P>
<P>
   Can it happen?
</P>
<P>
   If the leaders start quickly, said Woods, they'll be tough to
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come back a little bit, then it will be a different
story,'' said Woods, who is tied for 12th after a second
consecutive 67.
</P>
<P>
   Despite flying several greens down the stretch, Love said he is
confident he can regain the form he showed in the first two rounds
while seizing control of the leader board with rounds of 66-63.
Even after his third-round backslide, Love still is positioned to
be first wire-to-wire winner at the Nelson since Tom Watson in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, obviously, with the way that I scored,''
Love said. ``But I haven't lost any confidence with the way I'm
playing. I scrambled pretty good. I don't feel like I've got to go
figure out what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What Love would really like is to shift directions on the leader
board, once again, with today's anticipated shift in winds. nn

TIRED OF HENDERSON, METS RELEASE HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rickey Henderson jogged himself right out of a Mets
uniform Friday night when he unabashedly slipped into his home run
trot without the ball leaving the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the first inning when his shot hit the left-field
wall at Shea Stadium, but the Mets would lose to the Florida
Marlins, and Henderson's effort, compounded by his unrepentant
attitude, would be the lasting memory for the team's management.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Henderson's half-hearted run to first base Friday, he
had to settle for a single. Saturday, after the Mets lost another
game to the Florida Marlins, 7-6, the Mets would settle no more.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, the 21-year veteran left fielder who is baseball's
career stolen base leader, had performed his last act. After the
Mets lost another lead and another game _ the 12th of their last 17
_ General Manager Steve Phillips announced that the team had given
Henderson, 41, a likely Hall of Famer, his unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, when you continue to do the wrong thing and say
the wrong thing, you continue to wear out your welcome,'' Phillips
said. ``We were at the point where we were having to compromise our
ideals too many times. When taking everything into account, the
offense, defense and the alternatives we had, and what it does to
the fabric of the team, we thought it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had already put Henderson on outright waivers Monday,
but no team claimed him. He was not in the starting lineup Saturday
and was a defensive replacement in the ninth inning, but he did not
bat in the Mets' fruitless comeback that had Manager Bobby
Valentine out of bench players, forced to even use pitcher Mike
Hampton at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets (19-19) slipped to .500 Saturday, potential already
going unfulfilled, Henderson seemed a prime example of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have our best chance of winning now with other people
playing,'' Valentine said. ``I thought some guys felt he was
keeping us from winning a couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's first-inning jog, Valentine said, would have been the
final straw, but Henderson topped that. According to Valentine,
even after he told Henderson the premature trot was unacceptable,
Henderson would not apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to build a responsibility within a group,'' Valentine
said. ``I thought I could have gotten a `I screwed up' comment. Not
in as much as an apology, but in an acknowledgment of
responsibility. I was having a hard time compromising my
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips told Henderson after Saturday's game that the team had
cut him. Henderson did not speak to Valentine but spoke briefly
with reporters. ``I'm a little surprised, but that's fine,'' he
said. ``I didn't cause them to lose; you'd better look someplace
else. I've got to boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. If he clears waivers by Wednesday, the Mets will
have paid him about $500,000 of his $2 million salary for playing a
quarter of the season. If a team claims Henderson within 48 hours,
it would have to pay him the remaining $1.5 million of his salary.
If no team claims him, the likely scenario, and he signs with a
team after 48 hours, the team would have to pay him only $150,000,
a prorated amount of the $200,000 minimum. The Mets would then be
responsible for the rest of Henderson's contract, $1.35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's addition by subtraction,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, his first with the club, Henderson was an integral
part of the Mets' reaching the playoffs with a .423 on-base
percentage, best in the National League. But there were signs of
disruptive disinterest. He did not run out a ball off the wall in
San Diego, settling for a double instead of reaching third with
what would have been the potential tying run.
</P>
<P>
   But his most memorable act came when Mets players walked into
the clubhouse after losing Game 6 of the NL Championship Series to
the Atlanta Braves and saw him playing cards with Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Then he reported a day late to spring training this year and was
less than enthused about the team's season-opening series in Tokyo.
``I think I knew in Japan,'' Valentine said of Henderson's
dwindling time with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was all but final Saturday morning. Phillips hinted
that the clock was ticking on Henderson. Henderson himself was like
a time bomb, later in the morning cursing at a reporter and
launching into a tirade about a story that quoted Henderson
accurately.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Valentine was somber, having just spent his 50th
birthday releasing a player and losing another game in which the
Mets blew a lead. For the second straight game, the Marlins'
Preston Wilson _ traded by the Mets with two minor leaguers for
Mike Piazza in 1998 _ crushed a three-run home run, off Dennis
Cook, to give the Marlins a 7-5 lead in the seventh inning. Wilson
also hit a three-run homer on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, the Mets had the tying runs at the plate,
but Piazza, pinch-hitting, and Jon Nunnally struck out against
Braden Looper to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just lost a tough game,'' Valentine said, prefacing his
feelings about Henderson's release. ``You keep hearing guys make
comments. You keep having to take the high road. But there were too
many comments on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players who would discuss Henderson's departure were
positive about their teammate. They were a little surprised by the
move, citing Henderson as a team player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved playing with him, he's a Hall of Famer, he was always
exciting,'' Piazza said. ``Personally, no, I did not feel he was a
distraction. He was great with the guys. I know last night was
tough,'' Piazza added, referring to the Friday night incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he gets a bad rap,'' Nunnally said. During Saturday's
game, Henderson worked with Nunnally in the batting cages. ``I
really like Rickey; he's been nothing but kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the utility infielder Melvin Mora was put on the
disabled list with stitches in his right index finger, the Mets
recalled Joe McEwing from Class AAA Norfolk. He was in Henderson's
place batting leadoff, and went 1 for 4, doubling and scoring in
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After the game the Mets called up first baseman Mark Johnson,
who was hitting .303 with 25 runs batted in, 7 home runs and 6
stolen bases at Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine did not know if he would bat McEwing leadoff again
today. He did concede that nobody would get on base more than
Henderson had. He left the Mets with a .387 on-base percentage and
five stolen bases but a .219 batting average this season. ``If he
had doubles and was able to drive in runs and was hitting .300, I
don't think we would have done this,'' Valentine said. ``I think
Rickey's a good guy, I know he's a great player, and maybe he is
misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson would not do anything to change that conception.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets losing their second straight game to Florida,
Valentine and Phillips thought the timing was right. Once again,
the team squandered chances and blew leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel it was a lack of effort, it was a lack of
execution,'' Piazza said. But for lack of effort, his teammate was
gone Saturday.

LOVE REMEMBERS ADAM PETTY AT NELSON

\Nsubheds:Remembering Petty
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Davis Love III wore the digit ``45'' on the back
of his cap yesterday in honor of Adam Petty, a 19-year-old driver
who died Friday in a crash during practice for a Busch Grand
National race in Loudon, N.H. Petty, a fourth-generation driver and
grandson of NASCAR legend Richard Petty, drove car No. 45 when he
competed.
</P>
<P>
   Love, a NASCAR fan from Sea Island, Ga., said he developed a
relationship with Adam's father, Kyle Petty, during races he
attended in Charlotte, N.C. Love said he also knows Richard Petty
and called him ``one of the nicest people in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never met Adam, but I got to know Kyle a little bit,''
Love said. ``I watched the start of the race \Ryesterday\S in the
locker room, and you could just see that they had lost part of
their family. It's like out here, when we lost Payne \RStewart\S
last year. It brought back a lot of memories of Payne ... and
that's something that hits you kind of hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know \Rthe Petty family\S has a Web site for condolences.
But I figured if I ever wanted to get in touch, this would be a
good way to do it. So that \RNo. 45\S was for Adam.''
\Nsubheds:Colonial power group Hal Sewell, an amateur golfer from
Fort Worth, drew the pro-am equivalent of a winning lottery ticket
for this week's MasterCard Colonial. In a blind draw to set the
field for Wednesday's pro-am, Sewell was mixed into a group that
includes PGA Tour participant Justin Leonard and MasterCard
executive Jeff Price.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow amateurs? Baseball legend Hank Aaron and hockey
legend Bobby Orr. The fivesome will tee off at 7:57 a.m. Wednesday.

name jump up on the leader board early yesterday morning at 3 under
par en route to his 7-under 64, and was hoping he could get his
name beside Kuehne's before the leaders teed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping I could get my name up there early at 3 under ...
you never know what might happen,'' Woods said after a birdie on
the 18th to finish with a 67 and move into a tie with Kuehne, David
Duval, Jay Williamson and Glen Day at 207.
</P>
<P>
   Although Woods finally got to 3 under, he said he ``scrambled''
to post his 67.
</P>
<P>
   He said the course played differently because of gusty north
winds rather than the south winds that have been prevalent since
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind would gust, then die,'' he said. ``It was sort of hit
and hope.'' \Nsubheds:Longer than Tiger Paul Stankowski said he had
fun blasting his drive 350 yards on the downwind par-5 16th to clip
Tiger Woods' drive by five yards. Winds gusted as high as 25 mph
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat Tiger, and that's all I cared about,'' Stankowski said.
``Day-in, day-out, he kicks my butt. It means nothing. ... It was
just fun for me to go, `Oh cool, I hit it by Tiger.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hole is being used in the GTE Long Distance Competition, and
Woods won Thursday when he hit a 287-yard drive into the wind that
gusted to 38 mph. Woods was second yesterday with a 345-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Stankowski, who wasn't playing with Woods, cared more
that he eagled the hole after hitting a 9-iron for his second shot
on the 554-yard hole. It helped him shoot a 66 and move into
contention, five shots off the lead. \Nsubheds:Ruling delay TV
coverage of the final two groups wasn't shown because of a delay
caused by two rulings that Neal Lancaster had on the 14th hole and
one on the 17th. Lancaster and Glen Day were one group in front of
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's drive on the par-4 14th drifted near a culvert to
the right and finished in an area designated as a hazard. He asked
for a ruling to get relief from the culvert, but because he was in
a hazard, couldn't get it. His next shot hit the culvert and
bounded backward. But his third cleared water in front of the
green, but came to rest near TV cables. After another ruling, he
got relief, chipped up and salvaged a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   On the 17th, his tee shot on the par-3 hole hit in the lap of a
seated spectator. When the spectator stood, the ball remained in
his canvas chair. After another ruling, the seat was closed and the
ball fell out, and that's where Lancaster played from. He finished
with a 75 and is at par for the tournament. \Nsubheds:Mickelson
rebounds Phil Mickelson's short game ranks among the best on the
PGA Tour, and it kept him in contention entering today's final
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly in a lot better position than I thought I was
going to be starting the day after I had a couple of bogeys early
on,'' said Mickelson, who carded a 2-under-par 68 despite bogeys on
Nos. 2 and 3. ``I was just trying to regroup and get my round back
under control. To be within four or five shots of the lead is a
good spot to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson hit 29 of 36 greens in regulation through the second
round but hit only seven in regulation yesterday. He offset that
shortcoming by needing only 22 putts. \Nsubheds:Brooks hangs in
Fort Worth's Mark Brooks completed the third round tied for fifth
among a group of three at 5 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played pretty well, especially on the back nine,'' said
Brooks, who shot an even-par 70. ``I hung in there on the front
nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks hit 14 of 18 greens in regulation, but he found himself
with few realistic opportunities for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every putt I had was downhill, and I really
didn't make many of them,'' he said. \Nsubheds:Briefly Paul
Stankowski, a Flower Mound resident who became eligible for next
week's MasterCard Colonial by moving into the 80th spot on the
money-earning's list after winning $57,800 last week in New
Orleans, said he declined to play in Fort Worth because his new
home is scheduled to be finished during Colonial week. The world's
top two players _ Tiger Woods and David Duval _ are paired today
with a tee time of 11:56 a.m. It's the first time they have been
paired in the final round of a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's estimated gallery count of 85,000 was the largest at
the Nelson since 1997, when Tiger Woods won.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton Allem's left contact lens blew out while he has waiting
to hit his second shot on the par-4 third hole. After picking it
off the ground and reinserting it, he had to let Nick Faldo, whose
ball was in front of his, play first. Apparently, Allem lost his
concentration because he pulled his second shot short into the
rough and plopped his third shot into a trap he was trying to go
over.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the names on the leader board are familiar to golf
fans, one probably isn't. Jerry Smith has hung near the top this
week after rounds of 68-68-70. Smith, a 36-year-old from
Scottsdale, Ariz., played on the Buy.com Tour last year and his
biggest victory was the Guam Open in 1998 on the Omega Tour. He was
seventh in the PGA Tour qualifying school, and has missed only
three cuts in 14 starts this year, earning $193,616. \Ntagtop:Staff
writers Jimmy Burch, Charles Clines and Johnny Paul compiled this
report.

BOXING A MEANS TO AN END FOR TONY AYALA JR.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sweat pours from his body as freely as time's sand
spills through the hourglass of a career nearer its end than
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ayala Jr. refers to boxing as ``a young man's game.'' His
37-year-old body reminds him of this after sparring six rounds in a
musty gym whose only defense from the Texas heat rests with the
whirl of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Time would not appear to be an ally for someone a year removed
from serving a 16-year sentence in New Jersey's Rahway State Prison
for a sexual-assault conviction. Yet, Ayala exchanged prison garb
for trunks and gloves upon his release in April 1999. He will walk
into Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum Friday night as part of his ``To
Hell &AMP; Back'' tour to fight middleweight Anthony Stephens on the
card's 10-round main event.
</P>
<P>
   Winning in the ring, however, isn't the fuel driving Ayala's
comeback bid. Nor is recapturing his youth, or earning that pot of
gold a world title would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't care about winning. I just don't think
winning is life,'' Ayala said. ``I hope people understand where I'm
coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the visions \Rof winning\S, but they're not as
important anymore, as important as being happy and at peace with
one's self and the world. I've come to realize and understand that
there are much more important things in life than winning a fight
or winning a world title.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ayala views boxing as a means to an end, a tool to
support his wife, Lisa, earn financial security and perhaps start a
business once his boxing career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to God I could say that this was for what we consider
the honorable reasons, that I want the world title wrapped around
me for the fulfillment of a dream,'' said Ayala, who has earned
approximately $500,000 for his first four fights since his release,
according to Boxing Management Inc. president Lester Bedford. ``I
wish I could say that, but that's not the reality, and I'm not
going to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody doubting his commitment in the ring, however, is missing
the point, said Tony's father and trainer, Tony Ayala Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell any of these other fighters in his weight class who
think he's too old and slow, `Pick a number and get in line.' It's
coming. Believe me. It's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   On that his son agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing for me is a job. Is it more than that? Yeah. When I'm
in the ring, it is a thousand more times than that,'' Ayala said.
``When I'm in the ring, it's about winning and winning at any cost.
At that point, the gladiator in me comes out. It's win at all costs
because of the sacrifices I have to make.'' \Nsubheds:Turning his
life around No doubt many who know Ayala's story want to see him
fail or believe a convicted rapist should still be in jail. High on
heroin, he raped a 19-year-old neighbor in West Paterson, N.J.
during the early morning hours of New Year's Day 1983. Already on
probation for assaulting a woman four years earlier in San Antonio,
he was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to 35 years in
prison, with a minimum of 15 years before he became eligible for
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who refuse to believe that people have the
capability and character to turn their life around,'' Ayala said.
``Am I a saint? I've never said I'm a saint. I have my flaws. Am I
who I was? The answer to that question is definitely not.
Ultimately, people are going to have to search their own souls and
come to a conclusion as to how they feel about me _ if I'm that
important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``El Torito'' could be that big in the boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   A victory Friday could catapult him into an August fight on Home
Box Office with ``Yory Boy'' Campas, the former International
Boxing Federation junior middleweight champion. A victory in that
fight could steer him into the direction of Felix Trinidad, David
Reid or Fernando Vargas and a huge financial bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stop and argue with destiny,'' said Ayala, 26-0. ``For
whatever reason, fate has dealt me this hand. Now that I've come
out, I've been able to accomplish a lot, first and foremost through
the grace of God and, secondly, through my hard work and the people
who surround me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala stays close to his extended family. He rarely goes
anywhere in public alone to avoid the chance of a confrontation or
the fear of being falsely accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very hard for something to go wrong,'' said his
wife, Lisa, who stuck with him through his imprisonment. ``His head
is in the right place, and I think that's all that matters. When
he's not with any of us, it's not like we have to worry _ `Well,
where is he? What is he doing?' _ because his head is in the right
place. He does have a great support system, but even outside that,
he has grown tremendously. There's just no way he would ever repeat
the mistakes that he's made.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala could not have made it this far without a blemish unless
he had come to grips with his past, said his manager, Brian Raditz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he would have survived,'' said Raditz, a
psychologist who also served as Ayala's therapist during his
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   His support system includes his wife, his mother and father, his
brothers, Raditz and friends Richard Kenefick of New York and
Junior Suarez of New Jersey. Ayala forged a friendship with former
convicts Kenefick and Suarez during their time in prison together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was released from prison, they were outside the gate
waiting for me,'' Ayala said. ``I cannot express to you how much
help it was to have someone who could relate to what it's like
being in prison.'' \Nsubheds:Getting another chance Ayala never
ducked an opponent before imprisonment and will not bob and weave
from questions regarding his past or time spent as Inmate No.
69765. He uses candor and openness as he would gloves, and the fact
that BMI signed him to a four-fight contract to promote his fights
does not surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the answer I should say is, `Yes,' '' Ayala said.
``The reason I have a hard time saying it is because my change
didn't occur when I walked out of prison. My change occurred
probably after my fifth year in prison, and I've lived this life
for the last 11 years. Is it hard for some people to believe that
I've changed? Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight Friday will be Ayala's fifth since his release from
prison and the second promoted by BMI.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford did not perceive Ayala being the gamble many did and
promoted the boxer's first three fights before becoming BMI's
president in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went and visited him twice in prison,'' Bedford said. ``The
first thing I had to do was get comfortable with him personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford admitted being concerned that Ayala would be bitter and
angry upon his release and would lay blame for his self-destructive
ways upon others instead of accepting responsibility. Ayala erased
those fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered a guy who was very much remorseful and thankful
for his opportunity in life after 16 years of trying to make
himself better,'' Bedford said. ``I walked away feeling very
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining the company earlier this year, Bedford also
convinced BMI's bosses, Scott Sherman and Billy Rosenthal, but that
took work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an easy sell. I can tell you that,'' Bedford said.
``There was some concern about him having been in prison, and the
other question was could you make money if you took a shot on him.
The answer to both questions for me was definitely yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also felt very comfortable in the fact that he's got a lot
left as a fighter. This guy is a legitimate contender. I think it
will take one of the top two or three guys in the world to beat
him, and I don't know if they can beat him ... He has a desire to
go out there and do something historic and be a real challenger and
not just a freak show or fight for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunger for greatness remains, but Ayala insists it's not his
priority in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could interview me for a thousand hours and I could never
relate to you the gratitude and appreciation that I have for what's
happened in my life,'' Ayala said. ``If I go out and \RStephens\S
knocks me out, I'll feel bad. But who cares? I don't want to sound
callous or like a guy who doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RBut\S when I die, the regrets that I'll take with me are
things no world title or no amount of money can erase the fact that
I victimized a couple of women in my life. That is something I'll
never forget, and I never want to forget. What I did was horrible
and should never be forgotten no matter the level of success I
reach.''

Rangers' Wetteland makes 300th memorable 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ John Wetteland kept insisting his 300th save
should not be a particularly memorable moment. Turns out he was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was memorable, for all the wrong reasons,'' Wetteland said
after the Rangers' 13-11 victory over the Anaheim Angels on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was memorable because Wetteland almost blew a five-run lead
in the ninth inning. He gave up a leadoff home run to Mo Vaughn, a
double to Tim Salmon and a two-run homer to Garret Anderson before
he got anybody out. Troy Glaus then grounded out, but Orlando
Palmeiro's single allowed the Angels to get the tying run to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, instead of his 300th save, Wetteland was on the verge
of a collapse that would have been huge even by the Rangers' latest
lofty standards. But he got Ben Molina to pop out, then struck out
pinch hitter Scott Spiezio to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, an obviously relieved Wetteland smiled, accepted the
congratulations of his teammates and said, ``I'm encouraged and
discouraged. Discouraged result-wise. ... Anyone would be. But go
figure. I put some stuff together, as good as I've had.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fastball was crisp, my curveball was good, the location
wasn't great, and there were a lot of sharp sliders. The home runs
were belt high, middle of the plate. Go higher or lower, and you're
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, the 12th pitcher in major-league history to get 300
saves, threw 28 pitches in the ninth, giving him ample opportunity
to analyze his stuff. But perhaps most important to him, the quest
for the 300th save is over. He admitted it had become a burden to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually not fun when you've got something like that
staring you in the face day after day,'' Wetteland said.
``Everybody wants you to do it, everybody wants it to happen for
totally different reasons than you want it. You feel that
expectation on top of it. Now it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates, ``Personally, I'm glad he got it
done. You know it's going to happen, but being patient is sometimes
tough. I thought he threw the ball great. I thought it was the best
stuff he's had in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's desire to get it done Friday night probably
contributed to his bad inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I was doing things that would support that,'' said
Wetteland, who settled down after a visit to the mound by pitching
coach Dick Bosman. ``I was doing things I tend to do when I get
emotionally rushing things. After he came out, I settled down and
had better location.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Rangers presented him with a cake
congratulating him on the moment. Rookie pitcher Doug Davis, who
earned his first major-league victory Saturday night, gave
Wetteland the game ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the lineup card,'' Davis said. ``I'm honored to be on
the same team as John. He's great. He's a guy I've looked up to
since I was a kid. ... But don't tell him that. He'll feel old.''
</P>
<P>
   With the moment past, Wetteland is eager to get back to the
normal business of winning a division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said for as long as I've been reminded of this, when that
day happens, tonight or two months from now _ well I wouldn't have
this job if it was two months from now _ you've still got a whole
season left,'' Wetteland said. ``That's why I don't set goals. You
reach the goal, so what's next. You end up setting goal after goal
after goal. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   One milestone was enough.

WRIGLEY FIELD THE BIG WINNER IN CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a battle for the basement in the National League Central, the
Brewers and Cubs averaged 25,418 spectators for a three-game,
series at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Across town a week earlier, the American League Central-leading
White Sox and the Blue Jays averaged 12,290 paying customers for
their three-game, midweek series at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are a major disappointment, a club that was given an
outside chance to contend but instead is a bottom feeder.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox are a pleasant surprise, a club expected to be an
also-ran that instead continues to hold off the heavily favored
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   So why do the Cubs outdraw the White Sox by about a 2-1 margin?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is Chicagoans' lingering bitterness toward White Sox
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, both for his role as a hawk in the labor
wars followed by the hypocrisy of briefly making Albert Belle the
best-paid player in the game, and for the ``white flag'' trade in
'97.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the Cubs have star power that the White Sox
lack. Sammy Sosa plies his trade on the North Side, as does Kerry
Wood. The Cubs drew 38,121 for Wood's comeback start against the
Astros on the same evening that a mere 10,397 bothered to watch the
White Sox play the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason, though, is that the Cubs play in Wrigley,
and the White Sox play in Comiskey.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox's South Side ballpark suffers from a bad location,
from a vertigo-inducing upper deck, and from an unfortunate lack of
vision and foresight.
</P>
<P>
   It opened in 1991 as an upgrade on old Comiskey, but devoid of
personality. It's got a lower deck, a ring of luxury suites, the
upper deck, and lots of outfield bleacher seats. The seats are
light blue. Nice, but nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the gorgeous Camden Yards opened in
Baltimore, touching off the building boom of aesthetically
pleasing, retro ballparks with all the modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Comiskey Park pales by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field, which opened in 1914 as the home to the Chicago
Whales of the Federal League two years before the Cubs moved in,
lacks the modern conveniences. But it more than makes up for it
with a charm all its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrigley Field is a special place,'' said Diamondbacks pitcher
Mike Morgan, a one-time Cub.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is ``the friendly confines,'' a neighborhood
ballpark, ivy-covered walls, a brick wall behind the plate, a view
of Lake Michigan beyond the right-field wall, home runs that carry
out of the ballpark and onto Waveland Avenue, fans watching from
adjacent rooftops, and day games.
</P>
<P>
   It's a park unsullied by senses-assaulting, garish billboards.
The only advertising seen at Wrigley is on buildings outside the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really glad they haven't done here is put those
stupid signs behind home plate where they're constantly rolling
over every minute and advertising for this and that,'' Cubs
infielder Jeff Huson said. ``It's nice to just have a brick
background. In the big leagues I don't think there should be any
advertising on the outfield walls, or behind home plate when that
thing's rotating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is bleacher bums who interact with the
outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is fans showing up to root, root, root for the
home team, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for you when you're losing; they're for you when
you're winning,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is an old ballpark that ranks among the best in
the game. Comiskey is a relatively new one that's average at best.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Wrigley is the place to watch a ballgame in
Chicago.
Helton, Guerrero stars on the slugging horizon
Fusaichi Pegasus is not the only Triple Crown threat in the world
of sports these days.
</P>
<P>
   There's two in the National League in Rockies first baseman Todd
Helton and Expos outfielder Vladimir Guerrero. Both are in the top
10 in batting average, home runs and runs batted in, baseball's
Triple Crown categories.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the weekend, Helton was second with a .392 average,
third with 12 home runs and first with 38 RBI. Guerrero was fourth
with a .387 average, ninth with 10 home runs (four out of first)
and third with 33 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's numbers are padded a bit by the advantage of playing
his home games in the thin air of Colorado. He's hitting .500
(24-for-48) with seven home runs and 21 RBI in 13 home games,
compared to a .319 average (23-72) with five home runs and 17 RBI
in 20 road games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that shouldn't obscure the fact that the 26-year-old,
left-handed hitting Helton has become one of the best young hitters
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .320 with 35 home runs and 113 RBI last year. He's on
pace to top that this season because he avoided an early-season
slump and he has improved his hitting against left-handed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In his two previous Aprils, Helton batted .240 with just three
home runs in 44 games. This April, Helton batted .337 and led the
team with six home runs and 25 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I consciously thought about in the
off-season, something I wanted to correct,'' Helton said of his
previous slow starts.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .245 against lefties in '99. So far this year he's hit
them at a .349 clip.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, 24, is continuing his ascent to becoming perhaps the
best all-around player in the game. He batted .324 with 38 home
runs and 109 RBI in his first full season in '98, and .316 with 42
home runs and 131 RBI last year.
</P>
<P>
   Giants outfielder Barry Bonds said Guerrero ``hits, throws,
runs, everything. He's an MVP-caliber player. Will he win it?
There's a good chance. He's in that league; he's in that class.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he or Helton win the Triple Crown? Probably not. It'll be
tough to win the home run crown in a league that includes Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't alter the fact that they are special young talents
having special seasons.
\Nsubheds:Dandy of a duel Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, the two
highest-paid pitchers in history, lived up to the contracts with a
good old-fashioned pitcher's duel Wednesday. They were so good that
the game wasn't decided until they left after eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Diamondbacks beat Brown's Dodgers, 2-1, with a run in
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two warriors going after it,'' D'backs manager Buck Showalter
said. ``Neither one was willing to blink, either. I found myself at
times during the game a fan of it, watching it. Usually games don't
live up to the hype, but this one did.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley's second-inning home run was the only run off
Johnson, who struck out 13 and lowered his earned-run average to
0.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a grind out there,'' he said. ``I knew once
I gave up that run, I couldn't afford to give up any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed six hits in eight innings, striking out six, and
lowered his ERA to 2.20. He was relieved for a pinch hitter in the
top of the ninth, opening the door for Arizona to win in the bottom
of the inning. \Nsubheds:Galarraga struggling Andres Galarraga's
feel-good comeback has hit a snag now that NL pitchers have changed
their pattern against him. In the first three weeks of the season,
pitchers tested the Braves first baseman with fastballs. Despite a
16-month absence from the game, he had no problems and hit a flurry
of home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he's seeing an abundance of breaking pitches, and
he hasn't been able to adjust. He leads the club with 26
strikeouts, and hasn't hit a home run since April 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been pitching me differently,'' Galarraga said. ``They
haven't been throwing me too much stuff to hit. As soon as I get
patient and start taking pitches, I'll be all right.''
\Nsubheds:Lowe impressive Forget Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciaparra
and Carl Everett. The Red Sox's most valuable player might be
closer Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of last season, the Red Sox are 68-19 in games
Lowe has pitched, including 12-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 13 appearances and 202/3 innings this season, Lowe
was 2-0 with a 0.87 ERA. He had allowed just nine hits and five
walks and struck out 12. He was 8-for-8 in save opportunities. With
runners on base, opposing batters were just 2-for-25 against him.
He allowed two runs, on solo home runs by Scott Spiezio and Richie
Sexson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been tremendous, to say the least,'' Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams said. ``He has an outstanding sinker and breaking ball and
he can throw them both for strikes.''
Around the NL Dodgers ace Kevin Brown pitched in 10 games last
season against an opponent's Opening Day starter or a pitcher of
that caliber. He went 4-3 with three no-decisions, and a 4.10 ERA.
This year, he has made five of his six starts against Opening Day
starters or a pitcher with similar talent _ Randy Johnson, Dustin
Hermanson, Alex Fernandez, Shane Reynolds and Tom Glavine. In those
five games he is 2-1 with two no-decisions and an ERA of 1.75.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had scored in 108 consecutive games through
Thursday, the longest current streak in the majors. The Astros are
second, scoring at least one run in 67 consecutive games. No NL
team has scored in every game in an entire season. The modern NL
record is 174, set by the Philadelphia Phillies from Sept. 20, 1992
to Sept. 29, 1993. Barring rainouts, Arizona would have to score in
every game through July 25 at St. Louis to break that record. The
major-league record is 308 consecutive games, by the Yankees from
Aug. 3, 1931 to Aug. 2, 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Former Braves closer Mark Wohlers continues to make progress in
his rehabilitation from both elbow surgery and the ``anxiety
disorder'' that caused him to lose his control. Wohlers, now with
the Reds, has exhibited a fastball in the mid-90s and is throwing
strikes in his batting practice sessions. He started throwing
breaking pitches Wednesday, throwing about 12 sliders among his 40
pitches. He's expected to begin throwing split-fingers in a week to
10 days, and could begin a rehab assignment in 2-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies closer Jose Jimenez doesn't have a save since April 22
in St. Louis, the Rockies' 19th game. He hasn't even had a save
opportunity since then. The Rockies are 5-9, winning four of those
games by at least six runs and getting a complete game from Pedro
Astacio in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams was cleared to begin jogging, and could return to
the Diamondbacks' lineup in less than three weeks. The club's third
baseman and cleanup hitter, who's been out since the final week of
spring training after a foul ball broke a bone in his foot,
Williams has been taking batting practice and fielding ground balls
since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs relievers allowed 18 ninth-inning runs in four games of a
recent five-game stretch. The Pirates scored six in the ninth on
May 6, rallying to win, 11-9, and four in the final inning of an
11-3 victory last Sunday. The Brewers scored four in the ninth on
Monday to cap a comeback from a 9-1 deficit to an 11-11 tie before
the Cubs rallied to win, 12-11, in the 10th inning. The Brewers
then scored three in the eighth and four in the ninth to turn a 3-1
deficit into an 8-3 lead before the Cubs escaped for a wild 9-8
victory on Wednesday. Desperate for help, the Cubs signed veteran
pitchers Tim Worrell and Eric Plunk to minor-league deals.
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing new when the Marlins handed Tom Glavine his first
loss of the season in a 5-3 victory against the Braves on
Wednesday. Glavine is 6-11 against the Marlins _ the only team he
has a losing record against in his career.
Around the AL Tampa Bay right-hander Steve Trachsel was a
thoroughly mediocre (actually, lousy) 1-2 with a 6.15 ERA and a
.317 opponents' batting average going into his start against the
Red Sox on May 6, making what came next perhaps the most improbable
feat of the season. Trachsel pitched a complete-game shutout to
beat Pedro Martinez, 1-0. Then, on Thursday, he pitched seven
shutout innings to outduel Orlando Hernandez in a 1-0 victory
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   His line in the two games: 16 innings, six hits, five walks and
16 strikeouts. ``Just my normal game out there,'' Trachsel said.
``Nothing special, just locating my fastball real well and working
my other pitches off of that. It just worked especially well. I'm
not throwing any harder. I'm not throwing a new pitch. My location
is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero improved to 4-1 when he beat Tampa Bay last Sunday,
one victory shy of all of last season, when he went 5-14 for the
Mariners and Rangers. His victory over the Rays marked the first
time he has won three consecutive starts since pitching for Seattle
in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar Jr. reclaimed his job as the Indians' starting
catcher when he came off the DL on Monday, but Einar Diaz will
continue to play two or three times a week. Diaz hit .356 while
Alomar was out, and is better at throwing out runners.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox sent Baylor ex Kip Wells to Triple-A Charlotte
after he went 2-3 with a 7.28 ERA in seven starts. Wells was 4-1
with 4.04 ERA in seven starts at the end of last year, his first
season as a pro, but struggled with his control this season. He was
leading the AL with 28 walks when he was shipped out. ``Hopefully
it will be just a bump in the road,'' Wells said. ``I didn't expect
to waltz in here and take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Since adjusting his delivery to include a rocking motion and
moving to the first-base side of the pitching rubber, Yankees
starter David Cone is 1-0 with a 3.48 ERA, a huge improvement from
his 0-2, 10.70 record after his first four starts. ``I like where I
am right now,'' Cone said. ``I feel good about what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the fanfare that accompanied Kerry Wood, A's
right-hander Ariel Prieto returned from surgery last week to make
his first major-league start since April 19, 1998. Prieto also
returned without Wood's success. He allowed five runs on 11 hits in
four innings of a 9-8 loss to the Angels on Tuesday, and was sent
back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are considering trying to acquire Rickey Henderson,
who was put on waivers by the Mets. ``I had Rickey once before \Rin
Toronto\S, and there were times then when I thought he might be
finished,'' GM Pat Gillick said. ``Obviously he wasn't. But you
don't know how much you are going to get from him. There's always a
chance that you could get a real good burst of 30 or 60 days,
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The longball note of the week: the Blue Jays have homered in all
21 of their home games, the only team to do so this season. In all
but five of those games the Jays have hit more than one home run.
The league record for consecutive home games with at least one home
run is 23, held by the 1963 Yankees. The big-league mark is 32, by
the '99 Colorado Rockies. The Jays return home tomorrow for a
seven-game homestand.
The week ahead The Giants, who climbed into contention in the NL
West with a hot streak, should be tested with a three-game visit to
East-leading Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL, there could be an early preview of the wild-card
battle when the Red Sox travel to Toronto for a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've got to break out the mushballs. I don't know
what's causing it, but it's not very enjoyable, whether the fans
love it or not.'' _ A's manager Art Howe, on the increased offense
this season.

WRIGLEY FIELD THE BIG WINNER IN CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a battle for the basement in the National League Central, the
Brewers and Cubs averaged 25,418 spectators for a three-game,
series at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Across town a week earlier, the American League Central-leading
White Sox and the Blue Jays averaged 12,290 paying customers for
their three-game, midweek series at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are a major disappointment, a club that was given an
outside chance to contend but instead is a bottom feeder.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox are a pleasant surprise, a club expected to be an
also-ran that instead continues to hold off the heavily favored
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   So why do the Cubs outdraw the White Sox by about a 2-1 margin?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is Chicagoans' lingering bitterness toward White Sox
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, both for his role as a hawk in the labor
wars followed by the hypocrisy of briefly making Albert Belle the
best-paid player in the game, and for the ``white flag'' trade in
'97.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the Cubs have star power that the White Sox
lack. Sammy Sosa plies his trade on the North Side, as does Kerry
Wood. The Cubs drew 38,121 for Wood's comeback start against the
Astros on the same evening that a mere 10,397 bothered to watch the
White Sox play the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason, though, is that the Cubs play in Wrigley,
and the White Sox play in Comiskey.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox's South Side ballpark suffers from a bad location,
from a vertigo-inducing upper deck, and from an unfortunate lack of
vision and foresight.
</P>
<P>
   It opened in 1991 as an upgrade on old Comiskey, but devoid of
personality. It's got a lower deck, a ring of luxury suites, the
upper deck, and lots of outfield bleacher seats. The seats are
light blue. Nice, but nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the gorgeous Camden Yards opened in
Baltimore, touching off the building boom of aesthetically
pleasing, retro ballparks with all the modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Comiskey Park pales by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field, which opened in 1914 as the home to the Chicago
Whales of the Federal League two years before the Cubs moved in,
lacks the modern conveniences. But it more than makes up for it
with a charm all its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrigley Field is a special place,'' said Diamondbacks pitcher
Mike Morgan, a one-time Cub.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is ``the friendly confines,'' a neighborhood
ballpark, ivy-covered walls, a brick wall behind the plate, a view
of Lake Michigan beyond the right-field wall, home runs that carry
out of the ballpark and onto Waveland Avenue, fans watching from
adjacent rooftops, and day games.
</P>
<P>
   It's a park unsullied by senses-assaulting, garish billboards.
The only advertising seen at Wrigley is on buildings outside the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really glad they haven't done here is put those
stupid signs behind home plate where they're constantly rolling
over every minute and advertising for this and that,'' Cubs
infielder Jeff Huson said. ``It's nice to just have a brick
background. In the big leagues I don't think there should be any
advertising on the outfield walls, or behind home plate when that
thing's rotating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is bleacher bums who interact with the
outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is fans showing up to root, root, root for the
home team, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for you when you're losing; they're for you when
you're winning,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field is an old ballpark that ranks among the best in
the game. Comiskey is a relatively new one that's average at best.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Wrigley is the place to watch a ballgame in
Chicago.
Helton, Guerrero stars on the slugging horizon
Fusaichi Pegasus is not the only Triple Crown threat in the world
of sports these days.
</P>
<P>
   There's two in the National League in Rockies first baseman Todd
Helton and Expos outfielder Vladimir Guerrero. Both are in the top
10 in batting average, home runs and runs batted in, baseball's
Triple Crown categories.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the weekend, Helton was second with a .392 average,
third with 12 home runs and first with 38 RBI. Guerrero was fourth
with a .387 average, ninth with 10 home runs (four out of first)
and third with 33 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's numbers are padded a bit by the advantage of playing
his home games in the thin air of Colorado. He's hitting .500

leading the AL with 28 walks when he was shipped out. ``Hopefully
it will be just a bump in the road,'' Wells said. ``I didn't expect
to waltz in here and take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Since adjusting his delivery to include a rocking motion and
moving to the first-base side of the pitching rubber, Yankees
starter David Cone is 1-0 with a 3.48 ERA, a huge improvement from
his 0-2, 10.70 record after his first four starts. ``I like where I
am right now,'' Cone said. ``I feel good about what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the fanfare that accompanied Kerry Wood, A's
right-hander Ariel Prieto returned from surgery last week to make
his first major-league start since April 19, 1998. Prieto also
returned without Wood's success. He allowed five runs on 11 hits in
four innings of a 9-8 loss to the Angels on Tuesday, and was sent
back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are considering trying to acquire Rickey Henderson,
who was put on waivers by the Mets. ``I had Rickey once before \Rin
Toronto\S, and there were times then when I thought he might be
finished,'' GM Pat Gillick said. ``Obviously he wasn't. But you
don't know how much you are going to get from him. There's always a
chance that you could get a real good burst of 30 or 60 days,
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The longball note of the week: the Blue Jays have homered in all
21 of their home games, the only team to do so this season. In all
but five of those games the Jays have hit more than one home run.
The league record for consecutive home games with at least one home
run is 23, held by the 1963 Yankees. The big-league mark is 32, by
the '99 Colorado Rockies. The Jays return home tomorrow for a
seven-game homestand.
The week ahead The Giants, who climbed into contention in the NL
West with a hot streak, should be tested with a three-game visit to
East-leading Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL, there could be an early preview of the wild-card
battle when the Red Sox travel to Toronto for a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've got to break out the mushballs. I don't know
what's causing it, but it's not very enjoyable, whether the fans
love it or not.'' _ A's manager Art Howe, on the increased offense
this season.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending May 6, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

   &UR; THE NIGHT INSPECTOR &LR;  By Frederick Busch. Ballantine, $14. A
former Union sniper, wearing a mask to conceal a wound sustained in
the Civil War, wanders the streets of New York, where he becomes a
friend of a forgotten writer who resembles Melville. This novel
``is a marvelously dark-hued story by a master craftsman,'' John
Crowley wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999. ``His
prose and his conversations are precisely, surprisingly and
thoroughly of their time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRYPTONOMICON &LR;  By Neal Stephenson. HarperPerennial, $16. This
overstuffed picaresque novel is an audaciously conceived tale of
code making and code breaking. It takes place both during World War
II, when the Allies were scrambling to break the Nazis' Enigma
code, and in the present day, when a couple of entrepreneurial
computer hackers are trying to create a ``data haven'' for
encrypted information in the Philippines. With its profusion of
plot lines, characters and gonzo riffs, the book is ``as
fascinating, and as frustrating, as a string of partly decrypted
code,'' Dwight Garner wrote last year. ``It wants to blow your mind
while keeping you well fed and happy. ... It's brain candy for
bitheads.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD MAN OF NANKING: The Diaries of John Rabe &LR;  Edited by
Erwin Wickert. Vintage, $14. The author, a German businessman and
Nazi supporter, not only witnessed the Japanese massacre in Nanking
in 1937 but also saved the lives of many poor Chinese. His
unpolemical account ``is at once riveting, inspiring, terrifying
and tragically sad,'' Sheryl WuDunn wrote in 1998. It is
``compassionate and, at times, humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEXTANTS OF BEIJING: Global Currents in Chinese History &LR; ,
by Joanna Waley-Cohen (Norton, $14.95), surveys the history of
China's ambivalent relations with the outside world and seeks to
shatter the myth that the nation traditionally has been deeply
isolationist. Last year the reviewer Nicholas D. Kristof disagreed
with much of the thesis but found this to be a ``thoughtful and
highly readable'' book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BROADWAY BABIES SAY GOODNIGHT: Musicals Then and Now &LR;  By Mark
Steyn. Routledge, $17. A columnist and critic offers an irreverent
history of the Broadway musical, a diverse and lively art form
that, judging from the flood of revivals these days, may be in its
death throes. Last year in The New York Times Book Review, Robert
Gottlieb called this an ``eccentric, funny, shrewd and somewhat
dismaying book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PALACE &LR;  By Lisa St. Aubin de Teran. Ecco/HarperCollins,
$13. The narrator of this exotic fairy tale is a former political
prisoner who assumes a gentleman's guise, makes a fortune as a
gambler in 19th-century Venice and builds a dream house for the
woman he loves. Last year the reviewer David Willis McCullough
admired the novel's ``lovingly rendered descriptive prose'' and its
``sensuous and sinuous portrait of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHADOW: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate &LR;  By Bob
Woodward. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16. The celebrated
investigative journalist examines how the rules of presidential
politics have changed since the Nixon administration, dwelling in
depth on the Clinton White House and its efforts to manage the
Whitewater, Lewinsky and other scandals. ``Some of Woodward's
judgments are shrewd and plausible,'' Michael Lind wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIMBUKTU &LR;  By Paul Auster. Picador USA, $11. Mr. Bones, this
novel's canine protagonist, roams urban, suburban and rural America
looking for a home (and spiritual enlightenment) after the death of
his beloved longtime companion, a homeless man from Brooklyn. Last
year the reviewer Jim Shepard praised the tale's ``periodic flashes
of gorgeous prose.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DISOWNED BY MEMORY: Wordsworth's Poetry of the 1790s &LR;  By David
Bromwich. University of Chicago, $15. The author explores the
crucial years of the poet's moral development, when his republican
ardor was transformed by the Terror that followed the French
Revolution. ``Bromwich is a rigorous critic, but he is a general
one whose insights are broadly applicable,'' Vijay Seshadri wrote
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE PLEASURES OF THE
IMAGINATION: English Culture in the Eighteenth Century &LR; , by John
Brewer ($20), a grand tour of the world of fine arts and literature
during a time when culture moved from the court into the public
domain, to be possessed as well as consumed. ``Brewer gives us a
brilliantly illustrated social history of the many people who
produced plays and paintings, music and books,'' T.H. Breen wrote
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I LEFT MY BACK DOOR OPEN &LR;  By April Sinclair. HarperPerennial,
$13. Daphne Dupree is a Chicago radio host with lots to say about
race, weight, self-esteem and popular music. ``It's a `Bridget
Jones' Diary' for black women,'' Sarah Vowell wrote last year.
``Many readers will respond to this novel's honesty'' and
``colloquial humor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GARDENS IN THE DUNES &LR;  By Leslie Marmon Silko. Scribner, $14.
Set in the 19th century, this novel follows the fate of two
American Indian girls who are sent from their desert home to
government-run schools to become ``civilized.'' The result is ``a
rich, intriguing, irritating mix of myth, allegory, Victorian
children's tale and adventure yarn,'' Suzanne Ruta wrote in 1999.

DC UNITED FALLS TO REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ After four years finding ways to lose soccer
games, the Revolution appear to be finding ways to win. And,
fortunately for the Revolution, D.C. United has adopted just the
opposite formula.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution also appears able to retain its composure,
another break from the past, and among the keys to success. The
Revolution took a 3-1 win over D.C. United Saturday night, their
second 3-point win over the three-time Major League Soccer Cup
champions this season and only their fourth in 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Wolde Harris (15th minute), Mauricio Ramos (66th), and Imad Baba
(82d) converted free kicks from virtually the same spot, and
goalkeeper Jeff Causey stopped a second-half Jaime Moreno penalty
as the Revolution remained in a first-place tie with Miami in the
Eastern Division. D.C. United is in last place.
</P>
<P>
   But United, which played without Marco Etcheverry, controlled
possession for most of the game and dominated play well into the
second half. Some individual heroics and effective substitutions by
coach Fernando Clavijo made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created a lot of chances in the past and we were not
able to finish them,'' Clavijo said. ``Sometimes it goes your way
and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a good team needs to win even
playing bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played against a very good team that was eager to get 3
points at home and we managed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, replacing Etcheverry as midfield director, carved
through the Revolution in the first half. Moreno, among the MLS's
all-time leading scorers, displayed his versatility by ranging from
side to side to find space, accelerating through the heart of the
defense, deftly chesting down long passes, and laying off
perfectly-timed balls into space for teammates to run onto. But
United squandered excellent chances after Moreno had provided a 1-0
lead with a 14th-minute header off a corner kick.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, though, Revolution substitute Mike Burns
made things difficult for Moreno. And, the longer United went
without scoring, the more the Revolution seemed to gain confidence.
</P>
<P>
   William Sunsing, who replaced Johnny Torres in the 60th minute,
added energy and unpredictability as the Revolution launched
effective counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   Harris scored the tying goal by drilling a low shot under a
United wall. As the United players jumped, Harris's shot skipped
through into the left side of the goal, less than a minute after
Moreno's goal.
</P>
<P>
   But United seemed destined to take the lead until Sunsing helped
break their momentum. Ted Chronopoulos intercepted a Richie
Williams pass in the 66th minute and carried to the penalty arc,
where he was fouled by Williams. Ramos then curled a shot just
inside the left post for a 2-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Chronopoulos was cautioned by Korean referee Kim Tae Young for
holding Chris Albright on a corner, surrendering a penalty. But
Causey aggressively cut the angle as Moreno shot directly at him in
the 78th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, the Revolution put the match out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution continued to counter, and Sunsing sped from his
own penalty area to the edge of the penalty arc, where he was
caught from behind. Baba then curled a free kick inside the left
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were patient and disciplined and believed in what we wanted
to do,'' Revolution captain John Harkes said.

LAKERS TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED, `CLOSE IT DOWN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For a hauntingly familiar expression of playoff angst,
we turn to the locker room of the team down 0-3 in this NBA
conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   See the dour faces. Examine the perplexed expressions. Hear the
desperate tones, mixed with faint and fading notes of hope. Listen
as the conversation turns quickly toward what went wrong, how to
fix it and what next season might bring.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Phoenix Suns' locker room at America West Arena,
but it provided a chilling reflection of where the Lakers were not
so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, down 0-3 to the San Antonio Spurs. Two years ago,
down 0-3 to the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, a game later, swept out of contention and into the
offseason abyss.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns now face that depressing conclusion. The Los Angeles
Lakers can look across the court today, and, as they try to both
compound and end that misery, they will get a measure of just how
far they have come in a year.
</P>
<P>
   From tormented to tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think and hope that it's a marked improvement in a
landslide capacity,'' said Rick Fox, a participant in the Lakers
collapses of 1998 and 1999. ``We'd like to turn the tables and be
the individuals for a change that are on top of the activity in a
series, and find themselves with more of the command than fighting
from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   With a win this afternoon at America West, the Lakers will be on
the winning end of a four-game sweep for the first time since 1989
- when they swept Portland, Seattle and Phoenix in succession on
the way to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant know only
misery when it comes to sweeps. They entered this postseason with
visions of blowing through the field but, after a 2-0 start against
the Sacramento Kings, failed to get their first sweep then got
pushed to five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get it done last series,'' Bryant said, ``so it'd
definitely be nice to sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns react to the 0-3 deficit the way the Lakers have in
the past, the series should be over by late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Lakers dominated the Portland Trail Blazers
and Seattle SuperSonics before running into the Jazz. They were
blown out at Salt Lake City in the opener but regrouped in Game 2
and lost by only four points. Then they got thumped by 11 points in
Game 3 at the Forum and succumbed in Game 4, 96-92.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Lakers lost a pair of competitive games at the
Alamodome to again return home down 0-2. But they again got thumped
in Game 3, a 103-91 Spurs win and rolled over in Game 4, 118-107.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are a living testament to the fragile psychology of a
team down three games to none - a deficit no NBA team has ever come
back from to win a series. The Game 4 losses were almost
predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch any TV or if you read any newspapers, the facts
start to come to light, that no team has ever done it,'' Fox said,
``so it's a huge mountain to overcome. When you're dealing with one
individual, in an individual sport, that might be something that a
person can conquer. But when you're talking about 12 guys that have
to come together to all believe it can be done, I think in that
case it's harder. A lot harder. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You need everyone to believe that, and, unfortunately in team
sports, faced with this situation that they are, it's more the norm
to fold the tents than it is to find the way back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an emotionally grueling state to be in, one Bryant prefers
not to recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't even remember,'' he said, asked
how deflating it was to be down 0-3. ``It has to be, getting swept.
But I really don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Lakers have reversed their fortunes, they sound
unconcerned with the significance of going 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is a win,'' said O'Neal, who is averaging a team-leading
37.3 points in this series. ``You know, we made a lot of progress,
coach (Phil) Jackson has done a good job of keeping us together,
keeping us out of trouble and keeping us very focused. We're
looking to close it down tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting away the Suns could prove difficult, if the last two
games are any indication. Game 2 went down to the last three
seconds, and Game 3 went down to the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognize the fact that they played well enough last
night (Friday) to win,'' Jackson said. ``We're going to have to
play through a long period of the game and make them think about
how long and hard this series is going to be and give them some
doubts and make them have some doubts, so they question the ability
to come back and win this series. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll come out with guns blazing, free, nothing to lose,
everything to gain, upset in mind, to show their dander or their
courage, and then as the game gets more and more difficult, doubt
starts to form in teams' minds. But I think closeout games are very
difficult games. You've got to be able to hang around and then find
usually a way to win at the end.''
