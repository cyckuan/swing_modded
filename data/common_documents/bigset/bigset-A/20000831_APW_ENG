<HEADLINE> Ruling Allows Temps To Join Unions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many of the nation's 35 million temporary
workers will be able to join company unions, putting them in a
position to bargain for medical benefits and other compensations,
as a result of a ruling Wednesday by the National Labor Relations
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the labor board, an independent federal
organization, will primarily affect those workers on longer-term
assignments, rather than temporary workers in short-term jobs. Only
temporary workers who are supervised by company employees are
eligible, and the worker would be allowed to bargain with both the
temp agency and their assignment company.
</P>
<P>
   Unions praised the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney called the ruling ''an
important step'' in addressing the rights of temporary workers,
whom he said have often been ''relegated to second-class status and
rights,'' The Washington Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen A. Bokat of the National Chamber Litigation Center,
which supported the employers in the battle, told the newspaper he
thought the ruling may eliminate some of the cost advantages of
using temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   Employers would have to treat temporary workers ''pretty much
like regular employees,'' Bokat told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Wednesday overrules a 1990 ruling by the board that
only permitted temporary employees to bargain with the leasing
employer if both the temp agency and the client company allowed
them to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The NLRB's 3-1 vote involved challenges by three employers that
the board has been considering since 1996. The board wrote that it
changed course because of the ''ongoing changes in the American
work force.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of temporary workers have doubled since 1990,
according to the American Staffing Association, a trade group for
temp agencies.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Miss Uruguay Among Crash Victims  </HEADLINE>
By MARIANELA JIMENEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Costa Rican authorities have
recovered the bodies of two pilots and eight foreign passengers,
including a pregnant former Miss Uruguay and her new husband, from
the wreckage of a small plane that crashed into a volcano over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Helena and Steven Bohmer were married Aug. 21, just five days
before the crash, Costa Rican authorities said Wednesday. Helena,
36, was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Media in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo reported that the
former Helena Gutierrez had been Miss Uruguay in the 1980s and
represented her country in the Miss Universe and Miss International
pageants. Steven Bohmer, 44, was a surgeon and native of
Cincinnati. The couple lived in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-seat Caravan plane operated by Servicios Aereos
Nacionales, or Sansa, crashed Saturday into the Arenal volcano 60
miles north of the capital, San Jose. The plane was en route from
the northern region of La Fortuna to the beach town of Tamarindo on
the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   Both Costa Rican pilots, Karl Acevedo Nevermann and William
Badilla Salazar, had logged more than 2,000 hours of flight time,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss passengers Silvia Riusser and Catherine Shoep, both 23,
spent their first week in Costa Rica hospitalized for an infectious
disease they had contracted from contaminated drinking water. They
were released just one day before the crash, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Damia of San Francisco, 36, was driving to Tamarindo
to visit his mother when his car broke down, forcing him to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers included U.S. vacationers Frank and Judy
Conzolazio, 56 and 55, whose home state was unavailable, and
Canadian Terry Pratt, 51, who worked in a Costa Rica tourism
agency.

Clinton Brings Aid To Colombia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- In a country beset by decades of violence,
President Clinton delivered a $1.3 billion U.S. package Wednesday which he said
would help Colombia defeat its drug traffickers without getting the United
States into a Vietnam-like quagmire. ''We will not get into a shooting war''
with Colombian guerrillas, he said, standing alongside Colombian President
Andres Pastrana. During Clinton's half-day visit to Cartagena, police said they
discovered and deactivated a 4.4-pound bomb found five blocks from a
neighborhood Clinton planned to tour.

Wildfire Fight To Cost $1 Billion

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal cost of fighting wildfires across the West
soon will exceed $1 billion with Congress likely to dip into the treasury again
this year to pay the final tab, federal officials said Wednesday. So far, the
federal government has tallied at least $626 million in costs to battle scores
of fires from Montana to New Mexico, spending as much as $18 million a day,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which is coordinating the
firefighting effort.

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Dick Cheney said Wednesday a military made strong in the

because of ''eight years of neglect and misplaced priorities'' by the
Clinton-Gore administration. Cheney, the former defense secretary and now GOP
vice presidential candidate, said troops have been hurt by spending cuts. Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, responded to Cheney's

Suharto's Corruption Trial Underway
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Ex-President Suharto's corruption trial opened
Thursday amid tight security, but the former dictator did not attend the session
after doctors determined he was too sick to stand trial. Prosecutors immediately
asked for a two-week adjournment to give their doctors a chance to examine
Suharto. The unprecedented trial is seen as a key test of Indonesia's
determination to stamp out corruption and deal with the excesses of decades of
authoritarian rule. Suharto's lawyers claim that 2&AMP;frac12; years after student
protesters dislodged him from power, Suharto, 79, has become a frail old man,
brain-damaged by strokes and unable to understand simple questions.

N.J. Construction Site Fire Spreads

<P>
   EDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- Fire engulfed a five-story condominium complex under
construction along the Hudson River on Wednesday. The roaring fire, which could
be seen miles away and across the river in New York City, forced the evacuation
of homes in nearby Cliffside Park, police said. No one was living yet in the
Avalon River Mews condominiums being built on the former site of an Alcoa plant.
Police said no injuries were reported. Water from fire trucks was sprayed on
houses and trees across the street from the site in an effort to keep the blaze
from spreading.

<HEADLINE> USDA May Overhaul Meat Inspection  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government may cut its oversight of food
processors by reducing the time meat inspectors spend doing jobs
the plants could do themselves, such as checking scales or
monitoring the fat and water content of products.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department, which has 7,500 inspectors, is
responsible for regulating a number of consumer protection rules
that officials say have little or nothing to do with food safety.
They are working on ways to free up more time for inspectors to
spend on microbial testing and other measures to curb food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not letting (processors) police themselves. We may be
going about reshaping how we police them, but we're not going to
let them police themselves,'' said Phil Derfler, associate deputy
administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   Among the inspectors' current responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   --Inspectors enforce a variety of rules on the content of meat
products: For example, fresh pork sausage can be no more than 50
percent fat, Italian sausage must contain at least one of two
spices -- fennel or anise -- and barbecued meat must be prepared with
dry heat from burning wood or coals.
</P>
<P>
   --The agency devotes the equivalent of 25 to 50 full-time
inspectors each year to check whether poultry carcasses have
absorbed excessive amounts of water after slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
   --Thousands of tests are performed each year on scales in
processing plants to make sure they are working properly. Although
inspectors frequently find problems, officials say that's not
necessarily because companies are cheating; it may be because the
plants are leaving it up to USDA to make sure they are weighing
products accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government should be supervising the industry's enforcing
of these other consumer protections rather than doing the
industry's job,'' Caroline Smith DeWaal, a meat-safety expert with
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy
group, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to make sure that our resources are devoted to
food safety. That's our first priority,'' said USDA's Derfler.
</P>
<P>
   Processors generally support the department's move, although
some companies say they fear that corner-cutting competitors might
take advantage of reduced oversight by USDA and cheat on the rules.
In a letter this week to the department, industry groups said the
department should focus its enforcement on plants that have a
history of breaking rules, such as those on fat content.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a limited number of resources for inspection and we
have to focus those resources on food safety,'' said Janet Riley,
spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most companies are doing a very good job of handling these
nonfood safety issues. If there's a problem, let's concentrate the
resources where the problems exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the department is experimenting with a new system
for inspecting animal carcasses in slaughterhouses that puts more
responsibility on packers to catch defects in meat. USDA inspectors
who traditionally poke and sniff each carcass are leaving that job
to plant employees and are instead doing more testing for microbes
and sampling for fecal contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors union sued to stop the project, and a three-judge
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
agreed this summer that USDA inspectors are required by law to do
hands-on checks of animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department regulates meat, poultry and egg
products. All other foods are regulated by the Food and Drug
Administration and state agencies.

<HEADLINE> Man Finds 11-Cent Penny  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTEN HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- Roll over, Sacagawea.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Dempsey and Baxter Coins and Stamps says he has a
1999 copper-plated penny with the familiar Lincoln profile on one
side and the reverse side of a dime on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The rare dime-penny was struck long before four misprinted 2000
Sacagawea $1 gold coins appeared with the American Indian guide's
face on one side and the front of a Washington quarter on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like finding a lottery ticket and you don't know what
you're cashing it in for,'' said Jack Dempsey, owner of the
northwestern Pennsylvania store.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional Coin Grading Service in Newport Beach, Calif.,
declined to certify Dempsey's coin earlier this year because such
an error was unprecedented. They thought differently after the U.S.
Mint acknowledged the Sacagawea dollars as mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only one known,'' said Miles Standish, spokesman for
the service. ''This coin obviously has been available longer than
the Sacagawea mules and no others have turned up.''
</P>
<P>
   A ''mule'' in the coin world is a hybrid of two denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said he bought the penny for a ''substantial'' sum in
December from a customer who had obtained it in a roll of normal
pennies from an Erie-area bank.
</P>
<P>
   This summer four one-sided Sacagawea dollar coins surfaced and
there have been unconfirmed reports of 15 others. A former press
operator at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia has been charged with
stealing and selling misprinted Sacagawea coins.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Mint spokesman Michael White said Wednesday officials there
haven't seen Dempsey's odd coin or heard of any other 11-cent
pennies like it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing 28 billion coins this year, and so far we've
talked about 19 error coins,'' White said. ''In terms of the
percent chance that an error coin could come out, that's .0000019.
People are so interested in them because they're so rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Levy said it's doubtful that the
man charged in connection with the Sacagawea mules made Dempsey's
penny because it was found in a roll of bank pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one that just escaped everyone's attention,'' Levy
said.

<HEADLINE> UPN Rap Awards Show Soars in Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Notoriety for violence isn't necessarily a
negative in the rap world: The UPN television network scored
unusually strong ratings for its telecast of The Source Hip-Hop
Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The awards show taping was cut short last week after a
bottle-throwing brawl but new scenes were later added to pad the
two-hour telecast Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The program drew an average of 5.3 million viewers. That may be
a fraction of the Grammy Awards audience, but they are big numbers
at UPN, whose average audience on Tuesday nights this summer was
1.8 million until this week.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings were 32 percent higher than for the 1999 show, which
was UPN's top-rated special for the year.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's telecast opened with a taped message from rapper Mos Def,
who decried the violence but urged viewers not to condemn rap music
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't be fair to cast aspersions on an entire cultural
movement based on the actions of a few,'' he said. ''To quote my
grandfather, 'One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch.'''
</P>
<P>
   The freewheeling telecast included a mock ''fight'' between
hosts Monique and Da Brat during their opening monologue, frequent
censoring of profanities and an intentionally blurred camera shot
of the first award winner, Eve, because she wore a revealing top.
</P>
<P>
   Spliced into the show were awards presentations and acceptance
speeches of winners that were obviously filmed after the Aug. 22
taping at the Pasadena Civic Center in California. The brawl
stopped the show that night after only three performances and a
handful of awards.
</P>
<P>
   The show's third host, Busta Rhymes, also criticized the
violence in a taped message included on the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a negative image that the artists wanted to dispel,''
said Patti McTeague, UPN spokeswoman. ''It's important to show that
it will not be condoned.''
</P>
<P>
   McTeague said it's too early to tell whether UPN will want to
televise the awards in the future.

<HEADLINE> American Jumpers Offended by Remarks  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- The Australian long jumper who made
racial remarks toward two American jumpers apologized Thursday,
butsSavante Stringfellow and Melvin Lister were not forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't accept his apology,'' Stringfellow said. ''I can't
accept what he said. If he didn't mean it, why did he say it?''
</P>
<P>
   ''When a guy says something like that, 95 percent of the time he
means it,'' Lister said. ''You can talk trash all you want, but
racial comments will never come out of my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Jai Taurima said earlier in the week that because of
the cool conditions expected for the Sydney Olympics, ''you can
pretty much knock out all the black guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We jumped in Salamanca (Spain) a month ago, and those guys
just couldn't compete well in bad conditions,'' Taurima added. ''It
was wet and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow compared Taurima's remarks to those made by Atlanta
Braves pitcher John Rocker last year when he made disparaging
comments about foreigners, gays, minorities and New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Lister, winner of the U.S. Olympic trials, and Stringfellow, the
U.S. indoor champion and NCAA outdoor champion, both of whom are
black, were seething when told of Taurima's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rank them the same as the John Rocker comments,''
Stringfellow said. ''That was very unprofessional on his part.
Maybe he doesn't know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand him having the confidence to beat us -- but to
come at us racially,'' Lister said. ''I want him to know I wasn't
satisfied with the comments he made. All that can do is cause
animosity between the U.S. and Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Taurima was a bit remorseful Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm quite sorry,'' he said. ''I didn't mean to attack them
personally. It was not intended as a racial slur. I didn't mean to
upset them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were made to the Australian media, but not to the
American athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard he apologized, but he hasn't said anything to us,''
Stringfellow said. ''We haven't heard it from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Taurima's best is 27 feet, 4&AMP;frac34; inches. Lister, the NCAA indoor
and outdoor champion in 1999, has jumped 27-10&AMP;frac14; this year, and
Stringfellow's best is 27-2&AMP;frac34;.
</P>
<P>
   Lister said that the Americans have been treated very well since
arriving in Australia on Aug. 21 to train for the Olympics and he
would not let one athlete spoil the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't said anything to cross anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taurima -- a Queensland resident whose father is Maori, the
indigenous people of New Zealand -- also dismissed any chance of
U.S. long-jumpers winning a medal in Sydney. Dwight Phillips, the
third U.S. jumper, has not yet arrived in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans are Americans, aren't they?'' he said. ''They only
jump big in America. These three guys are a bunch of dribblers.
That's all I'm saying. I'm more scared of the two Ukraine and two
Russian guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Taurima, the Australian record-holder and fourth-place finisher
in the 1999 World Championships, could not name the Ukrainians and
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's a dribbler?'' Stringfellow said. ''This is my official
invitation to the Olympic Games. He's somebody who won't be able to
back up what he says. He just stuck his foot in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rivals? We don't even count him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is he anyhow?'' Lister said. ''He doesn't even know who I
am. He's never seen us. His teammates don't even have any respect
for him. It's also a proven fact that we Americans have come
overseas and jumped well.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lewis won the last four Olympic long jump gold medals, with
two of the games held overseas -- in Seoul and Barcelona. Mike
Powell set the world record of 29-4&AMP;frac12; in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never heard of a good Australian long jumper,'' Lister
said. ''The only long jumper you can talk to me about is Ivan
Pedroso (of Cuba, winner in the last four World Indoor
Championships and the last three World Outdoor Championships).''
</P>
<P>
   Lister and Stringfellow vowed to beat Taurima when they meet
Sunday in a tuneup meet for the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't going to jump,'' Stringfellow said, ''but I am now.
And mark this down: Whatever he jumps in the first round of the
games, I'm going to jump 20 meters farther.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even think he's going to be a factor,'' Lister said.

<HEADLINE> Voters Decide on Lambeau Field Tax  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT IMRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The love affair between the Green Bay
Packers and their fans faces the ultimate pocketbook test next
month, and the outcome is as unpredictable as a punt return.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether these cheesehead hat-wearing,
bleacher-sitting football fanatics will agree to enact a
half-percent sales tax to help finance a $295 million facelift and
expansion of Lambeau Field, home of the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not a sure thing heading into a Sept. 12
referendum in which about 170,000 Brown County residents will
decide the tax's fate. Emotions are strong on both sides, and a
recent poll had the election a virtual tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, the Packers are a wonderful story and the team has been
the city's most positive asset for decades, but a new tax is a new
tax, and we don't need new taxes,'' Warren Bluhm, columnist and
news editor for The Green Bay News-Chronicle, wrote this week.
</P>
<P>
   A Lambeau Field sales tax is estimated to generate $16.4 million
in its first year of collections, or about $75 for every man, woman
and child in Brown County.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is the first public vote on the venerable stadium
since April 1956, when Green Bay voters, by a 2-to-1 margin,
approved bonds to build it for $960,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, born in Green Bay in 1919 and the only publicly
owned team in the National Football League, have tapped the
franchise's fan base in urging taxpayers to finance $160 million of
the stadium renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The work would increase the stadium's capacity to 71,000, double
the number of concession stands and bathrooms and add a five-story,
mall-like addition for the Packer Hall of Fame, Packer Pro Shop and
stadium club.
</P>
<P>
   ''For small change each year ... I can support a team, our
economy and preserve history. Alas, a tax I can feel good about and
benefit from,'' Jason Gutzman said in a letter to the Green Bay
Press-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   The project also would be financed with $92.5 million by
charging season ticket holders a user fee; $20.4 million from the
Packers from proceeds of a recent stock sale; $13 million in a loan
from the NFL; and $9.1 million from the state for the parking lot,
streets and other surrounding infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The team says its ''unparalleled financial challenges'' can only
be solved with new revenue generated by an upgraded Lambeau Field,
which needs a retrofit anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, the team said, is whether the Packers can afford the
best players to win more championships. The Packers are coming off
an 8-8 season and failed to make the playoffs for the first time
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of the Packers franchise leaving Green Bay is better
than 50-50 without a stadium that can produce significantly more
revenue for the team, said Mayor Paul Jadin, who endorsed the
proposed tax.
</P>
<P>
   Phooey, countered Edith Valentine, co-chairwoman of Brown County
Citizens for Sensible Taxation and an outspoken referendum
opponent. The Packers have not made the case that they need
taxpayer money, especially in a county where many households
survive on incomes of $30,000 or less, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very hard to believe the Packers when they are screaming
poor when you look at the fabulous amounts of money being spent on
players and signing bonuses. They are spending money like it is
going out of style,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Packers President Bob Harlan said if the referendum fails,
the Packers would become a ''very poor football team'' in an aging
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is Plan B. Plan C is death,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 11, Angels 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- David Wells earned his major
league-leading 19th victory and the Toronto Blue Jays tied a
franchise record for homers in a season as they beat the Anaheim
Angels 11-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wells (19-6) improved to 14-2 following Blue Jays losses,
allowing three singles in five innings. He left the game after 61
pitches with tightness in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who failed to homer on Tuesday for only the 24th
time this season, increased their major league-leading total to 221
with two by Brad Fullmer and one each by Tony Batista and Darrin
Fletcher. Fullmer drove in four runs with his third career
two-homer game.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado drove in four runs to increase his RBI total to
124. Delgado, Fletcher, Mickey Morandini and Shannon Stewart each
had three of the Blue Jays' 19 hits, one shy of their season-high.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn reached the 100-RBI mark for the sixth time in his
career and third straight year when he led off the seventh against
Toronto reliever John Frascatore with his 33rd homer. He is the
second player in Angels history with consecutive 100-RBI seasons,
and the first since Wally Joyner in 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez had two hits to extend his hitting streak to a
career-best 20 games. Martinez has hit safely in all 20 games he
has played with Toronto since the Aug. 5 trade from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who also hit 221 home runs in 1998, homered three
times in the first three innings against rookie Matt Wise (3-2). He
allowed six runs and 12 hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was staked to a 4-0 lead before he threw his first pitch.
Stewart and Alex Gonzalez opened the game with singles and Fullmer
drove his 27th homer to right field with two outs. Two pitches
later, Batista hit his 37th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart singled in the second and scored on Delgado's groundout.
Fletcher hit his 17th homer in the third to make it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Ron Gant hit a solo homer in the ninth off Kelvim
Escobar.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wells goes for his 20th win next Monday against Oakland as
he tries to join Jack Morris, Pat Hentgen and Roger Clemens as the
only 20-game winners in Toronto's history. ... The Blue Jays are
15-1 in games preceding a day off. ... The Angels have alternated
wins and losses in their last 13 games, three shy of the major
league record. ... Batista's RBI was his 100th, matching the career
high he established last season in 44 games with Arizona and 98
games with Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Union wants sheriff to resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The Monroe County sheriff and
undersheriff have been asked to resign by the labor union
representing the sheriff department's road patrol deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The Monroe County Sheriff Police Benevolent Association Inc.
claimed their members have no confidence in the management ability
of Monroe County Sheriff Andrew Meloni and Undersheriff Patrick
O'Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   The union held a ''no confidence'' vote Tuesday night and
released a statement Wednesday citing eight points of contention
with Meloni's administration. The union is in the middle of
contentious contract negotiations with the county.
</P>
<P>
   The union said Meloni - who has been sheriff for 20 years -
failed to support the ''fight for fair and equitable pay for
deputies.''
</P>
<P>
   Other points listed in the statement include: More than 25
unresolved grievances over such issues as overtime, seniority and
ticket quotas; alleged violations of state labor laws; and the
appearance of a double standard between union members and command
staff when enforcing departmental rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The road patrol is one of four services provided by the
sheriff's office. Deputies in three other bureaus provide security
in the jails, courts and enforce civil procedures. Deputies in
those bureaus are represented by two other unions.
</P>
<P>
   The road patrol deputies are prohibited by law from striking.
And unlike other police unions, they don't have the guarantee of
binding arbitration - a decision reached by a third party that both
sides must agree to.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have recently presented their case to a mediator, who
can make a nonbinding recommendation, and are awaiting that report.

<HEADLINE> Battle Lines Forming Over Bush, Gore  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's claim that the next president
will inherit a military ''in decline'' is producing a political tug
of war among former and present Pentagon commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign has put forth Defense Secretary William
Cohen, the only Republican in President Clinton's Cabinet, and
former Clinton Defense Secretary William Perry to dispute the
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
during the presidency of Bush's father, joined the fray Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Readiness has declined, investment has declined, maintenance
has declined, training has declined,'' Powell said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He stood by declarations by both Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, and running mate Dick Cheney -- the defense
secretary under Bush's father -- that the Clinton administration is
responsible for a weakened and overextended military.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Wednesday to an international-relations group in
Atlanta, Cheney accused President Clinton and Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee, of ''eight years of neglect and misplaced
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said troops that were victorious in the Persian Gulf War
have been hurt by spending cuts ''far beyond any careful weighing
of the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell sought to reinforce Cheney, his partner in overseeing the
1991 operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was with Cheney. I know everything he's talking about. I've
seen nothing with which I disagree,'' said Powell, who was made
available to reporters by Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Powell did concede that Bush misstated one fact when talking
about Army readiness in his Aug. 3 speech accepting the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said: ''If called on by the commander in chief today, two
entire divisions of the Army would have to report ... 'Not ready
for duty, sir.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and Gore's campaign complained that Bush had quoted
a report that was eight months old.
</P>
<P>
   ''His data was a few months out of date,'' acknowledged Powell,
a Republican who is widely viewed as a likely candidate for
secretary of state in a Bush administration. But he insisted that,
even if the Army now says all its divisions are combat-ready, ''the
force is not balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats point out that defense spending had been declining
when Clinton took office in 1991 -- from 1985, the high point of the
Reagan buildup, through the elder Bush's term.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that defense spending has been up sharply in the
past two years under Clinton, including the biggest military pay
raise in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, as have other Republicans, said recent increases in
defense spending were due more to the GOP-led Congress, responding
to readiness complaints voiced in 1999 and again this year by the
military brass, than to initiatives of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just Colin Powell coming out of the woods and
saying this. All you have to do is look at their (military service
chiefs) testimony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the current defense secretary, earlier found himself in
an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   As a Republican, he has often agreed with congressional
Republicans on defense issues. But as a Cabinet member, Cohen was
called upon to defend Clinton-Gore military policy after Bush's
comments at the GOP convention and in a subsequent address to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen disputed Bush and Cheney's assertions that morale in the
U.S. military is dangerously low, saying, ''As a matter of fact I
think morale is increasing.'' He cited indications that the
services are having more success this year meeting retention and
recruiting goals.
</P>
<P>
   Powell on Wednesday countered, ''It does a disservice to the men
and women in uniform to suggest that they are as ready as they can
be or that the right investments have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has also enlisted Richard Armitage, who served
in the State and Defense departments under President Bush, as a
warrior in the present defense-spending battle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Perry, defense secretary in Clinton's first term,
asserted on behalf of Gore's campaign that ''two-thirds of the
reductions in the military'' were made by previous GOP
administrations. ''I think people might be suffering from
amnesia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, defended the campaign's role in
escalating the battle of the commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush injected politics into the
national-international security debate by falsely saying that two
army divisions were not ready for combat. In fact, they are ready
for combat. The U.S. military is the best trained, equipped and
ready in the world,'' Hattaway said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World, an arms
control advocacy group that follows defense issues, said the debate
''submerges serious subjects in partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, both parties are distorting the facts and
omitting key information,'' he said. ''It would be far better to
conduct a rational review of current military needs for the next
president.''

<HEADLINE> Suharto's Corruption Trial Underway  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Former President Suharto's corruption
trial opened Thursday amid tight security, and then quickly
adjourned after the ex-dictator's doctors determined he was too
sick to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This morning Suharto's medical team consisting of 23 doctors
checked the health of our client and concluded he was sick,'' said
attorney Felix Tampubolon told the five-judge panel. ''Because of
that he could not face the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors immediately asked for a two-week adjournment to give
their doctors a chance to examine Suharto. Chief judge Lalu Mariyun
granted the delay until Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented trial is seen as a key test of Indonesia's
determination to stamp out corruption and deal with the excesses of
decades of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns surrounding the trial were heightened when a
small bomb exploded late Wednesday inside an empty bus less that
300 yards from the venue of the hearing. No one was injured and
damage was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's medical team examined him early Thursday morning at
his central Jakarta residence while dozens of journalists waited
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyers claim that 2&AMP;frac12; years after student protesters
dislodged him from power, Suharto, 79, has become a frail old man,
brain-damaged by strokes and unable to understand simple questions.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors countered that recent medical tests, including
brain scans, by government doctors show that he is fit for a trial,
which is expected to last for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon, the head of Suharto's legal team said Wednesday that
the decision on whether Suharto was fit enough to attend the
opening court session at a heavily guarded auditorium in south
Jakarta would depend on the medical examination.
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon said he personally believed that the trial should not
go ahead because Suharto ''is unable to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is charged with stealing $583 million of state funds,
according to a copy of the indictment obtained by The Associated
Press. He had denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has said he will pardon Suharto if
he returns ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-page indictment alleges that Suharto enriched himself,
his family and cronies with state money through tax-free charitable
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges Suharto, who ruled the world's fourth
most populous nation with an iron hand for 32 years, issued
presidential decrees to pilfer the public purse.
</P>
<P>
   It alleges he skimmed 2 percent of the country's income tax
revenue, took funds from sales taxes and snatched a percentage from
the monthly paychecks of civil servants and military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 police are guarding the Agriculture Ministry,
where the trial is to be held in a converted conference room able
to hold hundreds of spectators and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Judges and prosecutors have been assigned bodyguards and bomb
squads are on standby.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Wednesday night's blast, which damaged the interior
of the bus, was a message to the trial's participants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an act of terror to intimidate people before the trial
starts,'' Jakarta's chief detective, Col. Hari Montolalu, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students complain the charges against Suharto are not broad
enough -- that he stole billions not just millions and that he
should also be prosecuted for human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is excellent that he is being forced to stand
trial,'' said Gina Ariyani, 23, a college student. ''But his people
are playing games and attempting to destabilize the country. They
still have power and money.''

<HEADLINE> McGraw, Chesney Threaten Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Country singers Tim McGraw and Kenny
Chesney are threatening to sue the Erie County Sheriff's Department
over their arrests during a scuffle with deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Thomas Eoannou said a notice of claim filed Tuesday in
state Supreme Court contends the singers suffer from physical and
psychological injuries as a result of the fracas.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, Chesney and a road manager were arrested June 3 at a
music festival in Orchard Park, N.Y., after Chesney allegedly took
a police horse without permission from a backstage area. Police
said McGraw assaulted a deputy when they tried to stop Chesney.
</P>
<P>
   The singers deny wrongdoing and claim their arrests damaged
their reputations and their business. Eoannou said his clients are
ready to pursue a lawsuit if the county continues to prosecute
them.
</P>
<P>
   The three are scheduled to face trial in December on various
misdemeanor charges which carry potential prison terms of up to a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Erie County Sheriff Patrick Gallivan called the notice
''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a common defense tactic: When someone is arrested try to
deflect attention from the real issues at hand by filing a lawsuit
against the police,'' the sheriff said.

   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Danny Glover will help pay tribute to Walt
Disney when he acts as master of ceremonies of the National
Inventors Hall of Fame's induction ceremony on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Glover's appearance, announced Wednesday, lends heft to
Inventure Place President David Fink's promise to turn the annual

</P>
<P>
   Glover has starred in the Disney movies ''Operation Dumbo Drop''
and ''Angels in the Outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is being inducted for his 1940 patent of a special camera
for filming animation -- an invention first used for a full-length
film with ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wozniak, who founded Apple Computer in 1976 with Steve
Jobs, will be honored for his invention of the Apple II, which
brought together all the elements of the modern personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   This year's ceremony brings the number of inventors honored to
158.
</P>
<P>
   The hall of fame was created in 1973 by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office and the National Council of Intellectual Property
Attorneys. Previous inductees have included Thomas Edison, the
Wright brothers and Henry Ford.

Wildfire Fight To Cost $1 Billion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal cost of fighting wildfires across the West
soon will exceed $1 billion with Congress likely to dip into the treasury again
this year to pay the final tab, federal officials said Wednesday. So far, the
federal government has tallied at least $626 million in costs to battle scores
of fires from Montana to New Mexico, spending as much as $18 million a day,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which is coordinating the
firefighting effort.

Andres Pastrana. During Clinton's half-day visit to Cartagena, police said they

transplanting kidneys illegally from dead patients, according to a report
submitted to the state prosecutor's office. It's not clear how the patients
died. The state attorney will decide soon whether to prosecute them, said
Anuchart Kongmalai, a state attorney.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A judge said he may order a recall of as many as 2
million Ford Motor Co. vehicles over concerns that they are prone to stalling,
and accused the company of deceiving federal safety investigators and consumers.
Ford denied the allegations. It's a new blow for the Dearborn, Mich.-based
automaker, which is involved in this month's recall of 6.5 million Firestone
tires, which were standard equipment on some Ford trucks and sports utility
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Texas Medicaid Fails Children  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas' failure to live up to a 1996
agreement to make major improvements to its Medicaid program is
hurting poor children, a federal judge has found in ruling that the
state has not adequately cared for 1.5 million low-income
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice says the state was not
adequately providing dental care, regular checkups, transportation
to doctors or information about what services are available to
children in Medicaid, despite its promise four years ago to make
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision immediately became fodder for the presidential
candidates, with Democrat Al Gore criticizing Republican rival
George W. Bush, the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign cited the ruling as an example of what it says
it Bush's lack of leadership on child health issues.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president regularly complains that there are 1.4
million Texas children without health insurance and that Bush tried
to limit eligibility for a new program aimed at getting health care
coverage to the children in working poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and top aides traveling with him Wednesday were caught off
guard by the decision. He told reporters that he had not reviewed
the order by Justice, who is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we have a good record signing people up to Medicaid,''
Bush said, without mentioning the services children get once they
are signed up -- the subject of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general plans to appeal. The ruling gives the
state 60 days to come up with a solution -- making it due just
before the Nov. 7 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to comment, saying he hadn't read the decision.
But others weighed in for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush has an obligation to explain that strong and
very troubling court decision,'' said running mate Joseph
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign said he is committed to improving the program
and pointed the finger at the Democratic administration that
preceded him. Bush was elected in 1994. The class-action lawsuit
that sparked the latest ruling was filed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a decade-long challenge that Texas is addressing,''
said spokesman Dan Bartlett. ''We are aggressively working to
provide health care to those children.''
</P>
<P>
   The state signed a consent decree promising change in 1996. The
court issued a ruling Aug. 14 saying the state had failed to fix
the program, which serves about 1.5 million Texans under age 18.
Another 1.4 million are uninsured, about 600,000 of whom are
eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Children's advocates said they want to move beyond court fights
and political battles.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about the children of the state of Texas,'' said state
Rep. Garnet Coleman, vice chairman of the House Public Health
Committee. ''The time that we spend on fighting a lawsuit we could
spend on making sure that the children who have not seen a doctor
have that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa McGiffert, a policy analyst with the Austin office of
Consumers Union, an advocacy group, agreed the state's energy could
be better spent. ''I guess when I hear that there's going to be an
appeal that says to me that their efforts are going to go to
defending what they're doing rather than changing it or trying to
do it better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 175-page ruling, Justice said Texas had failed to inform
families about the benefits available -- even when they asked. About
1 million kids never saw a dentist last year, and most who did were
there for emergency treatment -- such as an inability to eat -- that
could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   The court also found major problems with transportation programs
and for children enrolled in health maintenance organizations and
other managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''A poor and often-isolated population should not be robbed of
their rights to services,'' wrote Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Like other states, Texas is in the process of moving its
Medicaid population into managed care, which is cheaper and has a
reputation for providing strong preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   But the court found that the checkups ''were grossly inadequate
and incomplete'' -- taking just 12 to 20 minutes when a proper exam
would take an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also concluded that Texas failed to address the needs
of about 13,200 abused and neglected children under state
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said the state had added staff and increased budgets in
an attempt to reach more children and provide more families with
transportation. But the court found that much of the data used to
show improvement was inflated.

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Decide Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge has refused to designate a
presidential candidate for the divided Reform Party, whose opposing
factions have chosen separate nominees.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon said Wednesday he lacks
jurisdiction to settle an internal party dispute between allies of
Pat Buchanan and an anti-Buchanan faction that selected rival
candidate John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's supporters had sought an order barring the opposing
faction from operating under the party's name. But Moon said the
power struggle didn't raise any constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
   During the party's convention in Long Beach, Calif., earlier
this month, delegates opposed to Buchanan declared his nomination
illegitimate and walked out. That group then held its own
convention across the street and nominated Hagelin, an Iowa
physicist.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are seeking $12.6 million in Federal Election
Commission money and have been working to get on state ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Cooter, attorney for the Buchanan faction, said he will
take the issue to a state court, possibly as early as next week. He
wasn't sure where he would file.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hagelin hasn't seen the last of me just yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooter said he was disappointed with the ruling. ''We felt this
was the appropriate place to get a speedy and fair decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Moon presided over a power struggle between opposing
party factions seeking control of $2.5 million in party funds. Moon
ruled that Pat Choate, the 1996 running mate of party founder Ross
Perot, was the party's legitimate chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mangia, a Hagelin backer, called Wednesday's ruling ''a
small victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This dispute will go on until Pat Buchanan goes back to the
Republican Party where he belongs,'' Mangia said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan left the GOP last October to run under the Reform Party
banner.
</P>
<P>
   State election commissions across the country are struggling to
decide whether Buchanan or Hagelin should appear on their general
election ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Two states, Iowa and Montana, literally have pulled names out of
hats to decide who would be listed. Buchanan won in Iowa; Hagelin
won in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Other states reached ballot decisions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Hagelin will be the Reform Party candidate, with
Buchanan as the Colorado Freedom Party nominee. Buchanan's
supporters promised an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's secretary of state rejected both candidates because
of ''discrepancies'' over who is the rightful chair of the Reform
Party of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the State Election Commission said Buchanan
would be listed. In North Carolina, the state Reform Party sued to
stop the Board of Elections from printing ballots with Buchanan as
the Reform nominee. A hearing was scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   California Reform Party Chairman Ray Mills on Wednesday
submitted Buchanan's name as the nominee for a second time, but the
state party's board again said the move was illegitimate. State
elections officials were expected to rule Thursday on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Virginia, Choate, who later stepped down as party
chairman, accused Hagelin's supporters of trying to delay any
decision in the dispute until after the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tear-down strategy. What we need to do and what we
will do is get into court where we can put them under oath and
everyone will see the game that is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia said the Buchanan faction has no case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the judge realized this was a bogus attempt to
subvert the democratic process, to subvert the Federal Election
Commission and federal election law and he wasn't going to stand
for it,'' said Mangia.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia said he has filed a complaint with the FEC alleging fraud
by the Buchanan faction. He claims the other side is seeking refuge
in the courts to keep the FEC from getting involved in the dispute
and deciding who gets the $12.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Attacks Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The navy captain's body was found floating
off Taiwan's eastern coast seven years ago. Yin Ching-feng, it was
thought, was about to blow the whistle on colleagues for taking
kickbacks in a weapons procurement scheme.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators couldn't prove the connection, and the case of
Yin's mysterious death fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. In a symbolically important strike against
corruption, President Chen Shui-bian has reopened the investigation
as part of a broad crackdown on one of Asia's most entrenched
havens for graft.
</P>
<P>
   The new president's determination to make good on his campaign
promises dominates news headlines here, raising hopes the island
can clean up an embarrassing chapter in its military history.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's war on ''black gold'' -- Taiwanese slang for corrupt
money -- so far has produced mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Many had thought the president would try to first chalk up early
successes by solving smaller cases, building up momentum before
tackling big ones.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, though, Chen's strategy has become clearer.
He's focusing on multiple targets ranging from big-name suspects,
or ''tigers,'' to minor ones, or ''flies.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate cases, investigators have raided a temple in central
Taiwan suspected of laundering money for gangsters. They've accused
business tycoon and lawmaker Wang Ling-lin of fraudulent land
sales. Another lawmaker, Liao Fu-pen, allegedly held fake stock
certificates. A mayor in Taiwan's fourth-largest city, Tainan, was
charged in a bid-rigging scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say many investors have pulled out of the stock market,
fearing that more companies will be involved in the probes. But
Premier Tang Fei said Thursday that Taiwan will forge ahead because
corruption threatens the economic foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no reason to be pessimistic,'' Tang said. ''If we
don't get rid of black gold now, when should we do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Corruption has long been rampant in Asia, where lawmakers and
business leaders have cozy ties, the rule of law is weak and rules
are bent or ignored in return for favors.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is often held up as a classic case. For more than 50
years, one of the world's richest political parties, the
Nationalists, ruled the island, building a massive business empire
and spreading around enormous amounts of cash at election time.
</P>
<P>
   When the 49-year-old Chen toppled the Nationalists in March, the
former lawmaker and Taipei mayor promised to clean up graft.
Kicking off the effort in a recent speech, Chen said corrupt
politicians are a ''malignant tumor'' that must be removed without
any delay.
</P>
<P>
   The Yin case particularly stands out, ruling nightly TV news
here and demonstrating the new leader's resolve to shake up the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Yin -- the head of a weapons procurement office --
was killed because he was about to finger military brass who took
kickbacks in a deal to buy French-made warships and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, Chen had held hearings on the scandal but the
military denied him access to documents and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   With Chen their new boss, military leaders now pledge to assist
investigators and a truckload of documents has been turned over.
</P>
<P>
   Chen badly needs the support of the military, which had long
pledged allegiance to the former Nationalist government. Many
Taiwanese had expected Chen to leave the powerful armed forces
alone, but some experts say Chen believes he can't secure his
control without first straightening up the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''Soldiers are supposed to be strictly disciplined, and yet we
had navy officers colluding among themselves and with arms dealers
who were former colleagues,'' said Kang Ning-hiang, a member of the
government watchdog Control Yuan, who launched a separate probe
into the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cracking the case may be impossible. Some key witnesses and
suspects have left the country and prosecutors have complained that
evidence has disappeared or been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may not find the murderer, but we might at least clarify
some doubts and prevent more wrongdoing,'' said Shu Ching-chiang, a
military expert at Nanhua University.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are frustrated in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   After raiding the Chenlan Temple in central Taichung County,
they lacked evidence that Yen Ching-piao -- a reputed gang leader
and local politician -- used the temple to launder money. The raid
produced only one minor charge, that Yen illegally rented public
land outside temple grounds to street vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Another apparently ill-conceived raid on the Legislature was
equally embarrassing when prosecutors failed to find any fake stock
certificates held by Liao Fu-pen, a six-term Nationalist lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Although the investigations have caused Taiwan's jittery stock
market to dip and could cause political instability, Chen told
reporters this week that the aggressive actions will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no worries,'' Chen said. ''We will carry them out to
the very end.''

<HEADLINE> Thousands Greet Somalia President  </HEADLINE>
By OSMAN HASSAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of flag-waving
Somalis greeted the new president -- their first head of state in
almost 10 years of unrest -- in his unexpected visit to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years of killing and looting is over. We brought you your
flag, we brought you the parliament and the president,'' Abdiqasim
Salad Hassan, under heavy protection, told more than 120,000
ecstatic Somalis who crammed into Mogadishu's national soccer
stadium on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan had been in the small town of Arta in neighboring
Djibouti, where he was elected and where Somalia's new assembly
currently sits. Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh has hosted
the gathering, the 13th attempt to find a peaceful solution to
Somalia's problems -- and one treated with skepticism by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the assembly nor the president were expected to return
to Somalia until a prime minister and Cabinet had been appointed.
The appointments have yet to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Somalis heard of the visit late Tuesday when announcements were
made on radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, virtually all of Mogadishu's businesses and
schools were closed and vehicles laden with loudspeakers, sirens
and ululating women sped up and down the capital's dusty streets.
</P>
<P>
   Bands and musicians also paraded, singing national songs and the
Somali anthem, which had not been heard in the city for years.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has been synonymous with chaos and violence and has had
no central government since opposition leaders joined forces to
oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Factional leaders then
fought with each other, turning the Horn of Africa nation into
battling fiefdoms ruled by heavily armed militias.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament's election of the 58-year-old Hassan, who promised to
bring economic recovery and peace to the nation of 7 million, came
as a result of a conference that began in Arta on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, more than 100 specially fitted pickup trucks,
known locally as battle wagons, and 2,000 heavily armed militias,
employed by Mogadishu's business community, escorted Hassan on the
55-mile trip from Ballidogle Airport to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 battle wagons and 600 militias belonging to the
capital's Islamic courts provided security around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers say the real test for the assembly and president
will be when they move to Somalia permanently. Then, Hassan and his
245 legislators face the daunting task of persuading faction
leaders opposed to the peace process to respect them.
</P>
<P>
   And the parliament, which will be penniless and faced with a
virtually destroyed infrastructure, will have to recruit the
militiamen who cruise the streets into a new national security
force. They will also have to start collecting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   International support will be crucial, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who was accompanied by 90 legislators, did not
say how long he would be in Somalia but he was expected to visit
Baidoa, capital of the central region of Bay, before returning to
Arta.

<HEADLINE> Scrap metal company faces OSHA fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OWEGO, N.Y. (AP) - The federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has accused a scrap metal company of failing to
protect employees from lead exposure.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's six-month investigation, prompted by complaints about
workers being overexposed, has resulted in the citations against
Ben Weitsman &AMP; Son. The company is facing a $64,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Weitsman company failed to provide medical evaluations and
fit testing for employees required to wear respirators, according
to OSHA.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also charged the company with nine serious
violations, where death or physical harm may result, including
failing to remove an employee whose blood lead levels were too high
and failing to provide protective clothing, showers and
hand-washing facilities for employees exposed to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Weitsman, general manager of the Owego company, said he
plans to contest the citations at a hearing Sept. 7 in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged violations, some of which date back at least five
years, involve two employees out of a total of 50 who use torches
when cutting bridges and other large objects into pieces. Older
bridges tend to have lead-based paint, which can expose employees
to lead.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Says ADL Misunderstood  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman is accusing vice presidential
rival Dick Cheney of quoting him out of context to distort the
Clinton administration's record on military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another inaccurate and unfair statement and I'm
disappointed by it,'' Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice
president, said in an interview Wednesday night. Vice presidential
candidates normally criticize the other party's presidential
nominee, not their fellow No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Cheney told the Southern Center on International
Studies that the military is low on morale, weapons and soldiers
because of ''eight years of neglect'' by the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, the former defense secretary quoted Lieberman
as saying, ''Our military faces readiness problems, including
falling recruitment, and retention in critical skill areas; aging
equipment that costs more to keep operating at acceptable levels of
reliability; a need for more support services for a force with a
high percentage of married personnel; and frequent deployments.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did not mention that Lieberman praised the administration
in the very next paragraph of his February 1999 speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department of defense deserves credit for highlighting
these problems. The administration deserves credit for increasing
the budget to address them. And our colleagues who have crafted
this bill deserve credit for bringing these issues into focus,''
Lieberman said, according to a text provided by Democrat Al Gore's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's quoted me out of context and incompletely, and
I'm troubled by it,'' Lieberman told The Associated Press between
campaign stops in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush
said in his GOP convention speech that two Army divisions were not
ready for combat, a point rebutted by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the full text of
Lieberman's remarks do not absolve President Clinton and Gore of
troubles in the military under their watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's saying that the problems still exist,'' she said. 'He's
giving credit to the administration for finally addressing the
problem, and that is not leadership by any measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss suggested that Lieberman is being forced to change his
tune about the military, just as his views on affirmative action
and Social Security recently shifted to fit Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many times is the Gore campaign going to try to manipulate
Senator Lieberman's long respected positions in order to meet their
own ends?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's team pointed to a May 1999 speech in which Lieberman said
he was ''pleased and proud that we reversed the 14 years of
declining'' military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said in the interview that military spending began
declining under President Reagan and is rising under Clinton-Gore.
Soldiers recently received the largest pay increase in 20 years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cheney ''acknowledged my assessment of the problem ...
but then he doesn't add the second part, which is a statement of an
aggressive and encouraging response by the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also told The AP that the Anti-Defamation League
misunderstood his statements earlier this week when he advocated a
greater role for faith and religion in American public life.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the response to his remarks at a black church
in Detroit on Sunday and an interfaith breakfast in Chicago on
Monday as ''a bit of an overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches, the league urged Lieberman, the first
Orthodox Jew on a national party ticket, to tone down his
references to religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the ADL, but I respectfully disagree,'' Lieberman
said. ''I think they misunderstood part of it, part of what I was
trying to say. And the whole point of it is that I think faith has
a constructive role that it can play in American life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly plays a constructive role in the lives of
millions of Americans and can in the community as well and that's
what I was trying to say,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Bush Visits 100th School  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- George W. Bush is visiting the 100th school of
his presidential campaign to highlight his top legislative
priority, a $47 billion education plan. But Democrat Al Gore's
campaign says the visits are more like ''100 photo ops'' about
misguided proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is marking the occasion in the gymnasium of Springfield
High School in this battleground state in an event he hopes will
symbolize his commitment to giving school systems more control and
holding them accountable for poor student performance. The Texas
governor also is highlighting what he says are opportunities for
education reform missed by the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''After seven years of stagnancy where the achievement gap has
not closed, it is time for new leadership,'' Bush said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president's campaign, which has focused on health
care lately rather than education, accused Bush of avoiding
questions about the plan with his typically short speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 15 minutes, you get a nice picture to go on the evening
news, but you don't give real people at these events the
opportunity to express concern or have a real dialogue with the
candidates,'' Gore spokeswoman Kym Spell said.
</P>
<P>
   With public opinion polls placing education at the top of
voters' concerns, both Bush and Gore are breaking a bit from their
parties' traditional stances on the subject. Gore supports teacher
testing, which is opposed by teachers' unions that have been a
reliable Democratic constituency. And Bush's private school voucher
plan is not as broad as conservatives would like.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would penalize states that don't test kids for
reading in math in the third through eighth grades. It would allow
children in failing schools to go to private institutions with
federal money that had been going to their old schools. It also
includes money for teacher training, higher Pell grants to
first-year college students and more generous tax-protected
education savings accounts for school expenses from kindergarten
through college.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign estimates the plan would cost $47 billion over
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's 10-year plan, meanwhile, would increase federal spending
on education by 50 percent -- $115 billion -- plus offer another $55
billion in tax incentives to raise teachers' salaries, hire more
teachers, build and repair schools and ensure full access to
preschool.
</P>
<P>
   The events Thursday capped Bush's three-day tour of battleground
states that included New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and
Kentucky. During the trip, he raised more than $3.4 million for
Republicans in the run-up to Labor Day weekend, the traditional
start of the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is slated to kick off the homestretch campaign drive by
addressing Gore's pet issue, health care, next week.
</P>
<P>
   Education reform is the cornerstone of Bush's campaign, but he
has struggled to stick to that message the past two weeks as Gore
has taken shots at him on a Medicare prescription drug plan and the
proposed presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides tried to turn the tables, urging Gore to reveal the
details of his $115 billion plan to improve schools as the Texas
governor chided the vice president for being part of an
administration that has failed to close an ''achievement gap''
between rich and poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you'll be asking a candidate who promises specifics why
he can't outline how he's going to spend that massive amount of
money,'' Bush's communications director, Karen Hughes, said to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bush tried to refocus the topic of debate, it was
reported Wednesday that a federal judge had ruled that Texas has
failed to adequately care for the 1.5 million low-income children
in its Medicaid program. The ruling by U.S. District Judge William
Wayne Justice fed Gore's argument that Bush has failed to provide
health care to his state's children.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush had heard about the Aug. 14 ruling only
Wednesday. The state plans to appeal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, newly released SAT figures showed that
prospective college students in Texas this year had average scores
of 493 verbal, third-worst in the nation, and 500 math, tied for
seventh-worst. On the plus side, 52 percent of Texas high school
seniors took the test, well above the 44 percent rate nationally.

<HEADLINE> Report: Contractors won state and county contracts despite history of bad debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two fund-raisers for Gov. George Pataki and
Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta have won more than $37
million in state and county contracts and subsidies despite a
history of debts, delinquent tax payments and misrepresentations of
their qualifications, Newsday reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Frank and Kenneth Stubbolo have won a $28 million
dollar deal to build a dormitory complex at the State University
College at Old Westbury and a housing project in New Cassel, even
though public records show they have repeatedly defaulted on loans,
claimed credit for work actually done by others and figured in
repeated allegations of questionable business practices, the
newspaper reported on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors and government agencies have won at least 50 financial
judgments and tax liens against the Stubbolos and their companies
over the past several years, the newspaper found. Still, the
brothers have hosted fund-raisers for Pataki and Gulotta,
contributed more than $300,000 to them and other politicians and
gained access to the inner circles of influence.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Stubbolo was named to Pataki's transition team after he
defeated then-Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994. Pataki has played bocce
with the Stubbolos and other contributors at fund-raisers at Frank
Stubbolo's former home in Dix Hills. Gulotta singled out Frank
Stubbolo to be publicly honored at a $500-a-plate fund raiser in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Stubbolos declined to be interviewed by the newspaper.
Audrey Samit, general counsel for the Stubbolo's company, The
Vanderbilt Group, told Newsday the company believed a competitor
and a former business associate had made ''what may be false and
malicious allegations about Vanderbilt throughout the business
community and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta said the Stubbolos' contributions to his campaign fund
were not a factor in getting county support for the New Cassel
housing project job. He told Newsday that he referred Frank
Stubbolo to the county housing agency when Stubbolo expressed his
interest in the project several years ago. He said he honored Frank
Stubbolo for his philanthropic work.
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki spokesman declined to comment. Claudia Hutton,
spokeswoman for the state's Dormitory Authority, told the newspaper
that the Stubbolos' financial support of Pataki was not a factor in
their selection and that the governor's office was not involved in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsday investigation found the Stubbolos exaggerated their
experience in documents sent to Nassau, New York City and the
state, claiming credit for major roles in construction jobs where
they only performed limited, subcontractor tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also found that the Stubbolos have repeatedly
engaged in questionable business practices, with associates
accusing them of dishonesty and deception. The brothers have failed
to pay subcontractors and tax obligations while using business
accounts to pay personal bills, according to testimony in court
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the brother's companies have been forced into bankruptcy
by New York state tax authorities.

<HEADLINE> Energy Secretary Visits Russia  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH INGRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson visited a
flagship Russian military conversion project and promised $13
million to accelerate the transformation of a nuclear weapons
production facility into a civilian technology park.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of a four-day tour of Russia, Richardson
attended a ceremony Wednesday inaugurating the Avangard Technopark
on the premises of a nuclear weapons design facility in Sarov,
which was the closed city of Arzamas-16 in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   The park has carved out 10 acres from the nuclear complex in
Sarov, one of 10 such cities that the U.S. Energy Department is
helping to turn over to civilian enterprises. Ten buildings in
Avangard's Weapons Design Facility complex have been earmarked for
civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, their welcoming me to this forbidden site is a
positive development and an encouraging sign for U.S.-Russian
relations,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our non-proliferation programs are working and must continue,
as it is in America's best interest to help Russia convert these
massive Cold War-era facilities into non-weapons work.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson inaugurated a computer center in Sarov last October.
A firm producing kidney dialysis equipment, to be operated by
Fresenius Medical, has moved into one of the other buildings.
Richardson said that an automotive parts manufacturing plant was to
take over another.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston announced Wednesday that it would
establish a banking software center in the Avangard facility. The
center will employ former weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Conversion work has begun in three of Russia's 10 closed nuclear
cities, and U.S. officials are hoping to accelerate it. Officials
in Sarov, Russia's equivalent of the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory
in New Mexico, said Wednesday that the Avangard facility will no
longer be assembling or disassembling nuclear weapons by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Patients' Bill of Rights  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman say all Americans
are entitled to a ''patients' bill of rights'' that sets minimum
standards of care, and they're challenging opponents George W. Bush
and Dick Cheney to offer the same.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman were pushing their idea at a rally Thursday,
the culmination of a week-long focus on health care issues for the
Democratic candidates for president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he eventually would like to see universal health
care for all in the United States and Gore aides believe they have
a potent issue with health care.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign counters that the Republican governor already
has enacted a patients' bill of rights in Texas that is considered
a model by the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Lieberman proposal makes several guarantees, among them
that:
</P>
<P>
   --People have access to hospital emergency room care and
specialists if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   --Medical decisions are made by doctors, not insurance companies
or health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   --Doctors can tell patients about all options, not just the least
expensive ones.
</P>
<P>
   --Medical records are kept private, and health insurers and
employers cannot discriminate against people based on genetic
information that is now becoming available through human genome
mapping.
</P>
<P>
   --People can appeal a decision to deny coverage made by their
health plans and sue their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   A significant piece of the Texas bill of rights legislation,
giving patients the right the sue insurance companies, became law
without Bush's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Texas law's provisions:
</P>
<P>
   --Patients can appeal denials of care to an independent review
panel and in some cases, sue their HMO if they are hurt because the
HMO denied or delayed the approval of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   --Women have direct access to their obstetrician and gynecologist
and are covered for a minimum of 48 hours in the hospital after
giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   --Employees have the right to choose their own doctor, even
outside their health plan, so long as they are willing to pay
additional costs of that coverage.
</P>
<P>
   --People have access to their own specialists.
</P>
<P>
   --Final medical decisions must be made by doctors, not HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   --In emergencies, HMOs by law must make decisions about coverage
within two hours.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Spar in JonBenet Case  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The special prosecutor investigating JonBenet
Ramsey's slaying and a lawyer representing her parents both say
they will seek to release transcripts of the grand jury that heard
evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Wood, the attorney for John and Patsy Ramsey, challenged
prosecutor Michael Kane on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' Wednesday
night to explain why the grand jury didn't indict his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can absolutely not talk about what went on in the grand
jury,'' Kane replied.
</P>
<P>
   After further goading by Wood, he said: ''I'll tell you what: If
you will go to court with me, and ask the ... judge to authorize a
release of that information, I will release it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood agreed, saying, ''Let the truth come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys have been under suspicion in the 1996 death of the
6-year-old beauty queen, who was found beaten and strangled in the
family's Boulder, Colo., home. No one has been charged, and the
Ramseys have maintained their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers sparred on the King show over an interrogation
of the Ramseys this week in Atlanta, where Kane and other
investigators had come to ask questions about what they called new
forensic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kane complained that he had been misled into thinking the
Ramseys would answer any question. Wood insisted the couple had
answered ''fair'' questions but acknowledged that he had objected
to questions based on the prosecutors' explanation of the forensic
results.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to tell us what the results of the tests were and
then ask a hypothetical question about it,'' Wood said. ''The tests
results as they described them were confusing. They couldn't give
us a clear explanation, so I said 'just show us the results.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kane and six other investigators from Boulder interviewed the
Ramseys for 10 hours over two days at Wood's office. The family now
lives in Atlanta, and it was the parents' first meeting with
Boulder investigators in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Wood released a videotape of portions of the
interview. One segment showed Kane threatening to storm out after
Wood's objection to questions about their son.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sham,'' Kane told Wood in an excerpt of the tape
released Wednesday. ''This is a big publicity stunt on your part.''
</P>
<P>
   The angry exchange between Kane and Wood came Monday after Kane
asked Mrs. Ramsey why she didn't seem more concerned about the
safety of her son Burke, now 13, if she believed an intruder killed
JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   On the 22-minute segment of the tape released by Wood, Kane
asked Mrs. Ramsey if she worried about someone accosting her son at
a stop sign on his way to school. Wood objected.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the objection now?'' Kane asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wonder, what does this have to do with the
investigation into finding who killed JonBenet Ramsey?'' Wood
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Kane rose from the conference table, closed his notebook and
acted as if he would leave. He called Wood an obstructionist and
said the question was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ever expect for us to be able to put the case against
the intruder together, the intruder is going to ask that
question,'' he said. ''Why is it that the parents, a month after
their child was murdered, allow their son to be transported ...
with no protection. That's a legitimate question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Kane didn't leave and the session continued.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he released the tape to show that Kane was overzealous
and acted improperly during the interviews and to counter a Boulder
police statement that he said implied the Ramseys were less than
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point is, they're foolish questions,'' John Ramsey told
The Associated Press. ''He's trying to discredit us. It has nothing
to do with finding the killer.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mrs. Ramsey challenged Colorado police to charge
her in the death of JonBenet. ''I'm beyond being hurt or
embarrassed,'' Mrs. Ramsey told USA Today. ''If you think I did it,
let's have a trial and get it over with.''

<HEADLINE> Quiet Remembrance Of Princess Diana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Three years after Princess Diana's death in a
high-speed car crash, remembrances of her life will be a private
issue for the royal family and a low-key matter for her admirers.
</P>
<P>
   At Westminster Abbey, where Diana's funeral service took place,
the princess will be remembered in prayers. At Kensington Palace,
the focus of mass public mourning in 1997, loyal fans can be
counted on to return with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Prince William, Diana's 18-year-old son who just graduated from
Eton, will be away from home. He went to Belize right after school
to begin a year of traveling and working before starting college.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Harry, 15, will be with his father, Prince Charles, at
Balmoral, the royal family's private estate in the Scottish
Highlands. It was at Balmoral, on Aug. 31, 1997, that William and
Harry first heard of their mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Charles and Harry were with Queen Elizabeth II,
Prince Philip and the 100-year-old Queen Mother Elizabeth at
Crathie Church, Balmoral. Prayers were said for Diana, although she
was not mentioned by name, as is traditional in the Church of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Althorp, the Spencer family estate, closed its doors to the
public Wednesday after its two months open each year for people to
visit a memorial to Diana by her brother, Earl Spencer. The earl
was expected to spend the anniversary quietly at Althorp, where
Diana was buried on an island in an ornamental lake.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial was planned Thursday at Harrods, the London
department store owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died in
the Paris crash with Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed said Wednesday he will file suit in U.S. federal court
to gain access to American intelligence information, and repeated
his claim that Diana and his son were victims of a murder
conspiracy plotted by people who disapproved of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was seeking documents from the CIA, the Justice
Department and the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one suspects the U.S. government was involved'' in the
accident, said Al Fayed's lawyer, Mark Zaid. But he said the
government might be withholding information.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller nor NSA
spokeswoman Judi Emmel would comment, citing the pending
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said the agency understands Al
Fayed's ''grief and tremendous sense of loss.'' But he said any
suggestion that the CIA spied on Dodi Fayed or on Diana, or that it
knows of any plot to murder them is ''totally unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, an appeals court rejected Al Fayed's request for the
information, upholding the decision of a lower court judge who said
Al Fayed had tried ''to make an end run around'' the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Paris judge Herve Stephan has concluded that alcohol, drugs and
excessive speed caused the crash that ended the life of the
''people's princess.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial
Fund has amassed $160 million from public donations, corporate and
other funds and the licensing of Diana memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, $40 million has been pledged to help the most
disadvantaged people. A total of $65 million will be spent by 2001,
then $10 million each year thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Gore Becomes Tourguide of Wash.  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) -- Suddenly, Vice President Al Gore
bounded down the aisle of the plane and jumped into a seat in back
to give members of the press a guided tour of Washington state's
most famous mountain vista.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the mountain that my son and I climbed. There it is
right there! That's Mount Rainier there!'' said an excited Gore,
pointing out the window. ''The little flat one is Mount St. Helens,
... and the one straight across there is Adams, and the one back
there is Mount Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost 15 minutes, while his plane was en route from a
campaign stop in Portland, Ore., to one in Seattle, Gore fondly
recalled three days he spent with his son, Albert Gore III, in 1999
climbing Mount Rainier, a peak of 14,411 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great father-son experience and it was really fun in
a lot of ways. It was physically very hard but one of the great
things about for me was that I couldn't think about my work or the
campaign,'' Gore said. ''After three days, my mind was real
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was right after that that he decided to move his
campaign headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Nashville and made
many other changes in his campaign operation.
</P>
<P>
   On bended knee in the aisle of the plane, Gore described the
conditions as extremely dangerous. Sharing a two-person tent, Gore
and his son had to keep kicking the tent to keep hail from causing
it to collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had whiteout conditions and hail, lightning. Every night we
were there, there was a storm,'' he said. ''We went to bed at 7
p.m. and set the alarm at 11 p.m. and while we were trying to
sleep, the lightning was going and the biggest hail storm I have
ever been in in my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said they had to make their final ascent in the middle of
the night because the morning sun heats the top layer of snow and
can cause an avalanche. Wearing crampons on their boots and a kind
of miner's headlamp to see, they picked their way through the ice,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we finally made it to the top and headed back down at
daylight, ... only then did I see where we had been during the
night and I went, 'You are kidding me! This is ridiculous.' I mean
at one point, there were these crevasses on either side,'' he said.
''If I had been able to see that when I came up, I'm not sure I
ever would have made it. Coming back it was the only way down, so
you had to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Eye Gas Guzzlers  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Auto manufacturers didn't pay up to $10.2
billion in federal gas guzzler taxes last year because of a
22-year-old law that exempts light-duty trucks including
increasingly popular sport utility vehicles, an environmental group
says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Automakers are avoiding paying taxes and cranking out
polluting and gas-guzzling vehicles,'' said Brian Dunkiel, director
of tax programs at Friends of the Earth, a Washington-based
advocacy group. ''It's not fair, it's bad for the environment, and
it's making America more dependent on foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1978 law passed by Congress to encourage production of
fuel-efficient vehicles, U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers must
pay taxes ranging from $1,000 to $7,700 for each new passenger car
that gets below 22.5 miles per gallon on a combined city-highway
average.
</P>
<P>
   Light-duty trucks, which include pickups, minivans, full-size
vans and SUVs, were exempted on the theory that many were used in
businesses such as construction and on farms. At the time, these
vehicles made up about a quarter of new vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, light-duty trucks are almost half of all new
sales, and are frequently used more for commuting and other daily
chores.
</P>
<P>
   The study released Wednesday by Friends of the Earth, concluded
that if these vehicles were held to the same 22.5 mpg standard, the
industry as a whole would have paid the federal government $10.2
billion alone in additional gas guzzler taxes in 1999 -- and $43.1
billion over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes that could have applied to SUVs alone in 1999 amounted to
$5.6 billion, the study found. Pickup trucks avoided $3.9 billion
and vans and minivans, which tend to be more fuel efficient, $811
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service collected only $48
million in gas guzzler taxes on passenger cars in 1998 -- the most
recent year complete data was available -- mainly on luxury sedans
and high-end sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. auto industry has acknowledged room for improvement in
the fuel efficiency of SUVs. Ford Motor Co. recently announced it
will increase the fuel economy of its SUV fleet by 25 percent, from
18 mpg to 23 mpg, by 2005. General Motors Corp. says it will offer
pickups and buses that burn up to 50 percent less fuel and
DaimlerChrysler AG has a gas/electric version of its Dodge Durango
SUV ready for market if it can be priced competitively.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Auto
Manufacturers representing 13 major U.S. and foreign auto
companies, said extending the gas guzzler tax to light-duty trucks
would inevitably raise costs for consumers while not hastening the
availability of more fuel-efficient, less polluting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Automakers are already competing with each other to bring more
fuel-efficient vehicles to market,'' she said. ''Our view is that
competition is going to drive more progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials also said that the Friends of the Earth
report produced inflated estimates of the potential tax avoided,
noting that the federal fuel efficiency standard for a company's
entire light truck fleet is 20.7 mpg, compared with 27.5 mpg for
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists said even if light-duty trucks were given
a similar fuel-efficiency discount for tax purposes, the 1978 law
would still permit them to avoid billions of dollars in taxes every
year. They said the exemption acts as a subsidy for larger vehicles
that burn more gas and cause more pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we should close the tax loophole that gives the
worst vehicles an advantage,'' said Ralph Nader, the longtime
consumer advocate who is running for president on the Green Party
ticket.

<HEADLINE> Label Blasts Latin Grammys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Independent music label Fonovisa has
criticized the new Latin Grammy Awards, alleging a bias against
Mexican regional artists.
</P>
<P>
   The label's general manager, Gilberto Moreno, told the
Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion that artists associated with
Sony Music's labels and Miami-based producer Emilio Estefan are
being favored over Mexican regional stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a party between Emilio Estefan and Sony,'' Moreno told
the newspaper in Tuesday's editions. The Latin Grammys, he said
''definitely don't represent Latin artists at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left by The Associated Press with the Latin
Grammys before business hours Thursday morning was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Fonovisa artists have been nominated among the
estimated 200 nominees in 40 categories. There are no Mexican
regional acts nominated in the major categories, including album,
record and song of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys-based Fonovisa label has urged its artists to avoid
the inaugural Latin Grammys ceremony because of the perceived snub
by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, which produces
the awards show.
</P>
<P>
   Fonovisa representatives also are upset because the ceremony,
which will be televised Sept. 13 from Los Angeles, has no Mexican
regional artists scheduled to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican regional sales make up about 60 percent of the U.S.
Latin music market.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin academy was formed as a companion to the National
Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, the organization that stages
the annual Grammy Awards.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Veto Estate-Tax Repeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was ready to veto a
Republican bill Thursday that would repeal the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is ''too expensive and undermines our ability to pay
down the debt and strengthen Social Security,'' said White House
spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the estate and gift tax would affect the estates of
fewer than 2 percent of Americans, since the first $675,000 of
property left by a deceased person is exempt from tax. Farmers and
small-business owners get even larger exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insist that many farmers and business owners are
penalized by having to buy expensive insurance to cover the tax or
pay for legal and accounting advice to reduce or avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would repeal the tax gradually over 10 years at a cost
of $105 billion.

<HEADLINE> African AIDS Vaccine Targeted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England (AP) -- Researchers began clinical trials
Thursday with a vaccine targeted at an African strain of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is the first specifically designed to combat the
Clade A HIV-1 virus, the most prevalent strain in many parts of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen people volunteered to receive injections of the vaccine
at Churchill Hospital in Oxford. If the tests are successful,
trials will begin in Nairobi, Kenya, within six months, according
to the Medical Research Council, a government-funded national
research organization.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the vaccine will stimulate the body to produce
killer T-cells that will destroy HIV-infected cells fast enough to
stop an infection from taking hold, the council said. If this trial
is successful, it will be possible to conduct trials in volunteers
who have a high risk of HIV infection, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Andrew McMichael, director of the council's Human
Immunology Unit, said it would be three to five years before
researchers would have a clear indication whether the vaccine might
work. After that, it might take another five years to complete
development.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, announced in July at the International Conference on
AIDS in Durban, South Africa, is sponsored by the International
AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a global scientific organization, and
supervised by the Human Immunology Unit of the Medical Research
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seth Berkely, president of the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, said four vaccines are being developed in his project.
This is the first to go to human trials.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine given to the test subjects contains small fragments
of DNA that are intended to boost the immune system. Since the DNA
cannot be replicated, there is no danger of developing AIDS from
the vaccine, the council said.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand on Thursday, researchers announced that they have
reached their goal of recruiting 2,500 volunteers to test an AIDS
vaccine -- the first large-scale trial of such a drug in a
developing country.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDSVAX vaccine is produced by VaxGen Inc., a California
company.
</P>
<P>
   The last volunteer in the Thai trials was enrolled Aug. 24, 17
months after the first six volunteers received their first
injections in late March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   All the volunteers are intravenous drug users who tested
HIV-negative prior to their participation. Each volunteer will
receive a total of seven injections over the course of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The first test results will become available 30 months after the
start of the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has an estimated 1.5 million people infected with HIV,
and caring for the 100,000 people with AIDS poses a high cost to
the country's economy and society, said Dr. Kajit Chupanya, the
project's Thai director.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are rising in early trading,
despite weakness among retail stocks. The Dow Jones industrial
average is up 56 points in today's early going. Advancing issues on
the New York Stock Exchange hold an 8-7 lead over decliners.

</P>
<P>
   Shares of Gap, J.C. Penney and Pacific Sunwear all declined in
premarket trading after the retailers warned Wall Street about
pressure on earnings from lackluster sales. The announcements come
amid growing signs that the Federal Reserve's rate-hiking over the
past year is beginning to curb consumer spending. The market also
awaits tomorrow's pair of key economic reports. Those are the
August unemployment report and a survey of purchasing managers
measuring the health of manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Court TV To Show 'Confessions'  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The prisoner, irritation rising, swats away
the cop's questions about a rape and killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Speed it up. .... This is going to take too long. Get to the
point,'' snaps the man, and before long he's giving his account of
a doctor's death.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is reminiscent of a police interrogation on ''NYPD
Blue'' or ''Homicide: Life on the Street,'' but with a twist: The
players and the crimes are real on ''Confessions,'' Court TV's new
nonfiction show.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are calling the series twisted television that is
nothing more than a lurid grab for ratings. Court TV counters that
it is fulfilling its mission to cover the true face of crime and
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a network that does nothing in many respects but cover
trials and investigations and bad people not to show the bad people
in their own words is kind of ridiculous,'' said Henry S. Schleiff,
chairman and chief executive officer of Court TV.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Holden, a Los Angeles city councilman, is unconvinced. He
sent a letter to Court TV co-owner Time Warner imploring the
company to reconsider ''Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This type of violent TV programming brings the media to a new
all-time low,'' Holden wrote. ''Is it not enough that we are
inundated with news of actual crimes and violent, reality-based
television on a daily basis? Do we need to take it a step further
and get into the minds of these criminals?''
</P>
<P>
   The first half-hour episode (10 p.m. EDT Sunday, Sept. 10)
includes three confessions used at trial by the Manhattan district
attorney's office. There's the man convicted of killing a Bellevue
Hospital physician; a pothead accused of his roommate's death; and
another man arrested in the stabbing of a wheelchair-bound victim.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons between TV police dramas and the real deal are
inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   While series like ''Homicide'' turn the art of interrogation
into high drama, a duel between a clever detective and cagey
suspect, ''Confessions'' enters the scene when the accused are
ready to talk.
</P>
<P>
   What they have to say can be stunning, but not because of the
details: The confessions have been edited to exclude grisly facts.
It's the banality and diffidence that is most striking.
</P>
<P>
   The man convicted of killing the doctor describes her
strangulation with an electric cord as ''pressing the issue.'' The
man accused of killing his roommate recounts how he went to make a
marijuana delivery -- ''of all things'' -- while life apparently
ebbed from her body.
</P>
<P>
   Also noticeable is the scant information framing the
confessions, other than brief descriptions of the legal outcome of
the cases (Court TV said on-screen blurbs will be added to provide
somewhat more background than was included in preview copies of the
show).
</P>
<P>
   Viewers eager for context can stay tuned for a panel discussion
hosted by Court TV anchor Catherine Crier after the debut episode
or can travel to the network's Web site (http://www.courttv.com).
The legal, psychological and ethical aspects of confessions will be
examined, Court TV promises.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kroehling, who created and produces ''Confessions'' with
Eric Nadler, makes no apologies for the spare approach or the
subject. Kroehling is a documentary filmmaker; Nadler is a
journalist and producer. Both have worked on TV news magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The series is a ''very austere kind of television program that
is very well executed (and) that trusts that viewers can enter this
kind of material, engage in it and make their own judgments,''
Kroehling said.
</P>
<P>
   Concurring with him is Marc Klass, whose 12-year-old daughter
Polly was kidnapped and murdered in 1993 in California. During an
appearance last week on Geraldo Rivera's talk show, Klaas lauded
Court TV for having the ''gumption'' to give the public an
unvarnished look at criminality.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences don't always need ''talking heads'' to weigh what they
see, Kroehling said. Critics who decry the show as exploitative are
ignoring reality and the evolution of culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drama and entertainment and nonfiction are coming together in
a certain way. Look at all the movies-of-the-week constructed out
of real events,'' Kroehling said, suggesting that the merger's
roots could be traced to nonfiction novels by Norman Mailer and
Truman Capote.
</P>
<P>
   Schleiff believes the series' home base also makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the show coming after a sitcom on CBS or after a game
show is somewhat out of context,'' the Court TV executive said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confessions'' is part of the larger network picture that
includes daytime trial coverage and the prime-time reality series
''COPS'' and ''Crime Stories'' and news-oriented shows ''Pros &AMP;
Cons'' and ''Crier Today,'' Schleiff said.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently has a sense of what viewers want. Brought in to
help improve the network's sagging ratings in 1998, he's doing the
job: Court TV's household ratings for the third quarter (through
Aug. 9) were up 74 percent compared with 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were reality before reality was cool,'' Schleiff said.
Reality TV doesn't mean putting people ''on an island with some
coconuts and a very good lighting crew, great music and cameras,''
he said, referring to CBS' hit series ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality ''is not always pretty. The people we shine a light on
in the justice system don't always come with suntans and bare
bottoms that look cute,'' he said.

Hello? If you want to phone a local Protestant church, good luck
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- An organization that phoned 3,764
Protestant congregations to test their availability was unable to
establish contact with anyone at 40 percent of them, despite
repeated attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Barna Research Group phoned the randomly selected congregations
in June and July. Nearly half the churches where no person could be
contacted lacked an answering machine. In other cases, voice
messages were left unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a world where people are extremely busy and are suspicious
of the practical value of churches, they are not likely to make
three or four calls to a church before they get to speak to a human
being,'' commented head researcher George Barna. ''If churches
really want to help people, they have to be accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that small churches use call forwarding to a
volunteer ready to answer the phone, or get an answering machine
and repeatedly monitor it.

Pagan group wants equal time after high school prayer rally
</P>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- The Appalachian Pagan Alliance has
applied to hold a ''We Still Work Magic'' rally at the high school
stadium where Christians staged a huge ''We Still Pray'' rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian rally was part of a national movement urging fans
to break into the Lord's Prayer at football games after the
national anthem is sung, in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's
June ruling against organized prayer at games in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The pagan event, on the Sept. 22 autumn equinox, would cast
blessing spells asking for acceptance and call for the earth to be
healed, said leader Ginger Strivelli.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would probably be the same stuff the Christians do. It's
just that we have more gods than they do,'' she said. ''We wouldn't
be up there sacrificing cattle or anything.''
5 conservative pastors quit the United Methodist Church; most
remain
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Five conservative pastors in California
quit the United Methodist Church this summer, as five had in
previous years, but at least 25 others say they'll stick with the
denomination, United Methodist News Service reports.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions among California Methodists worsened this year when a
panel declined to bring charges against 67 clergy who jointly led a
union service for a lesbian couple, in defiance of national church
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Melvin Talbert defended that panel decision. Conservative
clergy, including four of the new defectors, then urged
congregations to withhold denominational assessments in protest,
and Talbert filed complaints against them.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert is retiring in September and a conservative clergy group
plans to meet with his successor, Beverly Shamana.

Interfaith alliance says voters want stronger families
</P>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- An alliance of Protestants, Catholics,
Jews and Muslims that advocates pro-marriage policies released a
poll showing voters think strengthening families is a much more
important social goal than adding jobs or cleaning up the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Wirthlin poll for the Alliance for Marriage also showed 59
percent thought the American family is ''not very strong'' or
''weak and losing ground.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little difference in opinions among Democrats,
Republicans and independents.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance favors lower taxes for families with children,
affordable adoption, mandatory counseling for couples considering
divorce, public education stressing the value of marriage and
employer policies to accommodate parents.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,030 adults had a margin of error of 3
percent.

Vatican reports bishop is being held in Congo's capital
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Authorities in Congo are refusing to let a
Roman Catholic bishop leave the nation's capital, accusing him of
favoring rebels in his home diocese of Manono, the Vatican
missionary news service said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fides service reported that Bishop Nestor Ngoy Katahwa, 57,
was arrested July 28 on a visit to Kinshasa and released the next
day with orders not to leave.
</P>
<P>
   This was at least the third time Congo authorities have arrested
and released bishops, Kinshasa's Cardinal Frederic Etsou Nzabi
Bamungwabi told Fides. He denied the accusations against Katahwa
and called the arrests an attempt to ''humiliate'' the church.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Emmanuel Kataliko remains in exile in rebel-held
Butembo in northern Congo. A rival rebel group has blocked his
return to his Bukavu diocese since February, despite appeals by
Pope John Paul II.
Islamic mosque request rejected in Maryland county
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- The Frederick County board has rejected a
request to suspend suburban sprawl regulations and allow
construction of the county's first Islamic mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest mosque is in Hagerstown, 27 miles away; other local
Muslims travel to worship in Baltimore, Silver Spring and Falls
Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of runaway county growth said they were unfairly portrayed
as anti-Islamic bigots by speakers such as Syed Habeeb Ashruf, a
Baltimore area representative of the American Muslim Council.
</P>
<P>
   Board President David Gray said the 3-2 decision protected the
public water system, outweighing Muslims' hopes to tap restricted
water and sewer lines. He offered to help them find a more suitable
mosque location.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims plan to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   A previous county board voted water exceptions for a youth
baseball camp and a soccer complex, but neither project was built.
Egyptian pope consecrates Tennessee's first Coptic Orthodox church
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Pope Shenouda III, head of Egypt's
Coptic Orthodox Church, has consecrated the altars, icons and
baptistry of Tennessee's first fully established Coptic
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Coptic leaders, members and visitors from across the U.S. packed
the sanctuary for the service led by the 77-year-old pope at St.
Mina Coptic Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   Copts make up nearly 10 percent of the population in Egypt,
where Islam is the state religion. The Coptic community worldwide
is estimated at 27 million.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mina began in 1986 with 18 families and now counts 450
families due to an influx of Egyptian workers to the city. Another
Tennessee congregation is being formed in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a day I will not forget,'' said Olfat Nashed, whose
son was baptized by the pope.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LILY DALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Maybe it's the drive, past farms and
along the wooded shores of a quiet lake. Or maybe it's passing
through a gate into a cozy community of 19th century
gingerbread-like houses and streets not widened since their horse
and buggy beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the first moments at the Lily Dale Assembly
establish a distinct sense of tranquility, a feeling continuously
nurtured through the course of a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Calling itself the ''world's largest Spiritualist community,''
Lily Dale and its year-round and seasonal residents invite visitors
to renew body and spirit. That could involve meditating at an
ancient tree stump deep in a virgin forest, taking part in a
''thought exchange,'' or walking a shrubbery labyrinth while
contemplating life's challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 22,000 to 25,000 who pass through the gates each
year, it means meeting with one of the assembly's three dozen
registered ''mediums'' -- people who claim to commune with the
spirit world -- in hopes of receiving a message or guidance from a
loved one who has died.
</P>
<P>
   But, cautions historian Joyce LaJudice, ''It is not a psychic
fair.'' She stresses Lily Dale residents are serious about
privately practicing the religion of Spiritualism. ''We are not
here for entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a believer is not a requirement to wander the grounds,
browse the bookstores or attend free daily meditation and healing
services and clairvoyance demonstrations by resident and visiting
mediums.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Dale, now in its 121st year, is busiest in summer, with
workshops, services and lectures on topics ranging from past-life
regression to yoga scheduled every day through Sept. 3. Services
are held on a more limited basis during the rest of the year and
Lily Dale's resident mediums continue to offer readings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marion Skidmore library is stocked with hundreds of books
devoted to healing, mediumship, transpersonal psychology and
spiritual development and gift stores stock crystals, clothing,
herbs and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Dale Assembly, named for the abundance of lilies flowering
on Cassadaga Lake on which it sits, has its roots in a group of
Spiritualists who met regularly in the mid-1800s to discuss their
beliefs and practice their healing and mediumship. The first
speaker at Lily Dale was suffragette Elizabeth Lowe Watson, who was
followed by peers like Susan B. Anthony, as the gathering place
about 55 miles southwest of Buffalo became a stronghold for the
suffrage movement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors come for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''To get away and find peace and connect with yourself,'' said
Jackie Laird of Pittsburgh as she walked the wooded grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Burdick-Carey, one of 15 mediums who live permanently at
Lily Dale, noted a shift toward a search for something beyond
material worth.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of those coming to see a medium have a spiritual
purpose, she said. ''Not only whether they should marry Joe or Bill
or if they should buy a blue or green car. They want to know about
their spirituality; what they can do to uplift their spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really became noticeable last year. There's a definite
change in society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laird, who was making her second visit to Lily Dale, agreed and
said the lectures and lessons help teach people to find ''inner
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are searching and it's a good thing,'' she
said. ''I think we went to one extreme and had to find out who we
really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdick-Carey and the assembly's other mediums know there are
many who doubt their abilities -- and the mission of Lily Dale and
other spiritualist communities in general. They welcome the
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''People can be extremely skeptical and I have no problem with
that,'' Burdick-Carey said. ''I won't accept something I haven't
researched.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ''This place radiates peace, love and a gentle,
healing energy, and everyone feels these things.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 181; Nasdaq Adds 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) --High-tech and financial issues pushed stocks
broadly higher Thursday, helping the market recover from a
blue-chip selloff a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 181.27 at 11,284.28, more than wiping out a
112-point loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 15.87 at 1,518.46 and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 69.83 at 4,173.64.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. 1, you're seeing technology stocks strengthen: Intel, Dell
and Microsoft are all up,'' said Greg Nie, senior vice president
for technical research at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''The
Dow is also being helped in particular by J.P. Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was trading up $13.94 at $165. Financial stocks were in
favor Thursday after Wednesday's announcement that Credit Suisse
First Boston planned to buy Donald Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette for $11.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $1.63 to $75.13; Dell climbed $2.50 to $42.44; and
Microsoft was up 1.06 cents at $71.06. Gateway jumped $2.66 to
$68.51.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks might have been even higher Thursday if not for some
disappointing retail sales numbers, which would seem to confirm
analysts' suspicions that second-half consumer spending is on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers re-entered the market Thursday after Wednesday's drop in
blue chips that followed a warning of disappointing second-half
profits at appliance maker Whirlpool. The news alarmed investors
and pulled other industrial stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 443.6 million shares,
up from Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.4 to 537.73.

<HEADLINE> Agent: No Evidence on Palestinian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- The government lacks direct evidence that
a Palestinian immigrant being held three years as a suspected
terrorist had raised money for a terror group or had helped
organize any violence, a federal agent acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   That admission came Wednesday during a bond hearing for Mazen
Al-Najjar, who has been jailed without charges on the basis of
secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The former University of South Florida Arabic instructor is
seeking to be released while he appeals a deportation order. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested him in May 1997
after the order was issued.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before an immigration judge continued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, INS attorney Daniel Vara played a 13-minute
videotape of various gatherings organized by the Islamic Committee
for Palestine as evidence Al-Najjar had consorted with known
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Najjar was an officer in the committee and helped organize
the conferences, some of which were attended by leaders of the
terrorist group Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was compiled from nearly 500 hours of video seized in
1995, but INS agent William D. West was unable to offer any example
of Al-Najjar soliciting money for the Islamic Jihad or advocating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   At one gathering shown on the tape, a Muslim prayer leader
identified the charity as the ''active arm of the Islamic Jihad,''
but Al-Najjar was neither present at, nor organized, that event,
West acknowledged under cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's become clear is that the government has no case against
Mazen Al-Najjar,'' his lawyer, David Cole, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said the government's case was an extension of its focus on
Al-Najjar's brother-in-law, Sami Al-Arian.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Arian incorporated the Islamic Committee for Palestine and
the World and Islam Studies Enterprise, a think tank associated
with the University of South Florida. Al-Najjar's primary work was
with the think tank, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Arian, a legal permanent resident, is free and has remained
in the courtroom after testifying. On Monday, he invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination 99 times.
</P>
<P>
   Over Cole's objections, the INS has presented a series of
photographs taken at think tank conferences in the early 1990s
showing Al-Arian and Al-Najjar seated at a table with suspected
terrorists. One 1991 photo depicted Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who
was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for plotting the 1993
World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cole asked West why Al-Najjar is considered a
security risk but not Al-Arian. West answered that he considered
both to be security threats but Al-Arian has not created any risks
while Al-Najjar has been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   None of the secret evidence against Al-Najjar has been
introduced. The INS showed classified material to Immigration Judge
R. Kevin McHugh in May 1997, prompting him to order Al-Najjar
detained as a national security threat.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge ruled in May that Al-Najjar's civil rights
had been violated and ordered the bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Najjar is one of several immigrants held on secret evidence
nationwide. An Egyptian in New York, a Palestinian in New Jersey
and an Iraqi in California were released after rebutting terrorist
allegations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomat Burleigh Retires  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tired of waiting, career diplomat Peter
Burleigh retired Thursday, his nomination to be U.S. ambassador to
the Philippines tied up for nine months in the Senate over a
whistle-blower at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh was named to the post in Manila by President Clinton
after widely praised service as acting U.N. ambassador during the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a farewell reception last December, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan praised Burleigh's skills, saying ''Peter has done
incredible and remarkable work in the United Nations in a very
difficult period.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anyone who can defuse a tense and difficult
situation ... without ever losing his cool, regardless of the
pressure he is under,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration was unable to negotiate
Burleigh's nomination past the ''hold'' placed on it by Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley blocked Burleigh's assignment to Manila in a standoff
with the State Department over its treatment of Linda Shenwick, of
the U.S. mission to the United Nations. The senator claimed she was
punished for sharing information on U.N. financial irregularities
with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Shenwick remains counselor at the mission.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy is trying to
gain the release of an American, Jeffrey Schilling, of Oakland,
Calif., being held by Abu Sayaf rebels. They have threatened to
behead him if the United States rejects their demands, which are
expected to include the release of several Arab terrorists held in
American prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has ruled out paying ransom or making
any deals with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh took charge of the U.S. mission to the United Nations
in September 1998 after Bill Richardson left to become energy
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   During his year in charge, the United States and Britain bombed
Iraq and NATO bombed Yugoslavia to force a withdrawal of Serb
troops and police accused of atrocities from Kosovo. He also was
involved in negotiating the handover of two Libyan suspects for
trial in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet and spoke out on crises
from East Timor to Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, who now holds the New York job, has spoken up
for Burleigh, saying he had ''the respect, the affection, the
gratitude'' of the entire U.S. Foreign Service and Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the delay in his own confirmation, Holbrooke
quipped: ''When I was released from captivity they took Peter
hostage in my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh submitted his resignation Aug. 1 and his retirement
took effect Thursday, the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's term nearing an end, Senate Republicans hopeful
of recapturing the White House have little motivation to move on
any nominations.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats controlled Congress in the winding down of Ronald
Reagan's second term as president in 1987-88 they also withheld
approval of several nominations.

<HEADLINE> Postal Violence Said To Be a Myth  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Postal workers have gotten a ''bad rap'' from
widespread reports of violence at post offices, says a new report
from an independent commission that concludes the agency is
actually one of the safest places to work in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going postal is a myth, a bad rap, nonsense,'' commission
chairman Joseph Califano said Thursday. ''Postal workers are no
more likely to physically assault, sexually harass or verbally
abuse their co-workers than employees in the national workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ''postal workers are only a third as likely as
those in the national workforce to be victims of homicide'' -- 0.26
per 100,000 versus 0.77 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about postal violence has risen with a series of 29
incidents dating to 1986 in which 54 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to go to one more postal facility and explain
why some father or mother was murdered,'' Postmaster General
William Henderson said of his decision to ask the independent
commission to analyze the problem.
</P>
<P>
   While Califano's group determined that the rate of violence was
actually lower in postal facilities than elsewhere, it did note
that the post office has a high rate of grievances and made
recommendations for reducing labor-management tension.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major findings, we're in absolute agreement with, and will
take steps,'' said Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the suggestions, including incentive pay, will
be brought up in negotiations with the postal service's major labor
unions, and he will take steps to modernize the service's grievance
process.
</P>
<P>
   While the instances of violence in recent years included many
other businesses, in the vernacular, a violent attack in the
workplace became known as ''going postal.''
</P>
<P>
   Califano reported that workers at private postal services are
twice as likely to be murdered on the job than federal postal
workers, and retail clerks are eight times more likely. The highest
murder rate, he noted, was for taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said the past reports about going postal have
caused ''unnecessary apprehension and fear among 900,000 postal
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elcano, former general counsel for the post office, agreed,
commenting that ''what concerned me is the sensationalism that
surrounded the coverage of Postal Service events has done violence
to Postal Service employees, in their view of the security that
they have in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The study surveyed 12,000 postal workers and 3,000 employees in
other jobs around the country and concluded that there is an
unacceptable level of violence in the American workplace. Among the
findings:
</P>
<P>
   --One in 20 workers was physically assaulted on the job in the
past year, 5 percent each for postal workers and others.
</P>
<P>
   --More than one in six people were sexually harassed at work, 14
percent for postal workers, 16 percent in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   --About one-third of workers said they were verbally abused on
the job, 36 percent of postal workers, 33 percent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   --The chance of physical assault by co-workers was 4 percent for
postal employees, 3 percent for others.
</P>
<P>
   --But postal workers were less likely to face physical assault
from outsiders, 0.4 percent versus 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the violent incidents, the post office instituted
programs to prevent repeats, including a zero-tolerance policy for
weapons on postal premises.
</P>
<P>
   The report said those programs should be continued. It also made
other recommendations, including improved screening of job
applicants for potential violence, and improved security by
establishing a communications system for carriers, especially in
high-crime and remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   Califano, a former secretary of Health and Human Services,
currently heads the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University.

<HEADLINE> Federal Panel Backs Off Metro Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal committee has backed off a proposed
radical change in how the government defines urban areas. The plan
would have seen some communities -- and one state -- disappear
statistically.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee still
recommends some changes in how the government compiles data from
the 2000 Census. But the panel no longer is proposing to lump
communities into ''megapolitan'' areas of 1 million or more people,
sticking instead with smaller and more numerous ''metropolitan''
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for New Jersey, which would have become part of
the New York City and Philadelphia ''megapolitan'' areas, and for
towns such as Lawrence and Haverhill, Mass., which would have been
part of a Boston ''megapolitan'' area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It definitely looks like they have taken some of our concerns
to heart, and made some adjustments accordingly,'' said Gaylord
Burke, who promotes Lawrence and Haverhill as executive director of
the Merrimack Valley Planning Commission. ''We were concerned we'd
be totally wiped out, and our identity eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's definition of core metropolitan areas
influences how census information is grouped together, which in
turn helps determine the distribution of federal funds, decisions
by corporations about where to locate and lists of ''best places to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the revised plan, adjacent cities with common commuting
patterns will be ''combined areas.'' But census data still will be
broken down by individual metro area as well, so smaller cities
will continue to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government first defined metropolitan areas in 1949.
Every decade since, it has re-evaluated the definitions.
</P>
<P>
   This time a federally appointed Metropolitan Area Standards
Review Committee proposed replacing ''metropolitan'' areas and with
three types of ''core-based statistical areas'' defined by
population: megapolitan (1 million or more), macropolitan (50,000
to 999,999) and micropolitan (10,000 to 49,999).
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget received hundreds of
comments on the proposals, many of them negative. The review
committee made several changes as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from the committee's final recommendations is
''megapolitan.'' Back is the term ''metropolitan'' to describe
urban areas of 50,000 or more people. Areas with 10,000 to 49,999
people would still be ''micropolitan.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of comment to retain the word
'metropolitan,''' said Colleen Joyce, a geographer for the U.S.
Census Bureau who worked on the revisions. ''People wanted to
retain it to avoid confusion or maintain some consistency through
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pleased with the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and officials in High Point, N.C. -- which proudly
bills itself as ''Furniture Capital of the World'' -- howled that
the original proposal would turn that city into an unnamed subset
of a Greensboro, N.C., metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Under the revised plan, High Point would get equal billing in a
''Greensboro-High Point'' metro area. But it also would be part of
a Greensboro combined area, and that's reason for concern, said
Heather Bischoff, research analyst for the High Point Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted corporate site consultants will evaluate combined
areas, rather than metropolitan areas, when choosing where to build
or relocate and won't see her city.
</P>
<P>
   Public comment on the revised recommendations will be accepted
until Oct. 6. A final decision is expected by year's end and will
be implemented as 2000 Census results are released.

<HEADLINE> Haider Says He May Block Expansion  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Risking more political damage to Austria,
the former leader of the far-right Freedom Party said Thursday he
reserves the right to block European Union expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am the expert on expansion'' of EU membership, Joerg Haider
told reporters in the city of Klagenfurt. ''No moves will be made
in expansion eastward that I do not approve.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he plays no formal role in Austria's government, Haider
wields immense influence with government ministers and members of
Austria's parliament. And that means he could throw a wrench in EU
expansion plans: The 15-member union wants to let former communist
countries join, but such major decisions can be vetoed by just one
dissenting member nation.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the governor of Carinthia province, resigned as Freedom
Party leader in May. His comments were the latest in a series of
controversial utterances that contributed to the EU's February
decision to impose sanctions on Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He has toned down his attacks on the European Union and its
leaders recently as Austria awaits an EU decision on whether to
lift the sanctions. Still, the outspoken politician apparently is
unwilling to remain completely silent -- even at the risk of having
the sanctions continued.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's comments, he most recently criticized Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini as ''antidemocratic'' earlier this
month. Dini reportedly had asked the Austrian government to try to
prevent any further visits by Haider to Italy because of occasional
violent anti-Haider protests by left-wing demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The EU sanctions came after the Freedom Party was sworn in as
part of the Austrian federal government. The party's inclusion
caused an uproar: Previously, Haider and other party members had
praised some aspects of the Nazi era and his party had exploited
anti-foreigner sentiment in its election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Senior EU officials are awaiting a recommendation from an EU
panel on whether to lift sanctions. Haider's comments could
influence the panel's report on whether or not the Freedom Party
and its officials play by democratic rules.
</P>
<P>
   Haider spoke amid an ongoing controversy between the Freedom
Party and its government coalition partner, the conservative
People's Party, over Austria's special envoy for EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Envoy Erhard Busek is a former vice chancellor and ex-head of
the People's Party. He has sharply criticized Freedom Party
officials for demanding that Austria keep the Czech Republic and
Slovenia out of the EU unless those two governments nullify wartime
decrees expelling ethnic Germans of mostly Austrian extraction.
</P>
<P>
   Busek, who also has criticized perceived Freedom Party hostility
toward the EU, said such linkage was counterproductive and
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who heads
the People's Party, said Busek will stay in his post despite
Freedom Party criticism. Senior Freedom Party members subsequently
said they no longer consider Busek a spokesman for their part of
government on EU expansion.

<HEADLINE> Treatment of Scientist Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leaders of three of the nation's most
prestigious scientific organizations are taking issue with the
treatment of fired Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we make no claim as to his innocence or guilt, he
appears to be a victim of unjust treatment,'' the three said in an
open letter Thursday to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Bruce Alberts, president of the
National Academy of Sciences; William A. Wulf, president of the
National Academy of Engineering and Kenneth J. Shine, president of
the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The three organizations are independent research groups
chartered by Congress to provide scientific advice to government.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan-born Lee is waiting to learn if the government will
appeal a judge's order that he be freed on $1 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, has been jailed since his arrest Dec. 10 on 59 counts
alleging he transferred restricted data about nuclear weapons to
unsecure computers and tape at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The three scientists said in their letter to Reno that they were
making their concerns public because previous inquiries about Lee's
treatment had been responded to only by a form letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned that inaccurate and detrimental testimony by
government officials resulted in Dr. Lee needlessly spending eight
months in prison under harsh and questionable conditions of
confinement,'' the scientists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In their earlier letters the three had asked about Lee family
complaints that Lee was being held in solitary confinement, that
restraints had been used on him and that contact with family was
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Reno the scientists contended that ''the
handling of this case reflects poorly on the U.S. justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The concerns that we have expressed and the questions that we
have posed in our letters are identical to those our Committee on
Human Rights regularly poses to foreign governments, some of which
have had the courtesy to respond. Surely we cannot expect less from
our own government.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge James Parker ordered the
government to disclose documents that could help him determine
whether Lee was a target of selective prosecution and ethnic
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis said an area of concern if Lee
is freed on bail is the unrestricted communication allowed between
Lee and his wife, Sylvia, in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, national security is at stake,'' Stamboulidis said,
complaining that the judge's proposed conditions were not strict
enough to protect government secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's proposed release conditions included limits on
communication, travel, home visits and required removal of all
electronic communication devices except for one telephone line from
Lee's home. Lee would have to remain under electronic monitoring
except when being driven by his lawyers to court or the lab to work
on his defense. His mail also would be inspected.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 196; Nasdaq Adds 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- High-tech and financial issues pushed stocks
broadly higher today, helping the market recover from a blue-chip
selloff a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 195.70 at 11,298.71, more than wiping out a
112-point loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.14 at 1521.73 and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 79.23 at 4,183.04.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expressed surprised at Thursday's surge in the
markets. Late August, especially the days leading up to the Labor
Day weekend, are traditionally a slow time for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. 1, you're seeing technology stocks strengthen: Intel, Dell
and Microsoft are all up,'' said Greg Nie, senior vice president
for technical research at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''The
Dow is also being helped in particular by J.P. Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was trading up $14.13 at $165.19. Financial stocks were
in favor Thursday after Wednesday's announcement that Credit Suisse
First Boston planned to buy Donald Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette for $11.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $1.94 to $75.44; Dell climbed $3.50 to $43.44; and
Microsoft was up 93.8 cents at $70.94. Gateway jumped $3.43 to
$69.28.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just optimism that we're looking at a higher market in
the fall and driven by the idea that the Fed is likely to not
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates
intermittently for the last year as part of a strategy to cool down
the economy. Last week, it passed on a chance to hike interest
rates and is not expected to consider the issue again until after
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks might have been even higher Thursday if not for some
disappointing retail sales numbers, which would seem to confirm
analysts' suspicions that second-half consumer spending is on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers re-entered the market Thursday after blue chips tumbled
Wednesda in response to a warning of disappointing second-half
profits at appliance maker Whirlpool. The news alarmed investors
and pulled other industrial stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came 657.9 million shares, up
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.46 to 537.79.

<HEADLINE> Cuba School To Treat Elian the Same  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- Schoolmates of Elian Gonzalez have been
encouraged to treat the 6-year-old survivor of a shipwreck and the
world's most publicized custody battle ''just like anybody else''
when he starts the second grade Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After months spent recovering from his ordeal in the company of
friends and relatives and out of the limelight, Elian is expected
to make his public reappearance when he -- and 2.2 million other
Cuban students -- return to classes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't be hanging over all over him. The poor kid has had a lot
of problems, and everything should be as normal as possible for him
now,'' said Luanda Leon, recounting advice given at a meeting this
week among teachers and parents of Elian's 27 new classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Leon's 7-year-old son, Ariel Cisneros, will be in Elian's
classroom at the high-ceilinged old school in the coastal city of
Cardenas, about 90 miles east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   When Elian walks into school, it will probably be without the
hordes of reporters, cameramen and photographers who followed his
every move in the United States for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said all along that they would fight to prevent
that kind of massive media coverage of the boy. Elian, who survived
when his mother drowned at sea in an attempt to reach the United
States, was returned to Cuba in June following a protracted custody
dispute between his father and relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family have been kept away from the media since
shortly after their homecoming. They reportedly have been living at
a Havana boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been able to enjoy some vacations in privacy and with his
family, and now he, like millions of Cuban school children, is
preparing to go back to school,'' Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
Roque said Thursday in answer to reporters' questions about the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I can say that things have gone well for Elian
Gonzalez,'' Perez Roque said. ''We think we have been successful at
preserving the greatest intimacy possible for this family that has
suffered so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Snippets of video have been broadcast occasionally on state-run
television showing Elian playing with friends, riding in a small
boat with his father and other relatives and swimming in a pool and
among dolphins near an undisclosed beach location. Making up lost
schoolwork he needed to graduate from first grade this summer,
Elian was seen practicing cursive letters on a blackboard and in a
composition book.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Elian's return to Cuba predicted that Fidel Castro
would parade the boy around as a poster boy for communism. The
Cuban leader appears to have made a conscious decision not to give
his political enemies any ammunition to use against him and his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Castro met the boy whose international custody battle
absorbed the island nation, no photographs of the historic meeting
were published and no videotaped images were shown.
</P>
<P>
   Workmen this week spruced up the Marcelo Salado school, named
after a revolutionary youth leader. They put in new toilets and
replaced bricks in the building, which holds about 900 students.
</P>
<P>
   The school will have water coolers, TV sets and videocassette
recorders in every other classroom -- a wealth of equipment found in
some, but not all, Cuban grade schools.
</P>
<P>
   Elian himself was nowhere in sight this week, and plainclothes
guards stood outside his family's home to shoo away reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another Elian here, explains Yolaine Betancourt:
her 7-year-old son, Elian Betancourt, who was playing with toy cars
on the floor of a neighbor's home in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for this other little Elian not to make a fuss
the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very excited about meeting him,'' Betancourt said of her
son's famous namesake. ''My son's going to look at him like
something out of this world!''

<HEADLINE> Albright Calls on Myanmar Gov't.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged
Myanmar's military government Thursday to immediately allow
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to travel outside the capital on
a political organizing trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am appalled at the actions of the Burmese regime in denying
Suu Kyi the freedom to travel in her own country,'' Albright said
in a statement. ''Freedom of movement and freedom of speech are
fundamental, internationally recognized human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, 55, the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her
pro-democracy campaign in Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- was
stopped along with 14 members of her party on Aug. 24 as they
attempted to travel outside the capital, Yangon, to carry out
political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   They have been stranded in the Yangon suburb of Dala for a week,
camping out in their two vehicles and refusing to return to the
capital until Suu Kyi accomplishes her work in Dala.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Suu Kyi has been stranded in deplorable conditions,
Albright said, ''her voice will not be silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the United States has joined U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and other nations to promote a productive dialogue
between the military government and Suu Kyi's National League for
Democracy.

<HEADLINE> American Jailed in Peru Being Moved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Lori Berenson, the American woman jailed for
treason in Peru, is being moved to a prison in the Peruvian
capital, local television reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Television images broadcast by Peruvian channel Cable Television
News showed a police motorcade escorting a van carrying Berenson to
an airport in the southern city of Arequipa, 475 miles southeast of
Lima, where she has been serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes three days after Peru's top military court
announced it had overturned the sentence imposed on Berenson,
paving the way for a new trial in civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old was found guilty of treason by a secret military
tribunal in January 1996, accused of helping the rebel Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Since being convicted four years ago, Berenson has been held in
two prisons. In 1998, she was moved from the a high mountain jail
cell to a prison in Arequipa after complaining of harsh prison
conditions and poor treatment by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities gave no indication where she was being transferred
to in Lima. The report said Berenson was being moved in the custody
of National Police and would board a commercial flight to Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Since her case is now in the hands of the civilian courts, it
was anticipated she would be taken to a maximum security wing of
the Chorillos women's prison in Lima. The report contradicted a
statement by Peru's Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante earlier
this week who said Berenson was already in Lima.

<HEADLINE> Concord Pilot Conversation Released  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The first word that something had gone terribly
wrong with the Concorde came from the control tower when the plane
was in the air, according to a preliminary report made public
Thursday by investigators probing the fiery crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Concorde zero ... 4590, You have flames. You have flames
behind you,'' the control tower said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:43 p.m. on July 25. Air France flight 4590, a sleek
supersonic Concorde, had just lifted its needle nose toward the
heavens after roaring down the runway at breathtaking speed.
</P>
<P>
   Seven seconds after the message from the control tower at
Charles de Gaulle airport, the chief navigator confirmed,
''Breakdown eng... breakdown engine two.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cut engine two,'' he said, four seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing. But
pilot Christian Marty could be heard saying: ''Too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The chilling seconds -- during which a vacation jaunt to America
by a group of German tourists was transformed into a tragedy -- were
resurrected in five minutes of cockpit conversation posted on the
Internet on Thursday. They were part of a highly technical 75-page
preliminary report by France's Accident and Inquiry Office, the
investigators probing the crash.
</P>
<P>
   All 109 passengers and crew died when the Concorde, spewing
flames, dove into a hotel near the airport. Four people were killed
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first crash in the Concorde's 24 years of commercial
flying history. The Concorde's airworthiness certification was
withdrawn by France and Britain -- the only countries which operate
the 12 remaining planes -- in early August.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident and Inquiry Office has said it believes a tire
blowout was at the origin of a ''catastrophic chain of events''
that sent the Concorde plummeting to the ground, its left wing
afire.
</P>
<P>
   However, the cockpit conversation indicates that it was the
control tower which first alerted the crew to real trouble. There
was no indication from the recordings that the crew was aware a
tire had been gashed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's burning badly, and I'm not sure it's coming from the
engine,'' said someone in the control tower. ''Gong'' sounds were
periodically recorded inside the plane.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:43 and 31 seconds -- 18 seconds after the announcement of
flames -- the control tower coolly advised: ''So, at your
convenience, you have priority to land.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were prepared to meet the plane on Runway 26 of
Charles de Gaulle, where the journey began. However, the co-pilot
said ''Le Bourg,'' referring to nearby Bourget Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Marty was heard to say, ''Too late.'' It was 4:44 and 16
seconds, near the close of a chillingly cool exchange that on paper
gives little indication the end was near.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident and Inquiry Office has said a 16-inch piece of
metal found on the runway shoulder -- and unlikely to have belonged
to the Concorde -- gashed the tire. High-speed debris from the tire
then likely gouged the fuel tanks contained within the plane's
delta-shaped wings.
</P>
<P>
   The report included a photograph of a badly damaged Goodyear
tire. It showed a nine-pound tire part with a nearly 13-inch gash.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident and Inquiry Office has not officially strung
together the chain of events in the crash, which also included two
failed motors and a problem with the landing gear. Struggles to get
the landing gear up could be heard in the cockpit conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference earlier this month, Accident and
Inquiry Office chief investigator Paul-Louis Arslanian stressed the
speed with which the burst tire crippled the Concorde. It was his
office that recommended that airworthiness certification be
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had proof that you can have a catastrophic chain of events
in a very short lapse of time and we saw that the crew could do
nothing,'' Arslanian said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report made clear that no conclusions or analysis
were to be drawn from the work so far and that ''certain points
could evolve.'' The final report is not due out for at least a
year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Accusses Suu Kyi of Plot  </HEADLINE>
By AYE AYE WIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
roadside standoff with Myanmar authorities was ''a
well-orchestrated plan'' to coincide with the coming U.N. summit
and attract world attention, the country's military government
charged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, 55, the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her
pro-democracy campaign in Myanmar, was stopped along with 14
members of her party on Aug. 24 as they attempted to travel outside
the capital, Yangon, to carry out political organizing. They have
been stranded in the Yangon suburb of Dala for a week, camping out
in their two vehicles and refusing to return to the capital until
Suu Kyi accomplishes her work in Dala.
</P>
<P>
   It was Suu Kyi's first attempt to travel outside the city since
two years ago, when the government blocked four such tries.
</P>
<P>
   The Myanmar government, in a statement issued Thursday, accused
Suu Kyi of staging the standoff in advance of next week's U.N.
Millennium Summit, expected to draw hundreds of world leaders to
New York. It charged that she was disrupting what it called a
transition toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action is seen as a deliberate move to engage in the act
of confrontation with the Government and to attract world attention
from the real 'flashpoints' elsewhere in the world,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday blasted
the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, for its treatment
of Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am appalled at the actions of the Burmese regime in denying
Suu Kyi the freedom to travel in her own country,'' Albright said
in a statement. ''Freedom of movement and freedom of speech are
fundamental, internationally recognized human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi is the daughter of the country's late independence
leader, Gen. Aung San. She has led Myanmar's opposition movement
since 1988, when the military smashed mass pro-democracy
demonstrations and asserted its authoritarian rule. She was held
under house arrest from 1989 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The military held a general election in 1990 but refused to
allow parliament to convene after Suu Kyi's National League for
Democracy won a landslide victory. Since then, her party members
have been arrested repeatedly and have suffered harassment from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The military junta, already sanctioned by many Western nations
for its poor human rights record, has drawn strong criticism from
around the world for stopping Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   The government claims she has less support inside the country
than outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Myanmar with their usual low level of interest
in party politics have been indifferent to the so-called 'War of
Endurance' orchestrated by the NLD,'' the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   True public sentiment is difficult to gauge because of
widespread fear of government retaliation for speaking out publicly
on political matters. But universities, which the government fears
are potential hotbeds of unrest, have been quiet.
</P>
<P>
   A history student told The Associated Press on Wednesday that a
wildly popular but illegal lottery is of more interest to students
than the Dala standoff. And a Dala resident who comes to Yangon
every day to sell beans said most people in Dala are poor and more
concerned with eking out a living than with the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   A trishaw driver in Dala said Thursday -- with apparent irony --
that the town's residents hope Suu Kyi stays there because since
her arrival, they have had electricity every day. A nationwide
shortage of electricity has cut daily power to the suburbs, but
it's been turned on in Dala, apparently for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to the standoff scene Thursday morning described it as
quiet, with security personnel deployed discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   Barbed wire barricades had been removed from where they were
earlier placed on the main road. Most of the security forces at the
scene were in plainclothes, including one who could be seen taking
down the license plate numbers of passing cars.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Suu Kyi tried to travel outside Yangon, in August
1998, she stayed in her vehicle for 13 days before returning home
for health reasons.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 196; Nasdaq Adds 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- High-tech and financial issues pushed stocks
broadly higher Thursday despite weak retail sales in August.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 195.70 at 11,298.71, more than wiping out
a 112-point loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 19.99 at 1522.58 and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 89.01 at 4192.82.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expressed surprised at Thursday's surge. Late
August, especially the days leading up to the Labor Day weekend,
are traditionally a slow time for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. 1, you're seeing technology stocks strengthen: Intel, Dell
and Microsoft are all up,'' said Greg Nie, senior vice president
for technical research at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''The
Dow is also being helped in particular by J.P. Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was trading up $14.13 at $165.19. Financial stocks were
in favor Thursday after Wednesday's announcement that Credit Suisse
First Boston planned to buy Donald Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette for $11.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $1.88 to $75.38; Dell climbed $3.94 to $43.88; and
Microsoft was up 43.8 cents at $70.44. Gateway jumped $3.78 to
$69.63.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks might have been even higher Thursday if not for some
disappointing retail sales numbers, which would seem to confirm
analysts' suspicions that second-half consumer spending is on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Gap Inc. were down 12.5 percent at $22.38 by
midafternoon, a day after the casual clothing retailer reported a
14 percent decline in same-store sales for August.
</P>
<P>
   The news was better at Sears and Wal-Mart. But most department
stores, including J.C. Penney Co. Inc., continued to flail.
Dillards saw its same-store sales -- those from stores open at least
a year -- drop by 6 percent, while total sales declined by the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chips tumbled Wednesday after appliance maker Whirlpool
Corp. warned of disappointing second-half profits.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were more positive on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just optimism that we're looking at a higher market in
the fall and driven by the idea that the Fed is likely to not
increase interest rates,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates
intermittently for the last year as part of a strategy to cool down
the economy. Last week, it passed on a chance to hike interest
rates and is not expected to consider the issue again until after
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 784.4 million shares, up
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.63 to 537.96.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Kenyans Mourn Priest  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS TOMLINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOLGORIAN, Kenya (AP) -- Amid howls and screams of thousands of
mourners, the Rev. John Kaiser was buried Thursday in front of the
roughhewn mission church the Minnesota native had built by hand for
the people of western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   With a spectacular view of the Serengeti plain and a few dozen
Maasai warriors leaning on their spears and watching from a
distance, his congregation mourned the loss of the man who fought
not only for their souls, but also for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very badly offended because he has always assisted my
children. He was always very helpful to the congregation,'' said
Jane Rose Tata, one of Kaiser's parishioners in Lolgorian, 155
miles northwest of Nairobi. ''Because of that we came to love him
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser was shot and killed last week in what many politicians
and human rights activists have called a political assassination.
He was found along a highway with a gunshot to the head, and police
said it was obvious someone tried to make it look like a suicide
but failed. His valuables were untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser had made enemies with his human rights work. Last year he
was threatened with deportation and in recent weeks he'd received
numerous death threats, according to his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Local media reports said documents found on his body linked two
unidentified Kenyan Cabinet ministers to violent clashes that
coincided with national elections. Kaiser intended to hand the
documents over to a government commission looking into the
fighting, which took place in the Rift Valley Province between 1992
and 1997, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, several young women in his parish had come
to him complaining of having been raped by another Cabinet minister
when they were in their early teens, said the Rev. James Juma,
whose church was in the next village.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser introduced the women to the Kenyan Federation of Women
Lawyers, who brought a private prosecution in June against Julius
Sunkuli, a minister in the president's office. The judge hearing
the case has still not decided whether or not to allow the case to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunkuli has repeatedly denied the charges, and President Daniel
arap Moi has called for the judge to drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women who claimed to have given birth to two of
Sunkuli's children became hysterical during the funeral mass
Thursday morning. She threw herself on Kaiser's coffin and later
fainted. She refused to speak to anyone except her sister,
explaining that she was frightened by the slaying. After she
recovered, she quietly placed a wreath on Kaiser's grave once it
was filled.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has dispatched three FBI agents to work
alongside Kenyan police. A fourth agent attached to the U.S.
Embassy is also in the investigation team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Father Kaiser always loved the truth,'' said Bishop Joseph
Mairura, who studied under Kaiser when he taught seminary.
''Because he witnessed the truth, and some powerful people feared
the truth, he was killed. Instead of repenting, they killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Encased in a teak and brass coffin with a glass lid, Kaiser was
dressed in robes with a crucifix made of Maasai beads around his
neck. His grave was just outside the partially completed chapel he
had built from bricks, pole beams and corrugated tin. While the
outer structure was complete, it was far from finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that those who hate Father Kaiser are now rejoicing
his death,'' said Romulus Ochieng, a seminarian who had lived at
the mission with Kaiser since 1995. ''But those who are left here
will leave their destiny to the hand of God and continue his
work.''

<HEADLINE> Surgeon claims company stole idea for medical use of Gore-Tex  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) - A Delaware company stole a Denver surgeon's idea
to use a waterproof fabric to replace injured blood vessels, the
surgeon claims in a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Kelly, the former chief of vascular surgery at Denver
Health Medical Center, has asked a federal court to award him all
profits W.L. Gore &AMP; Associates has earned from medical uses of
Gore-Tex since 1972, when Kelly successfully implanted a Gore-Tex
blood vessel into a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also has filed complaints against New Jersey-based medical
products manufacturer C.R. Bard Inc. and Arizona surgeon David
Goldfarb for laying claim to his invention.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, now in private practice in Englewood, collaborated with
W.L. Gore &AMP; Associates in the early 1970s to test Gore-Tex tubes as
a replacement for blood vessels clogged by fatty tissue or damaged
by surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Vascular grafts have grown to a $200 million industry worldwide,
and Gore-Tex products account for a significant portion of the
market, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's lawsuit said W.L. Gore and company official Peter Cooper
stopped cooperating with his research in 1973. Kelly said he
learned in 1999 of a patent dispute between W.L. Gore and C.R. Bard
over the artifical blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had brought in Goldfarb to further Kelly's research.
Goldfarb won a patent for the invention, and C.R. Bard acquired
rights to Goldfarb's patent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at W.L Gore declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Glass, a C.R. Bard spokeswoman, said company officials had
just heard of the lawsuit on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe Dr. Kelly's allegations against C.R. Bard are
without merit, and we will vigorously defend our position in this
matter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Kelly said he handed over detailed notes of his
research on artificial blood vessels to W.L Gore without knowing
the company had patented the technology as its own.
</P>
<P>
   W.L. Gore identified Cooper as the inventor of the technology in
its patent application, Kelly's lawsuit said. The lawsuit also said
W.L. Gore shared results of Kelly's research with Goldfarb, who
sold his patent rights to a corporation later acquired by Bard.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office discovered Goldfarb
and Cooper were filing to patent the same technology, the
applications were held up and C.R. Bard and W.L. Gore entered into
a licensing agreement.

<HEADLINE> U.S to Russia: Free Businessman  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting a Russian accusation of meddling,
the State Department angrily said prosecutors had no case against a
jailed American businessman and he should be freed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''We call them the way we see them,'' spokesman Richard Boucher
said Thursday, declining to withhold judgment on Edmond Pope, who
was arrested in Moscow in April on charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher also rejected claims in Moscow that Pope, who has
suffered from bone cancer, is in good health.
</P>
<P>
   The case is generating tension between the United States and
Russia, and President Clinton may take it up with Russian President
Vladimir Putin when they meet next week during the Millennium
Summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Federal Security Service alleges that Pope illegally
bought plans for a high-tech submarine torpedo. Pope, who denies
the charges, faces 20 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Pope's wife, Cheryl, ''has just been in Russia,'' Boucher said.
''She saw her husband, and his health, according to her and
according to others, has seriously declined while he's been
incarcerated.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian physician has examined Pope in prison. Russian
authorities have refused to permit an American doctor to see the
54-year-old American.
</P>
<P>
   After a steady stream of critical U.S. statements, the Russian
foreign ministry on Thursday complained U.S. officials were trying
''to substitute for investigative and judicial organs'' in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attempts to exert pressure on the investigative and
judicial organs do not bring honor to the American side, which
proclaims the rule of law as its main principle,'' the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to U.S. implications that the Pope case could impel
the United States to discourage American businessmen from going to
Russia, the ministry said ''the State Department's hints about
tying the Pope issue with prospects for developing Russian-American
trade and economic ties provoke the most serious concern.''
</P>
<P>
   A Moscow court said on Wednesday that it would hear Pope's
appeal for release from prison on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had not seen the statement, Boucher nonetheless
assailed Russia's stand and said ''first of all, the Russian
government bears the responsibility for maintaining the health and
welfare of detained American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. spokesman said if the Russian authorities believe Pope
is healthy ''they should allow us medical access.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the case itself, Boucher said ''we have seen no evidence
that Mr. Pope violated any Russian laws. We're both disturbed and
concerned that he remains in custody, and we do think that they
should release Mr. Pope and allow him to return home.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Shell Rebel Band  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops conducted so-called
''mopping-up'' operations in several regions of Chechnya on
Thursday, searching for suspected rebels, while Russian helicopters
pounded Chechen roads.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have sealed off the southwestern town of Urus-Martan
for most of the week, and they fanned out Thursday in Bachi-Yurt,
12 miles southeast of the capital Grozny, and Chernorechye, on
Grozny's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Russian mayor of Grozny, Supyan Mokhchayev, said that
more than 40 suspected rebels were detained in Chernorechye, where
about 10,000 people are living, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Two rebels were killed when Russian artillery shelled what the
military claimed was a band of Chechen rebels on the border between
Chechnya and the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, the
military said. The casualty figure was impossible to verify.
</P>
<P>
   The group of rebels, said to number about 15, was spotted
Wednesday by a reconnaissance patrol near Bachi-Yurt. Russian
troops called in strikes by artillery and heavy rocket launchers,
which went on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters also bombed the road leading from Shali, southeast
of Grozny, to nearby Makhkety on Thursday. Soldiers manning a
checkpoint outside Makhkety said that rebels had shelled a Russian
helicopter earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Russian airplanes and helicopters flew more than 30
combat missions over the past 24 hours, the military said. Russian
troops have relied on their attack jets and heavy guns, while the
Chechen fighters have turned to ambushes, sniping and mines to
inflict casualties on the Russians even in areas they nominally
control.
</P>
<P>
   Four Russian soldiers were injured Wednesday, one of them
critically, when their armored vehicle ran over a mine in Grozny,
officials said. In the past 24 hours, four explosive devices were
disarmed in Grozny, and three more along roads elsewhere in the
region, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Federal Security Service said it had arrested three
Turkish citizens who allegedly entered the country illegally from
neighboring Georgia to fight for the rebels. The three, identified
as Akhmed Gumuzemer, Ilyas Kush, and Molla Khasan Ildrymer, told
investigators that they had come to Russia looking for work, a
spokesman for the service said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from the North Caucasus town of Vladikavkaz helped the
Turks to enter Russia, the security service contended. It said that
the woman had previously been kidnapped and held captive in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Gen. Valery Manilov, chief of the General Staff, said
that 15 Russian soldiers had been killed and 50 more wounded over
the past week. However, independent observers contend that the
armed forces greatly underestimate Russian losses.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen independence fighters drove out Russian troops in a
1994-96 war. Russian troops re-entered the region last year after
militants based there crossed over into Dagestan and raided several
villages, and after 300 people died in apartment bombings that the
government blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Treat Gays the Same  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The German government said Thursday that
homosexuality was no reason to reduce a soldier's status or limit
his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The issue had arisen here in the case of an officer who was
reassigned from platoon leader to an office job after a background
check revealed he is gay. He filed suit in Germany's Constitutional
Court last year against the move, and in April the Defense Ministry
said he would get his old job back.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to a question by the parliament faction of the
Party of Democratic Socialism, the government reaffirmed that
homosexuality was no ''separate entry criterion'' for military
service. The Defense Ministry will also make it clear in army
regulations the consequences of discrimination based on sexual
orientation, and offer advice for leaders in a brochure on dealing
with gay troops in the army.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti's Ex-Wife Breaks Silence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Luciano Pavarotti's ex-wife has broken her
vow of silence regarding the opera star -- but only to fault him for
complaining publicly about alimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has always needed a scapegoat. For 40 years I was his
safety valve; he obviously hasn't found a new one,'' Adua Veroni,
Pavarotti's former wife and manager, was quoted as telling Milan's
Corriere della Sera daily on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Veroni, who split with Pavarotti in 1996, was responding to the
tenor's recent public accusations that Veroni was trying to destroy
him financially.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti, now 65, fell in love with his secretary, Nicoletta
Mantovani, now 29, in the mid-1990s. The break-up of his 35-year
marriage followed in 1996, and a long legal battle over alimony
ensued.

<HEADLINE> China Head Sympathized at Tiananmen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a rare admission for a Chinese communist
leader, President Jiang Zemin says he sympathized with the passions
for freedom and democracy that drove students into Tiananmen Square
11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang recalled his own days as a student protester against
Japan's occupation of China in the 1940s in an interview with CBS'
''60 Minutes.'' The comparison was brought up by correspondent Mike
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 1989 disturbances we truly understood the passion of
students who were calling for greater democracy and freedom. In
fact, we have always been working to improve our system of
democracy,'' Jiang said, according to a transcript of the interview
to be broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His comments were the most sympathetic portrayal of the student
movement by a senior Chinese leader since the leadership ordered
tanks and troops to oust the demonstrators. Hundreds, if not
thousands, died in the military assault on June 3-4, 1989. The
Chinese government has never given a credible account.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang reverted to the party line, however, in defending the
crackdown. He accused people he did not identify of trying to ''use
the students to overthrow the government under the pretext of
democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he felt inspired by the courage of the lone
protester who faced down a tank during the assault, Jiang said ''we
fully respect every citizen's right to freely express his wishes
and desires.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I do not favor any flagrant opposition to government
actions during an emergency,'' Jiang said. ''The tank stopped and
did not run the young man down.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''60 Minutes'' interview was conducted at the Chinese
leadership retreat at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, a first for
Western television.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is due in New York next week to attend a U.N. summit.
Polite but at times feisty, Jiang said he agreed to the interview
to underscore his government's desire to work with the United
States -- even in the aftermath of the U.S. bombing of China's
embassy in Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the United States' state-of-the-art military technology,
China cannot accept Washington's explanations that the bombing was
a mistake, he said. He said he told President Clinton that they
will never agree on this.
</P>
<P>
   ''The identification marks of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
were too clear for people to miss. So why has there been such an
incident? It is still a question. But we have decided to look
forward, to improve China-U.S. relations,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also denied that the Wen Ho Lee, the ethnic Chinese
scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets from a U.S.
government lab, was a spy for China.
</P>
<P>
   He turned aside U.S. criticisms of communist authoritarian
one-party rule, saying that Americans find it hard to believe
Chinese support their government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why must we have opposition parties? You are trying to apply
American values and the American political system to the whole
world,'' Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Designates Bioterrorism Antidote  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If bioterrorists ever attack the United States
with anthrax, the antibiotic Cipro will be the first line of
defense for civilians who breathe the deadly bacteria, the
government decided Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Bayer Corp.'s popular
antibiotic will help protect people exposed to inhaled anthrax from
becoming infected and dying -- if they take it quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Cipro, known chemically as ciprofloxacin, has been sold for 13
years to treat a variety of infections, and many experts long
believed it would fight anthrax, too.
</P>
<P>
   But FDA's formal approval of Cipro Thursday makes it the
nation's first medication specifically designated for use after
bioterrorism, a sign federal health officials have begun taking the
threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts have warned for several years that the
nation is unprepared for the growing risk of bioterrorism, the
release of deadly bacteria or viruses. Germs are the ultimate sneak
attack: Unlike with bombings or chemical spills, no one would know
an attack had happened until sick people began arriving at
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a theoretical risk. In 1985, a cult sickened 750
Oregonians by tainting salad bars with the food-poisoning germ
salmonella. Experts say Japanese doomsday cultists tried but failed
to release botulism toxin and anthrax in Tokyo in 1995, before they
released nerve gas into a subway, killing 12 people and sickening
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a spore-forming bacteria found in soil. When it is
aerosolized and inhaled, it becomes incredibly deadly. It is of
particular concern because it has been manufactured as a biological
weapon by at least three nations, Russia, Iraq and Iran. Just a few
pounds of spores released into air conditioning units or sprayed
over a crowd could infect thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of inhaled anthrax victims die within days if
they go untreated. To be most effective, Cipro should be taken
within hours of anthrax exposure, said FDA antibiotic chief Dr.
Gary Chikami. Once symptoms -- fever, chills, rash and respiratory
congestion -- appear, little can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's approval ''is a welcome step forward'' because for the
first time it sets the proper Cipro dose for both adults and
children, said Michael Osterholm of the Infection Control Advisory
Network, who advises the government on bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But Osterholm complained that the nation still spends far too
little readying for bioterrorism, compared with billions spent
against missile attacks and other threats now considered less
likely thanks to technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services is spending $278
million this fiscal year on bioterrorism preparedness. That
includes stockpiling enough Cipro for 5 million treatments.
Osterholm would not reveal how much already is stockpiled, but
said, ''we've got a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to test Cipro's effectiveness in people
suffering inhaled anthrax, so the FDA based its approval largely on
a study of monkeys, who suffer anthrax in almost the same way that
people do. Nine out of 10 untreated monkeys died after inhaling
anthrax; only one out of nine Cipro-treated monkeys died.
</P>
<P>
   Adults would take 500 milligrams of Cipro orally twice a day for
60 days after anthrax exposure; children would take it for as long
but at doses proportional to their weight.

<HEADLINE> Former lawyer pleads no contest to embezzlement charge  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Former lawyer and federal prosecutor F.
Mac Buckley pleaded no contest Thursday to first-degree larceny in
the theft of $145,000 from two of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Herbert C. Carlson said he would seek prison time for
Buckley, who is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Patrick Clifford
on Nov. 8. Carlson did not say how much prison time he would
recommend to the judge. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, a one-time boxing coach who often volunteered his time
for poor children, declined to comment as he left Hartford Superior
Court flanked by family members.
</P>
<P>
   One of his daughters put her hands over camera lenses and said
the family needed privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley entered a written plea of nolo contendere, meaning he
won't contest the charge. Clifford then found him guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain was unusual because Carlson did not say what
his recommended sentence would be. Plea agreements usually include
proposed sentences, so defendants can decide whether to accept
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will include a recommendation for actual incarceration,''
Carlson said. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford continued Buckley's bond at $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 58, has been under house arrest and receiving treatment
for bipolar disorder since he returned in April 1999 from a
still-unexplained, seven-week disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   He vanished March 1, 1999, after leaving his Marlborough home
for a client's sentencing in U.S. District Court in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's family initially was worried that he was the victim of
foul play. But state police soon learned that some of Buckley's
clients were missing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley was spotted during the disappearance at a cemetery in
upstate New York where his father is buried. He also was seen at a
jewelry shop in Tennessee, where he used a credit card to buy a
$1,500 bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   The larceny charge was related to the embezzlement of nearly
$145,000 from David and Sharon Fracchia of Hebron. An arrest
warrant affidavit alleges Buckley forged the couple's signatures on
a check and converted the money for his own use.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley had represented the Fracchias in a wrongful death
lawsuit in the early 1990s after their daughter was killed by a
drunken driver. The couple won more than $580,000 in the case,
which they let Buckley invest and control.
</P>
<P>
   A short time after his arrest, Buckley repaid the Fracchias more
than $300,000, and the couple dropped a civil lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, however, faces several other lawsuits by former clients
who accuse him of taking their money and performing little or no
legal services in return. Those lawsuits were put on hold until the
criminal case was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley last year resigned from the practice of law and promised
never to reapply for admission to the Connecticut Bar.

<HEADLINE> Social Sec. Numbers To Be Concealed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to better protect people's privacy,
Social Security numbers will no longer be visible through envelope
windows of benefits checks mailed to more than 14 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department said Thursday that the change will begin
with September payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''By removing Social Security numbers from the window of the
mailings of Social Security checks, we will help safeguard the
privacy of millions of Americans,'' Gary Gensler, Treasury's under
secretary for domestic finance, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury's Financial Management Service, which issues the
checks, will use check numbers rather than Social Security numbers
to identify and retrieve payments that are ineligible for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 53 million people receiving Social Security benefits
get them electronically, a Treasury spokesman said. That offers a
safe and secure means of payment, Treasury said.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security numbers have become both a virtual national ID
and a powerful tool for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of Social Security numbers can give people
with dishonest intentions easy access to others' personal records,
including financial and medical data, or help criminals assume
another person's identity to obtain credit or government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, more than one million ineligible Social Security
checks valuing $620 million were removed from mailings, Treasury
said.

<HEADLINE> Rick Lazio raising far more funds than rival Hillary Rodham Clinton </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - For the past two months, Republican Rick
Lazio has been outpacing Hillary Rodham Clinton's fund-raising
efforts at better than a 3-to-1 clip.
</P>
<P>
   In a report for the Federal Election Commission, the Long Island
congressman said Thursday he had raised $10.7 million during July
and August, spent almost $6.7 million and still had more than $10.2
million on hand for his quest to win a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign said it raised $3.3 million during the
period, spent $3.1 million and had $7.1 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The reports detail only hard-money contributions, which are
limited to $2,000 from each individual donor. The Clinton campaign
has also been aggressively raising unlimited soft-money
contributions to the Democratic Party - money that can be used for
ads attacking or boosting a candidate as long as those ads don't
advocate voting one way or the other. A recent Hollywood Democratic
fund-raiser brought about $1 million in such funds.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has shied away from soft money fund raising thus far, but
that has not stopped anti-Clinton groups from doing such
fund-raisers for his benefit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the New York
Senate race has become the most expensive in the nation, with $49.2
million raised by Clinton, Lazio and New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who withdrew from the race earlier this year. The figure
does not include the new funds.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this year, the nation's most expensive Senate race, at
$43.2 million, had been the 1994 California campaign in which
Democratic incumbent Diane Feinstein defeated Republican Michael
Huffington.

<HEADLINE> Diana Anniversary Marked Quietly  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- On the third anniversary of Princess Diana's
death, her sons remembered her in private, far from the gates of
Kensington Palace, where a devoted core of admirers gathered
Thursday with flowers, candles and an impromptu religious service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We come each year because she was human,'' said Dottie
O'Connell, 63, from Buckinghamshire in southern England. ''She
touched people and made them feel special. She sat with children
who were dying and held their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   There were prayers at Westminster Abbey, where Diana's funeral
service took place a week after her death. Memorial displays were
arranged at Harrods, the London department store owned by Mohamed
Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died with Diana. And in Paris, admirers
stopped at the Flame of Liberty, the unofficial shrine above the
traffic tunnel where Diana died in a car crash on Aug. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Prince Harry, 15, was with Prince Charles at Balmoral, the
royal estate in the Scottish Highlands. And Prince William, 18,
left for Belize right after graduation from Eton, beginning a year
of work and travel before starting college.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, spent the anniversary quietly at
Althorp, the Spencer family home where Diana was buried and where
the earl created an exhibition in her memory. The display, open for
two months each summer, was closed for the season on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Flame of Liberty in Paris, a Greek visitor crossed
himself, an Italian family prayed silently and a Polish woman
placed a bouquet of baby pink roses at the base of the flame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our queen of hearts will always be remembered,'' said Jean
Grayden of Birmingham, England, who tucked a note under a candle.
''Let them rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors craned their necks to get a glimpse of the narrow
tunnel where Diana, Dodi and driver Henri Paul died when their
Mercedes slammed into a pillar.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the remembrances, there were legal developments as well. In
Washington, the senior Al Fayed sued the U.S. government Thursday
for all information it has on the fatal accident, asking for
documents, photographs and tapes from the CIA, the National
Security Agency and other government departments.
</P>
<P>
   Mark S. Zaid, Al Fayed' lawyer said, the government has 30 days
to reply. Zaid filed the suit in federal district court under the
Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people visit the Paris crash site each year, just
as in London people regularly stop at the wrought-iron gates in
front of the princess's former home, posing for snapshots or
leaving flowers.
</P>
<P>
   For those most devoted to her in life, the princess hardly seems
to have gone.
</P>
<P>
   Londoner Margaret Tyler, 56, has turned a room in her house into
a shrine, with stained-glass windows featuring the princess and
Kensington Palace. Its carpeting comes from a hotel where royal
staff parties were held. She believes Diana once walked on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regular visitors bring me more memorabilia. I have magazines,
cups and lots of photographs,'' said Tyler, who often spent her
days off at Diana's public engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kain was one of a small group that had camped out
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a hard core of about eight of us who come here on her
birthday and the anniversary of her death each year,'' Kain said.
''The hierarchy have forgotten Diana, but we are never going to
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, she complained that there wasn't yet an adequate
memorial to the princess. A playground built in her name at
Kensington Gardens opened this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see a memorial other than just the play park
for children -- somewhere where older people could sit and have a
few moments to remember Diana,'' said 65-year-old Terry Hutt,
another who camped out.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 200 people who gathered at the palace gates at
lunchtime was a retired Anglican priest, the Rev. Frank Gelli, who
held a short service in memory of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had this tremendous capacity to reach people because she
had suffered,'' he said. ''She had an amazing capacity to touch.
That is why people remember her.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: Legionnaires Traced to Soil  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- At least two people in the West are believed to
have contracted Legionnaires' disease from potting soil in the
first such cases ever reported in the United States, the government
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A third case of Legionnaires', involving a California man who
died in May, may also have been connected to potting soil, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
</P>
<P>
   A rare strain of bacteria that causes the disease infected two
women, one each in Oregon and Washington, in May. Both women had
worked with everyday gardening soil within 10 days of their first
Legionnaires' symptoms, and the bacterial strain was found in soil
they had used, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   The strain, Legionella longbeachae, also infected the California
man, but government scientists said they could not be sure he
contracted it from potting soil.
</P>
<P>
   Potting soil has previously been blamed for outbreaks in
Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The government cautioned that it is too early to question the
safety of potting soil or recommend precautions that gardeners can
take.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have quite a bit to learn,'' said Michael Martin of
the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. ''We certainly
don't understand the risk factors or risk behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia that was discovered
after an outbreak that killed 34 people at a 1976 American Legion
convention at a Philadelphia hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It has been traced to water from shower heads, humidifiers,
cooling towers and aerosol sprays. Early symptoms include fever,
respiratory problems and disorientation.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, potting soil was blamed for an outbreak of
Legionnaires' in the late 1980s, Martin said.

<HEADLINE> State ends year with $300.4 million surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state ended the fiscal year with a
$300.4 million surplus, Comptroller Nancy Wyman reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ninth consecutive year that the state reported a
surplus. Last year's tally was $69.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, state government spending grew
faster than the rate of revenue collected. The surplus, Wyman said,
was mainly due to the use of prior years' surplus funds to pay for
expenses during the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last five years, a portion of the surplus has been
set aside to be used in the next fiscal year,'' she said. ''That
cushion built up from previous years explains why the state
finished 2000 with a surplus even though the spending rate rose
faster than revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending grew by 9.3 percent, or about $950 million between
fiscal years 1999 and 2000, representing the largest increase in
eight years. Revenues grew by about 5.6 percent, or about $597
million over 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The state's overall debt increased by $196.2 million. The state
retired $948.3 million of debt while approving $1.45 billion in new
bonding.
</P>
<P>
   The state had recorded a gross surplus of $496.8 million, but
$196.4 million was appropriated for a variety of expenses by the
legislature. By law, another $35 million was deposited into the
''Rainy Day Fund.'' An additional $265.5 will be used for various
''debt avoidance'' projects related to school construction and
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus for the current fiscal year is projected to be $175
million.

<HEADLINE> Castro Considering Trip to New York  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro may travel to New York to
attend the U.N. Millennium Summit, but if not Cuba will at least
send a top official to argue against what it calls the hijacking of
the organization ''by a small and powerful group of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A decision will be made in the next 72 hours'' on whether
Castro will visit New York for the first time since 1995, when he
addressed the 50th anniversary U.N. session, Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque told a news conference Thursday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was unworried about the possibility of violence or an
assassination attempt against Castro in New York if he attends the
Sept. 6-8 U.N. meeting. ''No threat or risk is capable of scaring
anybody in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Cuba and the United States rose this week after
the State Department accused the island nation of preventing some
Cubans with U.S. visas from emigrating.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, in turn, accused the United States of failing to provide
enough visas for poorer or less-educated Cubans, while selectively
giving out visas to doctors and other professionals in what it
claims is a U.S. effort to strip the island of trained personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday that Cuba had
agreed to end a two-month suspension of talks on legal migration of
Cubans to the United States under accords signed in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba suspended the semiannual talks in June amid a furor between
the United States and Cuban exiles in Florida over Elian Gonzalez,
the 6-year-old whose mother died at sea in an illegal attempt to
get to America with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez Roque said Cuba has been -- and still is -- waiting for
Washington to set a new date for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of accusations between the two countries also
escalated with the denial of a visa last week to Ricardo Alarcon,
the president of Cuba's National Assembly, keeping him from
attending an international of parliamentarians in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Roque said a U.S. visa has already been requested for
Alarcon to attend the U.N. meeting. Earlier, a U.S. official
suggested that visa request would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever heads it, the Cuban delegation will speak out against
''the growing tendency of a small and powerful group of countries
to violate the U.N. charter'' by not consulting the General
Assembly on key decisions, and organizing U.N.-led interventions in
member countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Fishermen End Protests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French fishermen on Thursday called an end to a
nationwide wave of protests, including an hours-long traffic
blockade of the Channel Tunnel, after the Agriculture Ministry
promised to offset the costs of rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, fishermen had lined up cars to form a picket
line at the Channel Tunnel terminal at Coquelles, near the northern
port city of Calais, leaving hundreds of tourist buses and other
vehicles unable to board the trains that pass under the English
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   After a deal was signed at the Agriculture Ministry in Paris,
fishing unions called for an end to the demonstrations that have
left many French ports in gridlock for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany, who met with a delegation of
fishermen, pledged a series of financial measures to offset rising
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to take measures to lighten the companies' taxes,
which will permit companies to compensate for the ... rising price
of fuel,'' Glavany told France-Info radio after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   More good news came from Finance Minister Laurent Fabius, who
announced cuts on France's heavy fuel taxes as part of a sweeping
tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   The FNSEA farmers union said Fabius' announcement was only ''a
first step,'' and threatened to strike on Friday. The group said it
was asking members to send fuel bills to Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin. A union of taxi drivers also warned they would block
traffic Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Perigueux in the southwest, truck drivers,
farmers and taxis added their voices to the fuel protests, stopping
traffic at the principal entrances to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, fishermen had occupied ports from the
Mediterranean city of Marseille to Bayonne near the Spanish border
to the Normandy city of Le Havre.
</P>
<P>
   The British government demanded action by French authorities to
prevent a repeat of the blockade of English Channel ports. Deputy
Prime Minister John Prescott wrote to French Transport Minister
Jean-Claude Gayssot calling for ''new rules of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain ''remains deeply concerned at the disproportionate
impact on Britain of this kind of industrial action in France,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Survivor's Hatch Mulling Offers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Richard Hatch survived 39 days on a tropical
island to win a million dollars, but he needs a talent agency, a
management firm and a publicist to help him handle his latest
challenge -- life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is awash in proposals. Among the more bizarre offers, he
has been asked to be a spokesman for condoms and to spend some time
in a nudist colony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what my plans are. I am mulling over a million
different offers,'' Hatch told Daily Variety in a story Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a 39-year-old corporate trainer, has been keeping busy
since he won the $1 million prize on the hit CBS series
''Survivor.'' He was in New York on Wednesday for a third
appearance on ''Late Night With David Letterman,'' and has been
hosting a radio talk show this week in Providence, R.I., his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been drowning in mail -- and much of it doesn't make
sense for a gay man.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marriage proposals, from both men and women. I don't know what
those women are thinking,'' Hatch tells TV Guide in the upcoming
Sept. 23 issue.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Mideast Peace 'Now or Never'  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Mideast peace must come ''now or never'' and
Israel needs to show willingness to make concessions, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, whose country is a key player in Mideast
peacemaking, told a French newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's comments, to be published Friday, came amid reports
that Egyptian mediators are suggesting that the Israelis and
Palestinians defer the Jerusalem sovereignty question that has
hampered peace talks. Mediators have suggested that the sides
jointly police the holy city during a five- to 10-year trial
period.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with Le Figaro, Mubarak said ''Israel needs to
be willing to bend.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They (Israelis) have everything, a state, an army and the
territories taken in 1967. The Palestinians have nothing,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak told Le Figaro that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
would never succumb to pressure to make concessions on Jerusalem.
''No Muslim would ever pardon him,'' he said, according to Le
Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian leader also said the time is right for a final
agreement. ''Peace is now or never,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have said little publicly about their
mediation, no doubt wary of being condemned by hard-liners who want
no compromise on Arab claims to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But an Arab diplomat and an Egyptian expert close to the
negotiations said Thursday that the Egyptians have in recent days
presented their ideas to both sides and to the United States. Both
sources asked that their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   The plan suggests the ''one city with two administrations'' idea
be tried out for five to 10 years as a basis for a final agreement
on Jerusalem. But other accords could be struck in the meantime on
less complicated aspects of a Palestinian-Israeli agreement, such
as the borders of a Palestinian state and the fate of Palestinian
refugees who want to return to land in what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, joint Israeli-Palestinian police squads would
patrol and supervise security in areas where the two peoples are
expected to be in constant contact, the Egyptian expert and the
Arab diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Egyptian plan avoids a direct reference to the
explosive issue of rival claims to political sovereignty over
Jerusalem. Instead the Egyptian mediators have coined phrases like
''functional sovereignty'' and ''administrative control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian ideas include Israeli control of the Western Wall,
the revered site where Jews pray. Jews would have unrestricted
access to the Western Wall from two points in the city, as they do
now. The al-Aqsa mosque, which sits atop the wall, would be in
Palestinian hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The creative solution in these ideas is that the Egyptians are
trying to avoid using the word sovereignty, which was the main
stumbling block in Camp David,'' the Arab diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a solution can give each party what it wants without
delving into problematic phraseology,'' said the Egyptian expert, a
veteran of Middle East peace negotiations. He said wrangling over
legal and political terminology blocked agreement at Camp David
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas, which have not progressed to a formal proposal, fully
satisfy neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians. But they could
in time be the basis for resolving their most difficult point of
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian expert said the Egyptians had persuaded Arafat to
put off for at least a month plans to declare independence on Sept.
13. That would allow more time for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Egyptian plan, the office of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said: ''There are currently no concrete
negotiations between us and the Palestinians, and thus there is no
point in a discussion of this type until Arafat displays the
flexibility necessary for achieving an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, an official close to Barak said that if the
Palestinians do not make concessions in the coming few weeks, the
Israeli leader will ask the hard-line Likud party to join his
government.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline appeared aimed at forcing Palestinian concessions
on Jerusalem. Bringing the Likud into government would chill the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to Arafat, Nabil Amr, said such threats showed that
Barak had run out of ideas for the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> UN: Violations Remain in Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A brutal police force, an unchecked
military and a court system too weak to do anything about them are
important reasons why human rights violations remain a staple of
Guatemalan life, according to a U.N. report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing the fourth anniversary of the peace accords that ended
this country's 36-year civil war, the U.N. Mission to Guatemala's
11th human rights report blamed government forces for recent death
threats against judges, lawmakers and journalists, as well as for
dozens of politically motivated slayings and hundreds of wrongful
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   It said the government had contributed to vigilante killings in
rural, largely Indian areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National Civil Police is the institution principally
responsible for violations of human rights,'' Gird Merrem, director
of the U.N. mission, told a news conference. ''Its agents have
authored some of the most serious cases of extrajudicial executions
and tortures.''
</P>
<P>
   MINUGUA, as the mission is known, monitors compliance with peace
deal between government forces and leftist guerrillas. Its
responsibilities include monitoring electoral reforms and
overseeing projects for improving schools, health and social
services in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused the Guatemalan army of ''continued
interference'' in newly civilian-controlled organizations, such as
the police. It also said army officials were behind the 1999
kidnapping and killing of a wealthy businessman.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-page report, which documented 5,225 Guatemalan human
rights violations during a nine-month period ending June 30,
details 26 cases of politically motivated slayings and 19 cases of
torture, both of which are down from 1998 when MINUGUA reported 47
extra-judicial killings and 27 instances where victims were
tortured.
</P>
<P>
   But it reported 40 death threats, up from 17 in 1998, and said,
''fear, intimidation and criminal impunity'' still reign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at the quantitative numbers there have been
improvements since the end of the era of the armed conflict,'' said
Guillermo Fernandez, a MINUGUA political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that state institutions remain impotent and
oppressed by fear as in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Faustino Sanchez said Tuesday that his officers
were doing all they could.
</P>
<P>
   ''To MINUGUA we can say that the National Civil Police will not
tolerate the kind of crimes they are discussing,'' Sanchez said.
''We have captured and brought to trial a number of criminals
behind Guatemala's most serious crimes and we will continue to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that a ragged Guatemalan court system lacks
the political and legal presence to cope with Guatemala's serious
human rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''A phrase you see a lot in the report is 'this crime remains
unsolved,''' Fernandez said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - About 80 people were evacuated from the Chelsea
Piers sports complex and a nearby city sanitation department
facility Thursday after a gas main ruptured, Consolidated Edison
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries and service to the buildings was expected
to be restored later in the day, Con Ed spokeswoman D. Joy Faber
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a piece of digging equipment on a water and sewer
project broke the gas main on West Street about 11:30 a.m., forcing
the emergency evacuation and service shutdown. People were allowed
back into the buildings after 30 minutes, Faber said.

<HEADLINE> Judge sends Bruderhof custody case to Pennsylvania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) - An exiled Bruderhof member withdrew his
petition for custody over the child he is not allowed to see,
indicating he would file it in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, 5-year-old Roy Ebong, has lived in Farmington, Pa., for
three years, according to Leanora Kovacs, Ulster County Family
Court Judge Mary Work's law clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Laws generally require custody petitions to be filed in the
child's home state, or where the child has lived for the six months
preceding the petition. Roy Ebong is believed to still be in the
Pennsylvania Bruderhof with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Bruderhofs focus on Jesus Christ's spirit and teachings in the
Sermon on the Mount. They believe in community living and don't own
private property. Money is held commonly, decisions are made
jointly and individual members work in the community's shops,
making playthings and equipment for handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Ebong - along with two other fathers, Joseph Idiong and
Ebong Ebong - said they have not been allowed to see their children
since they were evicted from the religious group in 1997. Basil
Ebong said when he returned from a trip from Nigeria, he was not
permitted in the Bruderhof because he had questioned the Bruderhof
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruderhof movement has about 3,000 followers living in eight
communes around the world, members said last February. Founded in
the 1920s in Germany, it is part of the Anabaptist movement, which
also includes Mennonites and the Amish.
</P>
<P>
   There are Bruderhof communities in Catskill in Greene County,
Walden in Orange County, Rifton and Ulster Park in Ulster County,
Farmington, Pa., England and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Court Extends Detentions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Yugoslav military court on
Thursday refused to release two Britons and two Canadians arrested
on suspicion of terrorism, granting military officials more time to
investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers representing the four detainees -- Canadians Shaun
Going and Liam Hall and Britons Adrian Prangnell and John Yore --
said the army judge extended their detention for another month.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's top diplomat in Belgrade, Angela Bogdan described the
decision as ''very distressing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The detainees accepted this latest development with a great
deal of dignity and composure,'' Bogdan said. ''They had hoped to
be released today.''
</P>
<P>
   The four arrested were vacationing on the Montenegrin coast and
were en route back to Kosovo, where the two Britons trained local
police for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
An army patrol stopped them, searched their car and arrested the
four after discovering explosives-related material in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Jankovic, a Belgrade lawyer representing the Canadians,
said that the judge has demanded a report from the United Nations
and NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo, a southern Serb province where
Going ran a construction company. Going's nephew, Hall, was
employed with him for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Going claimed that the material was left over from his work, but
the military launched an investigation on possible espionage and
terrorism charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report asks in detail about Mr. Going's company, his
handling of explosives, import and other licenses, details on the
company's storage and use of explosives,'' Jankovic told reporters
outside Belgrade's military prison.
</P>
<P>
   British and Canadian diplomats in Belgrade have already
complained about the length of the proceedings against the four,
held at the Belgrade military prison for a month but not formally
charged, and waiting for a decision by the army prosecutor on
whether to indict them.

<HEADLINE> Treatment of Wen Ho Lee Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leaders of three of the nation's most
prestigious scientific organizations are taking issue with the
treatment of fired Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we make no claim as to his innocence or guilt, he
appears to be a victim of unjust treatment,'' the three said in an
open letter Thursday to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Bruce Alberts, president of the
National Academy of Sciences; William A. Wulf, president of the
National Academy of Engineering and Kenneth I. Shine, president of
the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The three organizations are independent research groups
chartered by Congress to provide scientific advice to government.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan-born Lee is waiting to learn if the government will
appeal a judge's order that he be freed on $1 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, has been jailed since his arrest Dec. 10 on 59 counts
alleging he transferred restricted data about nuclear weapons to
unsecure computers and tape at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The three scientists said in their letter to Reno that they were
making their concerns public because previous inquiries about Lee's
treatment had been responded to only by a form letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned that inaccurate and detrimental testimony by
government officials resulted in Dr. Lee needlessly spending eight
months in prison under harsh and questionable conditions of
confinement,'' the scientists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In their earlier letters the three had asked about Lee family
complaints that Lee was being held in solitary confinement, that
restraints had been used on him and that contact with family was
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Reno the scientists contended that ''the
handling of this case reflects poorly on the U.S. justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The concerns that we have expressed and the questions that we
have posed in our letters are identical to those our Committee on
Human Rights regularly poses to foreign governments, some of which
have had the courtesy to respond. Surely we cannot expect less from
our own government.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge James Parker ordered the
government to disclose documents that could help him determine
whether Lee was a target of selective prosecution and ethnic
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis said an area of concern if Lee
is freed on bail is the unrestricted communication allowed between
Lee and his wife, Sylvia, in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, national security is at stake,'' Stamboulidis said,
complaining that the judge's proposed conditions were not strict
enough to protect government secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's proposed release conditions included limits on
communication, travel, home visits and required removal of all
electronic communication devices except for one telephone line from
Lee's home. Lee would have to remain under electronic monitoring
except when being driven by his lawyers to court or the lab to work
on his defense. His mail also would be inspected.

<HEADLINE> US To Boycott Japan Whaling Meetings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will boycott several
meetings in Japan dealing with science and the environment in a
protest of the expansion of Japanese whaling, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected criticism from the United Nations and Australia that
staying away from the meetings would have no effect on Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the United States and other nations have made in
clear in international resolutions they don't like Japanese whaling
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of that, we are not attending several meetings that
have to do with the environment and science that were to be held in
Japan because we just don't think it's appropriate for us to go
there,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government expressed regret over a U.S. decision
not to attend a U.N. environmental conference in southern Japan,
saying it ''has nothing to do with whaling.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, sponsored by the U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, opened Thursday in Kitakyushu
on the island of Kyushu. The commission's 51 member nations and
organizations are expected to discuss key environmental issues in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott comes amid Japanese whaling in the northwest Pacific
Ocean carried out as part of a scientific program allowed under a
ban on commercial whaling. This year the Japanese are taking in
more whales of different species.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department notified Japan's ambassador to Washington
of the boycott on Wednesday, Japan's Environment Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Australian and U.N. criticism of the U.S. move,
Boucher said, ''The issue is not the U.N., not the Australians. The
issue is Japanese whaling practices.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Commerce Department was considering possible steps
to take against Japan to protest.

<HEADLINE> State legislators call for PSC chairwoman to resign  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two Democratic state legislators called for
the state's chief utility regulator to resign Thursday, saying her
agency's stewardship of utility industry deregulation in New York
has been a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Rising energy prices show that the state Public Service
Commission and its chairwoman, Maureen Helmer, have mishandled
deregulation and its intended effect of lowering power prices and
providing consumers with more buying choices, the two lawmakers
charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PSC standards for deregulation are not working,'' said
state Assemblyman Sam Colman of Rockland County. ''I believe a call
for new leadership at the PSC is needed in order to undo the damage
which the PSC has created.''
</P>
<P>
   Colman's fellow Rockland County Democrat, Alex Gromack, said the
PSC should be held responsible for the current energy ''mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmer is an appointee of Republican Gov. George Pataki.
Democrats in the state Assembly have complained for years that New
York is the only state in country where electric industry
deregulation was carried out by appointees on a state agency
instead of bills approved in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Pataki has full confidence
in Helmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfortunate that these guys (Colman and Gromack) want to
avoid responsibility for their support of the failed energy
policies of the past,'' McKeon said. ''This is hypocrisy at its
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislators should be blaming Democratic President Clinton
for having ''failed miserably'' to deal with oil shortages and oil
price increases which have helped fuel rising utility bills, McKeon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Helmer's spokesman, David Flanagan, accused the legislators of
engaging in ''finger-pointing'' motivated by ''political
expediency.'' He said Helmer has the extremely difficult job of
making sure there is enough power to meet rising demand in New York
state, that the power is available as cheaply as possible and that
energy efficiency remains a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the assemblymen had bothered to ask, they would know that
Chairwoman Helmer is moving aggressively on all these fronts and
that New York has been recognized as a national leader in
establishing a framework for a competitive market,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pataki administration's strategy, private utilities
are being made to get out of the energy-generating business and to
become distributors of power produced by other private companies.
The idea is to give consumers more options to ''shop around'' for
electricity and natural gas and for utilities to provide cheaper
power by buying it in the competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   However, electricity has markedly increased in price this summer
for customers of Consolidated Edison, which is struggling to secure
low-cost power to replace what it was generating at its
out-of-service Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant in Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several New York utilities say a spike in the price
of natural gas nationwide will force them to charge up to 20
percent more for gas during this winter's heating season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Colman and Gromack had called on state
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer - who is also a Democrat - to
investigate the state's utilities over allegations that energy cost
increases were the result of a price-fixing scheme within the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Thursday his staff is studying the system under
which utilities are buying energy on the open market for possible
signs that prices are being manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has also petitioned the PSC to get
Consolidated Edison to stop passing through higher electricity
rates to customers. Spitzer said the state's deregulation system is
allowing Con Ed the advantages of passing through rate increases to
customers but not requiring the utility to keep costs down to
minimize those hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Colman and Gromack are running for re-election this
November.
</P>
<P>
   Helmer was counsel to the state Senate energy committee for six
years and general counsel to the PSC for two years before being
appointed to the commission by Pataki in 1997. She was elevated to
the chairwoman's post the following year by the governor.

<HEADLINE> F-16 crashes off the coast of Atlantic City  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - An F-16 military jet on a training
flight crashed into the ocean Thursday on its way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Air Force plane went down about 3:40 p.m. one
mile east of the Absecon Inlet.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Barbara Harbison of the state Department of Military
and Veterans Affairs said the pilot, who was rescued by a New
Jersey State Police boat, was alone on the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Thomas Sost of the State Police's marine unit in
Atlantic City arrived first in an 18-foot patrol boat.
</P>
<P>
   Sost said the downed aviator was sitting in a military-type raft
in the ocean, surrounded by waves as high as 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was waving both of his arms vigorously and as soon as he
saw me, he had a nice big smile on his face,'' Sost said. ''He
looked good. Surprisingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another State Police boat arrived and got him out of the water,
and he was transported to Atlantic City Medical Center, where a
spokeswoman said he was under evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the pilot was reported in
good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison said the jet sank underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Brigantine closed its beaches about 4:30 p.m. because it was
concerned about jet diesel fuel washing ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Martyniuk, also of the Department of Military and Veterans
Affairs, said just before the engine failed, the pilot reported an
oil pressure problem.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was part of a routine training flight for the 177th
Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard at Atlantic City.
Harbison said three other planes flying in formation with the
downed fighter returned to their base at Atlantic City
International Airport without problems.
</P>
<P>
   Martyniuk said none of the aircraft was armed.

<HEADLINE> US, Iranian Lawmakers Meet in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since the Islamic revolution
two decades ago, a group of American and Iranian lawmakers met and
discussed U.S. sanctions against Tehran, the treatment of Iranian
Jews and other issues dividing the two countries, participants said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both Iran and the United States stressed that the
20-minute discussion Wednesday night at a museum reception was an
unofficial ''bumping into'' -- not a formal, sit-down meeting --
although both sides knew the other would be attending.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, participants said the discussion was a significant yet
small step in the warming of relations that has followed the 1997
election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami and has included a
recent easing of U.S. sanctions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 22 years of freeze, at least it's a good step that we
were in the same room together and nothing bad happened,'' said
Rep. Robert Ney, an Ohio Republican who favors increased dialogue
with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the meeting was just ''one step
removed'' from official government-to-government contacts, which
were severed after radical followers of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took 52
Americans hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're looking for here is to break the ice,'' Specter
said in a statement. ''So if you take what President Khatami has
been saying, I think the time is right to start a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Ney said they hoped the informal gathering, which
was first reported by USA Today, would be followed by a planned
exchange of lawmakers -- an invitation extended to the Iranians in
letters from House and Senate members several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two U.S. lawmakers were joined by Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.,
and Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
reception sponsored by the American Iranian Council, which seeks
improved relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   They met with the speaker of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, Mehdi
Karrubi, and four other Iranian lawmakers who are in New York for a
meeting of world parliament leaders at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Karrubi, a one-time hard-liner who now favors the democratic
reforms sought by Khatami, told a press conference Thursday that he
lodged several complaints with the congressmen, including the fact
that two of his delegation members were denied visas for the U.N.
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But more significantly, he said he complained about continuing
U.S. ''hostility'' towards Iran -- particularly the continuation of
economic sanctions and the federal law that requires nonimmigrant
Iranian visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed upon arrival
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''In connection to the people of the U.S., the government and
the nation of Iran has no problem,'' Karrubi said he told the
congressmen. ''But the problem is being created by the Congress and
the U.S. administration. They are hostile towards us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, who is Jewish, said he raised the issue of the plight
of the 10 Iranian Jews who were convicted July 1 of spying for
Israel and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 13
years. The proceedings drew condemnation from Israel and criticism
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mouris Motamed, the single Jewish representative in Iran's
290-seat parliament, said he was hopeful the Jews would receive a
''lighter'' sentence when their appeals are heard Sept. 5, but he
stressed that Iran's judiciary -- which is controlled by Iran's
hard-liners -- worked separately from parliament, which is now
controlled by reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Farzin Hashemi, a spokesman for the National Council of
Resistance of Iran, an Iranian opposition group in exile, dismissed
the significance of the meeting, saying the United States rightly
has maintained a distance from the Tehran regime for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming outside the country and smiling to the Western audience
is just a way to really divert the public attention and the
politicians here from the real issue which is the ongoing
violations of human rights, ongoing support for terrorsim and the
effort by the clerical regime to acquire weapons of mass
destruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council has been listed by the State Department as
an alias for the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq, which it describes as
a terrorist organization.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Targets Islamic Leader  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- An Islamic preacher accused of planning to
overthrow Turkey's secular government systematically planted his
followers in the civil service to create religious unrest, a top
prosecutor said Thursday in an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel argued that Fethullah Gulen sent
supporters particularly into the police ranks and the Education
Ministry, private NTV television said.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen, who is believed to be living in the United States, is
charged with leading a criminal group to overthrow the government.
He has a large following among Turks, who regard him as a moderate
Islamic figure who preaches tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   But Yuksel claimed the preacher's public statements were a
tactic to cover his true goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gulen's aim is to establish a theocratic Islamic dictatorship
by having Islamic orders dominate the state,'' Yuksel said in the
indictment, quoted by the Anatolia news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen, 62, faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted of
establishing an illegal organization which aims to overthrow the
state. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the head of Turkey's fiercely secular military,
Chief of Staff Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, criticized a court decision
to withdraw an arrest warrant against Gulen. The court ruled there
were no grounds for the warrant while the investigation continued.
</P>
<P>
   Kivrikoglu said 11 of 46 officers purged from the military
earlier this month were Gulen's followers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have infiltrated everything,'' he said. ''They have also
infiltrated the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Kivrikoglu also urged Parliament, which convenes in October, to
swiftly approve a draft bill to sack thousands of civil servants
suspected of sympathizing with Islamic factions. The decree is
likely to face strong opposition in Parliament, which is dominated
by conservative and Islamic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't eliminate rotten apricots in a basket in time,
all apricots are affected,'' Kivrikoglu said. ''Then you lose the
whole basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The military, which has carried out three coups since 1960, says
political Islam is one of the main threats to the republic and is
spearheading the secular state's battle against Islamic political
movements.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen's indictment comes a year after Turkish television
stations aired a videotape in which prosecutors claim he appeared
to be urging his followers to keep a low profile before attempting
an uprising.
</P>
<P>
   The preacher reportedly left Turkey last year to seek medical
treatment. His lawyer said he would not come back because he is in
poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen owns scores of schools in Turkey and Central Asia and has
ties with leading political parties, which court the votes of his
followers.

<HEADLINE> J.D. Salinger's Daughter Pens Memoir  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- J.D. Salinger, the fiercely private author of
''The Catcher in the Rye,'' has been exposed again -- this time, by
his own daughter, who says in a new memoir that he drank his own
urine, spoke in tongues and rarely had sex with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Salinger's ''Dream Catcher: A Memoir'' also reports
that her half-Jewish father was once married to a Nazi Party
functionary.
</P>
<P>
   The book, due out Wednesday from Pocket Books, comes two years
after Joyce Maynard's expose of her romance with Salinger when she
was a teen-ager and he was in his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, 81, has not published anything new since 1965 and has
remained publicly silent for years, refusing all interview
requests. He lives in seclusion in Cornish, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger's mother, Claire Douglas, was an Irish Catholic
high school girl in New York when she met Salinger, who was then in
his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 44-year-old Ms. Salinger, her father -- a U.S.
counterintelligence agent in wartime Europe -- arrested a young Nazi
Party functionary named Sylvia and married her. The marriage didn't
last long; later, he would call her with disgust ''Saliva,'' the
daughter writes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he met Douglas, Salinger was abstaining from sex,
following the advice of an Indian mystic, their daughter writes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Salinger, her father also studied Scientology,
homeopathy and Christian Science and engaged in a hodgepodge of
practices, including drinking urine, sitting in a Reichian ''orgone
box,'' speaking in tongues and fasting.
</P>
<P>
   The writer held his wife as ''a virtual prisoner,'' refusing to
allow her to see friends and relatives and demanding fancy meals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger says that that since her parents rarely were
intimate, her conception was all but an accident. When the writer's
wife became pregnant, he found her abhorrent and she developed a
suicidal depression, their daughter says she was told by her
mother, now a Jungian analyst in California.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger says her growing-up years were accompanied by
bulimia, panic attacks, chronic fatigue and ''severe perceptual
distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she felt compelled to decipher her childhood in print,
''absolutely determined not to repeat with my son what had been
done with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents divorced in 1966. She graduated from Brandeis
University, studied management at Oxford University, then attended
Harvard Divinity School and trained as a nondenominational hospital
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Father and daughter have kept in touch over the years, but with
the book out, she says she is not sure he will ever speak to her
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loves me,'' she said in Thursday's New York Times, adding
that ''he probably hates my guts, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father lives with his third wife, a nurse in her 30s.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Cuban Migration To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite their public feuding, Cuba and the
United States have agreed to resume talks on legal migration of
Cubans to the United States under accords signed in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba suspended the semiannual talks in June amid a clash between
the Clinton administration and Cuban exiles in Florida over Elian
Gonzalez, a 6-year-old boy whose mother died at sea in an attempt
to get to America with him. The boy was taken home to Cuba by his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba moved in a 15-page diplomatic note late Wednesday to start
the talks up again, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said Cuba was
waiting for Washington to set a date for the new talks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements grant visas to 20,000 Cubans a year, including a
portion for those with relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many more Cubans, an estimated 130,000 in one year alone -- 1980
-- make the 90-mile voyage to the United States illegally. An untold
number have perished at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements permit the U.S. Coast Guard to return Cubans
seized at sea to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the Cuban note was marked by ''some tired old
rhetoric'' in which Cuba portrayed itself as a victim of U.S.
policy. But, Boucher said, the note also said ''they are prepared''
to resume talks and that a time and place will be set.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no formal relations between the United States
and Cuba since Fidel Castro came to power four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   With diminishing success, the United States has tried to isolate
Cuba politically and economically. But the countries exchange small
diplomatic missions and the migration accords reflect a partial
working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raked Havana
for what she said was arbitrary denial of exit permits to Cubans
who had valid visas to migrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She said Cuba's action separated families and forced would-be
immigrants to attempt high-risk escapes by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, in turn, accused Washington of luring Cubans to risk their
lives making the dangerous 90-mile crossing to Florida, by
promising automatic residency for any Cuban who makes it ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions escalated with the denial of a visa to Ricardo Alarcon,
the president of Cuba's National Assembly, keeping him from
attending an international of parliamentarians in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon accused the United States, in turn, of permitting Cubans
who arrive illegally to become permanent residents after they have
been in the country a year and a day, a preference even over legal
immigrants from all other countries.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official hinted Thursday, though, that Alarcon
would be given permission to attend the Millennium summit next week
in New York.

<HEADLINE> State nears settlement on parole backlog  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey is near a deal with prison
inmates overdue for parole hearings and it might cost taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,400 inmates are waiting for the mandatory review,
with most at least six months behind and some almost as much as
five years late, advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   One possible provision to settle a federal class-action lawsuit
would have the state pay inmates a late penalty of $17 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The exact amount and how it would be paid are ''on the table''
while negotiators discuss additional issues, including independent
oversight of the state's Parole Board, Elaine Selan, executive
director of the advocacy group And Justice For All, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping there would be compensatory damages for all of
those who are currently waiting as well as those who are going to
be waiting in the future,'' Selan said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are scheduled to be back in court Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to clear the parole backlog, and we are attempting to
settle this lawsuit,'' said Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the state
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Joel Pisano in
Camden, lawyers for both sides said they are continuing to
negotiate. No details were discussed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Davis refused to discuss any possible payment or any other
details offered by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are discussions to settle the lawsuit and we are
close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating efforts to cut the backlog are the state's strict
parole regulations, Selan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing officers issue parole reports 120 days before an
inmate's eligibility date. The Parole Board holds hearings 30 days
before the parole date if the release is opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Several key members, including the chairman and executive
director, are gone from the 11-member board.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just can't add more board members magically,'' Selan said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Consovoy resigned as chairman July 28 after reports that
authorities were investigating claims he gave organized crime
figures a break by releasing them from prison at the earliest
possible time. Consovoy has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime member Peter Loos requested medical leave and is
expected to retire in September. State police interviewed Loos in
late July in their investigation of Consovoy.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Director Robert Engles began one month's medical leave
in mid-August and will continue to receive his $86,932 salary.
Consovoy also was on sick leave before he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   No replacements have been nominated by Gov. Christie Whitman,
spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously it's a priority. I would expect once the Senate
comes back we will be in a position to move some nominations,''
O'Connor said.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped American Said Ill  </HEADLINE>
By BULLIT MARQUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- An American held by Muslim rebels
in a southern Philippine jungle is seriously ill, U.S. officials
said Thursday. They appealed for his immediate release on
humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Thomas Skipper said U.S. government
officials learned from the family of Jeffrey Schilling that he has
serious medical problems and needs regular prescription medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a humanitarian standpoint, he should be released as soon
as possible,'' Skipper said. He said he did not know the nature of
Schilling's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf guerrillas announced Tuesday that they had abducted
Schilling, of Oakland, Calif. They threatened to behead him if the
United States rejects their demands, including the release of
several Arab terrorists in American jails.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which says it is fighting for a separate Islamic
state in the impoverished southern Philippines, still holds 18
other hostages on southern Jolo Island. It released six Westerners
earlier this week for what negotiators said was $6 million paid by
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine negotiators said they would send an envoy to an Abu
Sayyaf camp Friday to try to arrange the release this weekend of
six more Westerners, including two French television journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the U.S. was not interested in bringing in a third country to help
mediate Shilling's release and repeated the government's hard-line
stance against giving in to terrorist demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of the Philippines is in charge of the effort.
We are certainly willing to see negotiations by the government of
the Philippines, but I think our policies on concessions and ransom
and those sorts of things are well known,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling is held by a different Abu Sayyaf faction -- the same
one that was responsible for the kidnapping of about 50
schoolchildren and teachers in March on neighboring Basilan Island.
The group beheaded two teachers after the United States ignored its
demand for the release of Arab terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government, embarrassed by the kidnappings, is
considering a tougher approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing has become a revolving door. There are hostages
coming in and hostages getting out,'' Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado said. ''I think one of these days we should close that
door.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf said earlier that they were willing to begin
negotiations with U.S. Embassy officials as early as Thursday for
Schilling's release. They demanded that representatives of North
Korea, China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Libya take part -- which
Mercado called ''really out of this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials said they will try to negotiate before
resorting to military action. They said the talks are unlikely to
involve a third country, apparently referring to Libya, which
played a prominent role in the release of the other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has ruled out paying ransom and any
deals with the rebels. Skipper said that policy ''does not preclude
us from negotiating ... What we can offer I'm not really certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Shilling's mother, Carol, called local radio station DXRZ from
Oakland and appealed to the rebels to release her son and give her
a chance to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would really very much like him to be released and returned
home to me safely,'' she said. ''My son is very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say they believe Schilling is a CIA agent because he
introduced himself as a Muslim convert but knew little about Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling said her son converted to Islam several years ago and
visited the Philippines partly because of a longtime interest in
the region, but stayed after he fell in love with a Muslim woman,
Ivi V. Osani.
</P>
<P>
   Osani's mother, Aida Ajijol, said Osani and rebel spokesman Abu
Sabaya are second cousins. Sabaya invited the couple to visit the
rebels' camp on Jolo, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Thursday, a bomb exploded near a public market in a
southern town Thursday, injuring at least 13 people, officials
said. Police said they suspect another Muslim rebel group, the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, in the bombing near a public market in
the town of Kabacan.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall freshmen learn about fire safety the hard way  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - They sat on the couch at the curb,
three dejected freshmen, their college career all of five minutes
old and already off to a bad start.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping on a whim at a thrift shop a few blocks from Seton
Hall's campus on freshman move-in day, the trio decided to invest
$10 in a pullout couch for their dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   But as they hoisted it on their shoulders and tried to bring it
inside Boland Hall, a Seton Hall staffer stopped them, quickly
eyeing the orange tweed fabric and determining it wasn't
fire-retardant. It couldn't be brought inside, the staff member
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boland Hall is where three Seton Hall freshmen died in a fire
last January, prompting tough new fire safety precautions at
colleges throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an awesome couch,'' said Pete Ishak of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He sat on the doomed davenport outside Boland Hall as he and two
dorm-mates pondered their next move.
</P>
<P>
   ''How great would this have been?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great couch,'' agreed roommate Chris Fuller of
Kingstown, R.I. ''I would have loved to sit on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishak said he understood why Seton Hall was being more vigilant
this semester, particularly in Boland Hall. But he was still
bumming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like that they stopped us in one way, that they're thinking
of stuff like this, but it's a little overboard,'' he said. ''I
mean, it's just a couch. Without the fire, none of this would have
been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall is counting on tough new rules regarding dorm safety
to make sure problems don't recur. The university just finished
installing $4.5 million worth of dorm sprinklers, installed in each
room smoke alarms connected to the building's main fire alarm
system, and stepped up training of residence hall staff.
</P>
<P>
   The college also instituted a minimum $250 fine, plus probation
and mandatory campus service work for anyone who doesn't leave the
building during a fire drill. More serious fire safety violations
could result in suspension or expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire, which also injured 58 students and four
rescuers, remains undetermined. But the steps taken in its
aftermath seem to have reassured most Seton Hall freshmen and their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anything, I think it's going to make it safer here this
year,'' said Jesse DeMarzo of Denville as he and his parents lugged
his belongings into Boland Hall. ''They're taking more precautions
now. (The fire) really wasn't a concern to me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided to attend Seton Hall after the fire happened,
focusing on its academic reputation and his plans to major in
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Puffen of Nanticoke, Pa., had no misgivings about sending
her daughter, Kristie, to stay at Seton Hall to major in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could happen anywhere,'' Puffen said as she stood guard
over some of Kristie's possessions on the sidewalk while her
daughter lugged the rest inside. ''I was looking for the academic
aspect of it, which is why she came here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristie said she was reassured by mailings Seton Hall sent to
her home this summer outlining safety precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ''After seeing some of the regulations Seton Hall has this year,
I'm sure I'll be safe here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Father Bob Meyer, the university's assistant vice president for
student affairs, said most parents and students wanted to know
about the fire and what was done after it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you explain the precautions, the policies, the
sprinklers, the systems, they're ready to move on,'' he said.
''They start asking about how their laptops will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Gonzalez of Union City was excited about moving in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's safer now,'' she said. ''People know what to do
and what not to do. They sent us letters about what we're allowed
and not allowed to have in our rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   That, noted university spokeswoman Lisa Grider, should have
stopped Ishak and his friends from buying the ratty old couch.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should not have come as a surprise to anyone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the couch, it was getting late, freshman
convocation was set to begin in less than an hour, and Ishak and
his friends still hadn't set foot inside their dorm. The idea of
beginning their college careers with a sidewalk sleep-in protest
was considered but quickly voted down.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to sell the couch to someone else for $5, but were
reminded Seton Hall is a Roman Catholic college, and it might not
fit in so well with the Judeo-Christian tradition to stick it to
your classmates on the first day of school. So they reached the
only conclusion they could.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throw it in a Dumpster,'' said J.P. Baran of West Palm Beach,
Fla. And that's what they did.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really (stinks),'' Ishak said. ''I'm really upset.''

<HEADLINE> 11 Ex-FDA Heads Oppose Drug Imports  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eleven former Food and Drug Administration
commissioners have come out against legislation that would lift a
ban on prescription drug imports, a pharmaceutical industry group
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America is the latest attempt by the industry to
thwart bills that would allow pharmacists to import FDA-approved
drugs from other countries, where they often are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was a testimonial from Michael A. Friedman, acting FDA
commissioner under President Clinton in 1997 and 1998, who said
such legislation ''would significantly increase risks to patients
on prescription medicines because their drugs might be adulterated,
counterfeit or sub-potent.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade group said that every former commissioner dating to
1969 wrote to Congress opposing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prime sponsors of the Senate bill, Sen. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., brushed aside the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not surprising to me at all. A number of them have gone
to work for the pharmaceutical industry,'' he said, adding the
pharmaceutical industry is concerned about ''profits, not safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan introduced his bill in June 1999 along with Sens. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn.; Tim Johnson, D-S.D.; and Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine. The Senate this year passed a similar measure, 74-21,
introduced by Dorgan and Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the
Senate Health Committee. A House-Senate conference committee will
take up the legislation when Congress returns next week.
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows only a manufacturer to re-import its product
into the country. The measure approved by the Senate would allow
pharmacists and wholesale drug distributors to purchase and import
drugs that have been shipped from the United States to other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan said the legislation includes safeguards requiring the
FDA to ensure the drugs are safe, although some senators said the
FDA doesn't have the resources to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all nonsense,'' Dorgan said. ''We can provide the FDA
resources quite easily. The components that the pharmaceutical
industry uses come from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.

<HEADLINE> 'Dream Catcher' -- J.D. Salinger according to his daughter  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - J.D. Salinger, the fiercely private author of
''The Catcher in the Rye,'' is caught in the public eye again -
this time, by a daughter who says he once drank his own urine,
spoke in tongues and rarely had sex with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Salinger's ''Dream Catcher: A Memoir'' - due out
Wednesday from Pocket Books - also reveals that her half-Jewish
father had married a Nazi Party official in wartime Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be like the Native American dream catcher, given to
me when my son was born to hang over his cradle,'' she writes in
the 436-page tell-all book.
</P>
<P>
   ''The catcher's net, the filter of discernment, is woven to let
the nightmares of generations pass on into harmless vapor, and to
capture only the good dreams,'' she writes about memories of life
with her now 81-year-old father.
</P>
<P>
   The book comes two years after Joyce Maynard's published expose
of her own romance with Salinger when she was a teen-ager and he
was in his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   That encounter followed his marriage to Margaret Salinger's
mother, Claire Douglas, whom the 30-something author met when she
was an Irish Catholic high school student in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter offers details of his life that are both new and
intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome David Salinger, the son of Miriam and Sol Salinger, a New
York food merchant, was a U.S. counterintelligence agent during
World War II. After arresting a young Nazi Party functionary named
Sylvia, he briefly married her; later, he would call her
''Saliva.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he met Douglas, he was abstaining from sex,
following the advice of an Indian mystic, their daughter writes.
</P>
<P>
   Once her parents settled in Cornish, N.H., she writes, he held
his wife as ''a virtual prisoner,'' refusing to allow her to see
friends and relatives and demanding fancy meals.
</P>
<P>
   Since her parents rarely were intimate, she feels her conception
was all but an accident. Her father feared the female body so much
that when his wife became pregnant, he found her abhorrent and she
developed a suicidal depression, their daughter says she was told
by her mother, now a Jungian analyst in California.
</P>
<P>
   But once the child was born, Salinger expressed his joy, while
his wife felt ''jealousy and rage over my replacement of her in my
father's affections.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the Salingers also had a son, Matthew, now an actor and
producer.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Salinger's early years were accompanied by bulimia and
other disorders including panic attacks, chronic fatigue and what
she calls ''severe perceptual distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her father was obsessed with his writing, while
studying Scientology, homeopathy and Christian Science. As part of
his rites, his daughter says he drank urine and sat in an orgone
box, an invention of psychoanalyst William Reich meant to collect
cosmic energy. Salinger also spoke in tongues and fasted, she says.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Salinger has not published anything since 1965 and has
remained publicly silent for years.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter says she felt compelled to decipher her childhood
in print, while ''absolutely determined not to repeat with my son
what had been done with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some good times.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, ''he can be funny, intensely loving, and the
person you most want to be with,'' she writes in the book, which
includes photographs of her sitting on his shoulders and of him
watching her learn to walk. But, she warns, ''he is not going to be
your catcher in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   After her parents divorced in 1966, she occasionally stayed with
her father in Cornish. She graduated from Brandeis University,
studied management at Oxford University, then attended Harvard
Divinity School and trained as a nondenominational hospital
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The two have kept in touch over the years, but with the book
out, she's not sure he'll ever speak to her again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ''he loves me,'' the 44-year-old daughter was quoted as
saying in Thursday's New York Times, adding that ''he probably
hates my guts, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father lives in Cornish with his third wife, a nurse in her
30s, and his daughter says he still writes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks To Allay Nuclear Fears  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States said on Thursday that its
planned missile defense shield is not directed against China or
Russia, and denied that it will set off an arms race in space.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Robert T. Grey, head of the U.S. delegation to the
66-nation Conference on Disarmament, told the grouping the defense
system being considered would defend the United States against
''certain countries of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said such nations include North Korea and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Grey said concerns about the proposed missile defense shield
were keeping the conference from tackling more pressing concerns
such as the need to ban fissionable materials -- plutonium and
enriched uranium -- that are used to make nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no arms race in outer space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grey said U.S. consideration of a limited missile defense system
has nothing to do with an arms race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would use satellites only to provide early warning and data
on threat missiles,'' Grey said. ''This is a far cry from the
'weaponization' of outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the United States remains committed to the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, even though it wants to make changes
in it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been trying to persuade Russia to amend
the ABM treaty to permit deployment of a shield against limited
missile launches by ''rogue'' nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been reluctant to change the ABM treaty on
grounds that it is a keystone of the global effort to reduce the
risk of nuclear war.

<HEADLINE> State approves noise test in Delaware Bay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Department of Environmental
Protection has approved a high-frequency noise test in the Delaware
Bay, a move opposed by a local official and environmentalist who
fear the noise will disrupt sea life.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP signed off on the U.S. Navy's application to conduct the
test about seven miles off the bay coasts of New Jersey and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   University of Delaware scientists hope the test will help
explain the physics of sound in water and aid in the remote
gathering of environmental data, according to Thursday's editions
of The Press of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The university has a Navy grant to conduct the three-month test.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding
Center in Brigantine, told the newspaper that he is concerned that
the test will harm newborn dolphins in the midst of learning skills
such as feeding and socialization, and drive away fish on which the
dolphin feed.
</P>
<P>
   There is insufficient evidence to show that rare sea turtles,
including loggerhead, Kemp's Ridley and green turtles, won't be
affected by the noise test, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-2nd, said he wanted the state to
postpone the test until later in the fall, after the dolphin and
turtles migrate south.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed the permit was approved and I hope they
got it right,'' he told the newspaper. ''We've not said we don't
believe this should never take place. We just wanted to be assured
it's as safe as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The DEP's Land Use Regulation Program approved the permit
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of the approval, the DEP is requiring underwater
video cameras at the experiment site be linked to the University of
Delaware's Web site for live public viewing.
</P>
<P>
   If the cameras detect a ''significant behavioral impact,'' the
experiment will be stopped while the cause of the disturbance is
analyzed by the DEP, according to a letter written by program
Director Richard H. Kropp.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP will decide whether to suspend or modify the experiment
based on monthly videotapes, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service indicated to the DEP that
the experiment would not harm marine life, Kropp wrote. The DEP's
Division of Fish and Wildlife also believes the experiment's
interference with fish will be minimal, he wrote.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Implanted Hearing Device  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal health officials approved a novel
surgically implanted ear device Thursday that may help Americans
frustrated with regular hearing aids to hear better.
</P>
<P>
   Symphonix Inc.'s Vibrant Soundbridge is for a type of
moderate-to-severe hearing loss that afflicts millions of
Americans. The loss is caused by problems with nerves vital for
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Regular hearing aids help many of these people by magnifying
sound. The Soundbridge works very differently: It converts sound to
the mechanical vibrations of the delicate middle ear bones -- the
way normal sound moves those bones.
</P>
<P>
   To implant the Soundbridge, a doctor places a microphone and
battery on the patient's scalp. The microphone transmits sound
through the skin to a receiver surgically implanted behind the ear.
A wire leads down to a small electromagnet implanted in the middle
ear that drives the vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   The implant is different from another surgical treatment,
cochlear implants, for the profoundly deaf. Cochlear implants are
electronic systems that send sound-generated impulses to the brain
to bypass a flaw in the inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials of the Soundbridge, patients who had been
frustrated with feedback or echoes from hearing aids told
physicians it provided more clear hearing, said Dr. Thomas Balkany,
chairman of otolaryngology at the University of Miami, who helped
test the device for Symphonix.
</P>
<P>
   That's a very subjective statement, he cautioned, with no
objective way to measure it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Food and Drug Administration said that in a study of
81 patients, standard hearing tests showed people gained the same
overall amount of hearing with a regular hearing aid as with the
implanted Soundbridge. Thus the FDA calls the new device equally
effective to hearing aids, not superior.
</P>
<P>
   The Soundbridge, including surgery, costs about $15,000. In
contrast, a high-quality digital hearing aid costs about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Balkany acknowledged the expense, but said the Soundbridge
should last a lifetime, with routine battery replacements, while
hearing aids typically must be replaced every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Balkany said, perhaps one in 10 patients -- people for
whom regular hearing aids don't work well -- are good candidates for
the surgically implanted device.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be really careful not to do operations on people
who could do just fine without an operation. ... Modern hearing
aids actually work well for most people,'' he said. ''We only want
to put this (implant) in people who have experience with regular
hearing aids and for one reason or another are not satisfied with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soundbridge is implanted during outpatient surgery that
takes about two hours but does require general anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also cautioned that about 2 percent of patients actually
suffered worsened hearing after implantation, 5 percent had
long-term ear pain and 16 percent reported a permanent feeling of
''fullness'' in the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA told San Jose, Calif.-based Symphonix to create
plain-English patient information booklets explaining the
Soundbridge and said consumers should insist on receiving a copy
before deciding on the surgery. Implant recipients also should
receive a booklet on postoperative care, FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can request the booklets by calling Symphonix at
1-800-833-7733.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. to hold NASCAR gala to kickoff racing plates  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN FARKAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Hot dogs, maybe apple pie, but
definitely Chevrolet and Ford racing teams will be at the state
Capitol next month when West Virginia unveils six NASCAR-theme
license plates honoring the motor sport.
</P>
<P>
   A licensing agreement with NASCAR allows West Virginians to
purchase plates bearing the signatures of Dale Earnhardt, Jeff
Gordon, Dale Jarrett, Ricky Rudd and Rusty Wallace. A generic
NASCAR plate completes the first of several planned series by the
state Division of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia is the second state in the nation, after New York,
to allow driver loyalty to be displayed on registered vehicles.
NASCAR is talking with North Carolina and South Carolina about
similar licensing agreements, said Dave Kobuszewski, a spokesman
for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.
</P>
<P>
   New York announced its plate last September and New Yorkers have
14 drivers to choose from. West Virginia's selection of drivers was
based on surveys that showed them to be among the top fan
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ''We introduced them, but we didn't really get them on line
until this year,'' Joe Picchi, a spokesman for the New York
Department of Motor Vehicles, said Thursday. ''We're really
starting to promote them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has sold only 288 plates so far at the initial cost of
$63, Picchi said. New York has 10 million registered drivers and
the state offers several specialized plates.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia has had 3,000 requests for plates that tentatively
go on sale Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   It took a legislative act to allow motorists to obtain a NASCAR
plate at an initial cost of $65. Motor Vehicles Commissioner Joe
Miller, an avid race fan, pushed the legislation this year saying
it would be a great way to promote the state and the sport. The $65
includes the normal registration fee, the $25 plate fee and a
one-time $10 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing agreement requires the state to pay about 25
percent of the $25 plate fee to NASCAR, the drivers and their
racing teams, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's plate features the state's tourism Web site
address over a checkered flag. The driver's plate features the
driver's signature and his car's number.
</P>
<P>
   ''When somebody looked at it, we wanted them to know it's a West
Virginia tag,'' Steven said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will launch the series with 1,500 plates.
Commemorative plates will be available to nonresidents for $25
each.
</P>
<P>
   To kick off the sale, Gov. Cecil Underwood will host NASCAR
Sunday on the state Capitol Complex grounds on Sept. 10. NASCAR
drivers Matt Kenseth, Jimmy Spencer, Kenny Wallace and Busch series
point leader Jeff Green are expected to attend.

<HEADLINE> Giants Claimed Servais on Waiver  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Scott Servais is heading back to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Servais, who spent the 1999 season with San Francisco before
signing with Colorado in December, was claimed by the Giants on
Thursday after the Rockies placed the catcher on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lead the NL West by three games. San Francisco beat
Pittsburgh 10-2 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get some reinforcements now that it's
September,'' manager Dusty Baker said after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Servais hit .218 with one home run and 13 RBIs in 33 games with
Colorado. He had not played for the Rockies since straining his
right calf in the second week of July.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to Triple-A Colorado Springs after the injury, Servais
hit .292 with three homers and 12 RBIs in 20 games with the Sky
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Josh Bard, Colorado's third-round draft pick in 1999,
took Servais' place on the Colorado Springs roster. Bard hit .285
with two home runs and 25 RBIs at Class A Salem.

<HEADLINE> Webb Can Tie LPGA Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Karrie Webb, coming off a
record-shattering victory last week in the Oldsmobile Classic, can
tie an LPGA record with her seventh victory of the season this
weekend in the State Farm Rail Classic.
</P>
<P>
   She shot a second-round 61 to match the lowest score ever
recorded in an LPGA event last week. That round helped Webb tie the
tournament record of 265. She also broke her own tour record with a
54-hole score of 23-under par.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, competing for a fifth straight week, is concerned about
her stamina through the hot and humid days of late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I generally don't play five weeks in a row,'' she said. ''But
I realized I haven't played in Springfield before, so I wanted to
make sure I put it on my schedule this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, one of only four top-10 money winners competing this week,
could continue her under-par run. The 6,400-yard, Robert Trent
Jones layout has yielded birdies in bunches in the 25 years it has
hosted one the oldest LPGA events.
</P>
<P>
   First place at the Rail is worth $135,000 -- another big payday
prospect for Webb, who has already broken her own record for season
winnings and sits atop the money list with $1.68 million. That's
more than $500,000 ahead of second-place Annika Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam is skipping the Rail Classic, as are No. 3 Meg Mallon
and No. 4 Juli Inskster.
</P>
<P>
   The Rail Classic has the added bonus of being the final event in
the State Farm Series, which pays the top point-getter in a series
of televised events $100,000 from a $250,000 bonus pool.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time winner Pat Hurst, No. 5 on the money list, trails Webb
by 10 points heading into the Rail Classic. But the series-ending
event is worth triple points, up to 300 for first place.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Rail champion Betsy King and two-time winners Pat
Bradley and Nancy Lopez are in the field. Defending champion Mi
Hyun Kim, who won the event last year on her way to becoming the
LPGA Rookie of the Year, also returns.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) - When Continental Airlines picked up its latest
jet Thursday, it was the boss who signed the papers, picked up the
plane in Seattle and flew it home.
</P>
<P>
   Continental chairman and chief executive officer Gordon Bethune,
who also happens to be a licensed commercial jet pilot and aircraft
mechanic, personally delivered the carrier's first Boeing
767-400ER.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune's early reviews of the aircraft were predictably
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our customers will enjoy a new space-age cabin with every
amenity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Continental expects three more of the planes to
arrive this year and a total of 26 by 2005. They will replace
retiring DC-10s on routes to Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The first jet initially will fly between Newark and Orlando for
the last two weeks of September before serving the Newark-Rio de
Janeiro route beginning Oct. 1. The next few jets will serve Paris
and London.
</P>
<P>
   The 767-400ER is 21 feet longer than previous models and holds
235 passengers. The extended range jet can fly up to 6,200 miles
nonstop.

<HEADLINE> Ballerina Pavlova To Be Reburied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Nearly seven decades after her death, the ashes of
prima ballerina Anna Pavlova will be returned to Russia for burial,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlova was born in Russia's imperial capital St. Petersburg in
1881, and she created a sensation dancing for the famed Mariinsky
Theater there. She moved to London in 1912, and launched world
tours from there that introduced many to the beauty of classical
ballet. She died in 1931 and her ashes were interred in London's
Golders Green cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlova's remains will be reburied in Moscow's Novodevichy
Cemetery, in accordance with her stated wishes, on Sept. 14,
ITAR-Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Fans Embrace Thomas  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Thurman Thomas made a routine 17-yard pass
reception in the Miami Dolphins' first home exhibition game, and as
he trotted to the bench after the play, fans stood and roared.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest cheer of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're glad to see him in a Dolphins uniform,'' former Miami
coach Don Shula said. ''I am too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Thomas seemingly ran roughshod over the Dolphins
every year for the Buffalo Bills. He has eight 100-yard rushing
performances against Miami, including a 158-yard effort in the 1995
playoff game that ended Shula's career.
</P>
<P>
   But while Dolphins fans are delighted to have Thomas on their
side, folks in Buffalo are less than thrilled about the switch.
Cast aside by the Bills after 12 seasons because of the salary cap,
Thomas signed a three-year, $3.6 million contract with Miami in
March.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't his choice to leave Buffalo, but apparently fans there
resent his decision to join the Bills' archrivals in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten nasty mail -- 'Watch your back when you come to
Buffalo,''' he said. ''I'm thinking they mean maybe a couple of
snowballs, but you never know when you get letters like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't say former teammate Jim Kelly didn't warn him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jim was the first person I called when I came down here,''
Thomas said. ''He said, 'If you still think you can play, go ahead
and do it. But you're probably going to make a lot of people in
Buffalo mad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas won't need to worry about returning to Rich Stadium until
December. For now he'll focus on Miami's season opener Sunday
against the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has 456 career receptions, second behind Larry Centers
among active running backs, and he'll play mostly as a third-down
back in passing situations. But he may also give the ground game a
boost as a backup to Lamar Smith and J.J. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be in there on every third down, because that
means we're trying to convert on third-and-long,'' he said. ''I'd
rather play some on first and second down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indications are from practice that I will. I was kind of
surprised that I was in there on a couple of plays in practice. I
don't know how many carries I'll get. It'll depend upon how the
game is going.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thomas' duties will be limited, coach Dave Wannstedt
considers him a vital offseason upgrade for an offense that
sputtered last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thurman does things the right way,'' Wannstedt said. ''All
you've got to do is watch how the guy practices and watch him in
meetings taking notes and listen to the questions he asks, and it
becomes very clear why the guy is a future Hall of Fame
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 34, appeared on the verge of retirement last year, when
a bruised liver limited him to five games. Now he's thinking that
he'll play again next year before quitting.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to sign with the Dolphins has rejuvenated him. If
the reaction in Buffalo is a disappointment, the cheers at the
first exhibition game in Miami suggest he made a good move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I would get that kind of ovation here,'' he
said. ''It made me feel like I was finally welcome in South Florida
after all those years coming down here.''

<HEADLINE> SoCon's Top Scorer Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Wofford guard Ian Chadwick, the Southern
Conference's top returning scorer, must sit out the season's first
three games because he played in a summer basketball tournament not
approved by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick is one of four Southern Conference players -- three from
Wofford and one from the College of Charleston -- suspended for
their participation in the tournament, which is put on by NBA star
Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Also suspended were Wofford forward Bishop Ravenel and center
Edvin Masic and College of Charleston guard James Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   All four played in Garnett's summer tournament in Greenville,
which was not certified by the NCAA. Griffin played one game in
1999 and two games this summer, and the Wofford players played
three games this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both schools have said they would suspend the
players for three games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not written in stone, but we feel like that's probably
what it will be,'' College of Charleston coach John Kresse said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, a 6-foot-4 senior guard, averaged 16.8 points last
year. Ravenel, also a returning senior starter, averaged 7 points
and 5.9 rebounds for the Terriers. Masic sat out last season with
an injury.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs open space bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman continued her
weeklong open space tour Thursday, signing two more in a series of
bills totaling $61 million toward preservation of rural and urban
land.
</P>
<P>
   The newest recipients include the Asbury Park Boardwalk and
other urban park projects, which are in line for a total of $7
million in grants.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill sets aside $29 million for acquisition of open
space along streams and trails around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Land to be preserved under the second bill includes a 537-parcel
along the Raritan River watershed in Hunterdon and Somerset
counties - home to deer, foxes, pheasants and wild turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago voters approved creation of a new trust fund
designed to save 1 million acres of farmland and open space over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman concludes the bill-signing ceremonies Friday. She is
scheduled to appear in Bergen County to ink another measure
allocating funds from the Garden State Preservation Trust for still
more preservation projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''To date, we have preserved nearly 150,000 acres of open space
and farmland, which is halfway toward my personal goal of 300,000
acres by the time I leave office,'' she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The one bill signed Thursday approves open space acquisition and
park development funds in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   It includes $500,000 to help restore the Asbury Park Boardwalk.
Whitman said the project will usher in the rebirth of the resort.
</P>
<P>
   This ''is one more effort my administration has instituted to
restore this city's economy and secure its future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The second bill funds the purchase of the Raritan River
watershed tract from the Merck company for $4.7 million, saving it
from heavy development pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge other corporations to consider Merck's actions and
consider selling open land for preservation,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The areas approved by this bill for acquisition emphasize, to
a greater extent than ever before, the preservation of greenways
along stream and trail corridors,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The package of bills signed this week follow two bills she
signed Aug. 9 to preserve farmland.

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- The field for Friday's Spinaway
Stakes presents youngsters whose potential appears considerable
despite the absence of four runners.
</P>
<P>
   The 109th running of the $200,000, Grade I Spinaway is
Saratoga's prime showcase for 2-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hennig's talented trio of Gold Mover, Raging Fever and With
Ability, and Todd Pletcher's Harmony Lodge, have been impressive in
their brief careers. Injuries, or as in Raging Fever's case the
trainer's preference, a meeting of these fillies will have to wait
until the Belmont fall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Though winless in her first two trips to the post, Barry K.
Schwartz's Seeking It All, the daughter of A.P. Indy from the
Seeking the Gold mare, Seeking Regina, has been second in both of
her starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been pointing to (the Spinaway) since the
Schuylerville,'' trainer Mike Hushion said. ''Everything has gone
according to plan this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Queen Carson, Shane Sellers will try to ride his third
Spinaway winner in the past five years. Sellers won in 1996 on Oath
and in 1997 on Countess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty Storm, who will break from the rail, showed excellent
speed before finishing third in her first trip here on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   With all starters carrying 121 pounds, and from the rail out,
the Spinaway field is: Nasty Storm, Mike Smith; Seeking It All,
Aaron Gryder; Stormy Pick, Jose C. Ferrer; Hit Gold, Robbie Davis;
Out of Sync, Marlon St. Julien; Weekend Gold, Pat Day; Look of the
Lynx, Richard Migliore; Queen Carson, Shane Sellers and Two Item

<HEADLINE> Padres 11, Cubs 5  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Phil Nevin hurt the Chicago Cubs again Thursday,
driving in four runs, but the San Diego Padres 11-5 victory was
marred when winning pitcher Jay Witasick was hospitalized for heat
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick wasn't the only one affected by the heat, which was 88
but felt about 10 degrees warmer because of the humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs star Sammy Sosa left the game after the seventh inning
because of cramps in his left leg. Sosa said afterward he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick left the game after the fifth inning, dizzy and
disoriented, and was taken to Illinois Masonic Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he came up here, he didn't know what inning it was,''
Padres general manager Kevin Towers said. ''He was having a hard
time running the bases. He said that when he was looking at Wiki
(Gonzalez), Wiki was sideways and he was seeing black spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Witasik will stay overnight, and the Padres don't know if he'll
make his next start.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin hit a two-run homer and drove in another two runs,
finishing 4-for-5. In the last 30 games, the former No. 1 pick has
hit .407 with nine doubles and 34 RBIs -- he drove in a career
high-tying six runs Monday at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Kory DeHaan added a two-run homer, and Gonzalez
drove in a pair of runs for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick (2-1) gave up four runs and six hits in five innings,
and also drove in his third run of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Greene hit a three-run homer for the Cubs in the first
inning, but Kevin Tapani (8-11) gave up his 34th homer of the year,
second-most in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani allowed seven runs and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings, his
shortest outing since going two innings May 20.
</P>
<P>
   The loss finished off a miserable August for the Cubs, who were
only six games below .500 on Aug. 2. Since then, they've gone 8-19.
</P>
<P>
   They also lost the season series to the Padres for the first
time since 1995. San Diego won five of the teams' eight games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Padres, not the Cubs, who looked like they were in
for a long afternoon on a hot, sticky day. After Witasick
alternated strikeouts with walks to the first four batters he
faced, Greene lofted the first pitch he saw to deep left for the
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   But Tapani got into trouble in the fourth, and the Padres just
kept hitting him. After Tapani walked Desi Relaford, Nevin homered.
</P>
<P>
   The 34 homers this season tie Tapani's career high, set in 1996
when he was with the White Sox. The club record is 38 by Warren
Hacker in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez tied the game in the fifth with an RBI double, and the
Padres went ahead on Witasick's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs tied it on an RBI single by Mark Grace in the fifth,
but the Padres erupted for four runs and five hits in the sixth.
Mike Darr hit an RBI single and Gonzalez hit an RBI double to chase
Tapani.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Farnsworth relieved, but he didn't have any more luck. The
first batter he faced was DeHaan, who promptly homered.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garibay, normally a starter, pitched the ninth to give
the bullpen some relief, but instead gave up three runs and two
hits in just 1-3 of an inning. After loading the bases with a walk
to Ryan Klesko, Garibay was relieved by Todd Van Poppel, who gave
up the two-run single to Nevin.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cubs OF Ross Gload, recalled from Triple-A Iowa after
Wednesday's game, was in the lineup Thursday. He went 0-for-4,
striking out twice. ... With the gametime temperature at 88 and the
humidity making it feel even worse, home plate umpire John Shulock
draped a wet towel around his neck for most of the afternoon. ...
This was only the second time in Witasick's six starts that the
game was decided by more than two runs.

<HEADLINE> Newfangled NFL Coming To You  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   From UmpCams to Dennis Miller, the NFL and its broadcasters are
employing all sorts of gimmicks for the season that starts this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call it the XFL factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this a reaction to the XFL? I don't think so,'' CBS Sports
executive producer Terry Ewert said of the UmpCams, which were
approved for use Thursday. ''Before the XFL was ever out there, the
NFL was progressive in looking at what the broadcasters were
requesting over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   When World Wrestling Federation guru Vince McMahon introduced
his new league, which starts play in 2001, he promised miniature
cameras in some players' helmets and microphones in huddles and on
the sidelines. NBC, shut out in the last NFL rights go-round, is a
part-owner of the XFL and will televise its games.
</P>
<P>
   The XFL might need such stunts, since it won't have Peyton
Manning, Terrel Davis or Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's game product can stand on its own, the TV types say.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all is said and done, it's still about the quality of the
game on the field, and if you go back 15-20 years to a Green Bay
Packers' Lombardi-era game, the technology wasn't what it was
today, but anybody who watched those games would say they were not
only exciting but they were memorable,'' Fox Sports president Ed
Goren said. ''Matchups with something at stake and games that live
up to the expectations -- that may be more important than what we do
from our end.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is plenty up the broadcasters' sleeves
heading into the new season:
</P>
<P>
   -- The UmpCam, a tiny camera affixed to the brim of the umpire's
cap, gives an in-your-face view of the line of scrimmage. Fox plans
to use it for three games Sunday (Panthers at Redskins, Cardinals
at Giants, Eagles at Cowboys), while CBS will use it for the Jets'
game at the Packers. The networks lobbied for NFL approval. ''We
like the look of it, although if we had to critique some of the
umpires out there, we need them to level their brim a little more
so we don't get a slanted view,'' Ewert said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   -- The selection of Miller for the ''Monday Night Football''
booth has drawn the most attention. ABC is hoping the comedian will
help counter the WWF's draw of young male viewers. Weekly wrestling
telecasts on USA Network outdrew ''Monday Night Football'' by 47
percent in the male 12-to-14 category last season.
</P>
<P>
   -- CBS moved ''NFL Today'' to a studio in midtown Manhattan,
hoping to energize the show with an outdoor audience.
</P>
<P>
   -- MTV will produce the halftime show when CBS airs the Super
Bowl on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   -- The league is allowing players to be interviewed on TV at
halftime for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   -- Restrictions were relaxed to allow more network doubleheaders
in individual TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   Average ratings for NFL games were up on both Fox and CBS last
season, the first time since 1985 that both the AFC and NFC primary
networks saw their Nielsen numbers rise. ESPN's ratings also went
up. ''Monday Night Football,'' though, has seen ratings decrease
each of the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Preseason NFL ratings have been down across the board, in part
because of kickoff time changes, and the league predicts that will
continue when the games count.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not concerned about the bigger picture -- the overall
popularity of the NFL. We're confident that's as strong as ever,''
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can tell you right now, ratings will probably be down this
year for two simple reasons. One is the additional competition from
the Olympics. The other reason is we're starting on Labor Day; last
year we didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will start the season a week after Labor Day from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one more change to try to keep viewers tuning in.

<HEADLINE> China's No. 2 leader is served in New York with lawsuit alleging abuse </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Li Peng, the premier of China at the time of the
1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, was served Thursday
with a civil lawsuit alleging massive human rights abuses occurred
after he declared martial law.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed under seal Monday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, was made public after Li's security personnel received
the lawsuit, said Jennie Green, an attorney at the Center for
Constitutional Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Li, now chairman of China's national legislature and
the second-most powerful figure in the Chinese Communist Party,
could be served because he is visiting New York to attend the
Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments at the
United Nations this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''You bring your crimes with you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Li has been a target of victims of the government crackdown who
point out that he went on national television to declare martial
law two weeks before a military crackdown killed hundreds of people
in June 1989, ending seven weeks of protests.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Chinese government described the protests as an
attempt to overthrow Communist Party rule. Demands for a government
investigation into the crackdown and compensation for victims have
been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   A message for comment left Thursday with the Chinese Consulate
in Manhattan was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit sought unspecified damages on behalf of those who
were ''summarily executed, arbitrarily detained and subjected to
other gross human rights abuses as a deliberate policy to
indiscriminately inflict deadly violence on the civilian
population.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence occurred after the Chinese government ordered its
military to crush demonstrations it described as a
''counterrevolutionary rebellion'' to protect stability and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Li bears responsibility for the crackdown on demonstrators in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, according to four plaintiffs in the
lawsuit who spoke at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want justice,'' said Feng Suo Zhou, who was jailed for one
year in China after he was placed on the ''Most Wanted List'' of
student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests. He came to the
United States in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe justice is on our side, no matter where we are,
China or America,'' he said. ''We want justice. This is a first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Liming Zhang, whose sister was shot to death by troops during
the crackdown, said he joined the lawsuit seeking damages on behalf
of all the victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last year, we have sought redress but have gotten no
response,'' he said. ''Eleven years have passed but so far the
government has not even issued an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, relatives of people killed and injured during the
protests submitted a petition to China's top prosecutor demanding
an official investigation of the protests. A year later, they said
they had gotten no response while the prosecutor's office said it
had not received the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in Manhattan said it was relying for legal
authority on the Alien Torts Claims Act, which permits claims of
torture occurring outside the United States to be heard in U.S.
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said they hoped to win damages similar to a recent jury
award of $745 million to victims of atrocities committed by the
soldiers of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 10 verdict in Manhattan came after women testified that
they were raped repeatedly by Serbian soldiers in a campaign of
so-called ''ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   During a speech at the United Nations Wednesday, Li said the
world would be led astray if certain countries ''attempt to impose
their own social system, development model or values on others
under various pretexts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was the duty of the Presiding Officers of National
Parliaments ''to listen to the people, reflect their will and
safeguard their legitimate rights and interests.'
</P>
<P>
   He said China in the past two decades had carried out a
political structural reform ''to build up democracy and improve the
legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With respect for and protection of human rights and democracy,
our country will achieve sustainable development,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 112; Nasdaq Gains 103  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors optimistic that the U.S. economy is
growing at a healthy but non-inflationary pace sent stocks broadly
higher Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq
composite index each gained more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 112.09 to 11,215.10, a mirror image of Wednesday's
drop of 112.09. The average was up nearly 200 points during
afternoon trading Thursday, but some of its gains were lost in a
late burst of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 102.54 at 4,206.35, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 15.09 at 1,517.68.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expressed surprise at Thursday's surge, but said
it was a sign of confidence in the market. Late August, especially
the days leading up to the Labor Day weekend, are traditionally a
slow time for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just optimism,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore. ''We're looking at a higher
market in the fall ... driven by the idea that the Fed is likely to
not increase interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over the
past 14 months as part of a strategy to cool down the economy and
slow inflation. Last week, it passed on a chance to raise rates
again, and it is not expected to consider the issue again until
after the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the government said orders to U.S. factories
posted their biggest-ever one-month drop, further proof that the
economy is slowing, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think investors feel that as ... they come back from
vacation, they're going to see interest rates down, relatively
benign inflation, double-digit corporate earnings and feel very,
very good about the economy,'' said Donald Berdine, chief
investment officer for PNC Advisors in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and financial stocks were among the most active
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're seeing technology stocks strengthen: Intel, Dell and
Microsoft are all up,'' said Greg Nie, senior vice president for
technical research at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''The Dow
is also being helped in particular by J.P. Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan rose $16.13 to $167.19. Financial stocks were in favor
Thursday after Wednesday's announcement that Credit Suisse First
Boston planned to buy Donald Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette for $11.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $1.38 to $74.88; Dell climbed $3.69 to $43.63.
Microsoft was up most of Thursday but ended down 18.75 cents at
$69.81. Gateway jumped $2.25 to $68.10.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks might have been even higher if not for some disappointing
retail sales numbers, which would seem to confirm analysts'
suspicions that second-half consumer spending is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Gap Inc. fell $3.19 to $22.38, a day after the casual
clothing retailer reported a 14 percent decline in sales at stores
open at least a year during August.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were stronger at Sears and Wal-Mart, but their stocks
slipped lower. Sears dropped 43.75 cents to $31.19, and Wal-Mart
fell 18.75 cents to $48.
</P>
<P>
   Most department stores including J.C. Penney, which dropped
$1.19 to $14 Thursday, continued to flail.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the federal government was expected to release
employment figures, which could provide more information on how
fast the economy is growing. The National Association of Purchasing
Mangement report on the manufacturing sector was also due out.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume on the floor of the Big
Board came to 1.33 billion shares as of 4 p.m., up from 1 billion
shares in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.40 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.43 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.87 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of
smaller-company stocks, rose 5.56 to 537.89.

<HEADLINE> Wolfpack Suspends Four Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina State has suspended four
players for its opener against Arkansas State, with three to miss
the game for unspecified team infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chuck Amato announced the suspensions Thursday, saying
linebacker William Pannell, defensive tackle Nate Goodson and
offensive lineman Alex Rice violated team rules.
</P>
<P>
   The three players were not expected to start in Saturday's game,
but all are key reserves for the Wolfpack. Goodson was a starter
last year, and Rice started several games in 1998 before a knee
injury forced him to miss all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   All three are expected to play in N.C. State's game against
Indiana on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Willie Wright also will miss the game. Amato said
Wright failed to meet academic obligations and would not be allowed
to participate in games until he had done so.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic department officials said Wright's suspension stemmed
from an apparent misunderstanding over the completion of a summer
school course requirement.

<HEADLINE> Wet summer weather gives merchants mixed season at the shore  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Jim Lombardo hasn't seen a sunny weekend at
the shore since July, and that hasn't helped his bike rental shop
in Wildwood.
</P>
<P>
   Business at Green's Bike Rental has been off at least 20
percent, Lombardo said. Weak pedestrian traffic on the boardwalk
has meant a slow summer for his nearby clothing shop as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe the weekend forecasts just scared (the
visitors) away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a similar story for the Great American Fun Shop on the
Ocean City boardwalk. Jerry Hartzel said his business was down 20
percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of it was weather related. There were so many cool days
and rainy days that the day people and the weekend people didn't
come down at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cool days made for slightly more traffic in the store by day,
but nights, when a majority of his business is done, were slow.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it has been bad for everyone. This summer's wet, cool
weather hasn't been what town officials and merchants hoped for,
but several said they haven't noticed a decrease in business.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Mack said the weather didn't affect his pizza shops much
because it's an established business with loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a good summer,'' said the owner of Mack's Pizza in
Wildwood. ''I would say it's just about the same (as last year).''
</P>
<P>
   The rain didn't scare away visitors to Gillian's Wonderland Pier
in Ocean City, according to owner Gillian Roy. While last year's
warm, dry weather made a great season for the amusement park, Roy
was happy with the turnout this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Believe it or not between the rain drops we did very good,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Aqua Trails, a kayak rental company in Cape May, the cool,
damp weather wasn't enough to throw cold water on summer business.
It was up about 15 percent over 1999, said owner Mike Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the weather's bad, there's basically only four things to
do - eat, drink, shop or go to the movies. If it's raining, they
won't even go shopping because they don't want to get wet. But
people will go kayaking in almost any weather, unless it's really
windy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beach tag sales didn't suffer much. In Avalon sales were less
than 1 percent below last year, said chief financial officer James
Craft. The town had projected an increase in sales this year,
though, because of an incentive program for badge inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May has sold 1,361 more tags than last year, city
administrator Luciano Corea said. The municipality earned about
$965,000 in revenue as of last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Depending on the weather this week, we would hope we can
generate $1 million,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug May Help Stubborn Asthma  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- A study suggests that an experimental
drug could halve the number of asthma attacks suffered by people
whose condition isn't well controlled with current treatment --
about 15 percent of all asthma patients, a researcher said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The first major study of the injectable drug, presented Thursday
at the World Congress on Lung Health, also found that it allowed
half of patients to stop using steroid inhalers and the rest to
reduce their dependence on them, said Dr. Stephen Holgate, who led
the study.
</P>
<P>
   Steroids have been linked to dangerous side effects, such as
osteoporosis and stunted growth in children.
</P>
<P>
   The medication, Xolair, acts earlier in the cascade of reactions
that lead to an asthma attack than other treatments, said Holgate,
an asthma researcher with the Medical Research Council in London
and a professor at England's Southampton University.
</P>
<P>
   ''This discovery is really the first major step forward in the
treatment of asthma that we've had in the last 20 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking the drug had half the number of asthma attacks as
subjects who did not receive it. Their lungs functioned better and
they were less often admitted to the hospital with asthma attacks.
Some of the patients started improving two weeks into the 18-month
study, and no serious side effects were reported, according to the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study were presented at a session sponsored
by one of the drug's makers, Novartis AG of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an excellent result,'' said Dr. Mitchell Friedman, head
of the lung center at Tulane University in New Orleans, who was not
connected with the research. ''It may transform asthma treatment,
certainly in allergic asthma, but there are a whole lot of things
that influence inflammation in asthma. Whether this will be the
major one remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Xolair is the first in a new class of drugs that target a
chemical in the blood, called IgE, that is involved early in the
string of events that lead to the development of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma -- a respiratory condition that afflicts about 150 million
people worldwide -- is caused when irritants prompt the airways to
narrow. About 80 percent of asthma cases are brought on by allergic
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   When people breathe in substances they are allergic to, IgE is
released into the blood and attaches itself to cells lining the
respiratory tract on structures called receptors, triggering
allergic reactions that lead to asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Holgate said that the drug, genetically engineered using mouse
genes grafted onto a human antibody, blocks the ability of IgE to
trigger inflammation by introducing a substance that binds with it
before it has a chance to attach to the cells in the airway.
</P>
<P>
   When the influence of IgE is eliminated, the number of receptors
linked to it also drop by about 1,000 times, Holgate said.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 1,300 people, including 300 children, who had
moderate or severe asthma. They were all taking inhaled steroids.
</P>
<P>
   For the first four months of the study, in addition to a fixed
dose of steroids, half the group got the new drug and half got a
fake one. In the second three months, the scientists tapered the
dose of steroids, where possible.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 19 patients taking the fake drug were admitted to
hospital with an asthma attack, compared with two patients taking
Xolair.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are substantial improvements in the quality of life in
these people taking steroids,'' Holgate said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no evidence that IgE performs any other
function in the body, but the drug's makers are continuing to study
that possibility in case the treatment knocks out any positive role
IgE may have.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, whose chemical name is omalizumab, is being developed
jointly by Novartis AG, Genentech, Inc. and Tanox Inc. Approval to
market the drug is pending in several countries.

<HEADLINE> Belcher Makes Rehab Start  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- Anaheim pitcher Tim Belcher, who has missed the
last two months with an aggravated flexor muscle in his right arm,
will make a rehab start Friday night for Double-A Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher spent the first three months of the season recovering
from off-season surgery on the muscle. He made just four starts
before going on the 60-day disabled list following a dismal start
on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, a 10-3 loss to Oakland, the right-hander lasted
just one-third of an inning, allowing seven runs, five hits and
three walks. His ERA ballooned from 4.97 to 9.69.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is 144-137 lifetime in his 14-year career.

<HEADLINE> Flutie Upgraded To Questionable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie's
injury status has been upgraded to questionable for the Bills'
season opener against Tennessee on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Wade Phillips said Thursday that Flutie might
serve as the team's third quarterback behind starter Rob Johnson
and backup Alex Van Pelt, but a final decision may not be made
until game time.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, previously listed as out, practiced in pads Wednesday
for the first time since tearing a groin muscle Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good enough that I can contribute,'' said Flutie,
initially expected to be out until at least the middle of
September.

<HEADLINE> No Losing in Sight for Central  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Sooner or later, it will happen. It's
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, somewhere, Central will lose a volleyball match.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened in nearly two years, but coach Megan Clayberg
knows that time will come, as surely as she knows that night
follows day.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it will be disappointing. But crushing? Clayberg
doesn't think so because even with two consecutive national
championships and 59 straight victories, her approach has never
been about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talk about getting better,'' Clayberg said. ''So if we
lose, it could be the same talk they heard when we haven't played
well and won. The hard part probably will be if we play really well
and don't win. What do you say then? It's just like, well, they
were better.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has been better than Central for a long time. Central's
last loss was UC San Diego on Oct. 16, 1998. The Dutch won the NCAA
Division III championship that year and they repeated last season
while going 41-0 and running their winning streak to 59.
</P>
<P>
   That ties the all-division winning streak set by Washington
University of St. Louis in 1991, '92 and '93. Central will break
the record if it beats Gustavus Aldophus in the first round of the
Central Invitational on Friday night. And look who'll be waiting to
play the Dutch in the second game. Yep, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had asked to play Central in the first game so it
would get first crack at ending the streak, but Clayberg declined.
She felt too much was being made of the streak already and didn't
want to add to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't done anything yet this year,'' she said. ''It's a
clean slate across the board. We need to prove ourselves all over
again. We set our goals high. We have a goal of winning the
national title, but that's not even what we're talking about now.
There are too many small stepping stones to get to that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of them was to have a successful preseason and they did
work hard. We're on the right pace, on the right track to get to
that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Central returns five of its six starters, including first-team
All-Americans Candace Wilson and Angie Nielsen. But the one loss
was huge: two-time national player of the year Abbie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had a presence about her that inspired confidence in her
teammates. Someone else has to fill that role now and Wilson, a
6-foot-1 senior from Britt, is the logical choice.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, however, has not been on the court much recently. She
studied in London last winter and spring and spent a month in
Mongolia this summer. But what she lost in her conditioning, she
made up for in other ways, Clayberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has really grown personally,'' the Central coach said.
''She's just glowing in confidence and is carrying that onto the
floor. She may not be in great physical condition, but we'll get
her to where she needs to be. She's doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen also was gone over the summer, spending six weeks on a
mission in Kenya. Another veteran, Steph Gerdes, was in Guatemala
for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a great experience for them to draw from,''
Clayberg said. ''It just really puts things in perspective. And
when you keep it in perspective, you don't get all wrung out about
the wins and the records and the titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, Clayberg hopes, about that loss when it comes.

<HEADLINE> Under Lucent spinoff, shareholders will get stock in new company  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Lucent Technologies stockholders will
receive a special dividend of all the common stock of Avaya Inc., a
new company the telecommunications giant will spin off by the end
of September.
</P>
<P>
   Avaya comprises the three businesses under Lucent's Enterprise
Networks Group, which sells business telephone networks, voice and
data switches for those networks, voice messaging systems such as
its popular Intuity AUDIX, and other equipment and services to
''enterprises.'' Those include government agencies and large and
small businesses, as opposed to the telephone companies and
Internet service providers that are Lucent's primary customers.
</P>
<P>
   Avaya will be based in Basking Ridge near Lucent's headquarters
in Murray Hill. It will begin operating as a world leader in call
centers, messaging systems and cable equipment that links
telephones and computers inside companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll start out with about an $8 billion-a-year business,''
said Lucent spokesman Bill Price.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said Thursday that the spinoff will be complete on Sept.
30, the end of its 2000 fiscal year. On that date, Avaya shares
will be distributed to everyone holding Lucent shares as of Sept.
20.
</P>
<P>
   Trading after the stock is issued will determine the stock price
and market capitalization, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent shareholders will receive one share of Avaya common stock
for every 12 Lucent shares they hold, creating about 275 million
Avaya shares, according to Price. Any fractional shares will be
distributed as cash, and that cash will be the only portion of the
stock distribution subject to federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's stock fell 94 cents to $41.88 in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock has plunged from $84 per share last
December before the company warned of unexpected weakness in its
revenues and profits, partly due to production problems with
popular new products.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, a former AT&AMP;T unit that has made a number of
restructuring moves over the past year, announced the spinoff of
the underperforming enterprise network business on March 1. Company
executives said it would allow Lucent to focus more on serving
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Avaya, which brought in about 20 percent of Lucent's total
revenues, will have 34,000 employees and nearly one million
business customers in more than 90 countries. Those customers
include more than three-fourths of the Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which has about 116,000 other employees and total annual
revenues of about $38 billion, plans by next spring to spin off its
$4 billion-a-year microelectronics business, which has 16,000
employees. That business makes silicon chips and optoelectronic
components such as lasers used to build the telephone, wireless and
Internet communications systems Lucent sells.

	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) - A 20-year-old woman who escaped from police
more than two weeks ago was recaptured Thursday in Pittsfield,
Mass., police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Rivera was arrested Aug. 15 after she and three others were
found in a car containing 86 grams of crack cocaine. The three
others in the car were witness to an earlier shooting of two men on

shooting but was wanted for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   While in a second-floor interview room, Rivera slipped out of
her handcuffs and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Rome City Police got a tip that Rivera escaped to Pittsfield and
contacted police there. She was caught Thursday when police spotted
her walking into a house. She at first denied who she was but a

</P>
<P>
   She was arraigned as a fugitive of justice and waived
extradition back to Rome.

<HEADLINE> Putin Lashes Out At Tycoons, Media  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- In a rare public display of anger, President
Vladimir Putin accused business tycoons and independent media of
ruining the country's military and sought to distance himself from
the legacy of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks, made at last week's closed meeting with
relatives of 118 seamen who died when the nuclear submarine Kursk
sank, were his strongest criticism yet of the so-called oligarchs --
the magnates who acquired their fortunes thanks in part to close
links with the Kremlin during Boris Yeltsin's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have embezzled enough, bought up the media, and are now
manipulating public opinion,'' Putin said, according to a
transcript of an audio tape published by the Vlast weekly. The
magazine belongs to the most politically aggressive of all Russia's
tycoons: Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's government has been harshly criticized in Russia and
abroad for its initial reluctance to accept foreign aid, which was
offered immediately after the Kursk exploded and sank in the
Barents Sea on Aug. 12. Russia's own rescue efforts were bungled by
the lack of deep-sea divers, but the authorities agreed to invite
British and Norwegian rescue teams only after a four-day delay.
</P>
<P>
   Facing tears and angry shouts at the Aug. 22 meeting at the
Vidyayevo submarine base, Putin defended himself and the military,
saying the authorities had done all they could. He quickly blamed
the failure of the salvage efforts on the economic turmoil that
resulted from the chaotic reforms of his predecessors -- Mikhail
Gorbachev and Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready to account for the 100 days that I have been
president. As for the previous 15 years, I'm ready to sit on the
same bench with you and pose these questions to others.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's statements appeared aimed at deflecting
criticism rather than signaling a new attack on the oligarchs or an
attempt to sever his links with Yeltsin's era.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin owes his election victory to Yeltsin's team,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Moscow
office. ''His statement is no more than a public relations effort,
an attempt to shift the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed with questions about the Russian Navy's bungled rescue
effort, Putin said the answer lies in the pitiful state of the
military, which is struggling to survive a drastic funding
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ''As for rescue equipment, it has been ruined and there isn't a
fig left,'' he said. ''There isn't a fig left in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the nation could no longer afford a huge army and
should drastically cut the number of men and weapons in order to
increase military wages and the army's combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Putin pointed at the tycoons as the culprits for Russia's
economic and military decay, saying they had their media ''lie''
about the disaster in order to blackmail the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people on television, ... who for 10 years were destroying
the army and the navy where people are now dying, are the first
among the army's defenders,'' Putin said. ''Their goal is to
discredit and completely ruin the army and navy.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't name names, but he was clearly referring to both
Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky -- the owners of Russia's largest
media empires.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to influence the mass audience in order to show the
military and political leadership that we need them (the media),
that we are on their hook and must fear and obey them and let them
further rob the country, the army and the navy,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has previously sought to distance himself from the
oligarchs, and the authorities earlier this year took action
against some of the nation's largest companies, accusing them of
tax evasion or illegal privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky, whose media outlets have repeatedly criticized the
Kremlin, spent several days in jail in June on charges of
defrauding the state. The charges were later dropped -- but the case
had already provoked international concern about media freedom in
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Study puts volunteers with defibrillators in malls, nursing homes  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Picture this: you suffer a heart attack at
the local mall. Bystanders rush to call 911 and someone starts CPR,
but a heart defibrillator - which dramatically increases your
chances of survival - is likely seven to 12 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   A national study beginning this summer could mean you won't have
to wait for an ambulance for the defibrillator to arrive. In 24
cities, the machine - which shocks your heart back into a normal
rhythm through pads applied to the chest - could be as close as a
mall security guard or store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Public Access Defibrillation Trial say
putting defibrillators and trained, non-medical staff in areas with
large numbers of people, such as malls, senior centers, hotels,
office buildings or sports venues, could save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that citizen CPR saves lives,'' says MaryAnn McBurnie,
project director for the PAD clinical trial center at the
University of Washington in Seattle. When someone has a cardiac
arrest ''it results in a better chance of survival for the victim
if someone performs CPR. But ultimately, the victim needs to be
defibrillated.''
</P>
<P>
   Every minute victims suffer cardiac arrest without
defibrillation decreases survival chances by 10 percent. Joseph
Brent Muhlestein, director of cardiology research for Intermountain
Health Care, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''An immediate defibrillation after arrest is almost always
effective at regaining the person to an appropriate rhythm,'' says
Muhlestein, who is not affiliated with the project. ''There are all
kinds of reasons to say that the best defibrillation is the one
that occurs as soon as possible after the arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   The project will train up to 480 volunteers at 40 sites
throughout the Salt Lake Valley. As they will nationally, staff at
half the sites will only be trained in CPR while the others also
get defibrillators, according to Brent Shaum, a field coordinator
for the project who works at Salt Lake City's Intermountain Injury
Control Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first national effort to examine the usefulness
of defibrillators in public spots. Last year the American Red Cross
began a pilot program in about a dozen cities with the same goal.
Defibrillators also have been put aboard commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   McBurnie says the project is a unique collaboration:
defibrillator manufacturers have donated about 3,000 of the
machines, fire departments have volunteered to help teach CPR and
project participants like Shaum will do all the other training.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year study also has the backing of the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to participate was an easy one for Hogle Zoo in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have over 750,000 visitors a year and so it's appropriate
for us to have it,'' says marketing coordinator Stacey Phillips.
''With that number of visitors, you never know what could possibly
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaum says there is little danger in the project because the
machines - which verbally direct people on their use - will work on
people who are in cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason why we can do this in a public setting is that
the machines are designed in a manner that will read or analyze a
shockable rhythm, and that is the only thing it will allow you to
shock,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Mickelson, a Sandy City Fire Department medical officer,
also says she supports the project and that it will incur very
little risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people can do this,'' she says. ''I think people are
worried about accidentally shocking people, but that's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Salt Lake, the study will take place in Calgary
and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Birmingham, Ala.; Washington, D.C.;
Chicago; Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; New
York; Newark, N.J.; Phoenix; Pittsburgh; Portland, Ore.; Richmond
and Virginia Beach, Va.; Seattle; Palm Springs, Mission Viejo, and
Riverside, Calif.; Stony Brook and Syracuse N.Y.; Vancouver, Wash.;
and Detroit.

<HEADLINE> US, Iranian lawmakers meet for first time since 1979 revolution  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - For the first time since the Islamic revolution
two decades ago, a group of American and Iranian lawmakers met and
discussed U.S. sanctions against Tehran, the treatment of Iranian
Jews and other issues dividing the two countries, participants said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both Iran and the United States stressed that the
20-minute discussion Wednesday night at a museum reception was an
unofficial ''bumping into'' - not a formal, sit-down meeting -
although both sides knew the other would be attending.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, participants said the discussion was a significant yet
small step in the warming of relations that has followed the 1997
election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami and has included a
recent easing of American sanctions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 22 years of freeze, at least it's a good step that we
were in the same room together and nothing bad happened,'' said
Rep. Robert Ney, an Ohio Republican who favors increased dialogue
with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said the
meeting was just ''one step removed'' from official
government-to-government contacts, which were severed after radical
followers of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took 52 Americans hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're looking for here is to break the ice,'' Specter
said in a statement. ''So if you take what President Khatami has
been saying, I think the time is right to start a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Ney said they hoped the informal gathering, which
was first reported by USA Today, would be followed by a planned
exchange of lawmakers - an invitation extended to the Iranians in
letters from House and Senate members several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two U.S. lawmakers were joined by Reps. Eliot Engel and Gary
Ackerman, both Democrats from New York state, at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art reception sponsored by the American Iranian Council,
which seeks improved relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   They met with the speaker of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, Mehdi
Karrubi, and four other Iranian lawmakers who are in New York for a
meeting of world parliament leaders at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Karrubi, a one-time hard-liner who now favors the democratic
reforms sought by Khatami, told a press conference Thursday that he
lodged several complaints with the congressmen, including the fact
that two of his delegation members were denied visas for the U.N.
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But more significantly, he said he complained about continuing
U.S. ''hostility'' towards Iran - particularly the continuation of
economic sanctions and the federal law that requires nonimmigrant
Iranian visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed upon arrival
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''In connection to the people of the U.S., the government and
the nation of Iran has no problem,'' Karrubi said he told the
congressmen. ''But the problem is being created by the Congress and
the U.S. administration. They are hostile towards us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, who is Jewish, said he raised the issue of the plight
of the 10 Iranian Jews who were convicted July 1 of spying for
Israel and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 13
years. The proceedings drew condemnation from Israel and criticism
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mouris Motamed, the single Jewish representative in Iran's
290-seat parliament, said he was hopeful the Jews would receive a
''lighter'' sentence when their appeals are heard Sept. 5, but he
stressed that Iran's judiciary - which is controlled by Iran's
hard-liners - worked separately from parliament, which is now
controlled by reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Farzin Hashemi, a spokesman for the National Council of
Resistance of Iran, an Iranian opposition group in exile, dismissed
the significance of the meeting, saying the United States rightly
has maintained a distance from the Tehran regime for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming outside the country and smiling to the Western audience
is just a way to really divert the public attention and the
politicians here from the real issue which is the ongoing
violations of human rights, ongoing support for terrorism and the
effort by the clerical regime to acquire weapons of mass
destruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council has been listed by the State Department as
an alias for the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq, which it describes as
a terrorist organization.

<HEADLINE> American Woman in Lima for New Trial  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Lori Berenson, an American woman jailed for
treason in Peru, arrived in the capital Thursday for a new trial
after a life sentence handed down by a secret military court was
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, had spent nearly five years in prison before the
top military court announced three days ago that it had overturned
her life sentence, paving the way for a new trial in a civilian
court, a longtime demand of U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the state prosecutor handling the case on Thursday
confidently predicted the New York native would receive a minimum
20-year sentence in the civilian trial.
</P>
<P>
   Television images showed police patting down a bespectacled
Berenson, dressed in jeans and a burgundy sweater, before she was
led aboard a commercial flight in the southern city of Arequipa,
475 miles southeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later in Lima, Berenson was taken in an armored vehicle
led by a heavily guarded police motorcade to the maximum security
wing of the Santa Monica women's prison.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson was found guilty of treason by a military tribunal in
January 1996, accused of helping the rebel Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Since being convicted, Berenson has been held in two prisons. In
1998, she was moved from the a high mountain jail cell to a prison
in Arequipa after complaining of harsh prison conditions and poor
treatment by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's Supreme Council of Military Justice on Monday admitted
that in light of new evidence, Berenson was not a leader of the
rebel group, a crucial legal element to her previous conviction.
The case was handed for retrial to the civilian court.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, state prosecutor
Maria del Pilar Peralta she had filed seven charges against
Berenson, but declined to specify the charges.
</P>
<P>
   She described the state's evidence as ''abundant'' and able to
clearly link Berenson to the now all but defunct Peruvian rebel
group -- known by its Spanish initials, MRTA.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta said she expected the trial to center around new
testimony by government officials held hostage during the rebel
group's 1996 takeover of the Japanese ambassador's residence in
Lima, during which they held 72 hostages for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta said the officials would provide evidence implicating
Berenson in the leftist guerrilla movement.
</P>
<P>
   The government officials ''supposedly talked with members of the
MRTA who said she was a collaborator,'' Peralta said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have criticized Peru's judicial system, saying
trials in its military courts, as well as those for terrorism in
civilian courts, do not meet internationally accepted standards of
due process.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's case will now be reviewed by a prosecutor and a judge
in closed-door hearings that could last up to 50 days. Once the
evidence has been scrutinized, the prosecutor and judge will make
an initial ruling, which will then be reviewed by a Superior Court.
The process is secret.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty, Berenson would then appear in an open trial
before the Supreme Court, with the burden of proving her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's parents have led a campaign for her release,
condemning harsh conditions she has lived under in Peruvian prisons
and saying their daughter was innocent, working in Peru as a
journalist.

<HEADLINE> Corzine releases tax 'summary' with $44 million in earnings but zero details </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine on
Thursday released a single-page summary of his 1999 earnings of $44
million as reported to the IRS, and then promised to release a
detailed tax return listing all of his assets after the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, the GOP nominee, and Republican Gov.
Christie Whitman, among others, have chastised the millionaire
Democrat throughout the year for failing to make public a detailed
report of his personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's opponent in the Democratic primary, former Gov. Jim
Florio, made similar attacks. Corzine spent more than $36 million
in the primary to defeat Florio, all but about $2 million of it his
own money. His campaign has estimated his personal wealth at about
$400 million, and his spending of that wealth this year shattered
records in any race for a seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-return summary released Thursday shows an income of
$43.936 million for 1999, which could be less than Corzine actually
earned since income averaging across several years is permitted by
the IRS in many such cases.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it has been reported that on the day he led
Goldman Sachs into issuing stock for public sale in May 1999 - an
idea Corzine developed and saw to fruition - he saw his personal
stock holdings increase in value by more than $70 million in eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The summary released Thursday showed Corzine had itemized
deductions of $15.6 million in 1999, presumably for charitable
donations and capital value losses, and that he owed $9.9 million
in federal tax. He was able to apply $3.3 million in credits to
reduce his tax to $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine released a similar tax summary during the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Franks campaign issued a statement denouncing the tax
summary as inadequate and insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon Corzine has ignored the resounding call from newspapers
and public officials to tell us the truth, and has instead made a
mockery of the concept of public disclosure by trying to pass off a
brief summary as real information,'' said a news release from the
Franks campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign manager Charlie Smith said voters have a right to know
to which states or foreign countries Corzine pays taxes, as well as
the source of the wealth he is using to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine continues to maintain he is limited in how much
tax-return detail he can make public because of partnership
contracts he has with others at the Goldman Sachs investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   However, Corzine's campaign Thursday said he would release such
detailed returns in the future when the contract expires after this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corzine is legally prohibited from releasing his full tax
returns by a contract signed while still employed by the Wall
Street investment firm of Goldman Sachs. Upon the expiration of the
contract in the year 2000, Corzine has pledged to release all of
his future tax returns,'' a statement from his campaign said.

<HEADLINE> Rome's Mayor Looks to Premier Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli indicated on Thursday
that he is willing to take on media magnate Silvio Berlusconi in
the race to be Italy's next premier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm at the service of my country,'' Rutelli told RAI state TV
Thursday night when asked if he was ready to be the center-left
candidate in the elections that must be held by spring when
Parliament's term runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Until mid-August, Premier Giuliano Amato was considered the
likely challenger for Berlusconi, whose center-right opposition
bloc has been consistently leading in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Rutelli captured the nation's attention for his smooth
managing of the movements of 2 million young pilgrims who poured
into the capital for the Vatican's World Youth Day events.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor then began discussions with Amato on who would be the
center-left's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the nine parties in Amato's coalition have been
squabbling for months but have tried to play down any cracks in the
coalition over the choice of a candidate for premier.
</P>
<P>
   Some coalition leaders have been pressing for a decision soon so
a challenge can be mounted against the popular Berlusconi.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- Despite drawing the outside No. 8 post
position Thursday, Astreos was made the 2-1 morning-line favorite
for the $331,350 Cane Pace at Freehold Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Tyberwood, the 1999 juvenile pacing colt of the year, drew the
rail and was made the 5-2 second choice for the Labor Day race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm both relieved and thrilled by the draw,'' said Gary
Machiz, the trainer of Tyberwood. ''I think that Astreos drawing
post eight is even more significant than us drawing the rail
because he'll have to go a huge trip to win. Tyberwood loves this
track. He's always got around it really well''.
</P>
<P>
   Tyberwood, who will be driven by Richard Silverman, won his Cane
elimination in 1:54.1.
</P>
<P>
   Astreos, who will have Chris Christoforou in the bike, took his
division in 1:51.4, equaling the track record set by Blissful Hall
in last year's Cane Final.
</P>
<P>
   Art Dot Com, an 8-1 long shot with David Miller in the bike,

<HEADLINE> American woman arrives in Peru capital for new trial on terrorism charges </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) - Lori Berenson, an American woman jailed for
treason in Peru, arrived in the capital Thursday for a new trial
after a life sentence handed down by a secret military court was
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, had spent nearly five years in prison before the
top military court announced three days ago that it had overturned
her life sentence, paving the way for a new trial in a civilian
court, a longtime demand of U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the state prosecutor handling the case on Thursday
confidently predicted the New York native would receive a minimum
20-year sentence in the civilian trial.
</P>
<P>
   Television images showed police patting down a bespectacled
Berenson, dressed in jeans and a burgundy sweater, before she was
led aboard a commercial flight in the southern city of Arequipa,
475 miles southeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later in Lima, Berenson was taken in an armored vehicle
led by a heavily guarded police motorcade to the maximum security
wing of the Santa Monica women's prison.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson was found guilty of treason by a military tribunal in
January 1996, accused of helping the rebel Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Since being convicted, Berenson has been held in two prisons. In
1998, she was moved from the a high mountain jail cell to a prison
in Arequipa after complaining of harsh prison conditions and poor
treatment by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's Supreme Council of Military Justice on Monday admitted
that in light of new evidence, Berenson was not a leader of the
rebel group, a crucial legal element to her previous conviction.
The case was handed for retrial to the civilian court.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, state prosecutor
Maria del Pilar Peralta she had filed seven charges against
Berenson, but declined to specify the charges.
</P>
<P>
   She described the state's evidence as ''abundant'' and able to
clearly link Berenson to the now all but defunct Peruvian rebel
group - known by its Spanish initials, MRTA.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta said she expected the trial to center around new
testimony by government officials held hostage during the rebel
group's 1996 takeover of the Japanese ambassador's residence in
Lima, during which they held 72 hostages for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta said the officials would provide evidence implicating
Berenson in the leftist guerrilla movement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bradley Turns Down USOC Job  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley turned
down an invitation to become chairman of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, but will likely join the USOC's board of directors later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who was approached in July, seriously considered taking
the position but wasn't sure he could devote the time necessary to
do the job properly, the head of the USOC's nominating committee
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley will be nominated for the board of directors,
along with other notables such as Henry Kissinger and Cleveland
Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund at the organization's meeting in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is willing to get involved and will be nominated,'' said
Steve Richards, head of the USOC nominating committee.
</P>
<P>
   A list of officers and board members recommended by the
nominating committee was obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended Paul George, a lawyer and longtime
member of the board, to be the new chairman, replacing William
Hybl, who is stepping down after one term and is expected to be
named later this month to the board of the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   George has been a board member since 1989, representing figure
skating and, later, hockey. He has served as a vice president the
last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel ready,'' George said. ''I think this is the next
logical step for me.''
</P>
<P>
   George said he didn't feel that he was a second choice to
Bradley, and thought the nominating committee was right in feeling
Bradley out about the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great American,'' George said. ''He would have done a
great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards said that after Bradley turned the job down, the
committee considered George and Sandra Baldwin, a former president
of U.S. Swimming, to be the new chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Under the USOC's reorganization under new executive director
Norm Blake, the president's position held by Hybl becomes a
position of chairman, with less responsibility for day-to-day
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were two very respected, experienced people considered,'
Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   If no other candidates are put forward by petition by Oct. 18,
the slate recommended by the nominating committee will be the only
one presented for a vote by the board of directors at its Dec. 2-3
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, Gund and Kissinger will become board members from the
public sector, assuming the board agrees to expand the public
sector members by two at the meeting to include Bradley and Gund.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger will be taking an existing spot on the board
representing the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger became involved in the Olympic movement earlier when
he was named a member of the IOC 2000 reform commission, created in
the wake of the Salt Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of our goals is to gain influence in the international
movement and who better to do that than Henry Kissinger,'' Richards
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said Bradley was approached in July because the
committee thought he might bring a new perspective and stature to
the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was thinking outside the box to approach him, but we
thought it was worth a try,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was not immediately available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Ready for Friday Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken is experiencing a wide array of
emotions as he prepares for his return to the Baltimore Orioles'
lineup Friday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy, excited and nervous. Most of all, I'm looking
forward to getting back and playing,'' Ripken said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old third baseman has been on the disabled list with
lower back pain since June 28. Because he did not have the benefit
of a rehabilitative assignment, Ripken will begin his return as a
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a plan,'' he said. ''Maybe it's a nice introduction
back, eliminating certain things so I can just concentrate on the
hitting part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken will get the chance to dive for a grounder down the line
soon enough. By the end of the month, he hopes to have done
everything associated with playing third base on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Then he will make a decision about returning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always worry about my numbers, but the bigger goal is to
evaluate myself physically,'' Ripken said. ''I'd like to be able to
make a nice assessment by the end of the September.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is batting .239 with 13 home runs and 43 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Fire destroys firefighter's home; arson investigators comb through site </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) - Arson investigators searched the
still-smoldering construction site of a waterfront apartment
complex Thursday for clues to the cause of the fast-moving fire
that destroyed the site and nine homes, including one belonging to
an Edgewater firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular blaze, seen for miles in New Jersey and across
the Hudson River in New York City injured two firefighters
Wednesday night and left 100 people temporarily homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the fire at the Avalon River Mews luxury
apartment complex started on the first floor of a brick building
the farthest along in construction at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The building is across the street from firefighter Thomas
Taylor's home. Taylor and fellow firefighter Neil Menist were
putting a fence up on a balcony when they saw the fire, said
Menist's son, 12-year-old David.
</P>
<P>
   Both Taylor and Menist left to fight the fire, leaving David and
Taylor's wife in the home. About 20 minutes later, flames began
licking at the roof and the front of the home, David said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old, who said his father has taught him everything
about fire, pulled a stunned Mrs. Taylor out the back door and ran
up into the wooded hills of the Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was our only choice,'' said David. ''If we would have gone
out of the front, we probably would have died of smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire gutted the brick building and consumed what had been
started on three other structures at the site, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All you had was the wooden floors and the wooden walls'' that
quickly burned off the sheetrock, Edgewater Mayor Bryan
Christiansen said.
</P>
<P>
   A west wind blew the fire from the complex up the cliffs and
onto Undercliff Avenue, burning the homes and shearing the roof off
a three-family apartment building, police said. Heat from the fire
damaged at least 15 other homes, melting the siding off of some,
and damaged several cars, Christiansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators from the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office
were having trouble investigating the fire scene Thursday because
the site was still very hot, a spokeswoman said. The cause is under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter was treated at a hospital for heat exhaustion
and released. Another remained in stable condition at Englewood
Hospital and Medical Center with chest pains, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen said the Avalon developers had not begun to rent
the luxury one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments under
construction at Avalon River Mews. The development, one of scores
that dot the so-called Gold Coast for new, luxury office and living
space along New Jersey's side of the Hudson River, was scheduled to
open in December.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen said construction workers were working at the
property, a former Alcoa metals plant, the day of the fire until 6
p.m. He did not know the name of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   A natural gas line behind the apartment complex helped feed the
fire at the homes, authorities said, but explosions that some
residents heard were car gas tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co. spokeswoman Joie Anderson said
one valve to the gas line was shut off at 11:45 p.m. and another at
12:30 a.m. She said work crews had trouble getting their equipment
past fire trucks to turn off the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty of 70 homes that lost gas when the valve was shut off were
to return to power Thursday, she said. Twenty homes in Edgewater
remained without electricity, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Randy Livingston, acquired by the Phoenix Suns as
backcourt insurance before the 1999 playoffs, was waived Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston started the final 15 games of last season at point
guard after Jason Kidd was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston averaged 8.3 points and 3.5 assists -- nearly double
his numbers as Kidd's backup. But he never came close to Kidd's
production, and the Suns eventually talked Kevin Johnson out of
retirement for their playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston played in 64 games for Houston as a rookie in 1996-97
and 12 games for Atlanta in 1997-98 before he was released and
joined Sioux Falls of the Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns signed him on May 4, 1999, and he played in one
regular-season game.

<HEADLINE> Kemp: New Man in Northwest  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Feeling like a new man now that he's out
of Cleveland, Shawn Kemp promised Thursday that he'd be in shape
for training camp and try to fit in with a team already loaded with
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a rebirth of my career,'' Kemp said after
being introduced by the Portland Trail Blazers during a news
conference. ''You'll probably see me smile a little bit more than
what you have the past three seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp deftly handled questions about his weight, which soared
past 300 pounds last summer and brought him waves of taunts with
the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard so much about the weight the last couple years that
all I can tell you is, once I go to training camp, that won't be a
problem,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp hardly looked like the Michelin Man, but he said he's been
working out ''all summer long.'' In any regard, he said the extra
pounds actually helped him last season, when he had to play center
in place of the injured Zydrunas Ilgauska.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I did not have the little extra weight that I put on, I
honestly believe I would have suffered an injury, because I took a
lot of pounding. I've guarded every center there was in the league
the last two years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of Dale Davis from the Indiana Pacers on
Wednesday, the Blazers now have more forwards than they know what
to do with. Kemp likely will back up Rasheed Wallace at power
forward, but he also could play center behind Arvydas Sabonis and
small forward in relief of Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, a career 16.8 scorer, said he won't cause problems if his
minutes go down or he has to come off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing a role does not hurt me,'' Kemp said. ''It'll be a
challenge for me to come in and fit with a team that's already
good. Most of the time when you're going for a championship, unless
you have guys who are willing to sacrifice, you're not going to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp had his best statistical season in 1999, the year of the
lockout and his second with the Cavs. He averaged a career-high
20.5 points and 9.2 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years he's done such a tremendous job developing from
a young player into an All-Star, and now we've got a chance to
hopefully make him into a champion,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Losing took its toll, however. Cleveland made the playoffs just
once during Kemp's time there -- his first season, when the Cavs
lost in the first round. All the while Kemp was hounded for his
unwieldy contract, which will pay him $46.5 million in 2002-03 and
2003-04.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played so many years without having a big contract, to have
the big contract and not win and not have the appreciation, it
hurt,'' he said. ''I never want to be considered a guy who made a
lot of money who didn't earn it. That was the toughest thing to
deal with of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said he was glad to be working again with Blazers general
manager Bob Whitsitt, who drafted Kemp as a 19-year-old in 1989.
Kemp also will rejoin longtime Sonics assistant coach Tim Grgurich.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started off together,'' Kemp said. ''These are the guys I
worked with to create my identity, to create the Reign Man, to
create the most precious things in life that I've got.''

<HEADLINE> Annan: Olympics Share Our Ideals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations and the Olympics share
the same ideals -- tolerance, equality, fair play, and most of all
peace, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a message Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Together, the Olympics and the United Nations can be a winning
team,'' he said. ''But the contest will not be won easily. War,
intolerance and deprivation continue to stalk the earth. We must
fight back. Just as athletes strive for world records, so must we
strive for world peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan praised the International Olympic Committee for reviving
the ancient Greek tradition of the ''Olympic Truce,'' calling for
all hostilities to cease during the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I join the United Nations General Assembly in urging all those
at war to observe the Olympic Truce,'' he said. ''This may sound
unrealistic. But as any athlete will tell you, nothing happens
without a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general said there is increasing interest in the
power of sports to promote a culture of peace, and he praised the
establishment in Greece of the International Olympic Truce Center
under IOC auspices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us all now enjoy this inspiring spectacle, and let us
sustain the momentum of peace and goodwill so admirably set in
motion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general will be represented at the opening of the
games by Sergio Vieira de Mello, his special representative in East
Timor, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. flag will fly in Sydney and two U.N. representatives
will run in the Olympic Torch relay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, following a request to the secretary-general, the
International Olympic Committee authorized several East Timorese
athletes to compete as individuals, under the Olympic flag.
</P>
<P>
   Following a referendum last year to break its ties with
Indonesia, the United Nations is administering East Timor in its
transition to independence.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Add Two New Defenseman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes signed defensemen
Joel Bouchard and Dave MacIntyre to one-year contracts Thursday,
the day rookies and newcomers reported to begin training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, a 1992 seventh-round draft pick of Calgary, spent four
years with the Flames organization, appearing in a career-high 76
games in 1996-97. He joined the expansion Nashville Predators in
1998, and set career highs in assists (11) and points (15) in 64
games.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard played 52 games for the Predators last season before
being traded to the Dallas Stars, where he appeared in two games.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre spent the last two years in Europe, playing 12 games
with Berlin of the German Hockey League in 1998-99 and 31 games
with JyP Jyvaskyla of the Finnish Elite League last season.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre also has played parts of six seasons in the
International Hockey League, scoring 57 goals, 151 assists and 208
points with 330 penalty minutes in 342 games.
</P>
<P>
   He played in the American Hockey league from 1991-93.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Golfer Can Use Cart  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN (AP) -- A former teaching pro with a progressive muscle
disease will be allowed to use a cart in qualifying for U.S. Senior
Open, a federal judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   JaRo Jones of Baytown, filed a lawsuit against the United States
Golf Association, saying denying him a cart violates the Americans
with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James R. Nowlin agreed Wednesday, issuing a
permanent injunction that allows Jones to use a cart in qualifying
and the U.S. Senior Open if he advances.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just super,'' Jones said Thursday. ''This is what I
hoped for from the very beginning. All this does is level the
playing field to allow me to play at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA will appeal the injunction, spokesman Marty Parkes
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The USGA has felt all along that rules in a national golf
championships should apply equally to all players and that special
provisions should not be made for all players,'' Parkes said.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Nowlin said allowing Jones the use of a cart is a
reasonable accommodation. ''Nothing in the rules of golf requires
walking,'' Nowlin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that the USGA allows competitors to use carts
during the U.S. Senior Amateur and the U.S. Senior Women's Amateur.
The Senior PGA Tour also permits players to ride carts during
qualifying rounds and Senior Tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ''First, nothing in the rules of golf prohibits the use of a
cart,'' Nowlin wrote. ''Second, most players choose to walk even
when given the opportunity to ride because they feel walking gives
them an advantage over riding.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowlin said the USGA's justification for the no-cart rule is the
''fatigue factor that walking injects into the game,'' and a factor
that cannot be deemed significant under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Nowlin in June issued a temporary injunction that allowed Jones
to use a cart during the qualifying rounds at the U.S. Senior Open
at Saucon Valley Country Club, in Bethlehem, Pa. Jones, however,
failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA had denied Jones' request for a cart in 1998 and 1999.
He tried to play without one in 1998 but withdrew before finishing
the round.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA has maintained that walking is an integral part of the
game and giving Jones a cart could give him an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 53, was diagnosed in 1993 with post-polio syndrome, a
disease that causes leg and shoulder muscles to atrophy, resulting
in fatigue. Jones walks with a cane and doctors have told him he
could be in a wheelchair in just a few years.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Nun Killer Loses Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- One of two former soldiers
still imprisoned for the 1980 slaying of four U.S. religious
workers has lost an appeal for release, the Supreme Court announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Eduardo Tenorio said the court rejected the petition
of Francisco Orlando Contreras because it believed he had not been
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the country's National Guard, Contreras was
one of five men sentenced to 30 years in prison in 1984 for the
slayings of nuns Ita Ford, Maura Clarke and Dorothy Kazel, and
layworker Jean Donovan during the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The women had been detained at a highway checkpoint in December
1980 while headed to the capital from the nearby international
airport. Their bullet-riddled bodies were found a day later. They
apparently had been raped.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men were freed in 1998 for good behavior under a
law that reduced some sentences to ease prison overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras and Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios were kept in
prison because they had participated in a prison uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have long pressed the government to
act against higher-ranking military figures they say were
responsible. Families of the victims said they believe the women
were targeted because officials suspected they sympathized with
leftist guerrillas during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this year, Francisco Contreras
reiterated the soldiers' claim that they were only acting on
orders, and he asked the victims' families for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the group's decision, it was an order. We opposed
the crime,'' Contreras said. But he said he did not know where the
order originated.
</P>
<P>
   San Salvador Archbishop Fernando Saenz had asked the government
to pardon Contreras and Contreras Palacios.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urged To Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With a Mideast summit possible next week
in New York, the speaker of Israel's parliament called Thursday on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to compromise for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the name of all of us Israelis, do not say no,'' Avraham
Burg pleaded at the first global gathering of parliamentary
leaders. ''Do not wait for absolute peace because war will come
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg urged the more than 900 participants from 141 countries --
including 152 presiding officers of parliaments -- to ''join me in
my prayers for peace ... in the hope that our children will no
longer perish in the battlefields.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the only message -- that when we shall come here next
year, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, Syria and the rest of the
region of conflict in the Middle East won't be in conflict any
more, but will be a symbol of peace and harmony for the rest of the
world,'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   Burg took the podium immediately after the speaker of Egypt's
People's Assembly, Ahmed Fathy Sourer, called for ''the recovery of
Arab lands, including Jerusalem and the proclamation of an
independent Palestinian state'' as part of a comprehensive Mideast
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Abdul-Kader Kaddoura, the speaker of Syria's
People's Assembly, also called for the return of Jerusalem and the
Golan Heights saying ''this is the only way to restore peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think that the hesitation of the Israeli government --
if this hesitation goes on -- can save this peace process which has
been obstructed by greed and the dreams of Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's opening session, the speaker of the Iranian
assembly, Mehdi Karrubi, also urged the parliamentarians to support
the right of the Palestinians to establish a state with Jerusalem
as its capital -- and for all Palestinians to return to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians have set a Sept. 13 deadline for
settlement of their half-century-old dispute. Arafat has said he
would declare Palestinian statehood if there is no accord.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline looming, President Clinton is expected to make
a fresh attempt at next week's Millennium Summit of world leaders
to reopen summit talks with Israel and the Palestinians and try to
mediate a settlement on Jerusalem's future and the shape of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Arafat, with the immediate aim of setting up a three-way
session. His overall goal is the wide-ranging agreement that
appeared to be taking shape last month at Camp David but fizzled
mostly over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''This summit is vital,'' Burg told a news conference after his
speech, adding that without a summit breakthrough by the end of
September ''the future of the peace process is not optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Top lawmakers from around the world are attending the meeting
co-organized by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the United
Nations -- but the U.S. Congress didn't send anyone.
</P>
<P>
   IPU Secretary General Anders Johnsson said Vice President Al
Gore who presides over the Senate did send a letter saying he could
not attend because of his campaign for the presidency. But he said
neither Senate Majority leader Trent Lott nor House Speaker Dennis
Hastert ever responded to their invitations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. absence was also raised during Wednesday's opening
session by the speaker of New Zealand's Parliament and much
discussed by lawmakers in the U.N. corridors.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Clinton administration's decision to bar the
speakers of the Cuban and Yugoslav Parliaments, Ricardo Alarcon and
Srdja Bozovic, from entering the United States -- more than the U.S.
absence -- that sparked an official protest from the lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> Dexter shareholders approve sale of final piece of company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) - Shareholders have approved the sale
of Dexter Corp.'s nonwovens materials division - the final segment
of a company sold piecemeal to avoid a hostile takeover.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of shareholders voted in favor of the $275
million cash sale to Finland-based Ahlstrom Corp. during a brief
meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Chairman and Chief Executive Officer K. Grahame Walker
said Ahlstrom has no plans to close the Windsor Locks division,
which includes about 400 workers, and may even retain the company's
name.
</P>
<P>
   The vote moves the 233-year-old Dexter one step closer toward
dissolution. The final step will come Sept. 14, when shareholders
will be asked to accept the sale of the remaining portions of the
company to San Diego, Calif.-based Invitrogen for $1.9 billion in
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   That deal is centered around Dexter's majority ownership of
Rockville, Md.-based Life Technologies Corp., which makes products
used in DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter, which makes products for the aerospace, electronics,
food packaging and medical markets, announced in July that it would
break up to avoid a takeover by International Specialty Products
Inc. of Wayne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ISP, led by investor Samuel Heyman, had fought with Dexter over
Dexter's controlling interest in Life Technologies. Heyman, who
controlled most of the remaining shares of Life Technologies,
believed Dexter and Life Technologies were ill-suited together.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Get Cummings From Twins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox acquired outfielder Midre
Cummings, who leads the AL with 11 pinch-hits, from Minnesota for a
minor league infielder Thursday night in their second trade of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Boston got power-hitting outfielder Dante Bichette for
two minor league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   For Cummings, the Red Sox gave up Hector De Los Santos.
</P>
<P>
   By making the deals before midnight EDT, Boston ensured Bichette
and Cummings would be eligible for the postseason roster. The Red
Sox began the day 1&AMP;frac12; games behind Cleveland in the wild card race
and five games behind New York in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, who played for the Red Sox in 1998, was hitting .276
with four home runs and 22 RBIs for Minnesota this season. He led
AL pinch-hitters in RBIs (10) and at-bats (33), and was batting
.333 in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that he will be a good complement to our club,
especially at this time of year,'' Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, 28, began his major league career in 1993 with
Pittsburgh. He also has played for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings is a career .309 hitter at Fenway Park. He hit .283
with five homers and 15 RBIs for Boston in 1998, going 9-for-26
(.346) with two home runs as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   De Los Santos, 20, hit .295 with one homer and 11 RBIs for
Boston's team in the rookie Gulf Coast League.

<HEADLINE> Bichette Gives Boston Offense  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Dante Bichette met the woman he would marry at a
fitness center behind the Green Monster. Now he has a chance to hit
balls over it.
</P>
<P>
   Strong on the mound but struggling at the plate, the Boston Red
Sox obtained Bichette from the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday, the
last day a player could be picked up and still be eligible for
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 31 deal last season, the Red Sox obtained reliever
Rod Beck and he had a 1.93 ERA in 12 appearances with Boston. This
season, Beck has a 1.50 ERA in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, who batted fourth most of the season, figures to start
Friday night when Boston opens a four-game series at Fenway Park
against Seattle. The 37-foot high left-field wall will be an
inviting target for Bichette, a righty who capitalized on the thin
air at Coors Field to hit 201 homers in seven seasons with the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ''That Green Monster seems like it's real close,'' Bichette
said. ''You don't have to overdo anything to hit there. Hopefully,
that confidence will be there when I step in (Friday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   With 76 RBIs, Bichette has a shot at driving in over 100 runs
for the sixth straight season. In 461 at-bats with the Reds, he hit
.295 with 16 homers. The bonus for Boston is that he's signed for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been looking for a veteran presence to help our
lineup,'' Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said in a conference
call. ''We have a very specific need on our ballclub that has to be
addressed if we're going to make the playoffs, and that is run
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has obtained Bernard Gilkey, Mike Lansing, Ed Sprague and
Rico Brogna to improve its offense, but all have fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after the Bichette deal, the Red Sox acquired
outfielder Midre Cummings, who leads the AL with 11 pinch-hits,
from Minnesota for minor league infielder Hector De Los Santos.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had Thursday off after posting a 3-4 record on a
road trip to Kansas City and Tampa Bay that left them 1&AMP;frac12; games
behind Cleveland in the wild-card race and five behind the New York
Yankees in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Pedro Martinez, Boston had the AL's best ERA, 4.17, going
into Thursday's games. But it ranked 12th in the league with a .268
batting average, .424 slugging average and 647 runs. And it was
tied for 11th with 135 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, with a .300 career average before this season, was
obtained for minor league pitchers John Curtice and Chris Reitsma
the day after the Red Sox managed four hits in a 3-1 loss at Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, 36, last played in the AL in 1992 with Milwaukee and
probably will see most of his action as a designated hitter, a
position at which the Red Sox have tried several players.
</P>
<P>
   ''It almost feels like a day off to be a DH. I just have to keep
myself loose,'' he said. ''The only thing that concerns me is I'm
going to have to get to know the pitchers real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   He met his current wife, Mariana, when she was a student at
Boston University and he worked out at the gym near Fenway.
Bichette also has done well inside the ballpark with a .366 career
average. He spent his first three major league seasons with
California and his next two with Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard his name in trade talks, Bichette said, ''I said,
'Please be Boston' because it's a place I always wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who obtained him after last season, ''expected some
big things this year and our club just got off to a poor start,''
he said. ''If I know Boston fans like I remember Boston fans, it's
going to be real heated, real exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers Boston gave up are promising prospects. Curtice was
in Class A and Reitsma in Double-A, but Duquette said the Red Sox
have good pitching depth at Triple-A Pawtucket. That includes
Paxton Crawford and Sun-Woo Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford could be recalled after teams can expand their rosters
to 40 players Friday. But players added then aren't eligible for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We traded these younger pitchers in an effort to make the
playoffs and win the pennant this year,'' Duquette said.

<HEADLINE> Reds Trade Bichette to Boston  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dante Bichette knew he'd been traded the
moment he got the message to call Cincinnati Reds manager Jim
Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said to myself, 'Please let it be Boston,''' Bichette said.
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish and the Red Sox got a run producer Thursday by
sending two low-level minor league pitchers to the Reds for the
36-year-old outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams got what they needed most. The Reds had to free some
salary for next season, when their young nucleus becomes eligible
for arbitration. The Red Sox got a designated hitter and a proven
clutch hitter for their playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a very specific need to be addressed if we're going
to make the playoffs and that's run production,'' Boston general
manager Dan Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in a hitter-friendly park in a homer-friendly era, the
Red Sox have struggled to score runs. They led the American League
in team ERA (4.18) at the time of the trade, but were third-worst
in runs scored (647) and batting average (.268).
</P>
<P>
   Bichette should help. He batted .295 in 125 games for the Reds
with 16 homers and 76 RBIs and goes to Boston with a fondness for
Fenway Park. He had a .366 average with three homers there when he
played in the AL with Milwaukee and the Angels from 1988-92.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the places where he feels most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ''You step in the box and just have a feeling that you're going
to do good in that park,'' he said. ''Even when I wasn't quite as
accomplished as a hitter, I felt good and strong there. The Green
Monster seems real close. Hopefully that confidence will be right
there when I step back in.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly approved the trade and will be eligible for the
postseason -- if Boston makes it that far. The Red Sox trail the
Yankees by five games in the AL East and were 1&AMP;frac12; games behind
Cleveland in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the Red Sox acquired outfielder Midre
Cummings, who leads the AL with 11 pinch-hits, from Minnesota for
minor league infielder Hector De Los Santos.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have tried an assortment of players at DH, but none
has done well enough to keep the job. Duquette said Bichette will
DH and play some outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the Reds' last homestand, Bichette made errors in
right field that let in the go-ahead run in losses. He didn't
object to being a DH in Boston, where he met his wife, Mariana.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a place I've always wanted to play,'' he said. ''I met my
wife at the Gold's Gym beyond the Green Monster. I've had a lot of
luck there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got right-hander Chris Reitsma and left-hander John
Curtice, neither of whom has pitched above Double-A. More important
for the short term, the trade gave the Reds a little payroll room.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette will make $6.5 million next season. The core of the
Reds' young nucleus is eligible for arbitration and the club is
trying to keep its payroll at the same level, so someone had to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will certainly put us within the ballpark of being able
to keep that nucleus together,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' payroll on opening day was roughly $42 million, with
Ken Griffey Jr. ($7 million) and Bichette ($6.5 million) making the
two biggest base salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got Bichette from Colorado on Oct. 30 to replace Greg
Vaughn, their 1999 cleanup hitter who left through free agency. At
the time, there appeared to be little chance they could get Griffey
from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When they traded for Griffey on Feb. 10, the Reds seemed to have
one of the most formidable lineups in the NL. Just like the Red
Sox, they have struggled to score runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds fell out of contention in the NL Central, struggled to
stay above .500 and essentially gave up on their season when they
traded left-hander Denny Neagle to the Yankees on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''They expected some big things this year and the club got off
to a slow start,'' Bichette said. ''It (the trade) is a little bit
of a surprise, but it's a pleasant surprise because of where I'm
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Reitsma, 22, was 7-2 with a 2.58 ERA in 14 starts for Double-A
Trenton this season. Curtice, 20, was 4-10 with a 6.49 ERA in 23
starts and two relief appearances for Class A Sarasota.

<HEADLINE> Africa Lawmaker: Whites 'in Denial'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's minority whites
refuse to admit their role in the racist, apartheid regime that
ruled this country for nearly 50 years, a ruling party legislator
told a conference on racism Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most white people say they are not responsible for apartheid,
but the (apartheid-era) Nationalist Party was put into government
by the white electorate since 1948 and returned to power since then
with an even bigger majority until the late 1980s,'' said Pallo
Jordan, a member of Parliament from the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan spoke on the second day of the conference, billed as a
national effort to confront the racial divide that remains six
years after the fall of apartheid and to find a way to move beyond
the prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Many white activists accused Jordan of unfairly dwelling on the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ''What about what we have accomplished over the last 10 years?''
said Dene Smuts, a legislator from the opposition Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Other delegates to the four-day conference suggested boycotts
against racist businesses and urged the gathering to address
poverty and other economic issues directly related to racism.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of white intellectuals accused the government
of an unhealthy preoccupation with race that was further dividing
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''South Africans are standing helpless against a government
which professes its commitment to a struggle against racism, but
does exactly the opposite,'' said the Group of 63, which comprises
Afrikaner academics, writers, and labor unionists. Afrikaners are
the descendants of mainly Dutch settlers who first came to South
Africa 350 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speeches criticizing whites made by government officials,
including President Thabo Mbeki and former President Nelson
Mandela, were stirring up black anger and alienating white South
Africans, the group said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can hardly be a more effective way of forcing wider the
rifts between communities,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also accused the government of unfairly branding its
white critics as racists.

<HEADLINE> F-16 crashes off the coast of Atlantic City, pilot rescued from water </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - An Air National Guard pilot ditched
his F-16 fighter jet in the ocean Thursday after its engine quit,
ejecting safely before it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The jet, which was one of four planes from the 177th Fighter
Wing on the exercise, went down about 1&AMP;frac12; miles east of Absecon
Inlet at about 3:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, whose name wasn't being released, parachuted into the
ocean, landing about 250 yards off Brigantine Beach, witnesses
said. Within minutes, a State Police marine bureau vessel rescued
him.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated at Atlantic City Medical Center for minor bruises
and a backache and released.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the pilot reported having engine trouble eight
minutes before the crash, while training over the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to return to his base in Egg Harbor Township, he was
worried he didn't have enough power to land safely, so he turned
around to steer the $18 million aircraft out to sea, according to
Lt. Col. Michael Cosby, executive officer of the 177th Fighter
Wing.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw the casinos and the Boardwalk below, he knew he
would be able to crash the plane away from land, reducing the
chance of harming people or property.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was happy because he knew he was going to make the water,''
Cosby said.
</P>
<P>
   Another pilot flew ahead of him to make sure there were no boats
in the area where the F-16 hit, according to Col. John Dwyer, a
spokesman for the New Jersey National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses on the ground knew the plane was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw him overhead and I heard a couple of pops,'' said
lifeguard Dan Daley, one of several lifeguards who watched from the
beach as the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then I saw smoke coming out of the plane but there wasn't any
noise. He banked it, pulled the hatch and ejected. He did a great
job of ditching the plane, I'll tell you. That's a crowded beach
right there, with the surfers and the trucks and the houses,''
Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   The jet hit the water with its nose and left wing first, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who had 12 years experience flying F-16s, was the
only person aboard, according to Staff Sgt. Barbara Harbison of the
state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Thomas Sost of the State Police's marine bureau, who was
first on the scene, found the downed aviator sitting in a
military-style life raft bobbing in 5-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was waving both of his arms vigorously and as soon as he
saw me, he had a nice big smile on his face,'' Sost said. ''He
looked good. Surprisingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another State Police boat arrived and got him out of the water,
and he was transported to Atlantic City Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brigantine closed its beaches about 4:30 p.m., worried about jet
diesel fuel washing ashore. The area where the plane crashed will
be cordoned off by U.S. Coast Guard boats and salvage crews over
the Labor Day Weekend, according to Coast Guard Cmdr. Thomas King.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers at southern Brigantine beaches may be restricted over
the weekend, too, because of floating debris, he said. ''They
should be very careful about where they swim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No information was available on the maintenance record of the
plane, which was built in 1984, or on the record of the pilot. Both
will be scrutinized when the Air Force convenes an accident review
board to investigate, Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The three other planes were able to return to Atlantic City
International Airport without problems. None were armed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third U.S. crash this month involving an F-16.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an Air Force reservist on a training mission was
killed when his F-16 crashed in a Texas field. Another F-16 crashed
Aug. 7 in the Nevada desert after apparently clipping another jet
during a training exercise. That pilot ejected safely, and the
other plane was able to land.

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds starter Pete Harnisch left
Thursday night's game against the Atlanta Braves in the third
inning after being struck in the lower right leg by a one-hop shot
off the bat of Rafael Furcal.
</P>
<P>
   After the ball caromed off his leg, Harnisch picked up the ball
and threw it to first, hitting Furcal in the back. Furcal was ruled
out for running in the baseline.
</P>

   Harnisch left after 2 2-3 innings and trailed 2-0. He gave up
one hit, a two-run homer to Andruw Jones in the first inning

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Martina Navratilova made a triumphant return to
the U.S. Open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova, making her first appearance at the National Tennis
Center since 1995, teamed up with Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario to win
their first-round doubles match 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (3) over Sabine
Appelmans and Linda Wild.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall
of Fame in July, decided earlier this year to play doubles. Teaming
with Mariaan de Swardt, Navratilova reached the third round in the
French Open and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Navratilova and Sanchez-Vicario have
teamed up since 1991 when they won Barcelona. In their only other
pairing, they won the Family Circle Magazine Cup in Hilton Head
Island, S.C., in 1990.

<P>
   HALL OF FAME: Ivan Lendl is on the ballot to be elected to the
International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Lendl is one of six people listed on a ballot that will be
distributed to a select group of voters who will determine the 2001
class into the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Lendl, who played in eight consecutive U.S. Open finals, winning
three, is the only person on the ballot in the Recent Players
category.
</P>

   Listed on the ballot in the Master Players category are Mervin

   BIG CHANGE: One year after they reached the final of all four
Grand Slam tournaments, winning twice, Leander Paes and Mahesh
Bhupathi were first-round losers in the U.S. Open men's doubles.
</P>
<P>
   After they lost in the final match here a year ago, Paes and
Bhupathi broke up as a team. They recently reunited so they could
represent India in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, they lost to Jaime Oncins of Brazil and Daniel
Orsanic of Argentina 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5).
</P>

</P>
<P>
   MISSING THE TOP: When Arnaud Clement defeated Andre Agassi
6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in a second-round match, it meant the first time
since the Open Era began in 1968 that neither the No. 1 nor the No.
2 seed has advanced to the third round of the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten lost to Wayne Arthurs in a
first-round match Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The top two seeded players have been ousted by the third round
only five times previously at any of the Grand Slam tournaments in
the Open Era, all in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Nos. 1 and 2 seeds were eliminated in the first two rounds
at the French Open in each of the last three years, and at the
Australian Open in 1999. However, in the latter tournament,
top-seeded Marcelo Rios withdrew with a stress fracture in his L2
vertebra before the tournament started.

her third child.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are happy to make this announcement at the U.S. Open,''
Austin said Thursday. ''I have great memories here and it's special

Cheney: Reduce Overseas Troops
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Dick Cheney said today that if he and George W.
Bush are elected they would look at crafting an exit strategy to get U.S. troops
out of the Balkans. European allies could take on ''a bigger share of the burden
there,'' the Republican vice presidential candidate said. ''We have global
commitments, they don't.'' Cheney also said President Clinton has no clear plan
for removing troops from the Balkans. Clinton has been scaling back troops in
the Balkans from the nearly 20,000 sent there in 1995.

reported in the United States, the government said today. A third case of
Legionnaires', involving a California man who died in May, may also have been
connected to potting soil, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
A rare strain of bacteria that causes the disease infected two women, one each
in Oregon and Washington, in May. Both women had worked with everyday gardening
soil within 10 days of their first Legionnaires' symptoms, and the bacterial
strain was found in soil they had used, the CDC said.

<HEADLINE> Dialysis Center Closes After Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- One man died and 18 other dialysis
patients were hospitalized shortly after receiving dialysis
treatment at a private center, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment center was temporarily closed and state and
federal officials were trying to determine what caused the
illnesses. Lawrence Lingo, 57, of Newton Falls, died Wednesday, and
the conditions of 14 others who remained hospitalized Thursday
ranged from fair to critical.
</P>
<P>
   During dialysis, fluids travel through a patient's kidney to
flush impurities. Mahoning County Health Commissioner Neil Altman
said Thursday that it is possible that bacteria was in water used
or that a malfunction occurred in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our primary concern is for these patients and their families,
and our prayers are with them,'' said Aileen Katcher, a spokeswoman
for Physicians Dialysis Center, one of 200 dialysis treatment
centers owned by Renal Care Group of Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Katcher said Thursday that an initial investigation indicated
all required safety procedures had been followed and that required
safety checks were performed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working around the clock to figure out what has
happened,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 14 Hurt in Roller Coaster Collision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) -- A roller coaster car failed to stop
and slammed into the back of a car waiting to unload its
passengers, injuring 14 people Thursday night, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident on the Big One roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure
Beach, one of Britain's most popular seaside resorts, occurred near
the point where passengers board and exit the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the injuries were minor, but two people were
hospitalized with leg injuries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was knocked out for a few seconds, and when I came to there
was panic all around,'' said passenger Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, who
suffered from whiplash and a concussion. ''It puts me off going on
things like that and will probably give me nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point on the mile-long Big One, riders race 235 feet down
a sloping track, reaching speeds of nearly 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the roller coaster opened in July 1994, 26 people
were injured when a carriage crashed into another at 35 mph after a
computer failure.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how fast this carriage was
traveling.

<HEADLINE> Bush Team, Networks Discuss Debates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign advisers for George W. Bush held a
second round of meetings Thursday with network officials to discuss
this fall's presidential debates but still have not made any
decisions, a campaign spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The team met with representatives from FOX, NBC and PBS after
holding similar sessions on Wednesday with representatives of CNN,
ABC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   All six networks have offered to host debates.
</P>
<P>
   The trio of advisers to Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee, will meet Friday with the Commission on Presidential
Debates, which has recommended three 90-minute prime-time debates,
all to be held in October, said campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore has accepted the
commission's recommendations, along with other various debate
invitations. So far, the Bush team has made no commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to pressure Bush, Gore campaign chairman William
Daley informed CNN on Thursday that the campaign will consider its
offer for a one-hour debate with host Larry King only after Bush
has agreed to the commission-sponsored debates.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said the commission debates will reach the largest
possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will actively consider invitations for debates from
sponsors other than the commission after agreement has been reached
on the commission prime-time debates,'' Daley wrote in a letter to
Tom Johnson, chairman and chief executive of CNN. ''Any other
approach will deprive too many Americans of the real discussion on
issues they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made clear his preference for relatively informal
debates, such as the session during the Republican primaries in
which the candidates sat around a table with talk-show host King.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been meeting with people this week. We have not made any
decision about debates yet,'' Tucker said. ''We look forward to
debate Al Gore soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Allbaugh in the meetings were campaign chairman Don
Evans and adviser Andrew Card.

Whitewater Team Leaves Little Rock
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray formally declared an
end to the Whitewater era today, announcing that he had closed the Arkansas
office where President and Hillary Rodham Clinton's business dealings had been
investigated for the past six and half years. Ray said he is now focusing on
whether the president should be held criminally liable for his testimony about
Monica Lewinsky during the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. A federal judge
last year cited Clinton with contempt of court and fined him $90,000 as a civil
penalty for what she called misleading testimony in the Jones case. A grand jury
was seated July 11 to consider whether Clinton should also face criminal charges
for the sworn testimony.

GOP Ad Goes After Gore's Integrity
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Going negative and getting personal, the Republican
Party is questioning Al Gore's credibility with a TV ad reminding voters about
his Buddhist temple fund-raiser and the time he took credit for the Internet.
''There's Al Gore reinventing himself,'' an announcer says in the 30-second ad
approved personally by GOP nominee George W. Bush. The Republicans called the ad
''tongue-in-cheek'' but also said it goes to the heart of a significant Gore
weakness: the perception by some voters that he stretches the truth.

Cheney Would Reduce Troops Overseas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Dick Cheney said today that if he and George W.
Bush are elected they would look at crafting an exit strategy to get U.S. troops
out of the Balkans. European allies could take on ''a bigger share of the burden
there,'' the Republican vice presidential candidate said. Cheney also said
President Clinton has no clear plan for removing troops from the Balkans.
Clinton has been scaling back troops in the Balkans from the nearly 20,000 sent
there in 1995.

Arafat Asked To Compromise
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The speaker of Israel's parliament called today on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to compromise for peace, with a Mideast summit
possible next week in New York. ''In the name of all of us Israelis, do not say
no,'' Avraham Burg pleaded at the first global gathering of parliamentary
leaders. ''Do not wait for absolute peace because war will come first.'' Burg
urged the more than 900 participants from 141 countries -- including 152
presiding officers of parliaments -- to ''join me in my prayers for peace ... in
the hope that our children will no longer perish in the battlefields.''

F-16 Crashes Off of N.J. Coast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- An F-16 on a training flight plunged into the
ocean today off the New Jersey coast after its engine quit. The Air National
Guard jet was one of four planes from the 177th Fighter Wing on the exercise.
The pilot parachuted into the ocean, landing about 250 yards off Brigantine
Beach, witnesses said. Within minutes, he was picked up by State Police boat,
and Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the pilot was in good condition. The
pilot reported a problem with the oil pressure just before the engine failed,
said Ray Martyniuk, a spokesman for the Department of Military and Veterans
Affairs.

Steelworkers of America members at nine plants are prepared to picket the tire
maker unless a contract agreement is reached by midnight Friday. The strike
threat couldn't come at a worse time for Japanese-owned Bridgestone/Firestone,
which is ramping up production to replace 6.5 million truck tires recalled

   NEW YORK (AP) -- There was no sadness in Andre Agassi's eyes, no regret over
the listless defense of his U.S. Open title, as Frenchman Arnaud Clement knocked
him out of the tournament, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. Top-seeded Agassi followed No. 2
Gustavo Kuerten and two-time champion Patrick Rafter in an early exit today.

<HEADLINE> F-16 Crashes Off the Coast of N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A military pilot ditched his F-16
fighter jet in the ocean off the New Jersey coast Thursday after
its engine quit, ejecting safely before it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Air National Guard pilot parachuted into the ocean, landing
about 250 yards from shore, witnesses said. He was quickly picked
up by a state police boat.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, whose name wasn't released, suffered minor bruises
and a backache.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did a great job of ditching the plane, I'll tell you.
That's a crowded beach right there, with the surfers and the trucks
and the houses,'' said Dan Daley, one of several lifeguards who
watched as the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the pilot reported having engine trouble while
training over the ocean with three other planes from the 177th
Fighter Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot tried to return to his base at the Atlantic City
International Airport but turned back because he was worried he
didn't have enough power, according to Lt. Col. Michael Cosby,
executive officer of the 177th Fighter Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Another pilot flew ahead to make sure there were no boats in the
area where the F-16 hit, said Col. John Dwyer, a spokesman for the
New Jersey National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third U.S. crash this month involving an F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, a military training plane crashed into a field in
San Antonio after the pilot and co-pilot ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine T-6A Texan II trainer that crashed is part of
the 559th Flying Training Squadron from Randolph Air Force Base.
The two men suffered minor cuts, base spokesman Lt. Jerald Black
said.

<HEADLINE> WWF Proposes Gore, Bush Matchup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The World Wrestling Federation is
proposing a matchup in the ring between the presidential opponents,
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Stamford-based WWF is offering each candidate five minutes
to address the 12- to 34-year-old men who make up the majority of
the audience of ''Smackdown,'' the Thursday night wrestling program
seen in about 5 million homes each week.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former WWF wrestler, has been
asked to moderate the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have such a strong presence in that demographic that both
parties have indicated are difficult to reach,'' WWFE Chief
Executive Officer Linda McMahon said Wednesday. ''We are a public
company and this is an opportune time for us to give back, to
contribute as good corporate citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither presidential campaign nor Ventura has responded to the
offer, said WWF spokesman Gary Davis. Neither campaign returned
calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, along with three
youth-oriented voter registration and education groups, has
registered more than 40,000 new voters in its ''Smackdown Your
Vote!'' campaign, which began a month ago.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 2, Royals 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Bobby Smith doubled home the
go-ahead run in the eighth inning as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat
the Kansas City Royals 2-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cox, who went 3-for-3, opened the eighth with a walk from
Jeff Suppan (7-8). Pinch-runner Jason Tyner stole second with one
out and went to third on Fred McGriff's grounder. Smith, mired in a
1-for-27 slump, doubled to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fiore (1-0) worked a scoreless eighth to get his first
major league win. Roberto Hernandez got the final three outs for
his 28th save in 34 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan gave up two runs and seven hits in 7 2-3 innings. It was
just his second loss in seven decisions since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has won 13 of the last 16 meetings between the two
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dunwoody's sacrifice fly in the second inning gave the
Royals 1-0 lead. The Devil Rays tied it in the sixth when Smith hit
into a double play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays starter Paul Wilson allowed one run and five hits
over seven innings in his second start of the season. The
right-hander, acquired from New York Mets July 29, missed all of
last season after elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay got a runner to third base in the first, third and
seventh innings with two outs. McGriff struck out to end the first,
Greg Vaughn flied out in the third and Gerald Williams hit a
seventh-inning fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Mike Sweeney had his 16-game hitting streak
stopped after going 0-for-2. He also walked and was hit by a pitch.
Notes: Vaughn, who has been limited to DH duties since Aug. 7 by a
right shoulder injury, has just eight hits in his past 61 at-bats.
He will have shoulder examined by Dr. James Andrews before Friday's
game. ... Royals OF Johnny Damon was the DH, which allowed Dunwoody
to start in center. ''I've been trying to get Dunwoody in the
lineup,'' Royals manager Tony Muser said. ''We're going to take a
look at a lot of people.'' ... Damon has a hit in 24 of his past 25
games. ... Wilson threw six shutout innings last Saturday at
Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Reed, Fans Have Confrontation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets pitcher Rick Reed had no problems on the
mound in his most recent start. His trouble started when he left
Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A group of fans, upset that Reed would not sign autographs,
rocked his car Wednesday night and prompted an angry confrontation
in the parking lot. Reed had pitched seven innings and was the
winner in a 1-0 victory over Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries and Reed drove away with his wife and
baby daughter, the Mets said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips met with the team's security
officials on Thursday to talk about safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we're going to look at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and the Mets traveled to St. Louis on Thursday. He was not
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz, a group of fans shouted
at Reed as the pitcher and his family got into a car inside the
shielded-off players' parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed drove into the general parking area, the fans crowded
around his car and again asked for autographs. Reed, Horwitz said,
''politely explained that his baby was not feeling well and needed
to get home.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, some of the fans began hitting the car and
rocking it.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher's wife, Dee, called WFAN -- the Mets' flagship radio
station -- on Thursday and said that after a teen-aged boy struck
the car and cursed at the family, Reed got out and chased him.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, several angry fans called the radio station
to complain about Reed's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was concerned for the safety of his baby and his wife,''
Horwitz said.

<HEADLINE> Painter Euan Uglow Dead at 68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Euan Uglow, one of Britain's most highly regarded
realist painters, died of cancer Thursday. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Uglow died at his studio in south London, said the artist's
dealer, the Browse and Darby Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Uglow was best known for his still lifes and nudes, and was
known for being especially meticulous, sometimes completing just
two paintings a year.
</P>
<P>
   His work was exhibited in major British galleries including the
Tate Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The Tate's director, Sir Nicholas Serota, called Uglow ''a
distinguished and distinctive painter in the long tradition of
painting from the model.
</P>
<P>
   ''His carefully constructed nudes and still life paintings were
the product of rigorous observation of objects in the studio,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Ammonia transferred to rail car; residents await green light to go home </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT EDWARD, N.Y. (AP) - Emergency crews had nearly completed
transferring about 30,000 gallons of ammonia out of a leaking tank
Thursday evening, but residents were still kept out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 people had been told they might be back in their homes
by 6 p.m., but complications getting the ammonia out of the leaking
train car into another car means they'll spend another night away
from home, in emergency shelters, motels or with family. It will be
Friday at the earliest that the residents can go home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a great resolve to solve these issues,'' said Michel
Spenard, a spokesman for Canadian Pacific Railroad, the company
that maintains the tracks. ''No one likes to be put out but these
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal in this village 43 miles northeast of Albany started
about 11 p.m. Tuesday, when a rail car began leaking anhydrous
ammonia that was bound for a local paper plant. By 1 a.m.,
emergency personnel were going door-to-door, evacuating portions of
the village around - and downwind from - the leaking car.
</P>
<P>
   The spill was blamed on a gasket on top of the tanker car and an
investigation was underway.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 10 a.m. Thursday, crews started to transfer the
ammonia. By 6 p.m., environmental inspectors said the level of
ammonia in the air was safe for humans.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 61 people were treated at a local hospital,
mostly for respiratory reactions and stress. None of the injuries
was serious.

   With Davis, the Blazers clearly got the best of the swap of
6-foot-11 players.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who helped lead the Pacers to the NBA Finals against the
Lakers, averaged 10 points and 9.9 rebounds, leading Indiana in
rebounding for the seventh straight year and making his first
All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who came into the NBA out of Eau Claire (S.C.) High
School, has contributed virtually nothing in his four pro seasons.
He averaged just 12.3 minutes, 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds last
season and couldn't crack the rotation playing behind forwards
Rasheed Wallace and Brian Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think he was as talented as the guys who were
playing in front of him,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal did get into games, usually as a backup to aging
center Arvydas Sabonis, he showed promising shot-blocking and
rebounding skills at the defensive end, but almost no touch on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has rebounding, shot-blocking ability. We feel he can play
any one of the three (front-line) positions, including center. He's
got athletic ability and great skill,'' Pacers president Donnie
Walsh said. ''This continues our idea of trying to keep this team
in a position to be good both immediately and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the lockout-shortened 1999 season, O'Neal brazenly had
''Year of the Resurrection'' tattooed on his arm, but two seasons
later, the 21-year-old is still looking for his niche.
</P>
<P>
   ''I finally get a chance to show what I can do,'' O'Neal said
from his home in Columbia, S.C. ''I don't think anybody really
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, entering the second year of a four-year, $24 million
contract he signed last summer, demanded to be traded in mid-June.
Dunleavy said O'Neal could improve his chances at more minutes by
playing on Portland's summer league team, but on the day he was
supposed to leave for Long Beach, O'Neal went shopping for hats at
a department store.
</P>
<P>
   ''We developed Jermaine and we liked him, but we was frustrated
and didn't want to be here,'' Portland general manager Bob Whitsitt
said. ''I still think he'll be a really good player in this league.
The book on Jermaine will be finished 10-15 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have been scheming to stop Shaquille O'Neal since
they blew a 15-point lead to his Los Angeles Lakers to lose Game 7
of the Western Conference finals. Adding Kemp and Davis gives the
Blazers a fighting chance to at least slow him down and disrupt the
Lakers' chances to repeat as champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to win a championship,'' Whitsitt said. ''We're
close, and we're trying to do all we can while we're in that
window.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves also will mean more rest for Sabonis, who was so
banged-up he couldn't play for Lithuania in the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Barron Shares Air Canada Golf Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) -- Doug Barron, bothered by a neck
injury, shot a 6-under-par 65 on Thursday for a share of the lead
in the Air Canada Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times, when people get hurt, they seem to play well
because it gets your mind off your game,'' Barron said. ''I think I
did it sneezing. I just couldn't turn my neck, so I went to my
chiropractor and he screwed it up worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Stockton Jr., Jason Buha and New Zealand's Grant Waite also
opened with 65s on the Northview Golf Club course.
</P>
<P>
   Barron had six birdies, including a 20-foot downhill putt on the
18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to get into position for Sunday and that's what
we're all trying to do,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, the leading money-winner in the field
at No. 5, overcame an inflamed hip to top a six-player group at 66.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Mike Weir, who last year became the first
Canadian to win a PGA Tour event on home turf since 1954, was
another stroke back at 67 along with 1997 winner Mark Calcavecchia.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, who won the 1993 Kemper Open for his lone tour title,
scrambled for birdies after hitting into the rough on the final two
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''To hit two poor drives on the last two holes and make birdies
from them just shows you what kind of game we play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton holed a 45-foot putt to key a five-birdie spree on the
front nine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It died right in the middle of the hole. You don't expect to
make putts like that and it got me pumped up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buha had nine birdies and three bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish star Sergio Garcia, coming off a victory over Tiger
Woods on Monday in a made-for-TV match, shot a 68. He recovered
from a double-bogey 6 on No. 10 with birdies on four of the last
seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't beat the No. 1 golfer every day,'' he said. ''It
gives you confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik used a putter given to him last week by Pierre Lacroix,
general manager of the NHL's Colorado Avalanche. They played a
round when Parnevik visited Montreal for a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd had it ever since he started playing,'' Parnevik said.
''He didn't pay more than 20 bucks for it, I would bet. I just put
it in my bag and it's worked nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir is 32nd on the money list, but hasn't had a top-10 finish
since May.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one shot better than my start last year so it was good
to go out there and have a nice, solid round,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like the last few tournaments I've played I've just
been sporadic. I'll get going good for a few holes and then hit a
shot that costs me a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Recall Three From Triple-A  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves on Thursday recalled three
players from their Triple-A Richmond farm club, infielder Steve
Sisco, outfielder George Lombard and right-handed pitcher Jason
Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also purchased the contract of catcher Mike Hubbard
from Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves said the four players will report to the club on
Friday when Atlanta opens a three-game series in Houston and
rosters can be expanded to 40 players.
</P>
<P>
   Sisco, Lombard and Marquis had been with the Braves earlier in
the season. Sisco hit .174 with a home run and two RBIs in 19
games, Lombard batted .095 (2-for-21) in 11 games and Marquis was
1-0 with a 4.29 ERA in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   At Richmond, Sisco hit .295 with 12 homers and 35 RBIs in 75
games, Lombard batted .277 with 10 home runs, 45 RBIs and 32 stolen
bases in 111 games and Marquis was 0-3 with a 9.00 ERA in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard hit .296 with six home runs and 31 RBIs in 69 games at

<HEADLINE> Marshall 63, SE Missouri 7  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Chanston Rodgers ran for three
touchdowns and Byron Leftwich threw for two more in their first
starts as Marshall beat Division I-AA Southeast Missouri State 63-7
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomores helped Marshall run its winning streaks to 32
overall and 18 straight at home, both tops in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall compiled 573 yards in total offense and held the
Indians scoreless over the final three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, returning from a torn knee ligament suffered in spring
practice, scored on second-quarter runs of 2 and 7 yards and added
a 5-yarder in the third period. He had only 25 yards rushing on
seven carries as part of Marshall's three-back rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Leftwich, who missed most of last season with injuries and
received a medical redshirt, took over this year for Heisman Trophy
finalist Chad Pennington. Leftwich went 13-of-20 for 205 yards
before sitting out most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The 63 points were the most scored by Marshall in an opener
since a 71-7 victory over Morehead State in 1994. It was the most
allowed by Southeast Missouri since it moved up from Division II in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The game was little more than a tuneup for Marshall as it
prepares for non-conference games at Michigan State and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the debut of Southeast Missouri coach Tim Billings, a
Marshall assistant the past 10 years and its defensive coordinator
last season, when the Herd ranked second in the nation in fewest
points allowed at 10 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Billings used those same schemes Thursday and they worked for
awhile. The game was tied at 7 until midway through the second
quarter when Rodgers and Leftwich helped Marshall score on its
final three drives for a 28-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Southeast Missouri backup punter Nick
Reggio put his knee to the ground while fielding a low snap at his
5-yard line. Marshall took over and Rodgers scored two plays later
for a 35-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On Marshall's next possession, Lanier Washington returned a punt
33 yards to the Southeast Missouri 10, setting up Ernest Pitts'
1-yard TD run for a 42-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Missouri was held to 259 total yards.

<HEADLINE> Colo. St. Backup QB Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Steve Cutlip, Colorado State's backup
quarterback, was suspended for the season Thursday, just two days
before the team's opener against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension came after the Fort Collins Coloradoan and the
Denver Rocky Mountain News reported Cutlip was arrested last
weekend for allegedly shoplifting $4.49 worth of markers from a
discount store.
</P>
<P>
   The school said it could not elaborate on the suspension because
of privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers said it was the fourth arrest in the past 17
months for Cutlip, a 21-year-old sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was time for something to be done and he would
have to suffer the consequences,'' coach Sonny Lubick said.
</P>
<P>
   Lubick said Cutlip had been on university probation through the
office of Student Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a very good kid and he was remorseful today,'' Lubick
said. ''The issue with him is this has happened a couple of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutlip said he was uncertain of his future.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of things on my mind. A lot of decisions, a
lot of decisions I have to make,'' he said. ''I just need to sit
down and make them myself and not really talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no explanation,'' said his mother, Vicki Cutlip. ''He
was at the store. He didn't need the markers. He had the money to
pay for them in his pocket.''

Gore Pushes Patients' Bill of Rights

   SEATTLE (AP) -- In person and on the air, Al Gore appealed today for the
support of people who battle with insurance companies over medical coverage.
''We can win this struggle,'' he declared. ''Allow yourself to believe,'' Gore
told a noisy downtown rally. He and running mate Joseph Lieberman spoke to more
than 3,000 cheering backers, pushing for ''a meaningful, real enforceable
patients' bill of rights.'' At the same time, the campaign began airing new
commercials ripping into ''some bean counter behind a computer terminal'' who
denies needed medical treatment for patients.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray formally declared an

office where President and Hillary Rodham Clinton's business dealings had been
investigated for the past six and half years. Ray said he is now focusing on
whether the president should be held criminally liable for his testimony about
Monica Lewinsky during the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. A federal judge
last year cited Clinton with contempt of court and fined him $90,000 as a civil
penalty for what she called misleading testimony in the Jones case. A grand jury
was seated July 11 to consider whether Clinton should also face criminal charges
for the sworn testimony.

<HEADLINE> Va. man charged after three-state chase, crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) - A man accused of pushing his mother out of a
car led police on a chase through three states on Thursday before
crashing into two police cars in Maryland, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dale Davis, 48, of Newport News, Va., was arrested after
the crash near the intersection of Interstate 95 and the Baltimore
Beltway, said Maryland Transportation Authority Police Cpl. Gregory
Prioleau.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey State Police said Davis pushed his mother and another
passenger out of the car at a New Jersey Turnpike rest area near
Woodbridge, N.J, then tried to run the passenger over with the car.
The three were driving from Connecticut to their Virginia home,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother told investigators that Davis was mentally deranged
and was not taking prescribed medication.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey State Police helicopter pursued the vehicle from
Cranbury, N.J., through Delaware until it reached the Maryland
line.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland State Police said their troopers picked up the chase
near the Susquehanna River. Officers were unable to get in position
to use ''stop sticks'' before Davis' car approached the Baltimore
suburbs, Sgt. Ernest Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Transportation Authority police took over when the car
reached the Fort McHenry Tunnel. The car went through the tunnel
and approached the Baltimore Beltway, then hit two Transportation
Authority Police cars and swerved into the median, Prioleau said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is charged in Maryland with aggravated assault on a state
trooper, New Jersey State Police said. He is awaiting extradition
to New Jersey, where he will be charged with eluding, theft and
aggravated assault, police said.

<HEADLINE> Sex offender charged with raping two 12-year-old girls  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) - A convicted sex offender was charged
Thursday with kidnapping and sexual assault after state police said
he abducted and raped two 12-year-old girls.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Cook, 43, was arrested at his New Milford home Thursday
morning after the girls complained to the Dutchess County Sheriffs
Department in New York state, where they live. Police said Cook
knew one of the girls and convinced them to go for a ride with him
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   After picking up the girls in New York sometime Wednesday, Cook
drove them to a wooded area in Kent, made them undress, bound them
together and repeatedly raped them, state police Sgt J. Paul Vance
said. After the attacks, Cook drove the girls back to New York,
Vance said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls immediately reported the attack and state police were
notified just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls were treated at Sharon Hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Short, Cook's neighbor, said he was stunned by the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in shock. I really am. I can't believe it,'' Short told
WFSB-TV. ''He was just easygoing, a nice guy. ... When Christmas
came around, he always brought presents for all the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But state police said Cook had a lengthy criminal record with
charges including sexual assault, kidnapping and drug possession
dating back to 1983. He was released from his latest stint in
prison, a four-year sentence, in December 1994 and ordered to serve
probation until December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He registered as a sex offender with the state Department of
Public Safety in January.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Cook was charged with two counts each of
first-degree sexual assault, kidnapping, risk of injury to a minor
and threatening.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held at Troop L in Litchfield on $500,000 bond and
is scheduled to appear Friday in Litchfield Superior Court.

<HEADLINE> Reds 4, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves fell out of first place in the
NL East for the first time since April 19, losing to the Cincinnati
Reds 4-3 Thursday night on Sean Casey's tiebreaking double.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta dropped a half-game behind the idle New York Mets. The
Braves lost three of four to Cincinnati, going 2-6 on a homestand
that left them with a 14-15 record in August.
</P>
<P>
   This is first time since 1993 the Braves have not been in first
place this late in the season. Atlanta has won eight straight
division titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, held hitless for four innings by starter Kevin
Millwood (8-10), overcame a 2-0 deficit with a four-run sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood broke his nose in a bunting drill Monday and was not
expected to make his scheduled start. But after throwing off the
mound Wednesday, he said he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie John Riedling (1-0) got the win with 1 2-3 innings of
relief, helped by a baserunning blunder by Andruw Jones in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Furcal opened the Atlanta sixth with a walk and Jones,
who earlier hit his 30th homer of the season, was hit by a pitch.
Chipper Jones then flied out to Dmitri Young at the left-field wall
and Andruw Jones raced past second base but failed to touch it on
his return to first and was ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga followed with a walk and B.J. Surhoff blooped
an RBI single off reliever Dennys Reyes. Scott Sullivan relieved
and struck out Javy Lopez on three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan walked the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh
before striking out Chipper Jones to end the threat.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations Guards Testify  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- One of two men convicted of
assaulting a woman and her son outside the headquarters of the
Aryan Nations denied being a member of the white supremacist group
Thursday during testimony in a civil rights case filed against
them, the Aryan Nations and the group's founder, Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law
Center who is representing Victoria Keenan and her son, Jason,
introduced letters, photographs and depositions to contradict the
men's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury awards compensatory and punitive damages, the
Keenans could demand the Aryan Nations' assets, mainly the 20-acre
compound and the sect's buildings. Dees has publicly said he hopes
to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Keenan's lawyers described Jesse Warfield,
43, as a former Aryan Nations security chief and John Yeager, 21,
as former guard for the group. Both men are serving prison
sentences for the 1998 assaults, and another security guard, Shane
Wright, is a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield testified that he wasn't a member of the group when he,
Yeager and Wright jumped into his pickup with an assault rifle and
chased the Keenans' car after hearing a loud noise outside the
group's compound, north of Coeur D'Alene.
</P>
<P>
   He said he only chased the Keenans, who are part-white and
part-American Indian, to try to find out who had paid them to shoot
at the compound. No weapon was found in the Keenans' car, and
authorities theorize the guards mistook a car backfire for a
gunshot. Warfield said he ''always acted as if I was security
chief, even though I wasn't appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager said he was drunk and didn't recall shooting an assault
rifle at the Keenans' car.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are representing themselves and testified that the
atmosphere surrounding the Aryan Nations compound in the months
leading up to a 1998 Aryan parade through town was one of
increasing paranoia that others would try to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The two denied lying to protect Butler, whom they consider to be
the protector of the white race.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, 82, has also said the men acted on their own. Edgar
Steele, a lawyer representing Butler and the corporation that
controls Aryan assets, has said he fears the Aryans' beliefs will
be scrutinized by the jury rather than the evidence. The lawyers
for the Ayran Nations have not begun calling witnesses in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Kootenai County Justice Building, security has been
tight since the trial began Monday. SWAT team members scan the
crowd with binoculars from atop the building, visitors must pass
through a metal detector and there is a daily lottery for courtroom
passes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, federal agents were posing as journalists in the
crowd to photograph neo-Nazi skinheads who had been rallying
outside the courthouse. The sheriff's department on Wednesday
revoked the agents' false credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Capt. Ben Wolfinger admitted he initially directed
seven agents to obtain media passes so they could blend in better
with photographers covering the trial. I was surprised it became an
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the news media said it is dangerous for law
officers to pose as journalists. Such deceptions could lead to
physical threats against reporters, who are not armed, said Kyle
Niederpruem, national president of the Society of Professional
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials did not immediately return messages for comment.
