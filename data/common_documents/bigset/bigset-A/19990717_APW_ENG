<HEADLINE> Plane Debris Found on Mass. Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Searchers swept across North Atlantic  
waters Saturday, pressing a desperate hunt for John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife and her sister, whose plane had vanished in the night. A 
piece of luggage from the plane was found 100 yards off a Martha's 
Vineyard beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears grew that America's most renowned political family had  
suffered another ghastly tragedy. The couple had been en route to 
Cape Cod, and a Kennedy cousin's wedding -- now postponed and 
replaced with prayers for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy -- universally known as ``John John'' since he was a  
toddler in the White House, and once labeled the ``sexiest man 
alive'' by People magazine -- had obtained his pilot's license in 
just the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still pursuing an active search-and-rescue mission.  
There's always hope,'' said Lt. Gary Jones of the Coast Guard 
office in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah -- the portion of the Vineyard  
popularly known as Gay Head -- ``some luggage,'' a wheel, a headrest 
and part of a plane support known as a strut had washed up, said 
Coast Guard Lt. Craig Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports that the luggage contained items with the  
name of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's sister, Lauren, but Jones would 
only say that ``family notifications are being made at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA reported the last contact with the plane during its  
final approach to the airport on the island off Cape Cod at 9:39 
p.m., the Coast Guard said. ``The aircraft was due to arrive at 
Martha's Vineyard around 10 p.m. and was later expected to fly to 
Hyannisport,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	No flight plan had been filed, and none was required.  
</P>
<P>
	Family members, assembled in Hyannisport , Mass., for the  
wedding of the late Robert F. Kennedy's daughter Rory, reported the 
plane missing to the Federal Aviation Administration and the agency 
in turn called in military rescuers about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard and Air Force launched a search between 7:30  
a.m. and 7:55 a.m., said Lt. Col. Steve Roark, an official at the 
Air Force Rescue Coordination Center at Langley Air Force Base, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is radar data'' to indicate the plane was off Martha's  
Vineyard, said another Air Force officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The search is being refocused in that area,'' said the  
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, just after noon on Saturday, rescuers dropped a rubber  
raft in Long Island Sound, off Mattituck, where government sources 
said an emergency beeper signal was received briefly at about 2:15 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a  
statement confirming that the plane left the Essex County Airport 
in Fairfield, N.J., about 8:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Martin, of Hyannisport, who described himself as a friend  
of the family, said the plane was stopping in Martha's Vineyard to 
drop off Lauren Bessette, before Kennedy and his wife continued on 
to Hyannisport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard identified the plane as a single-engine,  
six-seat Piper 32 Saratoga. Kennedy had reportedly acquired the 
aircraft recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident came one day before the 30th anniversary of the  
Chappaquiddick incident, in which Sen. Edward Kennedy's car went 
off a bridge, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne on a tiny island 
adjacent to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also three years to the day after the crash on July 17,  
1996, of Paris-bound flight TWA800, off the south shore of Long 
island, and 35 years after Ted Kennedy narrowly escaped death in a 
private plane crash in which he suffered a broken back. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Labor Day, Kennedy flew another plane -- its registration  
number, N529JK, paid tribute to his father's May 29 birthday -- up 
to Hyannisport for a family get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	The whereabouts of Kennedy's sister Caroline were not known. She  
is the only other survivor of the young family that transfixed the 
world, four decades . 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance sent a shudder across the country. The  
Chicago Sun-Times printed an extra edition of its Sunday paper with 
the news; in New York, at Yankee Stadium, fans were asked to rise 
for a moment of silent prayer. In Montgomery, Ala., St. Peter's 
Catholic Church scheduled an afternoon mass for anyone wanting to 
pray for the Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. has lived entirely in the public eye -- from his birth  
shortly after his father's election as the nation's 35th president, 
to his poignant salute on the day of his namesake's funeral, to his 
romances with Daryl Hannah and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he more  
recently attracted attention with his political magazine, George, 
in which he once posed nude. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his few private moments was his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding to  
Bessette Kennedy, a former publicist for fashion designer Calvin 
Klein. They were wed in an ultra-private ceremony on a small island 
off the coast of Georgia, free of hovering helicopters and 
paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy, 33, a doctor's daughter from Greenwich, Conn.,  
studied at Boston University before taking the public relations job 
in New York, where she met Kennedy.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Great Banks' Brother Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The younger brother of baseball Hall of Famer  
Ernie Banks has been found dead in a motel that served as his home. 
He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not determined.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Banks Jr. had been involved in an auto accident in which a  
29-year-old man was killed on Tuesday. On Thursday, he was found 
dead with the TV still blaring in the motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't come out and say it, but I could tell from the way  
he talked that he was upset,'' said his sister, Edna Warren of 
Dallas. ``Anytime something like that happens to a good man, it 
bothers you. You can't just walk away from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks had told police he missed his diabetes medication and may  
have blacked out just before running a red light and smashing into 
a car driven by Bill Whittaker. Whittaker died and his 6-year-old 
son is in serious condition at Children's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The family hadn't reached Ernie Banks, 68, late Friday. He was  
in Chicago. Banks hit 512 home runs over a 19-year Hall of Fame 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Banks graduated from James Madison High School in Dallas  
and did a stint in the Air Force before marrying. He spent the last 
four years alone in the Stemmons Corridor motel.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Struggling in CART </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Robby Gordon, the only owner-driver in the CART  
FedEx Series, is having a frustrating time at the Toronto Molson 
Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who nearly won the Indianapolis 500 in May, running out  
of fuel while leading with just two laps remaining, qualified 22nd 
among the 27 drivers on hand for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the slower qualifiers on Friday in the opening round  
of time trials, Gordon was placed with the slower of two groups in 
Saturday's split qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have no idea how hard it is to go out there and drive the  
wheels off something and still wind up 22nd,'' Gordon said. ``I'm 
watching the fast group go through the last turn here and I can see 
how these guys are hooked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, I've got my hands completely full right there. It's  
hard to find a solution right now. But we're working like dogs out 
here to make it right. Unfortunately, we're scratching like dogs, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All is not gloom for Gordon, though. Despite his recent  
qualifying woes, Gordon has finished among the top 10 in each of 
the last two races. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's proved the last few weeks that he can come through the  
field and post a good finish regardless of where he starts,'' noted 
team manager and co-owner Mike Held. ``So we're optimistic about 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	GETTING BETTER:@ Gil de Ferran's pole victory on Saturday gave  
Goodyear it's second pole in 11 events this season. The first was 
last month in Cleveland, also by de Ferran. 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran's victory in the race at Portland, Ore., last month  
also ended a losing streak by Goodyear that began after Michael 
Andretti won the 1998 season-opener in Homestead, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of this season, Andretti and Newman-Haas Racing  
teammate Christian Fittipaldi both switched to Firestones, leaving 
de Ferran's Walker Racing, Marlboro Team Penske, Dan Gurney's All 
America Racers and Bettenhausen Racing as the only Goodyear teams. 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran, who is now Goodyear's main CART test driver, said,  
``We continue to pick it up every race. There's been a big 
improvement in the tires since last year. They are really 
consistent and just getting better every race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry Bell, Goodyear's CART operations manager, said, ``With a  
pole position and second-place finish on an oval (in Japan), a win 
and second-place on road courses (Portland and Cleveland), and now 
a pole on a street course, Goodyear has proven the competitiveness 
of its CART tires on each of the different race circuits we race 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memo Gidley, de Ferran's rookie teammate, was the next fastest  
Goodyear qualifier Saturday. He will start 15th. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH:@ Earlier this season, when 28-year-old  
Christian Fittipaldi outqualified 36-year-old teammate Michael 
Andretti, he quipped, ``Maybe you're just getting too old for this 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four times this season, Fittipaldi has outqualified 1991 CART  
champion Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Saturday, Andretti outqualified his Newman-Haas Racing  
teammate for the third straight race and Fittipaldi said, ``You 
must be getting younger, my friend, because you are qualifying 
quicker than me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	SPARK PLUGS: Al Unser Jr. will make his 265th career start  
Sunday, breaking a tie with retired Bobby Rahal for the all-time 
CART lead in that category. Adrian Fernandez makes his 100th start, 
joining Unser, Michael Andretti (240), Scott Pruett (135), Paul 
Tracy (122) and Jimmy Vasser (117) as the only active drivers with 
at least 100. ... Drivers with Honda engines have won the last nine 
CART races contested on temporary street circuits, dating to the 
beginning of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Keeps French Cycling Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBI, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong had only one goal Saturday  
as temperatures soared in the Tour de France -- damage limitation. 
</P>
<P>
	With tough climbs in the Pyrenees ahead of them next week, the  
overall leaders sat back for the third straight day, while Italy's 
Salvatore Commesso charged to victory in Saturday's 13th -- and 
longest -- stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Commesso's countrymen placed second and third.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong retained a seven-minute, 44-second lead over Spaniard  
Abraham Olano, came in 36th in the stage. He said earlier Saturday 
that he was happy letting other cyclists battle it out between 
themselves -- as long as they weren't his top rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	As temperatures hit 102 Fahrenheit, the conditions were clearly  
not ideal for the 27-year-old American who says he prefers riding 
in the cold despite his Texas origins. 
</P>
<P>
	The same could not be said for Commesso who broke off with more  
than a dozen other riders just a few miles into the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought to myself: `There's so long to go. You're  
crazy, you'll never last all the way. It's impossible,''' a smiling 
Commesso said after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in the end I was helped by the fact that the main  
contenders weren't up with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commesso narrowly edged Marco Serpellini in a final sprint after  
a head-to-head battle that lasted more than 15 miles. Mariano 
Piccoli finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the sixth stage on this year's Tour won by an Italian.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now, my next objective is to get to Paris and finish the  
Tour,'' Commesso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's stage was a 147-mile ride between Saint-Flour and  
Albi, a fast descent from the high plateaus of the Auvergne region 
to the heart of the French Midi, about 558 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	Albi, which has a renowned Gothic cathedral dating from the 13th  
century, is the birthplace of painter Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour passed sunflower fields and red-tiled villages where  
locals skipped the siesta to sit roadside, waving flags and 
applauding the riders from any patch of shade they could find. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, none of the top-placed riders needing to claw back  
some of Armstrong's lead have attacked the Texan as the race 
criss-crosses the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Armstrong, who has staged a remarkable recovery from  
cancer, has been leading the main pack alongside his U.S. Postal 
Service teammates, keeping a close eye on trailing rivals while 
lesser names win stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's stage is between nearby Castres and Saint Gaudens at  
the foot of the Pyrenees. Monday is a rest day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour ends on the Champs-Elysees on July 25.

<HEADLINE> Bessettes Gather at Connecticut Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLD GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- The family of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s  
wife and sister-in-law gathered at their home here Saturday, as 
searchers looked for the small plane the three disappeared in over 
the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33; her older sister, Lauren Bessette  
and Kennedy were en route from Fairfield, N.J. to a Kennedy 
cousin's wedding when they vanished from radar Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Freeman, the sisters' stepfather, declined to comment.  
Half a dozen cars were parked on the front lawn of the small cape 
house on a private road in this affluent community, where the woman 
who went on to marry People magazine's ``Sexiest Man Alive'' grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Michael's Church, town residents gathered for a special  
Mass Saturday afternoon to remember a family with deep roots in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Moynihan offered prayers and lit three white  
candles -- one each for Kennedy, his wife and her older sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Several parishioners at the Mass have children who attended St.  
Mary High School with Carolyn Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people left church with tears in their eyes,''  
Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy, 33, was voted ``The Ultimate Beautiful  
Person,'' by her classmates at the private St. Mary High School in 
Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, who is 18 months older than Carolyn, has a twin  
sister, Lisa Ann. A 1982 graduate of Greenwich High School, Lauren 
worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Ann Bessette, a graduate of the University of Michigan, had  
been working on a doctorate in Renaissance studies in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters were raised by their mother, Ann Freeman, who worked  
as a teacher and administrator in the New York public schools, and 
their stepfather, an orthopedic surgeon. He brought three more 
girls into the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Fones, who went to high school with Bessette Kennedy, said  
she hadn't seen her classmate in ten years but joined the nation 
Saturday watching the news coverage -- and praying. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a beautiful person and I hope everything turns out  
alright,'' said Fones, who lives in Greenwich. ``Everybody that 
knows her loves her. I'm sure a lot of people are praying for her 
right now.''

<HEADLINE> Overpumping Affects Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overpumping is sucking out too much of the  
world's underground fresh water, with a stable world food supply 
now dependent on an increasing global water deficit, Worldwatch 
Institute said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Annually, the study estimates, 160 billion cubic meters of water  
is lost to thirsty cities and farms that are not returning it to 
underground aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest known losses are in India, China, the United States,  
North Africa and Saudi Arabia. The lost water would be enough to 
grow 10 percent of world grain, said Worldwatch, a nongovernment 
research group funded by grants and sales of its publications. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of giant pumps to extract water from ever-deeper in the  
earth was once viewed as a boon for farmers worldwide. Now, 
according to water expert Sandra Postel, the report's author, 
massive pumping intensifies water shortages that threaten to reduce 
the global food supply, spread hunger and increase social conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few years ago, the practice was confined to certain parts of  
the world and seemed manageable,'' she said. ``Now, we see it 
occurring across very wide areas over the most important 
food-producing regions, including in India and China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The large pumping projects are often subsidized by governments  
to get needed water to farmers and thirsty cities, she said. Unlike 
more visible dam projects, they have rarely been controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	But what they are doing underground is beginning to hurt, with  
wells running dry and parts of some cities such as Bangkok and 
Mexico City showing signs of literally sinking because of ground 
water drainage, Postel said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	With world population set to surpass 6 billion in October, the  
problem of dropping water tables is bound to worsen, she said. Her 
Worldwatch book, ``Pillar of Sand: Can the Irrigation Miracle 
Last?'' says irrigation accounts for two-thirds of global use of 
fresh water, but less than half the water actually reaches the 
roots of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Methods are needed to double the efficiency of water use, she  
said, citing several steps that are working: 
</P>
<P>
	--Some farmers in India, Israel, Jordan, Spain and parts of the  
United States use drip irrigation systems that deliver water 
directly to crop roots. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rice farmers in an area of Malaysia increased water  
productivity 45 percent by shoring up canals and switching from 
traditional transplanting methods to direct sowing of seed into the 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	--Israel is now reusing 65 percent of its domestic wastewater for  
crop production, freeing up fresh water for households and 
industries.

<HEADLINE> West 6, East 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- It just wouldn't be a Major League Soccer  
All-Star game without Preki. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Wizards midfielder, the only player to score a  
point in each of the three previous All-Star games, outdid even 
himself Saturday. He scored two goals and added an assist as the 
West beat the East 6-4 in the highest-scoring All-Star game yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Preki, named the game's MVP, became the first player to score  
two goals in an All-Star game. His four goals and 11 points are the 
most by anyone in All-Star play. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the first All-Star victory for the West. Last year's  
game featured American stars versus their international 
counterparts, and Preki scored a goal for the USA in its 6-1 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous highest-scoring All-Star game was in 1997, when the  
East won 5-4 at Giants Stadium as nine different players scored 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, the game wasn't as big a success as the MLS  
played its second straight All-Star game in a non-league city. 
There appeared to be no more than 25,000 fans at the 70,000-seat 
Qualcomm Stadium. The league didn't announce the attendance before 
the end of the All-Star game, but planned to during the second game 
of the doubleheader, between Chivas of Mexico and Universidad 
Catolica of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS officials said earlier in the week that they'd be happy if  
they sold 30,000 tickets. By late in the week, they sold about 
22,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we would have preferred having more fans in the  
stands,'' said MLS commissioner Doug Logan, who added that the 
small attendance wouldn't affect San Diego's chance of landing an 
expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Preki scored the West's first and last goals of the first half  
as it took a 4-1 lead. Chicago's Roman Kosecki assisted on both of 
Preki's goals and also scored once. 
</P>
<P>
	The East came back to tie it at 4-4 as a shot by Columbus' Stern  
John off a rebound in the 83rd minute started a flurry of late 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose's Mauricio Wright put the West back ahead in the 84th  
minute on an assist by Clash teammate Ronald Cerritos, who then 
scored an insurance goal in the 89th minute when he tapped in the 
ball off an assist from Mauricio Cienfuegos of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked like the East was going to continue its domination  
when Roy Lassiter, one of seven players from D.C. United in the 
starting lineup, scored 30 seconds into the game, the quickest goal 
in All-Star history. Columbus' Brian McBride assisted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the West scored the next four goals, starting when Preki  
pulled D.C. United's Tom Presthus out of the net and put the ball 
past the sliding goalie in the 13th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosecki scored in the 32nd minute, one-touching it past Presthus  
on a pass from Peter Nowak. Los Angeles' Cobi Jones and Preki 
scored in quick succession, with Preki and Chicago's Lubos Kubik 
assisting on Jones' goal in the 36th minute. Kosecki made a nice 
crossing pass to Preki who scored two minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	The East began closing the gap on a penalty kick by New  
England's Joe-Max Moore in the 62nd minute and a goal by Tampa 
Bay's Carlos Valderrama following some fancy footwork in the 73rd 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty kick, just the second in All-Star history, came  
after McBride was fouled by Colorado's Marcelo Balboa.

<HEADLINE> George Magazine, JFK Jr.'s Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of indecision, John F. Kennedy made  
up his mind in 1995: his immediate future was in publishing, not 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-prosecutor, at a jam-packed Manhattan news conference,  
announced plans for George -- a magazine that he envisioned as a 
Rolling Stone of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just politics as usual,'' was the magazine's tagline.  
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, the glossy magazine was in danger of  
disappearing, as ad pages and circulation fell. In the six months 
ending Dec. 31, 1998, paid circulation was down 5 percent to 
403,894. And ad pages this year were down 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's four-year deal with parent company Hachette Filipacchi  
expired at the end of this year, raising questions about the 
magazine's future. The company and one of Kennedy's partners spent 
$20 million to launch the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine debuted four years ago with a splash: supermodel  
Cindy Crawford donned a white wig and little else to pose as George 
Washington. The celebrity covers became the magazine's trademark. A 
cover photo of Drew Barrymore evoked Marilyn Monroe's birthday 
serenade to President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine was non-partisan; recent additions to its staff  
included ex-U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, and Clinton 
White House adviser Paul Begala. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize a Kennedy talking about non-partisan is like Mark  
Furhman addressing an NAACP convention,'' he joked at the news 
conference annoucing the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, while the magazine's publisher, was also a contributor.  
He conducted interviews with the Rev. Billy Graham, ex-Alabama Gov. 
George Wallace and Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ruffled family feathers by describing -- in a September  
1997 magazine column -- cousins Michael and Joseph Kennedy as 
``poster boys for bad behavior'' after each had very public marital 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
	George contributing editor Douglas Brinkley described Kennedy as  
a ``terrific editor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``John had a great sense of humor and sense of self-deprecation,  
and a trickster side to him,'' Brinkley said Saturday from his 
Louisiana home. 
</P>
<P>
	At the magazine's Manhattan offices, nobody was speaking  
Saturday as the search continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, we are not offering any statement,'' said a man  
answering the phone.

<HEADLINE> Newark Team Returns With Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Baseball returned to Newark on Friday night  
with a wild pitch from Yogi Berra, a sea of purple jerseys and the 
cheers of a struggling city that has a home team for the first time 
in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newark Bears, the nation's top minor-league team in the  
1930s and 1940s, returned to the city as a franchise of the 
independent Atlantic League to play on the edge of the Passaic 
River in the 6,014-seat Riverfront Stadium -- at $34 million, one of 
the most expensive minor-league ballparks in America. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials hope the stadium will revive baseball's glory  
days in the state's largest city, when the Newark Bears and the 
Negro League's Newark Eagles were champions. The teams quit the 
city after 1949 and the old stadium was torn down two decades 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be like it was way back in the good old days,''  
said Hall of Famer Phil Rizzuto, one of several New Jersey baseball 
greats who attended the Bears' opening game. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also hope the stadium, like a performing arts center  
built downtown two years ago, will help revitalize a city that has 
never completely recovered from race riots in the 1960s, and still 
has trouble keeping people downtown at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Burt Ironson, Elliott Sudler and Mace Chaplowitz remember a  
different Newark. The 70-year-old Newark natives can still recite 
the Newark Bears lineup from the 1940s, when they were high school 
classmates and attended every game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Newark was a beautiful, vibrant city in those days,'' said  
Ironson, a retired judge from Springfield. ``It's facilities like 
this that will bring people back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who played for the Bears in the 1940s before becoming a  
Hall of Famer for the New York Yankees, started the action with a 
ceremonial pitch that sailed over the glove of team owner Rick 
Cerone, a former Yankees catcher. Cerone caught Berra's second try. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great,'' said Berra, signing autographs for fans  
and some of the Bears in the dugout. ``I think it's going to keep 
the kids off the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Screaming fans eating hot dogs, drinking beer and lining up to  
buy purple Newark Bears jerseys and hats didn't seem to notice when 
the home team went down 3-0 to the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds in 
the first inning. They cheered wildly at every strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears went on to win the game, 9-8, in 10 innings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always wanted to go to a baseball game,'' said 11-year-old  
Eric Nunez, who isn't counting the games he plays for the Little 
Ironbound League in a Portuguese neighborhood of Newark. ``I'm very 
happy because it's my first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other kids practiced their curveballs at a speed pitch tent or  
sought autographs from practicing players. Ryan Long, who plays 
right field for the Bears, spent the hour before the game signing 
balls and programs. The team, which has a 25-37 record this year, 
has played a season and a half outside of Newark, hosting ``home'' 
games at Skylands Park in Augusta. The team is scheduled to play 36 
games this year at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just excited to have a place we can call home,'' Long  
said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Lifts U.S. Jews' Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the view of many American Jews, Benjamin  
Netanyahu left office as an icon of the right wing who blocked 
Israeli peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, his successor as prime minister, Ehud Barak, is shadowed by  
the opposite reputation -- a man open to compromise who will bring a 
quick peace with the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither caricature is true,'' says Elan Steinberg, executive  
director of the New York-based World Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Israeli leader, his country's most decorated soldier,  
was elected in May as Americans were wringing their hands over 
renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Now on his first visit to the United States, Barak -- whose name  
means ``lightning'' in Hebrew -- has become a lightning-rod for 
American Jewish expectations across the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	In The Washington Post on Friday, an ad from Americans for Peace  
Now wished Barak ``continued strength'' in seeking peace. In the 
New York Post, opponents of the peace process expressed fear in 
another ad that Barak might make too many concessions to 
Palestinians under American pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Jewish leaders say the average American Jew is willing  
to give Barak a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, Barak comes here with an abundance of good  
will,'' said Steinberg. ``There is no questioning his courage, his 
determination to secure peace while protecting Israeli security. 
The danger is, the expectations are so high -- the expected rapid 
advances of the peace process over a short time period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That attitude was reflected on Manhattan's Upper West Side, a  
traditional bastion of liberal Jewish views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's committed to a rapid peace, he's conciliatory,''  
said Jane Edelson, an editor shopping at the Zabar's deli. ``I'm 
not a Zionist, I believe Palestinians have rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, on a subway train rolling toward midtown, law professor  
Lloyd Epstein cradled a mammoth book of Hebrew doctrine as he 
offered his support for the new Israeli leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak ``is not really a new figure -- only in the American  
media,'' said Epstein. ``He's not unlike many Israeli leaders -- 
(the late Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin, for instance, who was a 
military man and worked for peace. It's not a contradiction. And 
everyone's hopes are the same as before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing at the other end of the car was Stephen Garrin,  
professor of Judaic studies at Baruch College and a Netanyahu 
supporter. He agreed with Epstein that the two Israeli politicians 
are not as far apart politically as their American images. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, they're both hard-liners. Barak is a military  
man who knows what the score is with the Arabs,'' said Garrin. 
``He's just more sophisticated, he has more finesse in dealing with 
people, he doesn't fly off the handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Barak wields his new power, U.S. supporters of Netanyahu are  
under pressure to take a more middle-of-the-road approach to any 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a political minefield.  
</P>
<P>
	The One Israel Fund/Yesha Heartland Campaign, a group that funds  
Jewish West Bank settlements, pointedly warned Barak in a statement 
to tell President Clinton ``that Israel will not be pressured into 
any negotiations, and Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not 
subject to discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More cautious was Ronald Lauder, heir to the cosmetics fortune  
who is both a friend of Netanyahu and head of the Conference of 
Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing is, both men have their priorities  
exactly the same -- Israel's security and peace in the region,'' 
said Lauder, who was to meet Barak on Sunday. ``American Jews will 
support the prime minister of Israel 100 percent, no matter who he 
is, because we have one Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever their stances, American Jews' high expectations of the  
neophyte prime minister ``will have to be tempered,'' warns 
Steinberg of the World Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we say in Brooklyn,'' he added, tongue-in-cheek, ``it ain't  
going to be easy.''

<HEADLINE> Rights Leader Farmer Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- James L. Farmer, the last of the ``Big  
Four'' civil rights leaders, was remembered as the ``tallest of the 
giants'' in the fight to end segregation -- the man who refused to 
accept ``whites only'' signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim was not just for the black race. He was for the human  
race,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, along with other civil rights leaders and politicians,  
paid tribute to Farmer on Friday at a service at Virginia Union 
University, a stop on the Freedom Rides he initiated in the 1960s 
to help desegregate interstate busing. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer, of Fredericksburg, died July 9. The public memorial  
service attracted several hundred people. His funeral was private. 
</P>
<P>
	``We honor his memory by staying in the struggle,'' said Dorothy  
Height, past president of the National Council of Negro Women and 
longtime friend of Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Added former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder: ``It is our  
responsibility to make certain our young people never forget that 
James Farmer had to spend the better part of his life fighting for 
things most Americans take for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Farmer's father asked him during college what he planned to  
do with his life, he had a two-word reply: ``Destroy segregation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 22, Farmer founded the Congress of Racial Equality. He  
became one of the most visible national civil rights leaders, along 
with Martin Luther King Jr., NAACP chief Roy Wilkins and Urban 
League leader Whitney Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the tallest of the giants,'' said Jackson.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, a dozen years before the Montgomery bus boycott, Farmer  
led a sit-in at a Chicago restaurant that barred blacks. He missed 
one of the defining events of the civil rights movement -- the 1963 
March on Washington -- because he was in jail in Alabama for trying 
to enter a whites-only bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton presented him with the Presidential  
Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

<HEADLINE> IRL Atlanta Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- A.J. Foyt got a major scare Saturday before  
the Indy Racing League cars even got on the track at Atlanta Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt's 22-year-old son, Larry, was involved in a spectacular  
five-car crash during a Formula 2000 race prior to the IRL's Kobalt 
Mechanics Tools 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Foyt's car flipped in the air and burst into flames,  
but he managed to stagger away from the mangled wreckage after it 
came to a stop. He collapsed on the grass inside the track, while 
his father lumbered from the pits to render assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Foyt suffered bruises and a minor burn on his left  
arm. He was treated at the infield hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was banged up pretty good,'' said A.J. Foyt, who owns the  
cars of IRL pole-sitter Billy Boat and defending series champion 
Kenny Brack. ``He'll be hurting tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured drivers were Larry Oberto and Arnold  
Brinkman, who suffered concussions and were taken by helicopter to 
Atlanta Medical Center. Like Foyt, Tom Wood and Michael Curtis were 
released after treatment at the infield center. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck occurred on lap 19 of the 34-lap race when the tightly  
bunched field approached the start-finish line in front of the 
grandstands. Jonathan Bottoms swerved into Brinkman, setting off 
the chain-reaction crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkman took out Foyt, whose car flipped, struck the wall and  
was slammed by Wood, engulfing both open-wheelers in flames. The 
race was red-flagged and then halted due to time constraints, 
giving the victory to pole-sitter Steve Rikert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope the drivers are OK,'' Rikert said in a somber  
Victory Lane. ``We're competitors, but we're more like family and 
friends. Certainly, you don't like to see something like that 
happen in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RAY'S LUCK:* Greg Ray wasn't sure why his car quit running, but  
he knows how to prevent it from happening again. Pack your bags, 
wife and kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, who won the previous IRL race at Pikes Peak and finished  
second before that at Texas, was leading the Kobalt Mechanics Tools 
500 when a mechanical problem knocked him out on lap 108. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were running strong,'' Ray said. ``I don't know what  
happened. A chain broke or something like that. One thing I do 
know: My wife and kids have been to the last two races and I 
finished first and second. My wife and kids will definitely be at 
Dover (for the next race) because they are good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray and his wife, Angela, have two children, 6-year-old Winston  
and 1-year-old Simon. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW FENCE:* A higher fence, installed in front of the  
grandstands after three fans were killed at Charlotte on May 1, got 
its first test during the Formula 2000 crash. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three pieces of debris deflected off the new fence,  
which stands 21 feet high and extends 6 feet over the track. The 
old fence was 15 feet high and extended out 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, track officials closed off the first 15 rows in the  
main grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans didn't seem too concerned for their own safety,  
standing to watch as the F2000 crash occurred in right in front of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mainly, I was concerned for the safety of the drivers,'' said  
Buddy Hitt of Live Oak, Fla. ``I wasn't really worried about the 
fans. Charlotte and Michigan (where an Indy-car crash killed three 
fans in 1998), that was something of a freak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the crashes during the IRL race occurred in front of the  
grandstands, which were sparsely filled anyway. The crowd was 
estimated at just 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOUBLE DUTY:* Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny  
Rutherford was grand marshal of the race in addition to his normal 
duties as pace-car driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford gave the command to start the race using a wireless  
microphone from the pace car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gentleman, start your engines and follow me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford won the inaugural Indy-car event at Atlanta in 1965  
and swept two 125-mile races at the track in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT FILLERS:* Track officials used the IRL race to announce a  
new title sponsor for the NASCAR Busch series race held at the 
track in March. Aaron's Rental Purchase will lend its name to the 
event under a three-year deal that runs through 2002. ... The 
Lazier brothers, Buddy and Jacques, didn't have to look hard to 
find each other. Buddy started the race from the 15th spot on the 
inside of the eighth row -- with his younger brother right beside 
him in the 16th position. Both took turns with the lead before 
crashes took them out. Jacques finished 12th, Buddy 21st. ... The 
race began at 7:30 p.m., causing treacherous conditions as the sun 
was setting behind turn one. Several drivers complained that it was 
hard to see until the sun disappeared beyond the horizon.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries GOP Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax cuts of the size proposed by Republicans  
in Congress would ``blow a $3 trillion hole'' in the federal budget 
just as baby boomers retirement strains Medicare and Social 
Security, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, Clinton cited a new Treasury  
Department analysis showing the House GOP plan to cut taxes by $864 
billion over 10 years would cost more than three times that in the 
decade after 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tax cuts that size quite simply are bad economic policy,'' the  
president said. ``At the very time the nation will be confronting 
the demographic challenge of the baby boom, the Republican plan 
will blow a $3 trillion hole in the federal budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to jeopardizing the retirement programs, Clinton  
said the GOP tax bill would result in cuts of up to 40 percent in 
defense and domestic spending and risked ``return to an era of 
deficits with high interest rates and economic stagnation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Congress to use some of the projected 10-year, $2.9  
trillion surplus to secure Medicare and provide a new prescription 
drug benefit and to invest in areas such as education. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton urged Congress to look again at his net  
$250 billion package of tax cuts, which include credits for child 
care and long-term care of the elderly and breaks aimed at raising 
private money for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take care of the baby boom retirement. Take care of our  
families and our children. Take care of the long-term challenges to 
America,'' Clinton said. ``Then we can allocate the rest of the 
surplus for other spending priorities like education and for tax 
cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republican response, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said  
deep tax cuts he helped enact in his state beginning in 1986 have 
now translated into $5,600 less in taxes for the average Wisconsin 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those in Washington who wish to use the federal  
government's swelling coffers to finance a spending spree on 
additional government programs, instead of providing hard-working 
families a meaningful tax cut,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is flat out wrong,'' he said. ``Republicans are drawing a  
clear line in the sand with Democrats. And the American people will 
have a clear understanding of which party is truly fighting to 
empower families through tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans have proposed a tax cut of $792 billion over  
10 years, and next week the House version may be trimmed to roughly 
that amount. Clinton administration officials say the president 
would veto either of them.

<HEADLINE> Woods Slips in British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Tiger Woods began his day on the  
first tee Saturday with a smile on his face and the tournament in 
his sights. He ended it hearing the roar of the crowd and knowing 
that this British Open was slipping from his grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	A day when Woods couldn't make a single birdie didn't get any  
better when a huge roar rolled through the Carnoustie Golf Links 
from the 18th green as Woods was discussing his round. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinctively, Woods knew what was up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did he just make three?'' Woods asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Jean Van de Velde indeed had, snaking in a 45-footer for a rare  
final hole birdie. It gave him a five shot lead on the field, and 
seven on Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	On a course where birdies are rare, only a collapse of major  
proportions will give Woods a chance of winning his second major 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to hope he shoots a number where he comes back to me,''  
Woods said. ``It is going to be awfully tough to catch him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Woods is going to catch Van de Velde, he'll have to make a  
few birdies of his own. That was something he couldn't do while 
shooting 74 in the third round -- the first time he has failed to 
make a birdie as a pro in a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a frustrating round of missed greens and misplaced shots  
that he shared with playing partner Greg Norman, who shot a 75 and 
was a stroke further back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really give myself a whole lot of chances to make up  
shots,'' Woods said. ``I missed an inordinate amount of greens 
today and had to rely on my short game just to get me around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed he did.  
</P>
<P>
	After making a routine par on the first hole, Woods missed the  
next five greens, but was able to get the ball up-and-down for par 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak was destined to end, though, and it did on the next  
hole when Woods hit it over the green from the rough, putted from 
80 feet and then missed a 4-footer for par. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods went on to par the next eight holes, blowing his best  
birdie chance when he 3-putted the par-5 14th after hitting it on 
in two. Then he made a double bogey on the treacherous 17th hole 
and parred 18 to finish three rounds at 7-over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't give myself a whole lot of birdie chances, basically  
on 13 and 14 is all,'' Woods said. ``I made a lot of par putts 
today and really kept myself in this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a round of good course management for Woods, something he  
has prided himself on in the past year. But he kept the driver in 
the bag most of the round for fear of hitting it into the deep 
rough or deep bunkers, and didn't give himself many short irons to 
the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at the waist high rough and you really can't be more  
aggressive,'' Woods said. ``I have to be more precise, though. That 
means hitting the ball closer to the pins. It is not easy to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another thing not easy to do is hold a lead on the final day of  
a major, something that gives Woods some hope going into the final 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	He has Justin Leonard and Craig Parry two shots in front of him  
and Van de Velde beyond that. But strange things can happen on 
windswept Carnoustie, where one misplaced shot can suddenly turn 
into triple bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can make pars and make up shots,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde doesn't exactly have much experience at holding  
leads, either. He's a journeyman European Tour player whose only 
win came in the 1993 Roma Masters 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, anyone who has a lead like that has got to sleep on  
it and that's not easy to do,'' Woods said. ``I remember when I won 
the Masters in '97 it wasn't exactly an easy night's sleep and I 
had a nine-shot lead.''

<HEADLINE> Smoltz Pain-Free in Rehab Stint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- John Smoltz pitched two more pain-free  
innings for Atlanta's Double-A Greenville affiliate Saturday night, 
then pronounced himself ready to rejoin the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Cy Young Award winner gave up five hits and two runs in  
the first two innings of Greenville's 6-3 win over Jacksonville. He 
struck out three and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, Smoltz said there was no pain in the right  
elbow that has bothered him off and on for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really pleased with the fact that at the present moment my  
elbow feels pretty good,'' Smoltz said. ``I didn't quite have the 
location of the pitches that I would like. All in all, I'm really 
happy. I came in here expecting the worst and I came out with some 
hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander also pitched two innings Thursday as he worked  
his way back from inflammation that landed him on the disabled list 
July 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz expects to rejoin the Braves in Miami for their series  
against the Florida Marlins on Wednesday. He will throw once on the 
side before an expected start next Saturday at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest problem is patience and waiting,'' Smoltz said.  
``Now I have to wait a few more days to judge this elbow and see 
how it does. If I feel fine, I'm going to make my start, which 
looks like Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz is 8-3 with a 3.49 ERA in 15 starts.

<HEADLINE> Gary Coleman Arrested Over Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Gary  
Coleman was arrested for failing to pay $400 in fines for punching 
an autograph seeker. 
</P>
<P>
	The diminutive actor was stopped on July 10 in Monrovia at a  
police drunken driving checkpoint, Lt. James McInerny of the 
Hawthorne Police Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers cited Coleman, 30, for driving with expired  
registration tabs. A check of his license plate revealed that a 
warrant had been issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman was booked into the city jail, where he spent several  
hours before posting $26,000 bail, McInerny said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman received a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail after  
pleading no contest in February to allegations he punched an 
autograph seeker. He also was fined and ordered to attend 52 anger 
management sessions.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Dems Feud Over Farm Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Democrats want to rush through $10  
billion in emergency farm assistance before lawmakers leave for the 
August recess, but it appears increasingly unlikely Congress will 
take up the question before the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We warned that it would get worse, and it has,'' Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Friday. ``This is an 
emergency. It must be addressed in July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said Congress has no  
need to act before the fall harvest and accused Democrats of 
playing up the problem and fattening their aid request for 
political reasons. Last month, Democrats proposed $6.5 billion in 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats, in an effort to buy votes, will run it up as  
large as they can,'' Lott, R-Miss., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to attach the farm aid to an Agriculture  
Department spending bill pending in the Senate, but Lott said he 
may not even bring it to the floor until September because of 
filibuster threats over an unrelated dairy issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also ruled out overhauling the 1996 farm bill, popularly  
known as ``Freedom to Farm.'' The law was designed to phase out 
government support for farmers and encourage them to plant 
according to market signals rather than federal dictates but has 
become increasingly controversial as the farm recession has 
lingered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to change policy,'' Daschle said. ``We have to ensure  
that this Freedom to Farm law is changed, gets fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the slump in commodity prices was caused by poor  
exports, not government policy. A worldwide grain glut has pushed 
prices of some commodities such as soybeans and corn to their 
lowest levels since the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law ``has been helpful in many parts of the country,  
and I think it's the right way to go in the future,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for emergency aid, Lott said there is no need for Congress to  
act before September or October, when it will be clearer how much 
help farmers will need. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are chary of getting into a bidding war with  
Democrats. Last fall, they proposed a $4 billion bailout only to 
have it vetoed by President Clinton. The package eventually 
ballooned to $6 billion.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Give Receiver Owens 7-Yr Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wide receiver Terrell Owens has reached a  
7-year contract agreement with the San Francisco 49ers worth at 
least $23 million, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes a signing bonus of $7.5 million and an  
escalator clause that could push the total value of the deal to as 
much as $35 million, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was approved Friday by the NFL's Management  
Council. The 49ers and Owens scheduled a press conference for 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Owens had 67 receptions for 1,097 yards and 14  
touchdowns, including a 79-yard scoring catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, he had signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract,  
which counted against the team's salary cap. The new agreement 
spreads the economic impact over several years.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Irked Over Bush Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- State Republican Party leaders say they  
were paid with out-of-state ``soft'' money for the lease on a prime 
site that Texas Gov. George W. Bush will use next month to court 
activists at a big straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides and party leaders insist the move is legal, an  
argument rejected by a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to publisher Steve Forbes say the expenditure violates  
campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``This raises serious questions about how ethical a Bush  
administration would be, particularly since they've raised a 
gazillion dollars from Washington lobbyists,'' said spokesman Keith 
Appel. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mindy Tucker, spokeswoman for the Republican presidential  
front-runner, said it's legal and that ``we play by the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republican Party Executive Director Dee Stewart confirmed  
the state party was paid with out-of-state checks that didn't come 
from the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, a straw poll is a fund-raiser for the  
party, it's not an election,'' said Stewart. ``It's perfectly 
acceptable for a presidential candidate to encourage people to 
donate money to the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said the party was paid with six separate checks, and a  
receipt given to the person delivering the checks. He said he was 
unsure whether that person was affiliated with a campaign, but 
insisted the party acted within the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are well within state and federal guidelines,'' said  
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the campaigns have leased space outside of Hilton  
Coliseum in Ames next month to throw parties for supporters showing 
up for the straw poll, considered an early test of candidate 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush paid the most, spending $43,000 to rent the spot. By  
contrast, Elizabeth Dole spent $5,500 for her site. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker conceded the money, actually paid to the Iowa Republican  
Party, came from soft money from out of state. She said the move 
was legal and the spending allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is cash donated directly to political parties instead  
of candidates and is largely unregulated by federal campaign 
finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an efficient use of our resources,'' Tucker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes aide Bill Dal Col disagreed, saying the expenditure  
violated campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be three or four separate violations,'' Dal Col said.

<HEADLINE> Octogenarian Tops Tennis World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAHWAH, N.J. (AP) -- Dorothy ``Dodo'' Bundy Cheney would never  
dream of stepping on a tennis court without a string of pearls 
around her neck, her tennis whites gleaming. 
</P>
<P>
	No primary colors and cut-out dresses; no shorts. Cheney, a  
petite woman crowned with short reddish-blonde hair, likes lace -- 
on her skirts, blouses, wristbands, even her knee brace. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother always played in pearls,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The gentility disappears once Cheney, 82, starts playing. The  
daughter of May Sutton Bundy, the first American to win at 
Wimbledon, is now the top player in the USTA league for players 
between 80 and 85. After playing for more than 70 years, she is the 
biggest winner in USTA history with 301 national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first came when she was 24, but most came after she turned  
55. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the senior tour, we all try to prove that tennis is a  
lifetime sport,'' Cheney, dressed in her lace and pearls, said 
after demolishing Irma Krizack 6-0, 6-1 in the quarterfinals of the 
USTA Women's 80s National Invitational tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	She defeated Marion Read 6-1, 6-1 in the semifinals Thursday  
night. The finals are Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my biggest lessons in life is never compare yourself to  
Dodo at any time, in any situation ... she's just unbelievable,'' 
said May Cheney, her daughter, who recently turned 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking 50 is nothing, I've got another 30 years,'' she  
said. ``I've never thought of myself at any age as being over the 
hill because my mom is past 80 and still going strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis been a lifetime love for Dodo Cheney, whose father,  
Thomas Bundy, won three national doubles championships from 
1912-1914, and was on the Davis Cup team twice. May Bundy won 
Wimbledon for the first time in 1905 and again in 1907, and was 
inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Cheney's aunts ranked among the top four U.S. players  
before 1915, and her three brothers also played competitively. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheney was ranked as high as No. 3 in her prime in the late  
1930s. She reached the semifinals of the United States 
championships, a forerunner of the U.S. Open, and winning the 
Australian Championship, a precursor to the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	But tennis was never her sole priority. She had too many other  
joys in her life, like her three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, Cheney has no regrets about the records she might have  
accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
	She has become more competitive over time, dominating her age  
group, moving up to play in the 75s and younger if she feels she's 
not getting the competition she wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she really enjoys winning right now,'' said May  
Cheney. ``Before she enjoyed playing, the travel, the people. She 
still does but I do think she has that will to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During her match against Krizack, Cheney showed why she's No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	She didn't move around a lot; she didn't need to. She made her  
opponent move after shots that would drop just over the net and 
then take odd bounces. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheney only lost 11 points and needed just 28 minutes to finish  
her match. 
</P>
<P>
	She lost two games against Read, but still had no problem  
winning. The last shot had so much spin that it bounced back toward 
the net once it dropped over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew where it was going but I couldn't do anything,'' Read  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has very superb anticipation, wonderful mastery of her  
shots, and she can cut the ball either way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also puts attention on the sport.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're so proud of her ... It's just wonderful. She does senior  
tennis a lot of good, we really have a spokesperson,'' Read said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheney, who lives in La Jolla, Calif., said she's amazed at the  
caliber of play among the young women on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows first hand about one young player. She faced a  
9-year-old Venus Williams at a tournament in Los Angeles about 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wiped me off the court,'' Cheney said. ``Even at that age  
she was very powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheney plays about two tournaments a month, and has no intention  
of stopping any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I keep healthy and well, I'll play,'' she said.  
``You'd think I'd be sick and tired of it by now, but I still enjoy 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Diana Saw JFK Jr. As Role Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Princess Diana saw John F. Kennedy Jr. as a role  
model for her son, Prince William, especially in handling of the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping he'll grow up to be as smart about it as John  
Kennedy Jr.,'' she said two months before her death in a 1997 Paris 
traffic crash. William is second in line for the throne of England, 
behind his father, Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want William to be able to handle things as well as John  
does,'' The New Yorker magazine quoted her as saying in an article 
published after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Kennedy's airplane was missing on a flight from New  
Jersey to Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. Also on the plane were 
Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren 
Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the attention that had been focused on him and his  
sister, Caroline, Kennedy responded then that he believed he had it 
easier growing up in the public eye than William and his brother, 
Prince Harry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really able to lead a normal life from about the age of  
5. I went to boarding school and then college,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing I went through could compare to what they are  
facing,'' Kennedy told reporters about two weeks after Diana's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had taught  
him about handling fame, Kennedy said: ``We didn't actually sit 
down and have a tutorial session. But you pick things up.''

	But the brothers lost interest after learning that the county  
and township couldn't come up with all the money for the land right 
away, Peter Paul Luce said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the person who wants to buy a car for let's say  
$10,000, but they've only got $5,000,'' said Luce, 70, of 
Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	They are now asking $9.5 million on the open market for the  
estate, with its 21-room mansion and miles of views of the Somerset 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Luce and Lila Hotz Luce Tyng built the estate, called Lu  
Shan, in 1933, about a decade after Luce founded the Time Inc. 
magazine empire. Mrs. Tyng received the home two years later after 
the couple divorced. She died in March.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Story Tops News Around World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- TV and radio stations throughout Europe led  
newscasts with reports of the search for the missing plane carrying 
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance topped French TV news Saturday with  
reports on the search, profiles of Kennedy's life and special 
reports devoted to the Kennedys, one about President Kennedy's 
death by Walter Cronkite. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was traveling with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,  
and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, to a family wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the British Broadcasting Corp. led its TV afternoon  
news with a report of the plane's disappearance on its way to 
Martha's Vineyard, while the BBC's Internet site said the Kennedy 
family ``could be facing another tragedy, the latest in a long 
history which has become known as the curse of the Kennedys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian state TV also led with the story, using the 1963 photo  
of ``John-John,'' as Kennedy is known, saluting his father's 
coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, correspondents traveling with Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak during his trip to the United States were asked by local 
stations about the fate of Kennedy and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, the independent NTV television carried news of the  
search, accompanied by footage of Kennedy meeting President 
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Says Health Is Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said  
Saturday night that he is nearly rid of cancer and recovering from 
an ulcer caused by radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking by telephone intercom to an audience gathered at a  
restaurant to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Nation of 
Islam's newspaper, the Final Call, Farrakhan sounded upbeat during 
his 15-minute address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe within the next few months that ulcer will be  
completely healed and that your brother will be back with you,'' he 
said. ``I'm not an old man and I'm certainly not tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 66, who was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in  
1991, underwent surgery March 30 to correct an inflammation caused 
by his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nation of Islam officials would only say Farrakhan was speaking  
from one of his homes, but would not say which one. Farrakhan has 
at least two homes, one in Chicago and one in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan explained that the ulcer led to very serious bleeding.  
``But by the grace of God, we caught it in time.'' He said he 
recently visited his doctors, who told him that the ulcer was 50 
percent healed. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan said he hopes to publish the newspaper, which he  
started in his cousin's Washington, D.C., apartment before moving 
it to Chicago, in Spanish, Arabic and French on the African 
continent.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Company President Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The president of a now-defunct insurance  
company who admitted stealing more than $2 million to support what 
he called his addiction to sex was sentenced to over five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge rejected Richard Maack's request for leniency  
Friday and sentenced him to five years, 10 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Maack, 41, said he stole huge sums from clients to support a  
lifestyle devoted to maintaining a series of sexual relationships 
with strippers. He bought one dancer a car and rented her an 
apartment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maack pleaded guilty in April 1998 to stealing about $2.3  
million from 1993 to 1995 while an official of Insurance Claims 
Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz listened to a full day of  
testimony from three experts on addictions before passing sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``However his sexual problems may be described, Mr. Maack could  
have controlled his actions,'' Katz said. ``He could have adhered 
to law. And he could have made money legally, rather than steal 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Debris From Kennedy Plane Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Hope dimmed late Saturday for John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law, as darkness descended on 
the waters off Martha's Vineyard where their plane went down. 
Debris washed ashore, but there was no sign of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you miraculous stories of people surviving,'' said  
Rear Admiral Richard M. Larrabee, first Coast Guard district 
commander, at a late afternoon news conference. ``I can tell you in 
previous cases like this, we've searched as many as three or four 
days. We're not ready to give up on this yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the daylong search by planes, helicopters and boats yielded  
little but some fragments of Kennedy's red-and-white plane, a piece 
of baggage labeled with the business card of Lauren Bessette, 
sister of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and a prescription bottle 
belonging to Bessette Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said the visual aerial search was suspended for the  
night, but an Air National Guard helicopter with infrared sensors 
would continue searching in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically a heat seeker,'' said Massachusetts State  
Police Capt. Robert Bird. ``It allows articles to be located based 
on differences in temperatures between water and ... a body or a 
person in the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
searchers on the water hoped they might see an emergency beacon or 
search light in the darkness, or rescue ships might turn off their 
engines and hear faint distress calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said National Transportation Safety Board  
investigators already were at work on the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The television networks suspended their scheduled programming to  
focus on the search, and the nation was glued to its sets, echoing 
the grim fascination at his father's assassination, nearly 36 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears mounted that the Kennedys had suffered another ghastly  
tragedy. The couple had been en route to Cape Cod and a Kennedy 
cousin's wedding at Hyannis Port -- now postponed and replaced with 
prayers for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy -- universally known as ``John John''  
since he was a toddler in the White House, and once labeled the 
``sexiest man alive'' by People magazine -- had obtained his pilot's 
license just last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah -- the portion of the Vineyard  
popularly known as Gay Head -- luggage, a wheel, a headrest and part 
of a plane support known as a strut had washed up, said Coast Guard 
Lt. Craig Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Richard Stanley of the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary said  
other searchers had discovered pieces of landing gear, part of a 
rubber pedal apparatus and pieces of seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, said she saw the black bag with  
Lauren Bessette's name on it in the water. A friend, Damon 
Seligson, waded in to retrieve it. ``It was kind of like, 'Oh God.' 
It seemed like it would be pretty bad news. Everyone was shaking,'' 
said McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration sent a  
submersible named ``Rude'' (pronounced Rudy) to aid in the search, 
and it began its work on Saturday evening, using sonar to look for 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA reported the last contact with the plane during its  
final approach to the airport on the island off Cape Cod at 9:39 
p.m., the Coast Guard said. ``The aircraft was due to arrive at 
Martha's Vineyard around 10 p.m. and was later expected to fly to 
Hyannis Port,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	No flight plan had been filed, and none was required.  
</P>
<P>
	Family members were assembled in Hyannis Port for the wedding of  
the late Robert F. Kennedy's daughter Rory. A family friend 
reported the plane missing to the Coast Guard about 2:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard immediately began searching for the plane and  
contacted FAA officials, who in turn alerted rescue personnel at 
Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, which is in charge of searching 
for overdue planes. At 3:30 a.m., the Air Force got a ``positive 
hit'' on an emergency signal emanating from northern Long Island, 
said Larrabee, the Coast Guard district commander. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers searched that area for three hours, but found nothing,  
he said. At 7:30 a.m., the Coast Guard launched an aggressive 
search of the area around Martha's Vineyard and Montauk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the morning, the search area was narrowed significantly  
when officials reviewed radar records and found the plane's last 
known location was about 17 miles southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a  
statement confirming that the plane left the Essex County Airport 
in Fairfield, N.J., about 8:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Martin, of Hyannis Port, who described himself as a friend  
of the family, said the plane was stopping in Martha's Vineyard to 
drop off Lauren Bessette, before Kennedy and his wife continued on 
to Hyannis Port. It wasn't clear whether the couple planned to 
start the next leg immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard identified the plane as a single-engine,  
six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP, acquired recently by Kennedy. The 
plane is known in the aviation industry as a high-performance 
airplane with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. Kennedy was not licensed to fly on instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the pilot wants to have is a relatively distinct horizon  
to see the ground and be able to determine the aircraft's altitude 
by looking outside,'' said Warren Morningstar, a pilot and 
spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At night your visual horizon is not going to be as distinct,  
and if it's hazy conditions, your vision is going to be obscured,'' 
Morningstar added. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th  
anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, in which Sen. Edward 
Kennedy's car went off a bridge, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne 
on a tiny island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also three years to the day after the crash on July 17,  
1996, of Paris-bound flight TWA800, off the south shore of Long 
Island, and 35 years after Ted Kennedy narrowly escaped death in a 
private plane crash in which he suffered a broken back. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Labor Day, Kennedy flew another plane -- its registration  
number, N529JK, paid tribute to his father's May 29 birthday -- up 
to Hyannisport for a family get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in May 1998, Kennedy told USA Today that he had  
gotten his license a few weeks before, but none of his relatives 
could be persuaded to fly with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who  
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said. ``The 
second it was legal she came up with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, ``whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane  
and fly off,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Kennedy was on a rafting trip in the West, according to  
CNN. She is the only other survivor of the young family that 
transfixed the world, four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance sent a shudder across the country. The  
Chicago Sun-Times printed an extra edition of its Sunday paper with 
the news; in New York, at Yankee Stadium, fans were asked to rise 
for a moment of silent prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. has lived entirely in the public eye, from his birth  
shortly after his father's election as the nation's 35th president, 
to his poignant salute on the day of his namesake's funeral, to his 
romances with Daryl Hannah and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he more  
recently attracted attention with his political magazine, George, 
in which he once posed nude. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his few private moments was his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding to  
Bessette Kennedy, a former publicist for fashion designer Calvin 
Klein. They were wed in an ultra-private ceremony on a small island 
off the coast of Georgia, free of hovering helicopters and 
paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy, 33, a doctor's daughter from Greenwich, Conn.,  
studied at Boston University before taking the public relations job 
in New York, where she met Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, who is 18 months older than Carolyn, has a twin  
sister, Lisa Ann. A 1982 graduate of Greenwich High School, Lauren 
worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New 
York City.

<HEADLINE> New Weather Terms Abound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It's not the heat, it's the humidity. Or is it the  
dew point? What about the heat index? 
</P>
<P>
	As high temperatures abound this summer, you may be hearing  
fewer references to humidity -- the traditional measure of muggy, 
sticky weather -- and more talk of dew points and heat indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists have used these ``new'' buzz words internally for  
years but are taking them public to replace or supplement weather 
terms frequently lost on the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you say the humidity is 50 percent, I don't think that  
really means a lot to people,'' said meteorologist Michael Henry. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists point to ``relative humidity'' as a frequently  
misunderstood weather term. 
</P>
<P>
	It refers to how much moisture the air can hold at a certain  
temperature. Because it is expressed as a percentage, that alone 
makes it a poor indicator for the public of what the weather feels 
like outside, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, dew point readings are expressed as single numbers  
-- like temperatures -- and give a better indication of outdoor 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	For most people, at dew point readings of 50 or below, the air  
outside feels comfortable. When readings creep into the 60s, many 
start to feel uncomfortable as excessive moisture in the air 
prevents sweat from evaporating. At levels above 70, nearly 
everyone feels oppressed by wet, muggy air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier to work with than percentages,'' said Dennis  
Smith, a meteorologist with The Weather Channel in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	By definition, the dew point is the temperature the air must be  
cooled down to for moisture to come out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Another good indicator of how hot it is outside is the heat  
index -- similar to wind chill readings in the winter. The heat 
index is a combination reading of the temperature and dew point and 
indicates how hot it feels outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just say its like wind-chill in reverse,'' said Ed Carroll,  
a meteorologist with Boston's WBZ-TV. ``It feels hotter than it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say that 'round the clock weather information on the  
Internet and cable television has helped the general public 
understand the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``People know that if the heat index is above 100 the weather is  
going to be pretty bad outside,'' said Joe Dellicarpini, a 
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

<HEADLINE> Crane Supervisor Concerns Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A union leader says iron workers, upset over a  
crane collapse that killed three men, won't resume work on the 
Milwaukee Brewers new baseball stadium until a supervisor of crane 
lifts is removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he isn't replaced, we're not going back to work,'' said  
Brent Emons, business manager for Iron Workers Local 8, which 
represents many Miller Park workers, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisor was not identified.  
</P>
<P>
	A giant crane lifting a roof section of Miller Park, the new  
$400 million home of the Brewers, collapsed in winds gusting up to 
26 mph Wednesday, killing three workers and injuring five others. 
</P>
<P>
	Emons and some iron workers have said workers felt it had been  
too windy to make the lift of the 400-ton section of the ballpark's 
retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just feel that it was a bad call, and we won't be put in  
that position again,'' Emons said. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers have been off since the accident. They are due to  
report back to work on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Cannon, a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi, the stadium's roof  
contractor, said Friday that the job status of the lift supervisor 
mentioned by Emons had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in the same position and has the same responsibilities,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyle Balistreri, president of the Milwaukee Building and  
Construction Trades Council, said unions have an agreement 
prohibiting work stoppages at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extremely serious issue,'' he said. ``We do not  
sanction what is happening here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal safety inspectors doing an unannounced safety inspection  
at the site when the crane collapsed apparently had no concerns 
about the safety of the operation, said Jim Dollins, of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said they don't yet know what the accident will  
do to the timetable for completing Miller Park, which had been due 
to open next April.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's Value Tops $500 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Investors continued their love affair with  
Microsoft Corp., making the software giant the first company to be 
worth more than half a trillion dollars as its stock price surged 
on a positive jury verdict and a rumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's stock was up $5.06 1/4 to close at $99.43 3/4 a share  
Friday in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. With more than 5.1 
billion shares outstanding, Microsoft was worth about $507 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 company, General Electric, was worth about $384  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	At current stock prices, company chairman Bill Gates would be  
worth more than $100 billion, based on the more than 1 billion 
Microsoft shares he was listed as owning in a Feb. 11 proxy 
statement. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, with more than 276 
million shares, is worth more than $27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft received one boost Friday when a federal court jury in  
Connecticut ruled it had not violated federal antitrust laws in its 
dealings with Bristol Technology Inc., a small software company. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, The Wall Street Journal reported  
Microsoft, which will report its annual earnings Monday, is moving 
closer to creating a tracking stock for its Internet businesses to 
take advantage of the stock market's infatuation with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A tracking stock is designed to give investors the opportunity  
to focus on just one aspect of the company's business without 
creating a separate publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokeswoman declined comment on the Journal report.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN.com is one of the most-visited sites on the Web,  
and includes such services as Hotmail e-mail, the Expedia travel 
site and the CarPoint auto buying service. 
</P>
<P>
	Although critics assail Microsoft's take-no-prisoners  
competitiveness, investors have favored a company with large profit 
margins, rapidly growing sales and no debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's phenomenal rise has created countless millionaires  
and made founders Gates and Allen two of the richest men on Earth.

<HEADLINE> 100 Homeless After Spokane Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- More than 100 people were left homeless  
and one firefighter injured due to a fire that destroyed most of a 
downtown city block. 
</P>
<P>
	The early Friday blaze, which started in a vacant three-story  
brick building, rapidly spread to a six-story apartment building 
with 90 units. Many of the residents, mostly elderly and low-income 
people, fled in little more than bathrobes. 
</P>
<P>
	The buildings that were destroyed date from the turn of the  
century and are some of the city's oldest. Authorities say 108 
people are now without homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A column of black smoke hung over downtown well into the  
afternoon. Charred embers littered streets for several blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A firefighter was knocked unconscious after a ceiling collapsed,  
but she was treated and released from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was called  
in to help pinpoint the cause of the blaze.

	JFK Jr.'s Plane Reported Missing  
</P>
<P>
	MATTITUCK, N.Y. (AP) -- An intensive search is under way today  
for John F. Kennedy Jr., whose small plane is missing en route to a 
family wedding in Massachusetts. The only son of the 35th president 
was traveling with his wife Carolyn Bessette, and her sister, the 
Coast Guard said. The Piper Saratoga took off from Essex Airport in 
Caldwell, N.J., at 8:45 p.m. yesterday and was heading to the Cape 
Cod-Martha's Vineyard area en route to a wedding today in 
Hyannisport, Mass. The passengers were due to arrive in Martha's 
Vineyard at 10 p.m. yesterday, but never arrived, a source told The 
AP. Coast Guard crews scoured a 150-mile-long swath of sea today 
from eastern Long Island to Cape Cod.

	Kennedy Compound Wedding Postponed  
</P>
<P>
	HYANNISPORT, Mass. (AP) -- At the storied compound here that has  
been a refuge of the Kennedy family for decades, the setting was 
prepared for a wedding today, but it had to be postponed. Family 
members and friends gathered for the wedding of Rory Kennedy had 
learned that the plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife to 
the wedding was missing. A Mass began on the porch of the house of 
Rory's mother, Ethel Kennedy, with about 50 family members and 
three priests praying ``for the safety of the loved ones,'' a 
family spokesman said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax cuts of the size proposed by Republicans  
in Congress would ``blow a $3 trillion hole'' in the federal budget 
just as baby boomers retirement strains Medicare and Social 
Security, President Clinton said today. In his weekly radio 
address, Clinton cited a new Treasury Department analysis showing 
the House GOP plan to cut taxes by $864 billion over 10 years would 
cost more than three times that in the decade after 2009. In the 
Republican response, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said deep tax 
cuts he helped enact in his state beginning in 1986 have now 
translated into $5,600 less in taxes for the average Wisconsin 
family.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered national  
anti-abortion leaders to pay more than $257,000 in damages and to 
stop interfering with the operation of abortion clinics across the 
country. U.S. District Judge David Coar yesterday barred the 
leaders from blocking clinic doors and driveways, damaging clinic 
property and threatening violence against doctors and patients 
anywhere in the nation for the next 12 years. Those named as 
defendants were Joseph Scheidler, head of the Chicago-based 
Pro-Life Action League, the league itself, Operation Rescue and two 
other activists.

said today. Bogoljub Karic, a Serbian government minister without

speech marking the 31st anniversary of the coup that brought his 
party to power, Saddam said other Arab leaders feel the same way 
but were reluctant to tell the Israelis. ``Palestine is Arab. The 
Zionists must depart from it,'' Saddam said. His remarks came as 
Israel's new Prime Minister Ehud Barak is vowing to speed up the 
Mideast peace process.

	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Australia's Craig Parry, who began  
the day eight shots off the lead at the British Open, birdied six 
holes today to move within three shots of Frenchman Jean Van de 
Velde. Parry was 5-under for the day through 16 holes and 4-over 
for the tournament. Van de Velde faltered early, making a bogey on 
the second hole, but came back with a birdie to get back to 1-over 
and lead by two shots over Sweden's Patrik Sjoland. Greg Norman 
birdied the first hole to get to 3-over, but then bogeyed the next 
two. Tiger Woods is 4-over, two shots back.

<HEADLINE> Overpumping Affects Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overpumping is sucking out too much of the  
world's underground fresh water, with a stable world food supply 
now dependent on an increasing global water deficit, Worldwatch 
Institute said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Annually, the study estimates, 160 billion cubic meters of water  
is lost to thirsty cities and farms that are not returning it to 
underground aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest known losses are in India, China, the United States,  
North Africa and Saudi Arabia. The lost water would be enough to 
grow 10 percent of world grain, said Worldwatch, a nongovernment 
research group funded by grants and sales of its publications. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of giant pumps to extract water from ever-deeper in the  
earth was once viewed as a boon for farmers worldwide. Now, 
according to water expert Sandra Postel, the report's author, 
massive pumping intensifies water shortages that threaten to reduce 
the global food supply, spread hunger and increase social conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few years ago, the practice was confined to certain parts of  
the world and seemed manageable,'' she said. ``Now, we see it 
occurring across very wide areas over the most important 
food-producing regions, including in India and China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The large pumping projects are often subsidized by governments  
to get needed water to farmers and thirsty cities, she said. Unlike 
more visible dam projects, they have rarely been controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	But what they are doing underground is beginning to hurt, with  
wells running dry and parts of some cities such as Bangkok and 
Mexico City showing signs of literally sinking because of ground 
water drainage, Postel said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	With world population set to surpass 6 billion in October, the  
problem of dropping water tables is bound to worsen, she said. Her 
Worldwatch book, ``Pillar of Sand: Can the Irrigation Miracle 
Last?'' says irrigation accounts for two-thirds of global use of 
fresh water, but less than half the water actually reaches the 
roots of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Methods are needed to double the efficiency of water use, she  
said, citing several steps that are working: 
</P>
<P>
	--Some farmers in India, Israel, Jordan, Spain and parts of the  
United States use drip irrigation systems that deliver water 
directly to crop roots. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rice farmers in an area of Malaysia increased water  
productivity 45 percent by shoring up canals and switching from 
traditional transplanting methods to direct sowing of seed into the 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	--Israel is now reusing 65 percent of its domestic wastewater for  
crop production, freeing up fresh water for households and 
industries.

<HEADLINE> 'Two Fat Ladies' Star Hospitalized </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jennifer Paterson, one of ``The Two Fat Ladies''  
television cooking pair, has undergone tests for cancer and is 
hospitalized in London, the BBC said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 71-year-old chef and fellow cook Clarissa Dickson Wright  
have amused and enlightened audiences in many countries. They 
travel about the countryside in a motorcycle and sidecar to collect 
ingredients, and leaven their recipes with wry humor. 
</P>
<P>
	With her eccentric manner and fondness for smoking and high  
living, Miss Paterson has become one of television's most unlikely 
celebrities. 
</P>

	Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London confirmed she was  
there and said her condition was satisfactory but gave no further

<HEADLINE> More Salmonella Tied to Ariz. Juice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- At least 207 confirmed cases of salmonella have  
now been linked to unpasteurized orange juice distributed by a 
Tempe company, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned  
consumers not to drink unpasteurized orange juice distributed by 
Sun Orchard Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said Friday that the cases have been reported  
in 15 states and two Canadian provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	The company voluntarily recalled its freshly squeezed orange  
juice on June 25 after clusters of salmonella cases were reported 
in Washington and Oregon. Sun Orchard is now pasteurizing all of 
its juice products, according to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The juice products, both frozen and liquid, were distributed  
under several brand names including the labels Earls &AMP; Joey 
Tomato's, Trader Joe's, Markon, Sysco, Aloha and Voila! The juice 
in question was dated for use before July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials say those who suspect they may have salmonella  
poisoning should see a doctor immediately. The bacteria can cause 
severe intestinal distress and possibly even death.

<P>
	ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) -- Al Gore, George W. Bush, take heart --  
Gov. Jesse Ventura is not going to make a run for the White House 
in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not doing it,'' the former pro wrestler said Friday.  
``You got to do the job. I don't want to be president. I like being 
the governor of Minnesota. 
</P>

	``Do you want to know who started all that? The media,'' Ventura  
said during a radio show appearance.

	Ventura didn't talk much about his upcoming return to the World

liked the raucous wrestling crowd who showed up for the 
announcement Wednesday because they shouted down reporters who 
asked questions he didn't like.

<HEADLINE>  Apollo Launch Anniversary Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- He thought he said it. He meant to  
say it. But 30 years after he blasted off on Apollo 11, Neil 
Armstrong can't be certain he inserted an ``a'' before ``man'' in 
his moon-stepping speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,''  
is how history has recorded the first words uttered by the first 
man to tread the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first news conference in years, at an anniversary  
celebration Friday, Armstrong said he came up with the line after 
he and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, four days 
after lifting off from Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said his ``gut feeling'' when he lifted off from Earth  
with Aldrin and Michael Collins is that they had a 90 percent 
chance of returning safely and that he and Aldrin had a 50 percent 
chance of landing successfully on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``After landing, actually having been somewhat surprised, the  
fact that we were able to make a successful touchdown, I realized I 
was going to have to say something,'' said the 68-year-old 
Armstrong, who was the mission commander. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wasn't anything very complicated. When you just think  
about stepping off, why, it seemed to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What didn't follow, at least for those listening back on Earth,  
was ``a'' -- the subject of decades of debate among space historians 
and space buffs. Armstrong speculated after the mission that his 
voice-operated transmitter may not have picked up the word. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 'a' was intended,'' Armstrong explained to reporters. ``I  
thought I said it. I can't hear it when I listen on the radio 
reception here on Earth. So I'll be happy if you just put it in 
parenthesis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The normally reclusive Armstrong, flanked by Aldrin and two  
other Apollo astronauts, sat on a stool and clasped his hands in 
his lap as he fielded questions from dozens of journalists. He 
spoke quietly and with a minimum of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Would he choose privacy over being the first man on the moon?  
</P>
<P>
	``Never,'' he replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Does he think about his moon landing on a daily basis?  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably only when you guys remind me,'' he told reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Should America return to the moon? Society should return, he  
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I left a few things up there.''  
</P>
<P>
	As for the legacy of Apollo, Armstrong said: ``The important  
achievement of Apollo was a demonstration that humanity is not 
forever chained to this planet, and our visions go rather farther 
than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a banquet later in the evening at a tourist complex housing a  
Saturn V moon rocket, Armstrong and Aldrin received standing 
ovations from the crowd of 1,000, many of them space program 
retirees who helped send them to the moon. Collins, who circled the 
moon in the Apollo 11 command module, did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never too late to say, `Thanks,' and I could never say,  
'Thanks' often enough to those of you who made it possible,'' 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apollo 17's Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, noted  
that any of the Apollo astronauts could have been first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been any one of a number of us,'' Cernan said.  
``But it so happened to be that it was Neil Armstrong. And the 
press has questioned him and even criticized him over the years for 
the privacy he has maintained in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I want to tell you as I stand here with a great deal of  
pride to say there is none of us, any of us in the space program 
who would have had that opportunity, who could have handled the 
responsibility with such dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong promised the press, with a shy smile: ``Maybe I'll try  
to do better.''

<HEADLINE> Serbia, Montenegro Split Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia and Montenegro, the two  
republics that make up Yugoslavia, may split for good if they fail 
to agree on redefining their mutual relations, a top Serb official 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogoljub Karic, a Serbian government minister without portfolio,  
said it was better for Montenegro to have full independence than 
autonomy with just 5 percent representation in the Yugoslav 
federation, according to Vijesti newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Karic also said that if the two republics failed to agree on how  
to live together, ``there remains nothing else but for us to 
separate in a democratic and civilized manner,'' according to the 
Belgrade-based private news agency, Beta. 
</P>
<P>
	While Karic said Montenegro could maintain ``quality relations''  
with dominant Serbia, where ``each is the master in his own 
house,'' he emphasized that the joint state must be based on 
existing constitutional rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strongest Montenegrin party must be in the federal  
government, and have the post of premier as well,'' Karic told 
Vijesti. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks began earlier this week in Belgrade between delegations  
from the two republics. Montenegro's pro-Western government hopes 
the talks might lead to Yugoslavia becoming a looser federation. 
But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is unlikely to agree to 
relenting power. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a split puts pressure on Serb officials to  
consider ousting Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb-born American millionaire, Milan Panic, who served as  
federal premier and backs Serbia's anti-Milosevic movement, told 
Belgrade daily Blic that, if Milosevic remains in power, 
``everything has been prepared for Montenegro to secede.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Not Riding on Dad's Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush is emerging from his  
father's shadow in his presidential fund raising, gleaning a 
smaller percentage of contributions in the last quarter from people 
who previously gave to his father's White House campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just shows that he's not riding on his father's coattails  
by any means,'' said Bruce Buchanan, political scientist at the 
University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press computer analysis found that 11.8 percent of  
the Texas governor's itemized individual contributions in the 
latest reporting period came from people who had given to his 
father in 1988 or 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the elder Bush gave $3.23 million out of the  
Republican front-runner's $27.5 million in the April-June quarter, 
according to records the governor filed with the Federal Election 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous reporting period, 15.4 percent of Bush's  
itemized contributions came from his father's supporters -- or $1.06 
million of $6.9 million. The AP analysis looked at individual 
contributions of more than $200. 
</P>
<P>
	Political experts see the shrinking percentage as a good sign  
for the younger Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	It's crucial for him to broaden his support beyond that held by  
his father if he hopes to emulate his successful presidential 
effort and not his losses, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need only remember that his father got 38 percent of the  
vote in 1992 to realize that if he can't greatly broaden his 
father's coalition, he will simply not win,'' said Larry Sabato, 
director of the Center for Governmental Studies at the University 
of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabato said he had expected a higher percentage of Bush's  
contributions to come from his father's backers but said the 
smaller percentage is very good for Bush's candidacy. He suggested 
it would be good strategy for Bush to try to separate himself from 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in this race, in part, because of his name, so he owes a  
lot to his father. Before this is over, if he is the nominee, he is 
going to pay for that connection,'' Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats will focus extensively on the shape of the  
economy at the end of the Bush administration versus the shape of 
the economy under the Clinton administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Goldford, chairman of the Department of Politics and  
International Relations at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, 
agreed that the smaller percentage of dad-related money is a 
positive sign for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests he's expanding his base beyond people who merely  
might have supported his father and therefore would support him,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bush didn't demonstrate overwhelming popularity even  
when he won in 1988 with only 53 percent of the popular vote in an 
election against Michael Dukakis and that Democrat's ``abysmally 
terrible campaign,'' Goldford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His name isn't George Reagan, it's George Bush,'' Goldford  
said. ``If his name were George Schleppermeyer, he probably 
wouldn't have had that initial stake from people. That certainly 
helped. But he's not a puppet or clone of his father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he said, the younger Bush appears to be a much  
better campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Miller, director of the Iowa Social Science Institute at  
the University of Iowa in Iowa City, had a different appreciation 
of the 11.8 percent tally. He called it a percentage significant 
enough to suggest family loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is drawing upon the same constituency that his father drew  
upon, despite the fact that one of the messages he is trying to 
convey to the broader public is that he is reaching out beyond the 
normal sorts of people that the Republicans would normally draw 
into their support groups,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Hughes, the candidate's spokeswoman, said it's  
unsurprising that people who supported the father would support the 
son. They're likely to be Republicans, many are friends, and a 
number may have worked with him during his father's campaigns, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what the number also says is, look at the 90 percent  
who contributed to Governor Bush who did not contribute to his 
father,'' she said. ``What that will say is Governor Bush is 
succeeding in attracting support from people who may have never 
been involved politically before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Bush, who is unrelated, organized more than 300  
fund-raisers for the former president. He said the crowd at a 
recent Washington fund-raiser for the younger Bush is a good sign 
of broad support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old Bush group was there, and they were there in force.  
But there was a whole new group of people that I had never heard of 
before. I think that bodes well,'' Fred Bush said. ``I think it 
says there's huge pent-up demand for leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bush took in $1 million at a June 22 fund-raiser attended  
by many lobbyists and by members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	By the numbers, the AP analysis found that of 34,620 reportable  
contributions totaling $27.5 million in the last reporting period, 
there were 3,677 totaling $3.23 million from people who also gave 
to Bush's father in 1988 or 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 8,669 reportable contributions totaling $6.9 million in the  
first reporting period, 1,350 totaling $1.06 million came from 
people who also gave to Bush's father in 1988 or 1992.

<HEADLINE> Father Searched for Son in Ariz. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- The place is nothing like the father  
imagined, this exquisite sandstone ravine framed by junipers and 
oaks, yucca, cacti and manzanita bushes. 
</P>
<P>
	He thought it would be more remote, more forbidding. He thought  
he would sense danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The colors are as rich as oil paintings: burnished reds and  
earthen browns, pale sandstone, gray granite, white limestone. But 
the father's eyes are drawn to the one color that doesn't belong, 
the fluorescent green police line slashed across the trunk of the 
giant ponderosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Kneeling at its base, he pulls a chisel from his toolbox. Slowly  
he starts to carve. Stooped, silver-haired, he resembles a priest 
at an altar. 
</P>
<P>
	His name is John Kearney, and people tell him he's a hero. But  
he doesn't feel like one. 
</P>
<P>
	He chips away methodically. The only sound, aside from his  
scraping, is the catlike cry of a mockingbird. Gradually, a perfect 
white cross appears in the bark. The father allows himself a quiet 
nod. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he pulls out his penknife and starts carving a name.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The events that led Kearney to Oak Creek Canyon began three  
months earlier, on an icy January morning in Scranton, Pa. He was 
at work at his electrical contracting company when his wife called. 
</P>
<P>
	``J.D.'s missing.''  
</P>
<P>
	Their 23-year-old son hadn't returned from a student conference  
in Arizona, hadn't been seen in two days, hadn't phoned. His friend 
Damean Freas was missing too. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearney's co-workers had never seen their boss so worried.  
``Cool Hand Luke,'' they jokingly call Kearney. The guy just walks 
into a room and everyone knows who's in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeeze, John,'' one said. ``Maybe they went someplace and  
stayed a couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kearney was close to tears.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no doubt in his mind that J.D. would have packed  
everything he could into his four-day trip to Arizona, would have 
savored it all, from the giant saguaros of the desert to the 
nightlife in Phoenix to hiking in the mountains with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seize the day,'' J.D. was always urging his younger brothers,  
the line borrowed from his favorite movie, ``Dead Poets Society.'' 
But he wouldn't have lingered without calling; he wouldn't have 
seized the day without letting them know. 
</P>
<P>
	Named for his father, he was his mother's son. Warm. Creative.  
Sure of himself, but in an understated way. The whole family had 
cheered when he won a scholarship to medical school. In his second 
year, swamped with studies, he would still bounce home on weekends 
to go skiing with his brothers or exploring the woods with his mom. 
</P>
<P>
	The student physician with the poet's soul. J.D. was going to  
make a great doctor someday. 
</P>
<P>
	But where the heck was he? Why hadn't he called?  
</P>
<P>
	Kearney knew just one way to start the search -- in a  
brainstorming session with his brother, Donald, and with his 
friend, John Cappelloni. In 30 years together, they had designed 
and built some of the most complicated electrical systems in the 
Northeast, from ski mountains to hospitals to airports. 
Problem-solving was their business. 
</P>
<P>
	Could they solve the riddle of the missing son?  
</P>
<P>
	In his office in the Scranton Industrial Park, Kearney told them  
what he knew. J.D. and a group of his friends had been in Phoenix 
for a weekend student conference. Most had returned on Monday, but 
J.D. and Damean had stayed an extra day. Another friend was 
supposed to pick them up at the airport on Tuesday morning. They 
hadn't shown up for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Damean's father wasn't worried. They're adults, he said over the  
phone. Give them a little more time. 
</P>
<P>
	We don't have time, Kearney insisted. We have to start searching  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where do we start?'' Cappelloni asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``We follow the money,'' Kearney replied. ``If we can trace  
where they spent their money, we can find the boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is missing. I need your help.''  
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of miles away, Kathy Ervien could hear the hurt in the  
father's voice. I'm a parent myself, she told him. I'll do 
everything I can to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Such kindness, flowing from a faraway stranger, brought tears to  
Kearney's eyes. He struggled to stay composed. Getting emotional 
would only waste time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ervien was the clerk at the National rental car company, which  
has a desk at the Phoenix hotel where the friends stayed. The hotel 
staff had been polite but dismissive when Kearney called, telling 
him that his son had checked out two days ago, that they couldn't 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Ervien understood she had to do something more.  
</P>
<P>
	She pulled the records. Sure enough, Damean Freas had rented a  
car on Monday, a green Chevy Cavalier. It hadn't been returned. 
Kearney had one last question: ``What are the roads like in 
Phoenix? Are there many accidents?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a desk across the room, his brother Donald was on the phone  
asking police the same question. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	When friends and family members heard J.D. was missing, they all  
thought of the same verse: 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately ...  
I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. embraced Henry David Thoreau's lines as though they were  
written for him. He stamped them on T-shirts, in notebooks, recited 
them to siblings and friends. He hinted at them in his application 
to medical school, writing how he wanted to understand the human 
spirit as well as the body. He quoted them in valentines to his 
mom. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, in a suburb of Scranton, Lois Kearney waited by the  
phone and prayed. In Philadelphia, the woman he loved prayed, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear St. Anthony,'' Raquel Szlanic wrote in her journal,  
``please come around, for Damean and John have been lost and they 
cannot be found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Please find J.D., she thought. Please find him so we can eat  
sushi together again and I can tease him about how skinny he is 
getting. Please find him so that we can sit in the bleachers and 
watch planes in the night sky and wonder where the world will take 
us. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is missing, I need your help.''  
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday evening, the words thumped in Kearney's head like  
the chorus of a song he couldn't shake. His brother and friend had 
their own versions: 
</P>
<P>
	``My nephew is missing...''  
</P>
<P>
	``My friend's son is missing...''  
</P>
<P>
	Call after call after call: airlines, hotels, taxicab companies,  
hot-air balloon rides. They contacted the National Missing Persons 
Organization and filed a report. They called 14 hospitals and 
clinics, 28 police stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the day, Kearney called VISA, his son's credit  
card company. Pretending to be J.D., he asked for his weekend 
charges. The last one was for $100 on Sunday afternoon. J.D. had 
gone sky diving. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Arms outstretched, backs arched, they free fall over the desert  
in a blur of wind and color. 
</P>
<P>
	Damean is queasy from the start. J.D. is elated. Another great  
adventure. Another thrill to tell his brothers when he bursts in 
the door and they tumble over him on the next weekend trip home. 
</P>
<P>
	He has so much to tell about Arizona: the desert, the hiking,  
the Jeep ride through the dusty trails of John Wayne country, where 
so many cowboy movies had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	But leaping from a plane at 13,500 feet!  
</P>
<P>
	His mom will shudder. His sister will laugh at his daring. And  
Raquel will make him describe exactly how it feels to glide like a 
bird in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	One minute of breathless free falling before the parachutes open  
and they float down, landing with a gentle bump. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	For a moment, Kearney was unnerved by the sky diving, but not  
for long. The dive took place on Sunday; J.D. hadn't checked out of 
the hotel until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	So Kearney pestered the credit card company again, insisting  
there must be a later charge. He was right: $125 for a helicopter 
ride on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday morning, more than 24 hours since Kearney launched his  
phone blitz, Cindy Rahn's voice sparkled over the line, a sweet 
rush of hope: ``Of course I remember your son. Who could forget his 
smile?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rahn works for Arizona Helicopter Venture, which flies tourists  
through the canyons of Sedona. 
</P>
<P>
	Sedona? Where the heck was that? Even as he listened to Rahn,  
Kearney scrambled to pull up information from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sedona, mystical desert town of red-hued cliffs and sculpted  
sandstone buttes. One hundred miles north of Phoenix. Home to 
hikers and tourists and new age artists, elk and deer and Indian 
ruins. No wonder J.D., ever the history buff, ever the outdoorsman, 
had headed there. 
</P>
<P>
	His son was stranded somewhere 2,300 miles from home. And this  
exuberant stranger was describing J.D. with a warmth that made his 
father cry. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. was just so interested in everything, Rahn said, in the  
rocks and the geology and the Indian ruins. And his friend, Damean. 
He was such a nice young man too, but more hurried. He kept teasing 
J.D. about how he always took so much time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearney laughed. That was them, all right.  
</P>
<P>
	After the helicopter ride, J.D. had wanted to see more of the  
scenery before they headed back to Phoenix. Rahn suggested Oak 
Creek Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearney's voice was urgent again: Is it possible to rent your  
helicopter? Can I pay you to search for my son? 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, the chopper was in the air, whirling above the  
canyons and creeks. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kearney was back in action in Scranton, faxing photographs  
to the sheriff's office in Flagstaff, digging up maps of Sedona, 
downloading weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Kearney felt a surge of confidence. They  
were on the trail. They would find the boys. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. had camped and hiked since he was a child. He could look  
after himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stand a better chance in the hills of Sedona than in the  
streets of Phoenix,'' Kearney quipped to a detective on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	But not for long. It had been warm for January, temperature in  
the 30s in the canyons at night. But the forecast was for freezing 
temperatures and snow. If J.D. and Damean were lost, they had to be 
found soon. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 p.m., six hours after Kearney first spoke to Rahn, the  
phone rang. It was the helicopter company. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found the car.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Night falls fast and cold in the desert, and the craggy canyon  
walls block even the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	It is late afternoon as J.D. and Damean start up the trail. The  
day has been warm and sunny, temperatures in the high 50s -- their 
last day of freedom before catching a late flight to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sedona seduces them, red and gold cliffs rising like turreted  
cathedrals from the desert. They gasp at its beauty, its mystery. 
They talk about their families, their studies, their hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	As the sun sets, they vow to remember this day for the rest of  
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	They can't believe how cold it is getting, or how fast darkness  
falls. Suddenly, the picturesque trail is dark and foreboding. To 
light the path, they pop the flash on John's camera and stumble 
forward, laughing at their ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
	FLASH! A few more steps.  
</P>
<P>
	Shivering, Damean sits on a rock to catch his breath. J.D. takes  
off his windbreaker and hands it to his friend. They don't realize 
they are at the edge of a precipice. Damean reaches for the 
windbreaker, stumbles, and he's gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Damean!'' J.D. cries into the darkness.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Dave Cardinell and Sgt. Jeff Drayton were the first to  
arrive at the scene, pulling in beside the Cavalier in a clearing 
just south of Pine Flats campground. They started up the trail, 
their calls bouncing off the canyon walls. 
</P>
<P>
	DAMEAN!   	
</P>
<P>
	JOHN!   	
</P>
<P>
	A police rescue helicopter whirred above, but the winds were  
picking up, and the pilot couldn't descend low enough so he turned 
back. The cops continued, finding none of the clues they were 
looking for. No cigarette butts, no water bottles, nothing to 
indicate two hikers had passed this way. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated, they headed back down. They would need daylight, and  
dozens of officers, to comb these hills. 
</P>
<P>
	At the cruiser, Cardinell sniffed the air suspiciously and  
glanced back up the canyon. Smoke! 
</P>
<P>
	A thin column spiraled out of the rocks a few hundred yards from  
the trail. The cops sprinted toward the spot, yelling with all 
their might. 
</P>
<P>
	In a crevice beneath a 70-foot sandstone cliff, they found him,  
a crumpled figure lying awkwardly on his back, covered in blood, 
right foot uncovered, blue from frostbite. Flames were leaping all 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Help,'' he whimpered. ``Don't let me burn.''  
</P>
<P>
	For three days and nights, he had lain there, delirious,  
hypothermic, close to death. He didn't know the body of his friend 
lay just 20 feet away, cradled in the base of a giant ponderosa. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hallucinating, ranting incoherently. For several hours,  
police weren't sure which student they had rescued or which father 
to call to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
	In Scranton, Kearney's telephones, which had been ringing madly  
all day, fell eerily quiet. What had they found in Oak Creek 
Canyon? Why didn't they call? 
</P>
<P>
	Three hours passed before word finally came.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It takes three months before the father can bring himself to  
hike up Oak Creek Canyon. But he knows he has to go. He has to see 
for himself the charred crevice where the survivor set a fire to 
signal the police, has to touch the tree where his son came to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kneeling by its trunk he carves the initials.  
</P>
<P>
	J.D.K.  
</P>
<P>
	The last letter is the hardest. As the bark falls away, the  
father's body shakes with sobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you,'' he whispers.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Epilogue:  
</P>
<P>
	J.D.'s mother wears his socks. His 21-year-old sister hugs his  
sweaters. His brothers, 14 and 10, write poems about their idol, 
how it's OK to cry. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman he loved turns her tiny loft into a shrine in his  
memory, a place where candles flicker beside his drawings and the 
sweet verses he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows precisely what happened at Oak Creek Canyon. Police  
think J.D. lost his footing as he clambered down the cliff to help 
his friend. They are sure of little else, other than the miracle of 
Damean's survival -- and John Kearney's role in finding him. 
</P>
<P>
	Damean wrestles every day with a foot that has no feeling and a  
heart that has too much. He says he tries to be less hurried now, 
more serene, more like J.D. This is his tribute to his best friend 
and to the man who saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Kearney draws comfort from Damean's words and from watching  
his recovery. Two months after the accident, he managed to walk, 
despite a steel rod in his leg and nerve damage from frostbite. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kearney struggles to find consolation in the life he saved.  
He needs to do something more for the one he couldn't. So he 
designs and builds a cross, a beautiful aluminum cross, three feet 
high and weighing 50 pounds. Tamper-proof, weatherproof, it is an 
engineering masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	At Oak Creek Canyon, he drills a hole in a rock and anchors the  
cross. 
</P>
<P>
	It glints there in the sun, barely visible from the side of the  
road, as immovable as the canyon itself, as eternal as the scrub 
and the sunsets and the mockingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
	As eternal as a father's love.  
</P>

<P>
	LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Yes It's True solidified his standing as the  
country's top sprinter, driving late to beat Good And Tough by 
three-quarters of a length in the $300,000 Frank J. DeFrancis 
Memorial Dash on Saturday at Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
	The D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt, carrying seven more pounds then  
any other entrant, won his fourth straight start, finishing six 
furlongs in 1:08.67. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-5 betting favorite, with Jerry Bailey aboard, paid $3.40,  
$2.20 and $2.10. Good And Tough was worth $2.40 and $2.10, and 
Storm Punch, a locally trained longshot, returned $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True started three wide and was third for most of the  
race. He made his big push in the stretch, overtaking Storm Punch 
and holding off Good and Tough. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone 3-year-old in a six-horse field, Yes It's True won for  
the sixth time in eight starts this year after earlier victories in 
Gulfstream's Swale Stakes, Keeneland's Lafayette Stakes, Pimlico's 
Maryland Breeders' Cup Handicap, Belmont's Riva Ridge Stakes and 
Monmouth's Jersey Shore Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Good and Tough, who had won four of his past five starts, broke  
slowly and played catch-up much of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeFrancis, elevated to Grade I status for the first time  
this year, is the only top-level six-furlong race in North America 
outside of the Breeders' Cup Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, named after a former Laurel CEO, has produced three  
sprint champions in the past nine years, as well as four Eclipse 
Award winners.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Search Forces TV Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing  
plane forced the networks to alter their sports programming, with 
ABC switching its British Open golf coverage Saturday to fellow 
Disney-owned ESPN and the Major League Soccer All-Star game to 
ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS wasn't as fortunate. It had to scrap its broadcast of the  
Ameritech Seniors Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC was scheduled to show the third round of the British Open  
starting at 10 a.m. EDT, but instead stayed with the breaking story 
involving the search for Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN picked up coverage about 11:30 a.m. EDT and stayed with the  
British Open, instead of regularly scheduled fishing and rodeo 
programming, until the leaders finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a breaking news story of national importance that took  
priority over any program we had scheduled on ABC,'' said an ABC 
spokesman. ``Fortunately, we had ESPN so we were able to switch the 
viewers who wanted to watch the Open championship while staying 
with the unfolding news story on ABC news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MLS All-Star game in San Diego was supposed to start on ABC  
at 3:30 p.m., but was switched to ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' broadcast of the Ameritech Seniors Open was scheduled to  
air from 4-6 p.m. EDT. CBS offered local affiliates a 15-minute 
highlight package, according to tournament director Brian 
Fitzgerald. The network's international coverage continued 
uninterrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This pretty much is a decision made in New York,'' Fitzgerald  
said. ``It's an unfortunate situation. We don't have much power 
over what's going on. All three networks made the decision to go 
with coverage of the search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald acknowledged that not having TV coverage could hurt  
tournament attendance for Sunday. The Saturday broadcast creates 
awareness and excitement, especially if it's a close tournament and 
there's a big name on the leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the tournament has been pre-empted,  
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never for the entire day,'' he said. ``We've been pre-empted  
before because other sports coverage has run late. But nothing to 
this extent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox pre-empted its pregame baseball show, ``In the Zone'', but  
went ahead with its baseball game of the week that included 
occasional news updates. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was supposed to show the LPGA Big Apple Classic golf  
tournament at 2 p.m. and a WNBA game between Los Angeles and 
Phoenix at 4 p.m., but it switched them to its CNBC cable channel.

<HEADLINE> Wedding Postponed, Kennedys Pray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HYANNISPORT, Mass. (AP) -- The family arrived expecting a  
wedding. Instead, they attended a Mass, solemnly praying that three 
relatives hadn't been struck down by tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedding of Rory Kennedy, daughter of late Sen. Robert F.  
Kennedy, was postponed indefinitely Saturday as word spread that 
John Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law were reported 
missing aboard a plane en route to the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,''  
said Christina Rivers of Hyannnis, who was to style the hair of the 
bridal party. ``It's just not fair. I don't know what it is, but 
it's not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bride-to-be's life has been marked by a string of tragedies.  
Her father, the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated 
before she was born; she was the one who cradled her dying brother, 
Michael, after a skiing accident in 1997; and she has lived with 
the long history of other Kennedy family troubles and pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 275 guests were expected for the private 6 p.m. wedding  
ceremony for Rory, a producer and documentary director, and Mark 
Bailey, a writer and editor of books and film. The bridal party was 
to include 30 family members and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of them, including Rory's mother, Ethel Kennedy, and uncle,  
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, were sequestered in the compound Saturday 
as they awaited word of the plane's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Kennedy, the sister of JFK Jr., was not at the  
compound, and a family spokesman said he was not sure where she was 
or if she had been informed her brother was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Kennedys' homes, a white tent stood by the sea, the  
grounds were manicured and a flag billowed in the breeze at full 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a wedding and reception, a Mass was said on the porch  
of Ethel Kennedy's house with about 50 family members and three 
priests ``for the safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory and 
Mark,'' said Brian O'Connor, a family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the priests was the Rev. Michael Kennedy, a distant  
relative from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad for anyone, but that family especially,'' said  
Phyllis Kahn, who has a summer house in town. ``I feel bad for the 
bride. Her father was assassinated before she was born. Now on her 
wedding day look what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, as has happened so often before, Cape Cod residents  
began coming to the Kennedy summer home. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Wood, a neighbor in Hyannisport, pushed her daughter  
Alexandra in a stroller past the family compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be the most incredibly painful thing,'' she said.  
``This family has been through so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The compound that had once been the vision of Camelot -- with  
young JFK and his siblings tossing footballs and sailing -- has 
repeatedly turned into a place of grieving. This is where the 
Kennedys go to escape the media's glare in times of sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The family gathered here two years ago over the death of Michael  
Kennedy, Rory's later brother who crashed into a tree on an Aspen, 
Colo., mountain on New Year's Eve 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place used to be of ceremony, now it always turns to  
remorse ... tragedy. It used to be a happy place, now it's no 
longer happy,'' said Mark Tiapgo, a local resident who went to the 
compound after hearing the news.

<HEADLINE> Americans Somber Over Kennedy News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On a steamy summer weekend, as word spread that John F. Kennedy  
Jr.'s plane was missing, Americans wondered if another 
throat-tightening Kennedy tragedy was in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever people knew him or admired his renowned family, a  
somber mood fell Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At New York's Yankee Stadium, before an afternoon game against  
the Atlanta Braves, Yankees announcer Bob Sheppard invoked a moment 
of silent prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kennedy family has done so much for our country,''  
Sheppard said. JFK Jr. watched another Yankees-Braves game from a 
front-row Yankee Stadium box Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. had become a New Yorker, but he was homeward bound to  
the Kennedy homestead Friday evening with his wife, Carolyn 
Bessette Kennedy; and her sister, Lauren. They were missing aboard 
a plane that left New Jersey headed for a family wedding Saturday 
in Hyannisport, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday afternoon, the front step of the couple's New York  
apartment was covered with bouquets of red roses, white daisies and 
sunflowers and a white candle. The building, nine floors of stone 
and brick, is in the fashionable but quiet Tribeca neighborhood, 
where artists and art galleries transformed a former industrial 
section of lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	A solitary police officer kept the curious away.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, anxious Americans kept somber vigils around  
television sets. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas at the Sixth Floor Museum, a museum about the  
assassination of President Kennedy, visitors gathered around TV 
monitors to see searchers combed the waters off Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin McCarthy, a 48-year-old visitor from St. Louis, said it  
all brought back memories of the awful day, Nov. 22, 1963, when JFK 
died. ``I couldn't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Martha Fabrega of Panama City, Fla., ``It's unbelievable  
that history is repeating itself. In my heart is a big sorrow,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen-year-old Zach Wells said he was shocked, hearing the  
news getting ready for work at the Crown Center shopping Mall in 
Kansas City, Mo. The teen-ager said he admired JFK Jr., for all 
he'd been through and achieved. ``He's made a name for himself. It 
would be a shame to lose another Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy friends were shaken.  
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Brinkley, a University of New Orleans history professor  
and a contributing editor at George, the magazine founded and 
edited by JFK Jr., spent Saturday trading consolations with 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pragmatically, it looks bleak,'' Brinkley said. But he tried  
to retain hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``John had a great sense of humor and sense of self-deprecation  
and a trickster side of him,'' Brinkley said. ``I keep hoping his 
being missing is greatly exaggerated and he'll appear in Nova 
Scotia or Maine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley called Kennedy a ``terrific editor'' and a liberal  
Democrat whose heroes included the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., 
Czech president Vaclav Havel and farm labor leader Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was circling around how he could best enter the public  
arena as a reformer,'' Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Billy Graham called JFK Jr. a ``personal friend'' and  
encouraged people everywhere to pray. ``It is my prayer that, if it 
is God's will, they will be found alive and well,'' Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a close friend of Sen. Ted Kennedy,  
D-Mass., said Saturday he was ``praying there is some simple 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``JFK Jr. was doing everything right. He got his law degree,  
worked as a prosecutor, started George,'' Hatch said. ``I expected 
sometime in the future he would definitely have gotten into 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that was far from Kristen Helm's thoughts. The 33-year-old  
sales representative was basking in the sun outside a Denver 
coffeehouse when friends told her Kennedy had vanished. Helm said 
she had been fascinated with the Kennedys most of her life. And 
touched by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried when Jackie O. (Onassis) died and I had no association  
with her,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly,'' she added, ``I'm not surprised. I really  
believe that the Kennedys have a legacy of bad omens.''

<HEADLINE> Highway Renamed for Babyface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- When Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds goes back  
home to Indiana, he should have no trouble remembering one of its 
highways -- it's just been renamed after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon dedicated a 17-mile stretch of  
Interstate 65 through Indianapolis in honor of the 10-time Grammy 
award winner, who was born and reared here. The governor presented 
Edmonds with a commemorative sign marking the Kenneth ``Babyface'' 
Edmonds Highway on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny Edmonds has made great strides in the entertainment  
industry and has brought great distinction to the state of Indiana 
through his music and by never forgetting to give back to the 
community,'' O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds is a singer, songwriter, and also a producer who has  
devised hits for artists ranging from Madonna to Toni Braxton. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, 41, also produced the 1997 movie ``Soul Food.'' Vivica  
Fox, one of the movie's stars and a fellow Hoosier, served as 
master of ceremonies for Friday's ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers To Receive $100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Struggling hog farmers next month will begin  
to receive $100 million in aid from the government to help offset 
low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments, capped at $5,000 per hog operation, are in  
addition to $50 million in assistance given to hog farmers earlier 
this year as they suffered through their lowest prices in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current farm crisis has been disastrous for small hog  
producers, so this additional assistance is really needed,'' Vice 
President Al Gore said in a statement Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has  
been actively courting the farm vote for several months and making 
various agriculture related announcements for the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sign-up for the new round of assistance is set to begin Aug. 9  
and is aimed at small- and medium-sized hog operations that sold 
less than 2,500 hogs. Hog farmers who received the earlier payments 
will automatically get the new payment and are not required to 
reapply or fill out additional paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligible producers will receive $10 per slaughter-weight hog  
marketed during the last six months of 1998 on up to 500 market 
hogs. Hog farmers who received payments under the earlier 
disbursement would receive a pro-rated amount to bring their total 
payment amount to $10 per slaughter-weight.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Blasts Bush, Clinton on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary  
Bauer on Saturday accused the Clinton administration and GOP 
front-runner George W. Bush of being soft on China and putting 
trade above national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer condemned ``the desire for a quick buck in China'' and  
said trade interests have led the United States to downplay 
concerns about the communist nation's arms buildup, human rights 
abuses and threats to Taiwan, which the mainland government 
considers a rogue province. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (China) is the major foreign policy threat to the  
United States. I think because of what they're doing, we're going 
to have to deploy a missile defense system'' as soon as possible, 
Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore ``ought to  
apologize to the United States for a failed China policy,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, operating a debt-ridden campaign on a shoestring budget  
amid a packed field of wealthy candidates, has been trying to 
portray himself as a conservative faithful to the Ronald Reagan 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, he contended, has backpedaled so far on conservative views  
that he sounds like Gore, the Democratic front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're so close that you could get away with calling  
them one candidate, Bush-Gore,'' Bauer said. ``On major issues, 
they're identical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On China, Bush and the Clinton administration agree that  
Congress should extend normal trade relations in an upcoming vote, 
and they both favor the communist nation's entry into the World 
Trade Organization, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has gone even further and supports the further easing of  
export restrictions, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a janitor's son and I believe in free enterprise, but I  
don't believe in putting your country second and putting your 
profits first,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the Texas governor  
has actually called for stricter controls on military-related 
exports to China.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Records Open to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After months of controversy, some 5,700 boxes of  
records from the 1996 Summer Olympics will be made available to the 
public beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents, which range from sponsorship contracts to  
documents related to the design and development of venue sites, 
created conflict between Olympic organizers and congressional 
investigators looking into possible corruption in the bid for the 
1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need this kind of information for a whole lot of  
purposes,'' said Penn State University professor John Lucas, a 
historian who has written four books on the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalists and historians are far apart in a number of  
things, but they are both investigators seeking the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Payne, former chief of the now-defunct Atlanta Committee  
for the Olympic Games, decided to released the bulk of the records 
in an effort to quell the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	ACOG will hold on to eight boxes that officials maintain include  
private information -- such as lists of donors wishing to remain 
anonymous, letters subject to attorney-client privilege and 
personnel files. 
</P>
<P>
	However, congressional investigators, who opened their  
investigation following bribery allegations involving the 2002 
Games in Salt Lake City, will have access to all records, including 
the eight sensitive boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to open those eight boxes to the public is in the  
works. A ruling on a lawsuit filed over whether the Georgia Open 
Records Act applies to the records kept by the Georgia Amateur 
Athletics Foundation, which coordinated Atlanta's bid for the 1996 
Olympics, is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	ACOG, meanwhile, has compiled an inventory of the contents of  
all the boxes, which are being housed at the Atlanta History Center 
and in private storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Monday, the three-year anniversary of the Atlanta  
opening ceremonies, the records will be available for public 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents may include unseen material such as sponsorship  
contracts and television rights negotiations.

	Kennedy Visual Aerial Search Suspended  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- The daylong search Saturday for the  
missing plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and 
sister-in-law yielded only some fragments of Kennedy's 
red-and-white plane, a piece of baggage labeled with the business 
card of Lauren Bessette, sister of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and a 
prescription bottle belonging to Bessette Kennedy. State police 
said late Saturday that the visual aerial search had been suspended 
until Sunday at daybreak, but an Air National Guard helicopter with 
infrared sensors would continue searching overnight in the dark.

	Kennedys Top News Around World  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British newspapers featured stories Sunday on the  
search for the missing Kennedy plane, while broadcasters throughout 
Europe led newscasts with the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife and her sister. Some British newspapers referred to the 
Kennedy family's history of tragedy, a theme echoed across Europe. 
Kennedy's disappearance topped French TV news Saturday with reports 
on the search, profiles of Kennedy's life and special reports 
devoted to the Kennedys. Kennedy was traveling with his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, to a 
family wedding when their plane disappeared.

	War Prosecutor Urges Rehabilitation  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Local courts in the former  
Yugoslavia must be rehabilitated so that they eventually can help 
handle some of the growing caseload, the chief prosecutor for the 
international war crimes tribunal said today. Louise Arbour is on 
her last tour of the region before leaving her post in The Hague, 
Netherlands. ``I think that it's critical that we participate and 
assist in full rehabilitation of domestic courts so that they can 
undertake a significant share of prosecuting war criminals,'' she

annexation of East Timor on Saturday, just weeks before a 
U.N.-organized vote on the territory's future. The provincial 
governor appealed for calm ahead of the August ballot, which will 
determine whether mainly Roman Catholic East Timor will become an 
autonomous region within Muslim-dominated Indonesia or break away 
altogether.

	India Declares End of Kashmir Fight  
</P>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- India's defense minister declared the end  
of fighting in Kashmir Saturday following the withdrawal of Muslim 
guerrillas from Himalayan battle zones under an agreement with 
Pakistan. Indian troops reclaimed key mountains and advanced to the 
1972 cease-fire line with Pakistan in all but one of four battle 
zones. The soldiers planned to reoccupy the fourth zone soon. India

	LA TUNIA, Colombia (AP) -- A top rebel leader says Colombia's  
military is exaggerating the threat posed by leftist guerrillas and 
inflating their battlefield prowess to gain U.S. counterinsurgency 
aid. The charges came as Colombia's defense minister visited 
Washington to lobby for increased assistance a week after a bloody 
guerrilla offensive in which the military claimed it had rescued

<HEADLINE> Judge Fines Anti-Abortion Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge ordered national anti-abortion  
leaders to pay more than $257,000 in damages and to stop 
interfering with the operation of abortion clinics across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Coar on Friday barred the leaders from  
blocking clinic doors and driveways, damaging clinic property and 
threatening violence against doctors and patients anywhere in the 
nation for the next 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 36-page opinion, Coar said that the right of abortion  
opponents to express their views is protected by the Constitution, 
but ``a number of their means -- destroying property and threatening 
violence -- are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those named as defendants were Joseph Scheidler, head of the  
Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, the league itself, Operation 
Rescue and two other activists, Andrew Scholberg and Timothy 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Coar's order stems from a landmark trial that ended in April  
1998 in which the National Organization for Women and two abortion 
clinics sued the defendants. The verdict came in the first 
nationwide class-action lawsuit filed against the anti-abortion 
movement under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
Act, a 1970 law originally aimed at breaking up the mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Coar ordered the defendants to pay damages totaling $257,780 to  
the two clinics, the Delaware Women's Health Organization Inc. of 
Wilmington and Summit Women's Health Organization Inc. of 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount represented a tripling of the damages that were  
awarded to the clinics by the jury -- a procedure required under the 
federal RICO act. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found that the defendants banded together in a nationwide  
extortion campaign based on violence and threats designed to force 
clinics to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Coar's order amounted to a decision on money damages and how to  
prevent a recurrence. It can be enforced nationwide by any law 
enforcement official or judge, and violation could result in a jail 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	``This injunction is marvelous,'' said Fay Clayton, attorney for  
the National Organization for Women. ``It's nationwide, it's 
powerful, it's long-lasting and it's clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheidler brushed aside the injunction, saying, ``There's  
nothing on there that we're prohibited from doing that we've been 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for clinic blockades, he said, ``I haven't done that for  
years ... I do encourage people to be activists. I don't encourage 
them to break the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the two clinics get damages under Coar's decision, he  
turned down a NOW request for a series of trials at which other 
clinics and individuals would be able to try to get damages as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton said after the damages and the plaintiffs' attorney's  
fees are paid, anti-abortion leaders may be broke anyway.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Actos for Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diabetics have won another treatment that  
promises to fight their disease with less risk than a popular but 
sometimes dangerous drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Actos, known chemically as pioglitazone, won Food and Drug  
Administration approval Friday to treat Type 2 diabetes by 
resensitizing patients' bodies to insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	It becomes diabetics' second alternative to the competing  
diabetes drug Rezulin, which generated huge excitement when it hit 
the market in 1997 because it worked differently than any previous 
diabetes treatment. But Rezulin also can cause fatal liver damage, 
prompting recent government restrictions to limit the number of 
diabetics who try it. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the FDA approved the first drug that worked like Rezulin  
but with allegedly lower liver risks, SmithKline Beecham's Avandia. 
</P>
<P>
	Actos, made by Takeda Pharmaceuticals and marketed by Eli Lilly  
&AMP; Co., is the newest alternative. It will be available, by 
prescription, next month. No price was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies of over 4,500 patients, there were no signs that  
Actos damaged patients' livers, the FDA said. However, because 
Actos is related to the problematic Rezulin, the FDA insisted that 
as a precaution Actos patients have their livers tested before 
starting therapy and then every two months for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same liver testing the FDA insists Avandia patients  
get, too, because that drug also is related to Rezulin.

<P>
	FAR HILLS, N.J. (AP) -- Ronald N. Yurcak, a junk bond trader who  
worked closely with Michael Milken, died Tuesday of a heart attack. 
He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Perot, the founder of Electronic Data Systems Corp., hired  
Yurcak in 1971 as a systems engineer. Yurcak also worked as Perot's 
personal assistant and in the brokerage subsidiary of EDS, a 
computer services company in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Yurcak later moved to Kidder Peabody &AMP; Co. and to Merrill Lynch.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, he moved to Salomon Brothers, where he started and  
managed the high-yield bond trading and sales department. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Yurcak moved to Drexel Burnham Lambert in Beverly  
Hills, Calif., where Milken had moved the firm's junk bond 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Yurcak was one of eight traders there, buying and selling  
billions in junk bonds, which are debt securities issued by 
corporations with poor credit ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	After the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, he went to work  
for a succession of financial companies in the United States and 
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Education in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- President Clinton, on a one-day visit to  
the state that launches the presidential primary season, offered 
hope of quick federal relief to farmers suffering tough economic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we've got a terrible problem in farm country all over  
America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While three GOP presidential hopefuls crisscrossed the state for  
votes, Clinton reminded his listeners that he wasn't a candidate in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But he sounded like one, challenging Republicans in Congress to  
take advantage of the healthy economy to invest in education and 
Social Security before promising tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them think politics is about power and position, but  
we think it's about ideas and people,'' Clinton said Friday at a 
fund-raiser for Sen. Tom Harkin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Save Social Security and Medicare first, pay down the debt and  
take care of education,'' he said. ``Then give the country a tax 
cut. That's what we believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP favorite Gov. George W. Bush criticized Clinton's  
agriculture policies on Thursday, saying his administration has 
done little to ease the pressures on the nation's farmers. Without 
referring to Bush directly, Clinton tried to lay blame for the 
farmers' problems on policies generated by the 
Republican-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He said those who supported the Freedom to Farm Act, which  
weaned farmers away from price supports in exchange for more 
freedom to choose what they planted, ``acted like there never would 
be a bad day on the farm.'' Clinton signed the legislation into law 
but said that he would soon seek changes in it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also met for an hour with seven Iowa farmers to discuss  
the economic difficulties they're facing at a time of historically 
low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a listening session,'' said White House spokesman Barry  
Toiv. ``They took the opportunity to impress upon the president how 
serious the problems are facing Iowa farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowans pleaded with Clinton for emergency assistance.  
</P>
<P>
	The president didn't commit himself, but Toiv said ``he was very  
sympathetic'' and promised to have his staff and Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman examine the request immediately.

	Plane Debris Found on Mass. Beach  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- An intensive search is under way today  
along the Atlantic seaboard for a small plane carrying John F. 
Kennedy Jr. to a family wedding in Massachusetts, the Coast Guard 
said. The only son of the nation's 35th president was traveling 
with his wife and his sister-in-law. Hours after the search began, 
Coast Guard Lt. Craig Jaramillo confirmed the discovery on Philbin 
Beach on Martha's Vineyard, of ``some luggage,'' a wheel, headrest 
and part of a plane support known as a strut. He would not confirm 
reports that the luggage contained items with the name of Lauren 
Bessette, Kennedy's sister-in-law, who was reportedly aboard the 
aircraft. 

</P>
<P>
	Search for Kennedy Plane Narrows  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Coast Guard and Air Force narrowed their  
search for a missing plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr. and two 
others to an area off the coast of their intended destination, 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., after debris was spotted today. ``We are 
centering our search about 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard,'' 
said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee. Officials said at 
least 20 aircraft and two boats are participating in the search.

	Clinton Decries GOP Tax Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax cuts of the size proposed by Republicans  
in Congress would ``blow a $3 trillion hole'' in the federal budget 
just as baby boomers retirement strains Medicare and Social 
Security, President Clinton said today. In his weekly radio 
address, Clinton cited a new Treasury Department analysis showing 
the House GOP plan to cut taxes by $864 billion over 10 years would 
cost more than three times that in the decade after 2009. In the 
Republican response, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said deep tax 
cuts he helped enact in his state beginning in 1986 have now 
translated into $5,600 less in taxes for the average Wisconsin 
family.

	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Bernard Kouchner, the new  
U.N. administrator of Kosovo, arrived today in this divided city 
where ethnic Albanians and Serbs form two hostile camps on opposite 
sides of the Ibar river. Prior to Kouchner's arrival, ethnic 
Albanians called off an anti-Serb protest in an apparent attempt to 
avoid possible violence in this northern city. Also today, about 
200 reservists took to the streets of Serbia's largest southern 
city, Nis, demanding long overdue payment for their services and 
ignoring a plea for patience from a top Yugoslav army general.

	Kashmir Withdrawal Completed  
</P>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- Islamic fighters completed their withdrawal  
to beyond the India-Pakistan cease-fire line today, a senior Indian 
army commander said, effectively ending a two-month battle in the 
icy heights of Kashmir. Brig. Ramesh Kakar said Indian soldiers 
reaching the cease-fire line in the Mushkoh Valley could see small 
remaining groups of fighters trekking over mountain passes into 
Pakistan. The Mushkoh Valley was the last battle zone where some 
rival forces had lingered. Some 1,100 fighters on both sides were 
killed in the conflict, and hundreds more wounded.

	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Winn-Dixie has agreed to pay $33  
million to settle racial and sexual discrimination claims brought 
by employees of the supermarket chain. The settlement was announced 
by the company yesterday, the same day the class-action lawsuit was 
filed in federal court by 13 current and former employees. The 
settlement, which covers all Winn-Dixie stores, could apply to more 
than 50,000 black or female employees who have worked for the chain 
since 1993. The settlement must be approved by U.S. District Court.

lowest round to move into a tie for second at 5-over with Justin 
Leonard. Tiger Woods and Greg Norman, meanwhile, both struggled. 
Woods shot a 74 and was six back at 7-over while Norman bogeyed the 
last hole for a 75 and was 8-over.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wide receiver Terrell Owens has reached a  
7-year contract agreement with the San Francisco 49ers worth at 
least $23 million, the San Francisco Chronicle reported today. The 
contract includes a signing bonus of $7.5 million and an escalator 
clause that could push the total value of the deal to as much as 
$35 million, the newspaper said. Last season, Owens had 67 
receptions for 1,097 yards and 14 touchdowns, including a 79-yard 
scoring catch.

<TEXT>
<P>
	The search for John Kennedy Jr.'s small plane ranged over some  
1,000 square miles at its height. A look at the aircraft and 
vessels involved: 
</P>
<P>
	--Two Coast Guard HH-60 Jayhawk helicopters searching from  
Martha's Vineyard to tip of Long Island. The twin-engine 
medium-range aircraft can fly 300 miles offshore, then hover for 45 
minutes, pick up six people and return with a safe fuel reserve. 
</P>

	--Two HC-130 turboprop Hercules cargo planes, one serving as  
airborne command circling the search area and the other searching 
waters off south shore of Long Island. They are from the New York 
Air National Guard and include the same crew that searched the 
crash site of TWA Flight 800 three years ago Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	--15 single-engine light aircraft from Civil Air Patrol units in  
New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Jersey,

<HEADLINE> Debris From Kennedy Plane Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Hope dimmed late Saturday for John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law, as darkness descended on 
the waters off Martha's Vineyard where their plane went down. 
Debris washed ashore, but there was no sign of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you miraculous stories of people surviving,'' said  
Rear Admiral Richard M. Larrabee, first Coast Guard district 
commander, at a late afternoon news conference. ``I can tell you in 
previous cases like this, we've searched as many as three or four 
days. We're not ready to give up on this yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the daylong search of planes, helicopters and boats yielded  
little but some fragments of Kennedy's red-and-white plane -- and a 
piece of baggage, labeled with the business card of Lauren 
Bessette, sister of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The television networks suspended their scheduled programming to  
focus on the search, and the nation was glued to its sets, echoing 
the grim fascination at his father's assassination, nearly 36 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears mounted that the Kennedys had suffered another ghastly  
tragedy. The couple had been en route to Cape Cod and a Kennedy 
cousin's wedding at Hyannisport -- now postponed and replaced with 
prayers for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy -- universally known as ``John John''  
since he was a toddler in the White House, and once labeled the 
``sexiest man alive'' by People magazine -- had obtained his pilot's 
license just last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah -- the portion of the Vineyard  
popularly known as Gay Head -- luggage, a wheel, a headrest and part 
of a plane support known as a strut had washed up, said Coast Guard 
Lt. Craig Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, said she saw the black bag in the  
water. A friend, Damon Seligson, waded in to retrieve it. ``It was 
kind of like, 'Oh God.' It seemed like it would be pretty bad news. 
Everyone was shaking,'' said McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration sent a  
submersible named ``Rude'' (pronounced Rudy) to aid in the search, 
and it began its work on Saturday evening, using sonar to look for 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA reported the last contact with the plane during its  
final approach to the airport on the island off Cape Cod at 9:39 
p.m., the Coast Guard said. ``The aircraft was due to arrive at 
Martha's Vineyard around 10 p.m. and was later expected to fly to 
Hyannisport,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	No flight plan had been filed, and none was required.  
</P>
<P>
	Family members were assembled in Hyannisport , Mass., for the  
wedding of the late Robert F. Kennedy's daughter Rory. A family 
friend reported the plane missing to the Coast Guard about 2:15 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard immediately began searching for the plane and  
contacted FAA officials, who in turn alerted rescue personnel at 
Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, which is in charge of searching 
for overdue planes. At 3:30 a.m., the Air Force got a ``positive 
hit'' on an emergency signal emanating from northern Long Island, 
said Larrabee, the Coast Guard district commander. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers searched that area for three hours, but found nothing,  
he said. At 7:30 a.m., the Coast Guard launched an aggressive 
search of the area around Martha's Vineyard and Montauk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the morning, the search area was narrowed significantly  
when officials reviewed radar records and found the plane's last 
known location was about 17 miles southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a  
statement confirming that the plane left the Essex County Airport 
in Fairfield, N.J., about 8:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Martin, of Hyannisport, who described himself as a friend  
of the family, said the plane was stopping in Martha's Vineyard to 
drop off Lauren Bessette, before Kennedy and his wife continued on 
to Hyannisport. It wasn't clear whether the couple planned to start 
the next leg immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard identified the plane as a single-engine,  
six-seat Piper 32 Saratoga, acquired recently by Kennedy. The plane 
is known in the aviation industry as a high-performance airplane 
with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. Kennedy was not licensed to fly on instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the pilot wants to have is a relatively distinct horizon  
to see the ground and be able to determine the aircraft's altitude 
by looking outside,'' said Warren Morningstar, a pilot and 
spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At night your visual horizon is not going to be as distinct,  
and if it's hazy conditions, your vision is going to be obscured,'' 
Morningstar added. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th  
anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, in which Sen. Edward 
Kennedy's car went off a bridge, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne 
on a tiny island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also three years to the day after the crash on July 17,  
1996, of Paris-bound flight TWA800, off the south shore of Long 
Island, and 35 years after Ted Kennedy narrowly escaped death in a 
private plane crash in which he suffered a broken back. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Labor Day, Kennedy flew another plane -- its registration  
number, N529JK, paid tribute to his father's May 29 birthday -- up 
to Hyannisport for a family get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in May 1998, Kennedy told USA Today that he had  
gotten his license a few weeks before, but none of his relatives 
could be persuaded to fly with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who  
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said. ``The 
second it was legal she came up with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, ``whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane  
and fly off,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Kennedy was on a rafting trip in the West, according to  
CNN. She is the only other survivor of the young family that 
transfixed the world, four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance sent a shudder across the country. The  
Chicago Sun-Times printed an extra edition of its Sunday paper with 
the news; in New York, at Yankee Stadium, fans were asked to rise 
for a moment of silent prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. has lived entirely in the public eye, from his birth  
shortly after his father's election as the nation's 35th president, 
to his poignant salute on the day of his namesake's funeral, to his 
romances with Daryl Hannah and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he more  
recently attracted attention with his political magazine, George, 
in which he once posed nude. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his few private moments was his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding to  
Bessette Kennedy, a former publicist for fashion designer Calvin 
Klein. They were wed in an ultra-private ceremony on a small island 
off the coast of Georgia, free of hovering helicopters and 
paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy, 33, a doctor's daughter from Greenwich, Conn.,  
studied at Boston University before taking the public relations job 
in New York, where she met Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, who is 18 months older than Carolyn, has a twin  
sister, Lisa Ann. A 1982 graduate of Greenwich High School, Lauren 
worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New 
York City.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Uruguay in Soccer Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Uruguay has earned a reputation as a  
giant-killer on the way to the finals of the Copa America. Now they 
play for the title against the biggest giant of them all: Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In emotion if not technique, Sunday's battle for the South  
American championship is about as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side, perennial favorite Brazil is the odds-on pick to  
repeat as Copa America champs. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time World Cup champions, led by Ronaldo and Rivaldo,  
are undefeated and have 14 goals in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dida, the goalie, has allowed just two goals, fewest in the  
tournament, and has saved a pair of penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay is devoid of international stars and barely sneaked into  
the second round by beating Ecuador after losses to Argentina and 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the youngsters, built around the core of the junior team  
that finished second in the 1997 Under 20 world championship in 
Malaysia, beat host Parguay in the quarterfinals in a shootout, 
then beat Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	For coach Victor Pua, the final is a classic matchup of Brazil's  
``talent and experience'' against his team's ``youth, dreams and 
desire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay has won the Copa America 14 times, including the first  
one in 1916, and is tied with Argentina for the most titles. Brazil 
has won it five times, only once away from home.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Shows Concern for Kennedys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton reached out to members of  
the Kennedy family Saturday to express concern over the 
disappearance of a plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., son of the 
nation's 35th president. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to let them know he was thinking about them, that  
we'll do everything we can and that our thoughts and prayers are 
with them,'' said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who is spending the weekend at Camp David in western  
Maryland, was informed of the plane's disappearance shortly after 7 
a.m. by John Podesta, his chief of staff, Lockhart said. Also on 
board the aircraft was Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 
and her sister, Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that after being told of the plane's  
disappearance, Clinton spoke by telephone with Caroline Kennedy 
Schlossberg, John Kennedy's sister; with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, 
his uncle; and with Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who is married 
to Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is being kept fully informed of the ongoing search efforts,  
which are being coordinated by the Department of Transportation, 
the Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
Department of Defense.'' Lockhart said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Members of Congress Join Iran Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A member of Congress shouted ``death to the  
dictators'' before thousands of cheering Iranian-Americans trying 
to convince Washington that both the political and clerical leaders 
in Iran must be brought down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., told the crowd in a rally at the  
base of Capitol Hill that Iran's rulers all face inevitable 
overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for the State Department to review its policy on  
the Iranian regime as well as the resistance,'' Ackerman said 
Friday. ``Death to the dictators, down with the mullahs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of Congress joined the rally which called on the  
Clinton administration to back the resistance group Mujahedeen 
Khalq, which the State Department labels a terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that tangoing with Tehran's tyrants will lead  
nowhere,'' said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., saying she was 
speaking for the majority of the House who have signed petitions or 
voted in support of the Mujahedeen Khalq. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, concerned about any appearance of U.S.  
interference in Iran during current unrest, has avoided any 
political comments on student street demonstrations that pit 
hard-line clerics against what U.S. officials view as moderate 
President Mohammad Khatami. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Iran's rulers and the Clinton administration consider the  
Mujahedeen terrorists. The rally was organized by the Paris-based 
National Council for Resistance of Iran, overseer of both the 
Mujahedeen, which operates in Iran, and the National Liberation 
Army, which has 30,000 soldiers in camps on the Iranian border in 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Washington rally, Alireza Jafarzadeh, said  
it was aimed at countering reports that the student protesters were 
merely backing Khatami's reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Khatami's position against the students and people revealed  
his true face and proved there is no difference between him and the 
rest of the regime,'' Jafarzadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Mujahedeen stands for a secular, democratic  
government that would allow political and social freedoms, respect 
human rights and support peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says the Mujahedeen has been involved in  
terrorism incidents in which Americans were killed and has a 
history of anti-Western activity. Placing an organization on the 
U.S. terrorism list makes it illegal for U.S. citizens to knowingly 
contribute financial support and subjects its bank accounts to 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Resistance leaders said 12,000 Iranian Americans from around the  
country were at the rally. Police had no official estimate.

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr.'s Plane Known As Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Piper Saratoga II HP that disappeared with  
John F. Kennedy Jr. and two others aboard is known in the aviation 
industry as a high-performance airplane with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the pilot wants to have is a relatively distinct horizon  
to see the ground and be able to determine the aircraft's altitude 
by looking outside,'' said Warren Morningstar, a pilot and 
spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At night your visual horizon is not going to be as distinct,  
and if it's hazy conditions, your vision is going to be obscured,'' 
Morningstar added. 
</P>
<P>
	Visual flight rules must be used by a pilot without an  
instrument rating, which Kennedy apparently did not have. Under 
so-called VFR rules, a pilot must be able to see at least three 
miles into the distance and stay well below clouds. Pilots say 
anything less than six miles visibility is marginal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's red-and-white Saratoga disappeared Friday as he was  
flying with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister 
Lauren, from Fairfield, N.J., just outside New York City, to 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was then supposed to travel on to Hyannisport, Mass.,  
where Rory Kennedy, the youngest child of the late Sen. Robert. F. 
Kennedy, was to be married Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard is about 200  
miles, or only about one-quarter of the aircraft's range. Coast 
Guard officials confirmed Saturday that debris -- apparently from 
the aircraft -- had been found near Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Powered by a single turbocharged Lycoming engine, the Saratoga  
could carry up to six and had a top speed of around 175 knots, or 
about 201 mph. With a full load of fuel, it could fly about 859 
nautical miles, or just short of 990 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, built in 1995, also was delivered with a full  
complement of modern instruments, as well as an automatic Emergency 
Locator Transmitter, or ELT, said Chuck Suma, president of The New 
Piper Aircraft Inc. of Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Such devices can be triggered manually or automatically upon a  
crash. They emit signals that can be detected by satellites and 
homed in on by search aircraft, but not after the plane has become 
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was not delivered with flotation devices or flight  
data recorders, Suma said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's considered a high-performance airplane, but among the  
ranks of high-perfomance aircraft, it's one of the easiest to 
fly,'' said Morningstar, whose group is the world's largest civil 
aviation group. ``It's a very safe, very solid, very good 
airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suma said there are about 7,500 Saratogas now in service  
worldwide, accumulating over a half-million flight hours each year. 
The last time one was involved in a fatal crash was December, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA records show that a John F. Kennedy from Manhattan had a  
student pilot's license as far back as 1987. Another student 
license was issued issued to John Fitzgerald Kennedy of Manhattan 
on Dec. 12, 1997. An FAA source, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, said Kennedy received a single-engine pilot's license on 
April 22, 1998. There are no records of him receiving an instrument 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saratoga was one of two airplanes that have been registered  
in Kennedy's name by a corporation, Random Ventures Inc. According 
to Federal Aviation Administration records, it carried the tail 
number N9253N. Another other plane owned by Random Ventures, a 
Cessna 182, had a similar number N529JK. 
</P>
<P>
	That registration paid homage to Kennedy's father, the late  
President John F. Kennedy, playing off his initials and his 
birthdate, May 29, 1917. FAA records indicate the aircraft had been 
sold by Kennedy and was registered by a Fairfield, N.J., aviation 
company in May. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA records indicate that Piper first sold the Saratoga in 1996  
to Poinciana LLC of Wilmington, N.C. It was then sold to Hussain 
Munir of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. Kennedy subsequently bought the 
plane and registered it with the FAA on April 30.

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Marked by Success, Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They are the country's most enduring celebrities -- the closest  
thing, it's often said, to American royalty. But if the Kennedys of 
Massachusetts have helped define modern ambition and 20th-century 
success, they've also withstood two generations of televised tears 
and premature goodbyes. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr.'s disappearance in a small plane off the  
Atlantic Coast is but the latest in a litany of high-profile 
misfortunes that have torn apart a family, and often a nation as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if there's some ineffable force that demands  
that they suffer -- and suffer nationally,'' said Neal Gabler, a 
sometime contributor to Kennedy's ``George'' magazine and author of 
``Life: The Movie,'' which explores the American celebrity and 
entertainment culture. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, of course, the excruciating assassination of  
President John F. Kennedy. The hail of bullets, five years later, 
that killed the brother who aspired to the same office. The 
Chappaquiddick accident in 1969 that killed a young woman and 
virtually ensured that Ted Kennedy would never be president. 
</P>
<P>
	The list goes on. A Kennedy killed in a World War II plane  
crash. A Kennedy institutionalized because of retardation and a 
failed lobotomy. A Kennedy accused -- and acquitted -- of rape. A 
Kennedy killed while playing football on the ski slopes. Paralysis. 
Cancer. A fatal drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, members of the Kennedy clan huddled yet again in  
their Hyannisport compound, the site of the famed touch-football 
images of the early 1960s. They had come together for a wedding, 
but were united in uncertainty as boats and planes scoured the 
waters for three of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	It has, for America, become a familiar sight -- their princes and  
princesses, hunkered down on a windswept patch of coast, trying to 
make sense of another loss. People watch, and wonder; for many, 
it's an epic soap opera set in a world they could never access. 
</P>
<P>
	``They occupy a very special place in the celebrity hierarchy,''  
said Irving J. Rein, a Northwestern University professor who 
studies how American celebrity is marketed and perceived. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kennedy name is almost like a brand; it evokes a series of  
feelings in us -- about families, about relationships, about luck 
and fate and tragedy,'' he said. ``Everybody's drawn to tragedy 
when people have everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But is this level of heartache truly that unusual or just  
different? 
</P>
<P>
	``This family has been under a microscope for so long that  
anything that happens adds to the catalogue of misfortune, and we 
remember it. But how many beloved relatives go through similar 
sorts of things without so much public attention?'' wonders James 
F. Smith, a Penn State University professor who studies postwar 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take out Robert and John, you have young people killed  
in skiing accidents, people having trouble with drugs, people with 
cancer,'' he said. ``Those are pretty normal things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly the Kennedys have had their share of pain, but they're  
also risk-takers. You can't have a public assassination without 
public service; a paragliding accident, like the one that injured 
JFK Jr. in May, is the result of an adventurous lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedys have thrust themselves into the vortex, and thus  
their suffering has been very high-profile -- making them fit into a 
narrative the public and media are ready to embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way that something can happen to any of them  
without it falling into a ready-made narrative -- `the curse,' or 
`that reckless group' or `this is payback for the sins of the 
great-grandfathers,''' said Susan Bordo, author of ``Twilight 
Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a story that's been written so many times,'' she said.  
``A family of men with a tremendous amount of capabilities and 
wealth and ambition who seem hell-bent on putting themselves at 
risk. I'm not saying it's true, but it's the narratives everyone's 
going to think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, public adulation of a family like the Kennedys can  
serve as a there-but-for-the-grace-of-God role for Americans. Sure, 
we see the glitter of Camelot and the romance of the Hyannisport 
touch football games. But when something like this happens, we like 
our normal, workaday pain just fine, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow their lives, which have seemed to us blessed, now  
become tragic,'' Smith said. ``In a kind of a backhand way, it says 
to us, `Maybe my life, as ordinary as it is, ain't so bad at 
all.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who looked at JFK Jr., and said, `If  
I could only trade places with that person,'' he said. ``Nobody's 
saying that today.''

<HEADLINE> United States 103, Argentina 72 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Argentina had the most impressive  
dunk and even held a brief lead. Everything else, however, went the 
way of the United States in a 103-72 victory Saturday night in the 
Olympic qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Garnett scored 21 points, Tim Hardaway made five  
3-pointers and scored 20, Tim Duncan had 14 and Vin Baker, Jason 
Kidd and Allan Houston added 11 apiece for the Americans, who 
trailed for the first time in this tournament when Argentina took a 
5-4 led with 17:32 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, the United States used runs of 8-0, 16-0 and 10-3 to  
take a 30-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Andres Nocioni of Argentina had the dunk of the night, driving  
around Garnett on the baseline and then going under the basket to 
dunk a reverse slam over the outstretched arms of Garnett and 
Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went wild, giving the 19-year-old Nocioni an extended  
standing ovation. Even Garnett and Duncan appreciated the move, 
smiling broadly as they walked off the court during the ensuing 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	Nocioni tried to dunk over Garnett one more time just before the  
final buzzer, but Garnett rejected the shot and committed a foul. 
The two smiled and slapped hands before Nocioni, who plays 
professionally in Argentina, made one of two free throws for the 
final margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina also had the first four-point play of the tournament  
against the Americans on the play immediately after Nocioni's dunk. 
That cut the Americans' lead to 72-40 early in the second half. 
Garnett followed with a dunk, one of his four, and Hardaway had a 
3-pointer to increase the lead to 37. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States reached 100 points on a jumper by Houston with  
2:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's one-point lead early in the game represented the  
first time the United States had trailed in the tournament. In its 
first two games, the United States led for 79 minutes, 12 seconds 
and was tied for the other 48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's 31-point margin of defeat was the lowest by any of  
the Americans' three opponents. The U.S. team beat Uruguay by 46 
and Canada by 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gugliotta did not play because of pain from a broken nose.  
</P>
<P>
	In an early game, Canada defeated Uruguay 80-62. In late games,  
it was Puerto Rico-Panama and Venezuela-Dominican Republic.

<HEADLINE>  Phone Call Led to Search for JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It started with a telephone call from a friend  
of one of America's most famous families: A plane carrying John F. 
Kennedy Jr., the anxious caller said, was past due at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	With that report, made about 2:15 a.m. Saturday to the Coast  
Guard station in Woods Hole, Mass., the military hierarchy sprang 
into action and started a desperate search for the son of a former 
commander-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews in Woods Hole contacted the Federal Aviation  
Administration, according to Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard 
Larrabee. The FAA, charged with supervising the nation's air space, 
in turn started calling airports and flight-tracking centers up and 
down the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's plane, a Piper Saratoga II HP carrying him, his wife,  
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren, had left 
Fairfield, N.J., Friday evening. It was due into the airport at 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., well before midnight. Airport officials 
said it never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	As it called its own personnel, the FAA also placed call to the  
Air Force Rescue Coordination Center at Langley Air Force Base in 
Hampton, Va., the elite unit that coordinates searches throughout 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	By 3:30 a.m., Larrabee said, the unit called back to the Coast  
Guard and reported a satellite had received a signal from an 
emergency locator beacon over land on the northern end of Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said a boat was sent to the area but did not find  
anything during a three-hour search. 
</P>
<P>
	At 7:30 a.m., Larrabee said ``a more aggressive search'' was  
launched. A Coast Guard jet was dispatched to the skies over Long 
Island Sound. Two Coast Guard helicopters were launched to search 
between Martha's Vineyard and Montauk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force C-130 was transformed into an aerial command post  
and sent to southern Long Island. Within hours, 15 more small 
planes manned by volunteers from the Civil Air Patrol, the Air 
Force auxiliary organization, also were buzzing over the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1 p.m., the search parties zeroed in on a spot 17 miles  
southwest of Martha's Vineyard, after swimmers found a suitcase 
bearing Lauren Bessette's luggage tag floating in the surf off 
Philbin Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said the sizable search had nothing to do with  
Kennedy's status as the only son of the late President John F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We treat all the searches the same,'' said Lt. Col. Steve  
Roark, an official at the Air Force rescue center. ``There is no 
difference between celebrity and noncelebrity. Our job is for all 
the citizens of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also defended the four-hour time lag between receiving  
a report of the missing plane and launching a more intensive 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does take time to research. We look at possible other  
landing sites ... rather than just sending out aircraft 
willy-nilly,'' Roark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said rescuers were hampered by the fact that Kennedy  
did not file a flight plan for his trip, which was not required. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we didn't have any better information because we  
did not have a flight plan,'' Larrabee said, recalling the early 
morning hours. ``We had a time of departure but did not have any 
other good information, so we found ourselves searching a very 
large area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said the searchers planned to continue until they found  
the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather is really not a factor,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal research vessel capable of undersea searches sailed to  
the scene from Montauk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rude, pronounced rue-dee, surveys the ocean floor for the  
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Towing a 
side-scanning sensor shaped like a torpedo, it can examine a swath 
of the ocean bottom 600 feet wide as it moves slowly along. 
</P>
<P>
	The waters of the search area are relatively shallow, ranging  
from 10 to 100 feet, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Networks Focusing on Kennedy Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks set aside normal weekend  
programming Saturday to maintain a constant vigil during the grim 
search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing plane. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS, NBC and the cable news networks beamed continuous  
coverage of the story from the moment the story broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be on the air at least until we know the fate of John F.  
Kennedy Jr.,'' promised CBS's Dan Rather Saturday afternoon, after 
he had already been broadcasting for more than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Hager, NBC's chief aviation correspondent, broke the story  
at 8:06 a.m. EDT. CBS and ABC followed within a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage of the LPGA's Big Apple Golf Tournament and of a  
women's basketball game were bumped from NBC to sister cable 
station CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC was scheduled to show the third round of the British Open  
but instead stayed with the breaking story, switching coverage to 
Disney-owned ESPN. The Major League Soccer All-Star game was 
switched to ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS pre-empted coverage of the Ameritech Senior Open, which was  
scheduled to air for two hours Saturday afternoon. In lieu of its 
scheduled broadcast, the network offered affiliates a 15-minute 
highlight package, said Brian Fitzgerald, tournament director. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unfortunate situation,'' Fitzgerald said. ``All three  
networks made the decision to go with coverage of the search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers were just as aggressive to respond. The Chicago  
Sun-Times published an ``Extra Edition'' of its Sunday newspaper 
with the banner headline: ``JFK JR.'S PLANE MISSING.'' The edition 
was circulating on the streets Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tearing up page one and re-designing it,'' said Ray  
Quintanilla, afternoon editor of the Chicago Tribune. ``This is the 
sort of story that warrants it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times is dedicating at least one full page to the  
Kennedy story in the Sunday edition, said Carolyn Lee, an assistant 
managing editor. But the paper has not added extra editions, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post is adding 16 pages to the Sunday edition. The  
Post is expanding the paper from 112 pages to 128. More than 24 
pages cover the Kennedy story. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe, and Boston.com -- the Globe's Website -- planned  
coverage for Kennedy story. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, pages A12 through A20 will be devoted to  
Kennedy,'' said Michael Larkin, assistant managing editor for the 
Boston Globe's Sunday edition. Boston.com said it is putting 
virtually all of the Globe's stories on its website. 
</P>
<P>
	Others hungry for news turned to Internet sites, reading  
stories, watching live coverage and adding their own comments in 
virtual chat rooms and bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web sites of MSNBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and The Associated  
Press all relayed their live audio and video coverage on the 
search, in addition to print stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Central, the Web site of the Arizona Republic newspaper,  
supplemented its coverage with a bulletin board where readers could 
post their reactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web sites of networks ABC, MSNBC, CBS and Fox also provided  
live chat sessions where people could post questions and comments 
on the drama. 
</P>
<P>
	On television, Rather was the first major network anchor to get  
on the air after the news broke. NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter 
Jennings also arrived to take the helm of their network's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	For the broadcasters, the story's unfolding was painfully slow.  
Each morsel of information -- a potential radar sighting of the 
plane, a washed-up piece of luggage, spotting of airplane wreckage 
-- contributed to a picture becoming clearer in the same way a 
motorist spots something in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the information was uncertain, such as early  
conflicting reports that Kennedy had been accompanied by a flight 
instructor on his plane. Rather, in particular, repeatedly urged 
caution against jumping to conclusions based on sketchy 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Others were more aggressive. ABC presented a graphic of a plane  
pitching into the ocean, with specific altitude figures, before 
confirmation of a crash. The network said its information on the 
plane's possible fate came from ``aviation sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telecasts grew more somber as no good news emerged. ABC's  
Charles Gibson, stationed outside the Kennedy compound in Hyannis, 
Mass., noted that ``the faces of those coming out do not look very 
hopeful to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the anchors, the story seemed particularly poignant. Not  
only did they each start their careers in the 1960s when the 
Kennedy legacy loomed largest, they were fellow members of the New 
York media establishment with Kennedy, publisher of George 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather told of running into Kennedy in coffee shops in  
Manhattan, and Kennedy attended last winter's release party for 
Brokaw's book, ``The Greatest Generation.''

<HEADLINE> Food Prices Stay on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prices farmers get for their crops are the  
lowest in decades for some commodities, though consumers could not 
tell by their grocery bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail food prices have risen 7.6 percent over the past three  
years, while the cost of commodities like wheat, corn and cattle 
has fallen 10.7 percent, according to government economists. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of commodities accounts for a small fraction of the  
price of many foods, so fluctuations in grain and livestock markets 
typically have little impact at the supermarket or restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers get 21 cents of each dollar Americans spend on food, and  
that share has been falling sharply. A decade ago, the farmers' 
share was 32 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's enough people who make a correlation  
between the wheat farmer and the price of bread or the cereal in a 
cereal box,'' said Naomi King, who farms with her husband near 
Jetmore, Kan. ``They don't understand how little the farmer gets, 
that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of a loaf of bread went from 79 cents in 1995  
to 87 cents in 1997, although the cost of the wheat dropped from 6 
cents to 5 cents over the same period, according to an Agriculture 
Department study released last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The agricultural economy is in its worst slump since the early  
1980s because of a worldwide grain glut. The price of wheat, one of 
the Kings' main crops, dropped from $4.55 a bushel in 1995 to $3.38 
in 1997. This year USDA says it could go as low as $2.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Other commodities are doing even worse. Soybean prices will be  
at their lowest since the early 1970s. Corn prices are at the level 
of the mid-1980s slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail food prices, meanwhile, rose 4.4 percent in 1997 and then  
2.2 percent last year, outpacing the overall rate of inflation both 
years, according to Labor Department statistics. So far this year 
they are rising at an annual rate of 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of labor is the driving force in the rise in food  
prices, as well as the growing gap between what farmers earn for 
their crops and what consumers pay for food, according to the USDA 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages and salaries accounted for 49 percent of the cost of  
processing and marketing food in 1997, up from 46 percent in 1992, 
the USDA said. Corporate profits, as a share of the processing and 
marketing cost, dropped slightly over that five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 alone, the industry's labor costs rose 5.7 percent.  
Between 1992 and 1997, the average hourly wage of a food 
manufacturing worker went from $10.20 to $11.49 an hour in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a tight labor market still. Not only food service  
outlets but food storage (facilities) are having some labor 
problems,'' USDA economist Howard Elitzak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Food manufacturers have been consolidating and laying off  
workers in an effort to cut costs, said Gene Grabowski, a spokesman 
for the Grocery Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commodity price is just one variable of hundreds. Once it  
leaves the farm and eventually ends up on the fork you've got so 
many more steps and variables to raise the cost,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while food costs are rising, and Americans more often are  
going to restaurants, they actually are spending less of their 
income than ever to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	The average family or individual spent 10.7 percent of their  
income on food in 1997, down from 11.6 percent a decade ago. Fifty 
years ago, food accounted for more than 22 percent of the household 
budget.

<HEADLINE> Va. Tourists React to JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- On a hot, muggy summer afternoon in July,  
visitors at the hillside grave of President John F. Kennedy voiced 
amazement and sadness Saturday over the disappearance of his son's 
small plane near the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Reid of Chicago said she was ``astonished'' to learn that  
John F. Kennedy Jr. was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's wife, Carolyn, and her sister are believed to be the  
other passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just really sad,'' Reid said. ``It's like there's some  
sort of a curse on the Kennedy family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many tourists at Arlington National Cemetery said they were  
unaware of the missing aircraft. Others said they learned of the 
event while visiting the Kennedy family memorial. President Kennedy 
and his wife, Jacqueline, are buried near the graves of their first 
child, an unnamed daughter stillborn in 1956, and an infant son, 
Patrick, who died three days after birth in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have been asking about him; wanting to know  
what's going on,'' said Tamika Wallace, a visitor center employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just heard about the missing plane thirty seconds ago...it's  
shocking,'' said Alex Hoffman, a visitor from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington National Cemetery attracts thousands of visitors  
daily.

<HEADLINE> Highway Renamed for Babyface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- When Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds goes back  
home to Indiana, he should have no trouble remembering one of its 
highways -- it's just been renamed after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon dedicated a 17-mile stretch of  
Interstate 65 through Indianapolis in honor of the 10-time Grammy 
award winner, who was born and reared here. The governor presented 
Edmonds with a commemorative sign marking the Kenneth ``Babyface'' 
Edmonds Highway on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny Edmonds has made great strides in the entertainment

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr. Air Search Halted for Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Hope dimmed late Saturday for John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law, as darkness descended on 
the waters off Martha's Vineyard where their plane went down. 
Debris washed ashore, but there was no sign of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears mounted that the Kennedys had suffered another ghastly  
tragedy. The couple had been en route to Cape Cod and a Kennedy 
cousin's wedding at Hyannis Port -- now postponed and replaced with 
prayers for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy -- universally known as ``John John''  
since he was a toddler in the White House, and once labeled the 
``sexiest man alive'' by People magazine -- had obtained his pilot's 
license just last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling the tragic death of his father, President Kennedy, in  
1963, there were special broadcast reports and newspaper coverage 
across the world. Many turned to Internet sites, adding their own 
comments in virtual chat rooms and bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions held out faint hope, including the search teams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you miraculous stories of people surviving,'' said  
Rear Admiral Richard M. Larrabee, first Coast Guard district 
commander, at a late afternoon news conference. ``I can tell you in 
previous cases like this, we've searched as many as three or four 
days. We're not ready to give up on this yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the daylong search by planes, helicopters and boats yielded  
little but some fragments of Kennedy's red-and-white plane, a piece 
of baggage labeled with the business card of Lauren Bessette, 
sister of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and a prescription bottle 
belonging to Bessette Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the visual aerial search was suspended for the night late  
Saturday, two Coast Guard boats with bright surface lights and a 
sonar-equipped boat from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration continued searching overnight in the dark, Coast 
Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Coast Guard helicopters and an Air National Guard  
helicopter, all with infrared radar equipment, and an Air National 
Guard C-130 airplane, were grounded early Sunday morning because of 
low haze, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Todd Burgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts State Police Capt. Robert Bird said the infrared  
sensors would allow searchers to detect differences between the 
water and a body or person in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
searchers on the water hoped they might see an emergency beacon or 
search light in the darkness, or rescue ships might turn off their 
engines and hear faint distress calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said National Transportation Safety Board  
investigators already were at work on the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The television networks suspended their scheduled programming to  
focus on the search, and the nation was glued to its sets, echoing 
the grim fascination by his father's assassination, nearly 36 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah -- the portion of the Vineyard  
popularly known as Gay Head -- luggage, a wheel, a headrest and part 
of a plane support known as a strut had washed up, said Coast Guard 
Lt. Craig Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Richard Stanley of the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary said  
other searchers had discovered pieces of landing gear, part of a 
rubber pedal apparatus and pieces of seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McCarthy, 31, of Boston, saw the black bag with Lauren  
Bessette's name on it in the water. A friend, Damon Seligson, waded 
in to retrieve it. ``It was kind of like, 'Oh God.' It seemed like 
it would be pretty bad news. Everyone was shaking,'' said McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration sent a  
submersible named ``Rude'' (pronounced Rudy) to aid in the search, 
and it began its work on Saturday evening, using sonar to look for 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration reported the last contact  
with the plane during its final approach to the airport on the 
island off Cape Cod at 9:39 p.m., the Coast Guard said. ``The 
aircraft was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard around 10 p.m. and 
was later expected to fly to Hyannis Port,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	No flight plan had been filed, and none was required.  
</P>
<P>
	Family members were assembled in Hyannis Port for the wedding of  
the late Robert F. Kennedy's daughter Rory. A family friend 
reported the plane missing to the Coast Guard about 2:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard immediately began searching for the plane and  
contacted FAA officials, who in turn alerted rescue personnel at 
Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, which is in charge of searching 
for overdue planes. At 3:30 a.m., the Air Force got a ``positive 
hit'' on an emergency signal emanating from northern Long Island, 
said Larrabee, the Coast Guard district commander. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers searched that area for three hours, but found nothing,  
he said. At 7:30 a.m., the Coast Guard launched an aggressive 
search of the area around Martha's Vineyard and Montauk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the morning, the search area was narrowed significantly  
when officials reviewed radar records and found the plane's last 
known location was about 17 miles southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the FAA issued a statement confirming that the  
plane left the Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., about 8:30 
p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Martin, of Hyannis Port, a friend of the family, said the  
plane was stopping in Martha's Vineyard to drop off Lauren 
Bessette, before Kennedy and his wife continued on to Hyannis Port. 
It wasn't clear whether the couple planned to start the next leg 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard identified the plane as a single-engine,  
six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP, acquired recently by Kennedy. The 
plane is known in the aviation industry as a high-performance 
airplane with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. Kennedy was not licensed to fly on instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the pilot wants to have is a relatively distinct horizon  
to see the ground and be able to determine the aircraft's altitude 
by looking outside,'' said Warren Morningstar, a pilot and 
spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At night your visual horizon is not going to be as distinct,  
and if it's hazy conditions, your vision is going to be obscured,'' 
Morningstar added. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th  
anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, in which Sen. Edward 
Kennedy's car went off a bridge, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne 
on a tiny island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also three years to the day after the crash on July 17,  
1996, of Paris-bound flight TWA800, off the south shore of Long 
Island, and 35 years after Ted Kennedy narrowly escaped death in a 
private plane crash in which he suffered a broken back. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Labor Day, Kennedy flew another plane -- its registration  
number, N529JK, paid tribute to his father's May 29 birthday -- up 
to Hyannis Port for a family get-together. In an interview in May 
1998, Kennedy told USA Today that he had gotten his license a few 
weeks before, but none of his relatives could be persuaded to fly 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who  
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said. ``The 
second it was legal she came up with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, ``whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane  
and fly off,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Kennedy was on a rafting trip in the West, according to  
CNN. She is the only other survivor of the young family that 
transfixed the world, four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance sent a shudder across the country. The  
Chicago Sun-Times printed an extra edition of its Sunday paper with 
the news; in New York, at Yankee Stadium, fans were asked to rise 
for a moment of silent prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. has lived entirely in the public eye, from his birth  
shortly after his father's election as the nation's 35th president, 
to his poignant salute on the day of his namesake's funeral, to his 
romances with Daryl Hannah and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he more  
recently attracted attention with his political magazine, George, 
in which he once posed nude. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his few private moments was his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding to  
Bessette Kennedy, a former publicist for fashion designer Calvin 
Klein. They were wed in an ultra-private ceremony on a small island 
off the coast of Georgia, free of hovering helicopters and 
paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy, 33, a doctor's daughter from Greenwich, Conn.,  
studied at Boston University before taking the public relations job 
in New York, where she met Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, who is 18 months older than Carolyn, has a twin  
sister, Lisa Ann. A 1982 graduate of Greenwich High School, Lauren 
worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New 
York City.

<HEADLINE> Poll Could Be Last 'Straw' for Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Straw polls are won by straw men at least as  
often as they foretell presidential nominees. But there never has 
been a straw poll with the buildup and advertised stakes of the 
vote coming up in Ames, Iowa, next month. 
</P>
<P>
	For some of the Republican candidates, it could be the last  
straw. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of the field trying to overtake Gov. George W. Bush --  
now down to nine -- it's an early chance to show the front-runner 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	For cash-short campaigners, it is an opportunity to demonstrate  
that donors ought to take another look and send along a check. Or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	All that for $25 a vote, although the rival presidential  
campaigns are spending much more -- the guessing runs to several 
million dollars -- trying to win, or at least come close enough to 
claim a measure of success, on Aug. 14. The estimates are that 
perhaps 12,000 votes will be cast, all for show, binding nothing 
and nobody. 
</P>
<P>
	In ticket-vote sales, that turnout would add up to $300,000 for  
the Iowa Republican Party, which already has auctioned off campaign 
sites outside the hall to the competing candidates for more than 
$80,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was the high bidder, $43,500 for 60,000 square feet of the  
lawn outside the coliseum, to entertain straw voters with music and 
barbecues while the prime candidate works at political persuasion. 
He overpaid in the blind auction. Steve Forbes got second choice 
for $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Bush hasn't done as much campaigning for the Iowa caucuses  
next year as his challengers -- he sat out the spring, saying he had 
to tend to his business with the Texas Legislature -- there was 
speculation he might pass up the straw vote. These faux primaries 
always are troublesome for the leader, as Bob Dole learned in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush is not only competing, he alone has said flatly that  
he's there to win the straw vote. ``I think we not only ought to 
compete, I think we ought to win the Ames straw poll,'' Bush said, 
calling it a good test for his organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates stick to the safe claims. Elizabeth Dole, for  
example, said that she expects to do well but doesn't regard it as 
make or break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to exceed expectations,'' said Lamar Alexander,  
campaigning almost full-time in Iowa until the straw vote, in which 
he hopes to show enough support to persuade contributors to keep 
him going. Forbes, who doesn't need money but does need to show 
that he can catch Bush, is campaigning intensively, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, who ran third in the straw poll four years ago,  
said this one could be the undoing of candidates who run far 
behind. ``The Grim Reaper is going to be waiting outside the gates 
of the Ames fieldhouse and about five or six of those fellows may 
never survive that,'' said Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	That sounds like a considerable judgment to be made at an event  
that is in fact only a preview of a preview. The Iowa Republican 
caucuses next winter will be the first actual competition of the 
campaign year, the first time there will be real winners and 
losers. But even that vote, at the precinct level, just begins the 
process that will award the state's nominating delegates at the 
Republican National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the straw poll is the only contest at hand now. And it is  
more Iowa-representative than it used to be; at least the voters 
now are required to show that they're from the state. Four years 
ago, straw voters were bused in from the rest of the Midwest, 
notably by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who gained a surprise tie vote 
with Bob Dole, the early favorite and the eventual nominee. Not 
that it did Gramm any good. His campaign didn't get as far as the 
New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw polls have picked losers about as often as winners.  
Iowa's, for example, went to then-Sen. Alan Cranston among 
Democrats in 1983, Pat Robertson in the Republican vote of 1987. 
Sen. John Ashcroft won one in South Carolina in 1998, and he's long 
since dropped his GOP presidential bid. On the other hand, Jimmy 
Carter used a 1975 Democratic straw poll in Ames as a springboard 
in his winning campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	There won't be a Democratic version in Iowa this year. The  
Democratic National Committee opposes straw polls as ``premature 
and false barometers'' of the nominating process. Despite that, 
Massachusetts Democrats held one at their state convention in May. 
Vice President Al Gore won easily.

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr.'s Plane Known As Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Piper Saratoga II HP that disappeared with  
John F. Kennedy Jr. and two others aboard is known in the aviation 
industry as a high-performance airplane with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the pilot wants to have is a relatively distinct horizon  
to see the ground and be able to determine the aircraft's altitude 
by looking outside,'' said Warren Morningstar, a pilot and 
spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At night your visual horizon is not going to be as distinct,  
and if it's hazy conditions, your vision is going to be obscured,'' 
Morningstar added. 
</P>
<P>
	Visual flight rules must be used by a pilot without an  
instrument rating, which Kennedy apparently did not have. Under 
so-called VFR rules, a pilot must be able to see at least three 
miles into the distance and stay well below clouds. Pilots say 
anything less than six miles visibility is marginal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's red-and-white Saratoga disappeared Friday as he was  
flying with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister 
Lauren, from Fairfield, N.J., just outside New York City, to 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was then supposed to travel on to Hyannisport, Mass.,  
where Rory Kennedy, the youngest child of the late Sen. Robert. F. 
Kennedy, was to be married Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard is about 200  
miles, or only about one-quarter of the aircraft's range. Coast 
Guard officials confirmed Saturday that debris -- apparently from 
the aircraft -- had been found near Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Powered by a single turbocharged Lycoming engine, the Saratoga  
could carry up to six and had a top speed of around 175 knots, or 
about 201 mph. With a full load of fuel, it could fly about 859 
nautical miles, or just short of 990 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, built in 1995, also was delivered with a full  
complement of modern instruments, as well as an automatic Emergency 
Locator Transmitter, or ELT, said Chuck Suma, president of The New 
Piper Aircraft Inc. of Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Such devices can be triggered manually or automatically upon a  
crash. They emit signals that can be detected by satellites and 
homed in on by search aircraft, but not after the plane has become 
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was not delivered with flotation devices or flight  
data recorders, Suma said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's considered a high-performance airplane, but among the  
ranks of high-perfomance aircraft, it's one of the easiest to 
fly,'' said Morningstar, whose group is the world's largest civil 
aviation group. ``It's a very safe, very solid, very good 
airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suma said there are about 7,500 Saratogas now in service  
worldwide, accumulating over a half-million flight hours each year. 
The last time one was involved in a fatal crash was December, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA records show that a John F. Kennedy from Manhattan had a  
student pilot's license as far back as 1987. Another student 
license was issued issued to John Fitzgerald Kennedy of Manhattan 
on Dec. 12, 1997. An FAA source, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, said Kennedy received a single-engine pilot's license on 
April 22, 1998. There are no records of him receiving an instrument 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saratoga was one of two airplanes that have been registered  
in Kennedy's name by a corporation, Random Ventures Inc. According 
to Federal Aviation Administration records, it carried the tail 
number N9253N. Another other plane owned by Random Ventures, a 
Cessna 182, had a similar number N529JK. 
</P>
<P>
	That registration paid homage to Kennedy's father, the late  
President John F. Kennedy, playing off his initials and his 
birthdate, May 29, 1917. FAA records indicate the aircraft had been 
sold by Kennedy and was registered by a Fairfield, N.J., aviation 
company in May. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA records indicate that Piper first sold the Saratoga in 1996  
to Poinciana LLC of Wilmington, N.C. It was then sold to Hussain 
Munir of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. Kennedy subsequently bought the 
plane and registered it with the FAA on April 30.

<HEADLINE> Reggae Star Gets Hero's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Thousands of people danced and cheered  
to reggae music Saturday as Dennis Brown, the man known as the 
Crown Prince of Reggae, was given a state-style funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a national outpouring of grief after Brown's July 1  
death from pneumonia after years of illness, the tribute was more 
dynamic than dour. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who died at 42, was buried at Kingston's National Heroes  
Park, an exclusive cemetery reserved for such notables as Marcus 
Garvey, who became an international black nationalist leader, and 
independence leaders Alexander Bustamente and Norman Manley. Brown 
is the first entertainer at Heroes Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds jammed the National Arena for the tribute, cheering on as  
musicians played. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's five sons were among the performers, as well as reggae  
artists Maxi Priest and Shaggy, and gospel singer Carlene Davis. 
The concert was broadcast live on Jamaican television. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-hour funeral, both Prime Minister P.J.  
Patterson and opposition leader Edward Seaga gave tributes to the 
late singer, Patterson calling his music ``a sweet song and 
soothing balm for our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, a funeral procession led by hundreds of people on  
bicycles waving red, yellow and green-striped flags drove through 
downtown Kingston. All along the route, people poured out of their 
homes to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was much more somber Thursday, when more than 10,000  
mourners spent hours under a broiling sun to file past the casket 
where Brown lay. Many sobbed and wailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Historian Roger Stefans attributed the immense reaction to  
Brown's death to reggae's function as ``Jamaica's true daily 
newspaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a bookish country. Its traditions are more oral than  
printed, and the people who most eloquently describe the island's 
conditions become heroes,'' Stefans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's religion was Rastafarianism, whose adherents worship  
former Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie and smoke marijuana as a 
sacrament. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown rose to prominence in a 1970s wave of reggae singers that  
included Bob Marley, who introduced the catchy rhythm with its 
social-minded lyrics to listeners around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown released more than 50 albums and a string of hit songs  
beginning with ``No Man is an Island,'' which he recorded in 1969 
at the age of 12.

murderers Juan Corona and Charles Manson, a 37-year-old derelict 
named Gregory Taylor is serving 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	But Taylor didn't kill, or even injure anyone. His crime?  
Attempting to break into a church to steal food. 
</P>
<P>
	The case recalls ``Les Miserables,'' the classic Victor Hugo  
novel in which Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing bread, said 
one of the three judges who ruled on Taylor's appeal in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two, however, upheld the conviction.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's sentence stems from the California three-strikes law  
intended to reduce crime by taking habitual criminals off the 
streets. Two ``serious or violent'' felonies, followed by one 
felony of any sort, require a sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor had the requisite record. He once snatched a purse  
containing $10 and a bus pass from a woman on the sidewalk. A year 
later, he and a buddy, armed only with macho attitudes, tried to 
rob a man on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	That the second conviction was 14 years ago mattered not at all.  
Without the previous convictions, his church break-in would have 
drawn no more than three years. Instead, he'll be eligible for 
parole in 2022, the year he turns 60. 
</P>
<P>
	His remaining chance is the state Supreme Court, which has not  
yet decided whether to consider his case. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-strikes law was approved by voters in 1994, the year  
after the kidnap-murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas by a paroled 
felon. Critics maintain that by curtailing the sentencing powers of 
judges, the law was bound to lead to unjust punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor grew up in the tough South Central section of Los  
Angeles, one of nine boys born between 1949 and 1966 to a nurse who 
quit work and went on welfare to care for her children. 
</P>
<P>
	His stern, religious mother gathered the boys each Sunday for  
church, hoping to keep them on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to go,'' Taylor recalls, looking out the  
visiting room windows of Corcoran State Prison. ``I'd say, 'I'm 
sick.' But it never worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the week, the boys heard spontaneous sermons from their  
mother's two sisters, both ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	His older brother, Dwight, who went on to play outfield for the  
Kansas City Royals and other professional baseball teams, ``taught 
me how to play sports,'' Taylor says. But the curious teen would 
slip away to check out what the other boys were doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``At recess, we'd go in this little room and be shooting dice,''  
he recalls. ``Dwight would come looking for me, and I'd hide in the 
bathroom stall with my feet up. He'd find me and smell my hands and 
ask me, 'You been smoking cigarettes?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The strict upbringing couldn't shield Taylor from bad  
influences. At age 12, he was initiated into the Crips, joining 
periodic gang battles against rival Bloods. It was mostly 
fistfights, he says, ``back in the days before the drive-by 
shootings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He quit school in the 12th grade, had some run-ins with the law  
while still a teen-ager, and spent time in the California Youth 
Authority. In his 20s, he did a total of about two years in state 
prison for the purse-snatching and the attempted street robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Once out, he met Vivian Fox, a new tenant in his brother's  
apartment building. He helped her unload her furniture and soon 
moved in himself. Vivian got pregnant, but the relationship didn't 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an argument and I left,'' Taylor says. ``When I went  
back, she had my clothes out on the porch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's daughter, Tamra, is 13 now. He says he hasn't seen her  
for seven or eight years, misses her and thinks of her often. 
</P>
<P>
	After his family broke up, Taylor began sleeping from time to  
time in the laundry room or an alcove at St. Joseph's, a Roman 
Catholic Church on 12th Street, a few blocks from the Los Angeles 
fashion and flower districts. 
</P>
<P>
	By day, the area is an open-air bazaar. Mannequins in rayon  
blouses and taffeta gowns line the streets. Bolts of fabric stand 
in rows next to shelves of baseball caps. The smell of hot dogs 
flows from food stands along sidewalks bustling with 
bargain-hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor found part-time work in the district, doing construction  
jobs at flower shops, running machines at a clothing store and, 
although he had no driver's license, making deliveries for various 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also volunteered to help church workers feed the homeless and  
occasionally worked as a guard at church weddings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, at the church, Taylor met the Rev. Allan McCoy, a  
Franciscan priest. They got together often to talk over baseball 
scores, family problems, spirituality. Sometimes McCoy served 
Taylor sandwiches or drove him to his mother's house in south Los 
Angeles. Sometimes he gave Taylor money to stay at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like a father to me,'' Taylor says.  
</P>
<P>
	But as the friendship grew, so did Taylor's heroin and cocaine  
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	When he had the money, he would get a hotel room for a few days  
and shoot up. When he couldn't afford a room, he says, he would 
sometimes crawl into a tent under a highway to shoot up. 
</P>
<P>
	His brothers tried to help. Michael drove him up to a drug rehab  
center where Taylor completed a 90-day program and stayed clean for 
a few years. But it didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd do good for a year, nine, 10 months,'' he says. Then it  
was back to the streets, he says, ``not doing crimes, doing 
drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was stuck in a cycle, he says, his sad downward-angled eyes  
casting about the visiting room. ``I'd do a little and I'd want 
more. That's a bad feeling, when you come down off that stuff. I'd 
ask myself, 'Why? Why?' It's crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, Taylor would wander over to the church and tell  
McCoy, ``I'm tired, burned out.'' The priest would give him a ride 
back to his mother's house, where he would rest, dry out. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the police picked him up for drug use, and in 1992 he  
was convicted of cocaine possession. Put on parole, he violated its 
terms by not checking in with his officer, he says, because he knew 
he would fail the drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4 a.m., July 11, 1997, two guards paused in the shadows  
and watched a tall, slender man in dirty clothes and worn-out 
tennis shoes bend over the bottom of the back door to St. Joseph's. 
He was working a piece of 4-by-4 into a crack in the door. 
</P>
<P>
	The door led to a kitchen where industrial-size refrigerators  
chill tubs of cottage cheese, and shelves of cups and plates line a 
wall above a row of deep sinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards, as they later told it, watched for a couple of  
minutes as the man pried at the door. Then they yelled, ``Stop!'' 
Gregory Taylor froze, then pulled the board from the door, leaned 
it against the wall and, following instructions, put his hands 
behind his head. 
</P>
<P>
	The arresting police officer later testified that Taylor said he  
``was trying to go in the kitchen to get something to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor continues to deny the whole thing. ``I would never go  
into that place to steal,'' he says, adding that the break-in was 
concocted by one of the guards who had argued with him over 
sleeping in the church alcove. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, Taylor's lawyer, Graciela Martinez, argued that even  
if Taylor had tried to break into the church, he was guilty of no 
more than trespassing. The kitchen was where church workers fed the 
homeless, Martinez said, and it wasn't a break-in if Taylor 
believed he had permission to enter to get food. 
</P>
<P>
	But a jury convicted him, a judge handed down the law-mandated  
sentence, and the appeals court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was devastated,'' Ms. Martinez says. ``This was the most  
painful case I've ever handled because it was so unjust. He did not 
have a violent nature. He was just poor and hungry. Now he has 25 
to life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a gentleman throughout the trial,'' she recalls. ``Even  
at the end, when the sentence was imposed. He thanked the judge, 
then turned, he was crying by this point, and he thanked Father 
McCoy. Then he thanked me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Ricciardulli, Los Angeles County deputy public defender,  
says Taylor is not the kind of defendant lawmakers had in mind when 
they wrote the three-strikes law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law,'' he says, ``was designed for repeat felons, not  
repeat nuisances. The punishment doesn't fit the crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dale Cutler sees it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor ``failed at both probation and parole and did more than  
that,'' he said. ``What he violated was the trust of a man (McCoy) 
who showed him nothing but kindness over a nine-year period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Taylor lives among some of the country's most violent  
offenders. He works out every other day and is eager to get 
reassigned to a new prison job. 
</P>
<P>
	He quit his last one because ``they wanted me to kill gophers,''  
he says. ``I can't do that. That's nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy moves ghostlike about the church grounds in his long,  
brown Franciscan robe cinched at the waist with a gold cord. His 
normally gentle eyes catch fire as he speaks of the sentence he 
considers unjust, of the friend he knows ``as a peaceful man, a man 
who helped down at the center with the feeding of the street 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What about the concept of human dignity?'' he demands, lightly  
pounding the table with his fist. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy and Taylor remain friends. They exchange letters.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor draws happy faces on his.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rep. Forbes Joining Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUOGUE, N.Y. (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker switched allegiance to  
the Democrats Saturday, the first such defection since the GOP took 
control of Congress five years ago. He drew praise from President 
Clinton for having the ``courage to change'' and scorn from the GOP 
for placing ``ego ahead of principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Michael Forbes, who represents the eastern tip of New  
York's Long Island, told reporters at his home that the Republican 
Party ``has become an angry, narrow-minded, intolerant and uncaring 
majority, incapable of governing at all, much less from the center, 
and tone-deaf to the concerns of a vast majority of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he was first elected to the House in 1994 as a supporter  
of the conservative ``Contract with America,'' Forbes clashed 
numerous times with the GOP leadership. His most prominent break 
came in 1997, when he refused to support then-Rep. Newt Gingrich 
for re-election as speaker, citing concerns over an ethics probe. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, he found himself briefly near the center of power  
in the House when it appeared last year that Rep. Bob Livingston 
would succeed Gingrich as speaker. Livingston quit Congress 
unexpectedly, though, and Forbes' political stock plummeted 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The defection provides an important psychological lift for  
Democrats who hope to regain control of the House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	With Forbes' announcement, Republicans will hold 222 seats in  
the 435-member House, with 211 Democrats and an independent who 
usually votes with the Democrats. A seat is vacant because of the 
death Thursday of Rep. George Brown, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who has shown a strong independent streak, said the GOP  
has become ``a captive of extremists,'' and he said the Democratic 
Party is more open. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party over the last 4 1/2 years has been defined  
through the actions of its extremists in the House of 
Representatives,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly, there's no room in the Republican Party in Congress for  
moderates like myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he knew Forbes ``made a hard choice, but ... the  
right choice'' and is ``joining a party that welcomes independent 
thinking and the courage to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Vice President Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, came recognition of Forbes as ``a man of 
principle and integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Praise flowed from the White House even though, as Republicans  
noted, Forbes recently endorsed Texas' Republican Gov. George W. 
Bush for president in 2000 and voted to impeach Clinton on all four 
of the charges brought by the House Judiciary Committee last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand your anger, but the Republicans in Washington  
aren't reflecting your values or concerns,'' Forbes told one 
constituent who complained about his switch. ``I am the same person 
that I was yesterday and the day before that and the year before 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans believe Forbes is ``obviously putting his personal  
ego ahead of principle and ahead of the interests of his district, 
which is solidly Republican,'' said Jill Schroeder, a spokeswoman 
for the GOP campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton won 51 percent of the vote in Forbes' district in 1996,  
compared with 36 percent for Republican Bob Dole. The vote four 
years earlier was 40 percent for President Bush and 38 percent for 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' decision followed a series of private conversations over  
several weeks with Democratic House members from New York and the 
House's top Democrat, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also met privately at the White House with Clinton at one  
point. The meeting with the president was unannounced at the time, 
and officials said the conversations with Gephardt occurred away 
from his Capitol office to avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, 47, defeated a Democrat to win his seat in 1994, one of  
more than 70 GOP first-termers who helped usher a Republican 
majority into the House for the first time in 40 years. Between 
1961 and 1995, when Forbes took office, Democrats had represented 
the district for 26 of those 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Five House Democrats switched to the GOP in 1995. In the Senate,  
Richard Shelby of Alabama and Colorado's Ben Nighthorse Campbell 
also switched from the Democrats in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is the second Republican to leave his party in less than  
a week. On Wednesday, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., running at the back 
of the pack in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, became 
an independent.

<HEADLINE> Probation Sentence in TWA 800 Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Three years after TWA Flight 800 exploded  
off Long Island, a federal judge sentenced a Virginia couple to 
probation for conspiring to steal seat materials from the 
reconstructed remains of the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel much better now,'' said Elizabeth Sanders, 52, after  
she and her husband James Sanders, 53, were spared jail time 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today is the third anniversary of the explosion that killed 230  
people aboard the Paris-bound flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, a self-styled investigative reporter who wrote the 1997  
book ``The Downing of TWA Flight 800,'' was given three years 
probation and 50 hours of community service. His wife, a former TWA 
employee, received one year probation and 25 hours of community 
service. They had faced up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would do it again, Sanders replied, ``Yes I would,  
but I probably would have changed some things.'' He declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were convicted in April of stealing evidence from a  
civil aircraft crash site or wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Sanders conspired with his wife and a  
former TWA pilot, Terrell Stacey, to take plane seat fabric in 
December 1996. Stacey pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In his book, Sanders claimed that the U.S. Navy mistakenly shot  
down the jetliner. He believed the swatches were stained with 
missile fuel residue and would support his contention. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators believe a fuel-air explosion in the plane's  
empty center fuel tank caused the catastrophe. They are still 
hunting for the ignition source and hope for a final determination 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, defense attorney Bruce Maffeo said his clients had a  
First Amendment right to take the swatches and stolen documents in 
order to expose what he said was a government cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three years ago tomorrow this tragedy occurred,'' Maffeo said,  
``and the government has yet to come up with a conclusive cause to 
this crash.''

<HEADLINE> Burnitz Leaves With Bruised Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- All-Star outfielder Jeromy Burnitz broke a bone  
in his right hand during the Brewers' game against Kansas City on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz was hit in the fourth inning by a pitch from the Royals'  
Jose Rosado. He stayed in the game but was replaced by Geoff 
Jenkins in the top of the sixth inning after Milwaukee took a 9-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays revealed a non-displaced fracture of the fifth metatarsal  
bone in his hand, the Brewers said. Burnitz's hand was placed in a 
splint and will be reevaluated on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz started for the National League in Tuesday's All-Star  
game and hit an RBI double. He also finished second to Ken Griffey 
Jr. in the home run-hitting contest. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0-for-2 with a strikeout Saturday. Burnitz has 26 home  
runs and 73 RBIs this season while hitting .275.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Sues Handgun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP has filed suit against nearly 100  
handgun makers in federal court, seeking injunctions that would 
place sweeping restrictions on handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
contends the industry's marketing practices fuel street violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday in Brooklyn, alleges that negligent  
marketing of handguns has ``led to disproportionate numbers of 
injuries, deaths and other damages among those whose interests the 
(NAACP) represents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are putting the gun industry on notice that it can't be  
business as usual,'' NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks to force distributors to restrict sales to  
dealers who have storefront outlets, prohibit sales to gun show 
dealers and limit individual purchasers to one handgun a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include industry heavyweights including Smith &AMP;  
Wesson Corp., Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. and Glock, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies and industry trade groups have argued that it's  
unfair and unlawful to try to hold manufacturers liable for the 
criminal use of a legal product. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's lawsuit ``would inappropriately try to change the  
law through the courts,'' said Glock attorney John Renzulli. ``This 
is a political, legislative issue, and not an issue for the 
judiciary. ... The industry already is well-regulated; some may say 
over-regulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for the lawsuit were first announced Monday at the NAACP's  
annual convention in New York.

<HEADLINE> The 'Heir to Camelot' Is Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For one generation, he was the brave little  
soldier: a small boy in a blue coat and shorts, saluting his 
father's casket on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	For today's generation, he has been The Hunk -- ``the sexiest man  
alive,'' said People magazine -- the heir to Camelot, the magazine 
publisher who dated Daryl Hannah and Madonna, a glitzy jet-setter 
who piloted his own plane. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr., 38, grew up in the public eye, from his  
years as a toddler in the White House to today, when his plane was 
reported missing somewhere between the Long Island coast and 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. For many, he has been the embodiment of 
the ``Kennedy mystique'' -- young, good-looking, seemingly 
invulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	A biographer, Wendy Leigh, said JFK Jr. was the one member of  
his family who remained untarnished by scandal. It was an 
overstatement, but it summed up the way the world viewed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to talk about a legacy or a mystique,''  
Kennedy said in 1993. ``It's my family. The fact that there have 
been difficulties and hardships, or obstacles, makes us closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was born 2 1/2 weeks after his father's 1960 election, the only  
child ever born to a president-elect. He soon became known to the 
nation as ``John-John,'' a name erroneously bestowed on him by a 
reporter who misheard a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his life, he was exposed to the tragedies that seemed  
to endlessly beset his family. A brother, Patrick, was born on Aug. 
7, 1963, but died days later. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 22, 1963, his father was killed by an assassin in  
Dallas. The enduring moment of the Washington funeral came when the 
little boy stood saluting his father's passing casket outside St. 
Matthew's Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	After his father's murder, his mother moved the family to  
Manhattan, where she raised John and older sister Caroline even 
after her marriage to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was close to his cousins, Mrs. Onassis kept her  
children somewhat apart from the rest of the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics,  
although he was constantly questioned about a future in the 
political arena. He showed some talent as an actor, performing in 
several plays. 
</P>
<P>
	But any hopes of a career in acting ended when his mother turned  
thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy graduated from Brown University, went to law school and  
joined the Manhattan district attorney's office -- but only after 
failing the bar twice. ``HUNK FLUNKS,'' read one tabloid headline 
after one of those failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was often seen throwing a Frisbee in Central Park or  
roller-blading through Tribeca. After his mother died on May 19, 
1994, JFK Jr. was photographed roller-blading to her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy acquitted himself well as a prosecutor, winning all six  
of his cases, but he wasn't fulfilled by the job. In 1995, he 
launched the magazine George -- subtitled ``not just politics as 
usual.'' A year later, Kennedy -- once dubbed ``the sexiest man 
alive'' by People magazine -- married girlfriend Carolyn Bessette in 
an ultra-secret wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette, the 30-year-old blond daughter of a Greenwich, Conn.,  
doctor, succeeded where many women had failed. Kennedy was a gossip 
column fixture, demonstrating that his father's sex appeal has 
passed on to the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine kept Kennedy in the limelight, and allowed him to  
do a bit of reporting. He interviewed ex-Alabama Gov. George 
Wallace, among others.

	Bush aides say the tickets were gifts from an old friend, and  
fit in under an exception to his ethics policy -- gifts from 
personal friends who don't have business pending before state. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Florida Democratic Party charged that by going to the  
Super Bowl in Miami for free, the Republican compromised the 
standards he set for himself and his administration when he took 
office earlier in January promising to ``raise the bar'' on ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	State law only prohibits public officials from accepting gifts  
from lobbyists over $100. Bush said he wanted a higher standard and 
limited his administration to gifts worth $25 or less if they are 
from lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it turns out, the governor's policy was in place for all of  
nine days before he handed himself the first exemption,'' said 
Democratic Party chairman Charles Whitehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokesman Cory Tilley said Friday that the tickets, from  
Miami attorney and longtime Bush buddy Dean Colson, fall under the 
exception area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor didn't pay for the tickets because Dean Colson is  
a close personal friend and not a lobbyist,'' Tilley said. ``The 
governor's staff and the governor should be able to receive gifts 
from personal friends if the individual doesn't have something 
before the governor that he has to make a decision on, and Mr. 
Colson didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colson was a member of the Miami Super Bowl host committee.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush took his two sons to the Jan. 31 game at Pro Player Stadium  
between the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilley also argued that a showcase event like the Super Bowl  
isn't just a personal trip -- it's almost like a state function the 
governor should attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the biggest economic development events in  
South Florida,'' Tilley said. ``If the governor wasn't there, it 
would have been strange.''

<HEADLINE> Security Gaps Present at Nuke Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A national laboratory insider determined  
to steal secrets still could copy files off the lab's classified 
computers onto a floppy disk and walk out, said the Energy 
Department's new security czar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, those problems won't be fixed for a year or so.  
That's what concerns me most,'' retired Air Force Gen. Eugene 
Habiger, the agency's new security chief, said Friday. ``Have they 
got more work to do? You bet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Habiger said it will take more than a year to close the computer  
security gaps that put the federal nuclear weapons lab in Los 
Alamos at the center of a political firestorm over secrets 
allegedly stolen by the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos is gradually tightening the security of its  
classified network of roughly 2,000 personal computers, 
workstations, and supercomputers. It will take until September 2000 
to create a network where information cannot be copied to floppy 
disks, tapes or CDs, said lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold. 
</P>
<P>
	Habiger took over as the Energy Department's director of  
security and emergency operations on June 16. He inspected Los 
Alamos most of last week, drawing up lists of security problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Habiger faces a difficult task winning scientists and engineers  
over to mandatory polygraph testing, which Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson ordered two months ago. Some lab workers view the 
lie-detector tests as an unscientific, politically driven insult to 
their trustworthiness.

<HEADLINE> NTSB, TWA Trade Accusations on 800 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On today's third anniversary of the crash of  
TWA Flight 800, the end of the investigation is in sight but not 
the hard feelings between the airline and accident investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,  
complained this week that Trans World Airlines has refused requests 
to share in the multimillion-dollar cost of recovering and storing 
the wreckage, unlike other airlines that have had a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said TWA has repeatedly told safety board staff members it  
is not responsible for the wreckage because it fell into the sea 
off Long Island, clouding property rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman also said the airline and its insurer have taken a  
hands-off approach when asked about taking the wreckage back. In 
light of that, Hall wants to move what's left of the Boeing 747, 
including a 92-foot section that has been reconstructed, from New 
York to Washington so it can be used to train accident 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``They refused to participate at all, even though we requested  
them,'' Hall said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA spokesman Jim Brown called Hall ``misinformed.'' Brown said  
NTSB rules precluded the St. Louis-based airline from helping with 
or financing the wreckage recovery and storage. Furthermore, he 
said the board never asked the airline for funding or to take 
custody of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall then produced letters from 1996 with a request for $5  
million in assistance and the airline's denial. In another letter 
from 1998, the airline stated that neither it nor its insurer owned 
the wreckage. In reply, Brown acknowledged the airline did receive 
a request for recovery money, but the other letter produced by Hall 
did not expressly ask the airline to take back the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said airlines have refused such requests in the past, yet  
there is precedent for both help and refusal. Brown also said the 
airline has no claim to the wreckage because it fell in the ocean, 
where ownership often reverts to the person making the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want us to take it back, it's something we would  
consider,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA Flight 800 was a New York-to-Paris trip that exploded  
shortly after takeoff on July 17, 1996. All 230 aboard were killed. 
The wreckage fell into the Atlantic Ocean about 10 miles off Long 
Island, where it was recovered by the Coast Guard and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still have not determined the cause, but they  
believe there was a fuel-air explosion in the plane's empty center 
fuel tank. They are searching for the ignition source and expect to 
make a final determination this fall or winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of the victims planned to observe the third anniversary  
of the crash today with a memorial service and monument dedication. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension between the NTSB, the lead investigator, and TWA began  
building immediately after the crash because the airline had 
difficulty coming up with a passenger list. Later, airline 
officials complained privately that the safety board was leaking 
embarrassing information to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers flared again in February 1997, when the airline refused  
to give the victims' families reduced airfares to travel to New 
York for their first look at the wreckage. TWA said it had already 
spent roughly $13 million providing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage is now in an old aircraft plant in Calverton, N.Y.,  
at a rent of $4.5 million annually. It will soon be moved to 
another hangar, where the charge will be $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In an August 1996 letter, Hall asked TWA for $5 million to help  
in funding ``this massive operation.'' Don Monteath, then the 
airline's vice president of operations, refused, saying such 
assistance ``would raise serious public questions about the 
integrity and eventual findings/conclusions of NTSB inquiries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monteath said the airline would support requests to Congress for  
more money. 
</P>
<P>
	In a January 1998 letter to the safety board, Randal Craft Jr.,  
TWA's outside counsel, addressed the wreckage issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This letter will confirm that TWA and its aviation insurers  
continue to take the position that they do not own the wreckage of 
Flight 800 or the personal effects of the Flight 800 passengers and 
crew,'' Craft wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked this week what fate the airline favors for the wreckage,  
Brown said: ``TWA believes that the remains of Flight 800 should be 
treated like the remains of any other airplane crash and disposed 
of respectfully once the investigation is concluded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said that considering the airline's response and the  
government's investment in the wreckage, training would be a better 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wreckage itself would be able to give back to future  
generations lessons that would prevent a similar occurrence,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Capt. Charts New Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Eileen Collins likes to use a little  
model of a space shuttle when explaining to her littlest fan where 
she'll be sitting when Columbia blasts off this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Bridget responds with a ``Yippee!'' What she doesn't  
know, can't know at age 3 1/2, is that Mommy is about to become the 
first woman to lead a crew into space. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's first female commander laughs as she recalls how her  
daughter once asked: ``Mommy, have you ever been to the moon?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she understands the big picture,'' says Collins.  
``I don't think she knows that everybody's mother doesn't fly in 
space or command a space shuttle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday -- coincidentally, the 30th anniversary of man's first  
moon landing -- Collins will chart a new course for women when she 
slides into the front left seat of Columbia and takes the controls 
at liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time in 95 space shuttle launches -- 126  
counting Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Skylab -- that a woman is at 
the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Air Force colonel will be responsible for four  
other astronauts, three of them older men. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll also be responsible for the heftiest and one of the  
priciest shuttle payloads ever: NASA's 25-ton, $1.5 billion Chandra 
X-ray Observatory, on a scientific par with the Hubble Space 
Telescope. The price tag for the entire Chandra project, from 
development through five years of orbital operation: $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Collins nervous? No.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to have the attitude that, 'I am confident enough  
to handle anything,''' says the former test pilot, who has logged 
more than 5,000 hours in 30 types of aircraft. ``I have a lot of 
faith in God. That's another thing I think that goes a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does she feel the pressure? You bet. But she doesn't dwell on  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time my brain starts going in that direction, I stop  
myself and go, 'Eileen, you're not focusing on the mission. Focus 
on the mission.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And she has, for 1 1/2 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Her promotion from shuttle pilot to shuttle commander was  
announced by Hillary Rodham Clinton at a White House ceremony in 
March 1998, a few months after NASA gave her the prestigious 
five-day mission to deliver the telescope to orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of young girls who need to see Eileen in the  
commander's seat achieving her dreams,'' says Air Force Lt. Col. 
Catherine ``Cady'' Coleman, 38, who is on Collins' crew. ``Not so 
that they can all be astronauts, because then the line to go to 
space would be way too long, but because they realize that they can 
achieve their dreams if they work for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second of four children, she grew up in public housing in  
Elmira, N.Y. Her father recalls how he'd take the family to a local 
air field to watch gliders and small planes; they could afford 
little else. 
</P>
<P>
	Good at math, Collins considered teaching. Her father suggested  
accounting. But the images of gliders and planes stuck. She took 
odd jobs to pay for flying lessons and, with the help of loans and 
scholarships, aimed for an Air Force career. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins graduated from Syracuse University with a bachelor's  
degree in math and economics in 1978, the same year NASA accepted 
its first female astronauts. With her sights on space, she trained 
as an Air Force pilot, then served as a T-38 and C-141 instructor 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After teaching math and instructing T-41 pilots at the U.S. Air  
Force Academy, Collins became only the second woman to enter Air 
Force Test Pilot School. That same year, 1989, she applied to 
become an astronaut. A year later, NASA chose her as its first 
female shuttle pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1995, Collins made her debut as the  
second-in-command pilot of Discovery. The afterglow was 
short-lived; one month after the mission, someone threatened to 
kill her at a parade planned in her honor in Elmira. She skipped 
the parade. The perpetrator was never caught. 
</P>
<P>
	She took a six-week maternity leave following Bridget's birth in  
November 1995, then flew again as a shuttle pilot to Mir 1 1/2 years 
later. By then, strangers in restaurants no longer asked for her 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is going to start happening again,'' she says.  
``But it will pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, the spotlight is on.  
</P>
<P>
	Women in aerospace and aviation will converge on Kennedy Space  
Center for Collins' middle-of-the-night launch. Sally Ride, who 
became the first American woman in space in 1983, will be there, 
too, with a dual interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ride's former husband, astronaut Steven Hawley, 47, will rocket  
into orbit with Collins. He was on the astronaut-selection board 
that chose Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this is a new and important step, in some sense it's  
a natural evolution,'' says Hawley. He points to the numbers as 
evidence: Of the 283 people who have flown on U.S. spacecraft, 32 
have been women. (NASA does not count the the three rookies killed 
aboard Challenger in 1986.) Of NASA's current 118 astronauts, 29 
are women. Of NASA's 40 shuttle pilots, three are women. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's egalitarian boss, Daniel Goldin, is unfazed: ``Eileen  
Collins is the commander. So what's the news?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Lt. Col. Pamela Melroy can't think of anyone better  
suited. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really is technically extremely good, but there's a lot  
more that goes into it than that,'' says Melroy, 37, who will fly 
as a shuttle pilot early next year. ``It's her personality. She's 
such a nice person, just easygoing, very friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins' nurturing side often shows.  
</P>
<P>
	At a practice countdown last month, Collins tried to deflect  
attention toward her crew, in particular 49-year-old French 
astronaut Michel Tognini. It didn't work. Collins still got the 
last question, but she made sure no one left until Tognini had a 
chance to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins cites her two jobs -- being an astronaut and being a  
mother -- as equally difficult, yet equally rewarding. In fact, she 
says, being a parent has made her a more sensitive commander and 
actually decreased her level of stress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that she has a young daughter, Bridget, that has kind of  
rounded everything out,'' observes her father, Jim Collins, 72, a 
U.S. Postal Service clerk in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Though very proud, he refuses to take credit. ``Everything that  
Eileen is today, she has earned,'' he says. ``She was born with 
this desire to be a success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Collins does credit her parents, as well as her husband Pat  
Youngs, a 41-year-old pilot for Delta Air Lines. She also relies on 
her own high level of energy and a low need for sleep, plus a 
wonderful nanny. 
</P>
<P>
	In the male-dominated world of aerospace, not everyone has  
embraced Collins' success. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Coleman has had to defend her commander whenever she  
chats with crusty old-timers at small airports. ``They're not going 
to let her land it, are they?'' the men ask. ``I certainly hope so, 
since she's sitting in the front seat,'' Coleman replies, with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Even crewmate Hawley admits that not every man in the astronaut  
corps would like reporting to a woman. Aware of this, the NASA 
official who assembled Collins' crew says he purposely chose 
open-minded men. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins doesn't pay much mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``My attitude toward that stuff is, I will be part of making an  
evolutionary change. And it's going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer McGee Returns After Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- On the night Jerry McGee had malignant  
tumors removed from his mouth and neck, his wife sat with her 
husband until dawn, not sure if he was going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Jill McGee is back at her husband's side, walking  
the course with him as he makes a triumphant return to the Senior 
PGA Tour at the Ameritech Senior Open, less than four months after 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels fantastic,'' McGee said, his voice catching. ``I knew  
it was going to be a very, very emotional week. I don't know how 
many times I've almost broken down out here. I'm definitely happy 
to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee is looking forward to his 56th birthday on Wednesday. He  
hasn't regained the 30 pounds he lost after 6 1/2 weeks of radiation, 
and his stamina is nowhere near what it used to be. He's the first 
to admit his game isn't really ready, and in Friday's first round, 
he shot a 44 on the back nine to finish at 6-over 78. 
</P>
<P>
	But his score doesn't matter. He's alive, and that's better than  
any trophy he could ever win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotional. It was very emotional,'' Jill McGee said after her  
husband's round Friday, tears filling her eyes. ``For the first 
time, I didn't care how he played. I was just glad he made it 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was last winter that McGee felt a lump on the left side of  
his neck, and he knew right away something was wrong. He'd been a 
heavy smoker for 20 years, going through 3 1/2 packs a day before 
quitting eight or nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The first doctor he saw told him the lump wasn't malignant, but  
he wanted to remove it anyway. That didn't feel right to McGee, so 
he went to see Dr. Eugene Myers at the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer, Myers told him on March 17. There were two tumors, the  
one in his neck and another on his tongue, and both needed to be 
removed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee balked, asking if there was any way he could wait until  
November so he could finish the season and keep his spot on the 
all-time money list. The top 70 on the list get priority at 
tournaments, and McGee began the season at No. 53. He's currently 
57th. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Sure, Jerry, we can wait. But you won't be here in  
November,'' McGee said, his eyes widening at the memory. ``It was 
like someone hit me over the head with a sledgehammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 24, McGee had surgery. The tumors were removed, along  
with the lymph nodes on the left side of his neck to prevent the 
cancer from spreading. Then came the radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever had a canker sore? I had like 500 of them,'' he said. ``I  
told my doctor it was strep throat times 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, all he could eat were soft, mushy eggs. He lost his  
saliva glands, and he still can't taste what he's eating. And he 
lost so much weight some friends didn't recognize him when they saw 
him in the locker room this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But within a few weeks, McGee was back on the golf course.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thought of hoping to play again did keep me going, but I  
didn't know if I could,'' he said. ``I thought I would play again 
in my prayers. And I had a lot of people praying. Prayers work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every day, there was a call or a card from a player, PGA  
official, caddie or tournament organizer. McGee and his family were 
overwhelmed by the support, and part of his reason for wanting to 
play this season was to say thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to come back three weeks ago for the Senior Players  
Championship, but his body wasn't ready. He still isn't back to 
full strength, but his return has been a cause for celebration on 
the tour. Several other players on the Senior Tour, including 
Arnold Palmer, have been diagnosed with cancer in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately we're all getting to the stage in life agewise  
where we find out these things,'' said David Graham, co-leader 
after the first round. ``It's great to have him back. ... Whether 
he plays well or not may be irrelevant. It's nice to know one of us 
has come through this so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee can't walk more than a few feet without someone coming  
over to say hello and tell him how good it is to see him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, it's good to see YOU!'' McGee replies.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost too bad it took something this bad to happen to me  
to see all the love in this world,'' he said. ``Every shot I used 
to hit was a life-or-death situation and that's not the way you 
should live life. I think that's why the pro in the sky decided to 
straighten me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer is gone, doctors have told McGee, but he still needs  
checkups every two to three months. And it will be at least five 
years before he can even think about the word ``cure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But each day is a step toward that. And this weekend, well, it's  
just something very, very special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't won yet on the Senior Tour, but this is definitely  
my first victory,'' he said. ``I'm not going to get a trophy, but 
it's definitely a victory.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers' Burnitz Breaks Bone in Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- All-Star outfielder Jeromy Burnitz will be out  
at least three weeks after breaking a bone in his right hand during 
the Brewers' game against Kansas City on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz was hit in the fourth inning by a pitch from the Royals'  
Jose Rosado. He stayed in the game but was replaced by Geoff 
Jenkins in the top of the sixth inning after Milwaukee took a 9-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays revealed a non-displaced fracture of the fifth metacarpal  
bone in his hand. Burnitz's hand was placed in a splint and will be 
reevaluated on Sunday, but the fracture will keep Burnitz out of 
the lineup for at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough break, but we've got some guys who are ready to  
step in there,'' manager Phil Garner said. ``We don't like to lose 
Burnie, but we won't hang our heads and quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers likely will place Burnitz on the 15-day disabled  
list when pitcher Rocky Coppinger, who was acquired from Baltimore 
on Friday, reports to the team. That could be as early as Sunday, 
when the Brewers open a three-game home series against the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz started for the National League in Tuesday's All-Star  
game and hit an RBI double. He also finished second to Ken Griffey 
Jr. in the home run-hitting contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been having another great year, but a lot of guys in our  
lineup are swinging the bat well now,'' Garner said after Milwaukee 
racked up 17 hits in its 11-3 win over the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner said Burnitz will be replaced in the Brewers' starting  
lineup by Alex Ochoa, who hit two home runs Saturday night. Ochoa 
and Jenkins have been splitting time in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz was 0-for-2 with a strikeout Saturday. Burnitz has 26  
home runs and 73 RBIs this season while hitting .275.

<HEADLINE> Mets Minor Leaguer Cleared of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- A New York Mets minor leaguer has been  
cleared of sexual battery charges in the rape trial of a 
17-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	When the not guilty verdict was read in court on Thursday,  
21-year-old Vincente Rosario gave his attorney, Harry Slovis, a 
bear hug and began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario, a former New York City high school star, was the last  
of five Mets minor league players to face trail in the alleged gang 
rape of the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Jose Brea-Tousent, Natividad Tavarez and Milton  
Gonzalez were indicted on sexual battery charges and are each 
serving two-year sentences. In April, the state dropped its case 
against Ruddi De La Cruz after he promised to testify at Rosario's 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 18, testified Rosario forced her to have sex with  
him and several others in a motel room in Port St. Lucie, Fla., 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant State Attorney Steve Levin, who says Rosario planned  
the attack, called on two players to testify Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Cruz, 19, said Rosario called him into the motel room,  
where the girl was naked on the bed with Rosario on one side and 
another player, Tavarez, on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have gone in the room if Rosario hadn't called me  
in,'' De La Cruz said. But he said he thought the girl wanted to 
have sex with him because she never resisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was having normal sex with me,'' De La Cruz said. The  
state dropped charges against him in exchange for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Brea-Tousent testified that he received a phone call in his  
motel room to ``come and see what we have here.'' Brea-Tousent told 
police the caller was Rosario. 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified that he went to the room and had sex with the  
girl. Brea-Tousent said he thought it was consensual sex because 
she motioned with her hand for him to come to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never tried to push me away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Uruguay in Soccer Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Uruguay has earned a reputation as a  
giant-killer on the way to the finals of the Copa America. Now they 
play for the title against the biggest giant of them all: Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In emotion if not technique, Sunday's battle for the South  
American championship is about as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side, perennial favorite Brazil is the odds-on pick to  
repeat as Copa America champs. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time World Cup champions, led by Ronaldo and Rivaldo,  
are undefeated and have 14 goals in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dida, the goalie, has allowed just two goals, fewest in the  
tournament, and has saved a pair of penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay is devoid of international stars and barely sneaked into  
the second round by beating Ecuador after losses to Argentina and 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the youngsters, built around the core of the junior team  
that finished second in the 1997 Under 20 world championship in 
Malaysia, beat host Parguay in the quarterfinals in a shootout, 
then beat Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	For coach Victor Pua, the final is a classic matchup of Brazil's  
``talent and experience'' against his team's ``youth, dreams and 
desire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay has won the Copa America 14 times, including the first  
one in 1916, and is tied with Argentina for the most titles. Brazil 
has won it five times, only once away from home.

<HEADLINE>  JFK Jr. Grew Up in Public Eye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation first met him as the playful boy in  
the Oval Office, the brave little soldier at his father's funeral. 
It watched as he evolved into ``The Hunk,'' a charismatic magazine 
publisher and heir to Camelot, keeper of the family flame. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr., 38, grew up in the public eye, from his sad  
salute at his father's 1963 funeral until his plane disappeared 
Friday night on the way to a family gathering in Massachusetts. For 
many, he has embodied the ``Kennedy mystique'' -- young, 
good-looking, seemingly invulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., as he became known, has been a reluctant icon. He  
eschewed a political career for publishing, and avoided the 
troubles that plagued many of his cousins. His wildest act, at 
least publicly, may have been getting a small shamrock tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
	His appeal transcended generations. His father was voted into  
the White House by the generation that fought World War II. He was 
born while that generation raised its children and for them he 
would always be that little boy, in a blue coat and shorts, 
saluting his father's casket on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	To another generation, he was ``the sexiest man alive'' -- a  
title bestowed on him by People magazine. New York's gossip pages 
simply dubbed him ``The Hunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 190-pound Kennedy dated Daryl Hannah and Madonna,  
becoming an unwilling fixture on the gossip pages. He preferred 
staying out of the spotlight, living a ``normal'' life, hanging out 
with family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Given his lineage, that was often impossible.  
</P>
<P>
	``John, although he didn't wish it himself, was born a star,''  
said a biographer, Wendy Leigh, whose book was titled ``Prince 
Charming.'' Almost from birth, Kennedy was famous mostly for being 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to talk about a legacy or a mystique,''  
Kennedy said in 1993. ``It's my family. The fact that there have 
been difficulties and hardships, or obstacles, makes us closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was born on Nov. 25, 1960, 2 1/2 weeks after his father's  
election as the 35th president. The only child ever born to a 
president-elect, the boy soon became known to the nation as 
``John-John'' -- a name erroneously bestowed on him by a reporter 
who misheard a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in life, he was exposed to the tragedies that seemed to  
endlessly beset his family. A brother, Patrick, was born on Aug. 7, 
1963, but died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 22, 1963, his father and namesake was killed in Dallas.  
The most poignant moment of the Washington funeral came when the 
little boy, too young to fully understand the tragedy, stood 
saluting his father's passing casket outside St. Matthew's 
Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	After his father's murder, his mother Jacqueline moved the  
family to Manhattan, where she raised John and older sister 
Caroline even after her marriage to Greek shipping magnate 
Aristotle Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics,  
although he was constantly questioned about a future in the 
political arena and often mentioned as a candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	A seat was his virtually for the asking when Rep. Ted Weiss died  
in 1992. Weiss represented the strongly Democratic and strongly 
liberal districts on Manhattan's West Side. Kennedy declined to run 
for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike his cousins, he avoided problems with drugs, alcohol  
and the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy showed some talent as an actor, performing in several  
college plays, even making his professional debut at the Irish Arts 
Center playing an Irish teen engaged to his pregnant girlfriend. 
But hopes of an acting career disappeared when his mother turned 
thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy graduated from Brown University in 1983, turning his  
attention to a variety of pursuits: searching for a sunken pirate 
ship off Cape Cod, visiting India for six months, raising funds for 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he introduced his uncle, U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
at the Democratic Convention -- and received a two-minute standing 
ovation. A year later, he graduated from New York University with a 
law degree. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Manhattan district attorney's office the next year  
-- but only after failing the bar twice. ``HUNK FLUNKS,'' read a 
tabloid headline after one of those attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was an attorney, but he was also quite athletic; it  
wasn't unusual for people to see him throwing a Frisbee in Central 
Park or Roller-Blading through Tribeca. After his mother died on 
May 19, 1994, JFK Jr. was photographed Roller-Blading to her 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved sports of all sorts: kayaking, rock climbing, rafting,  
hiking, camping, softball and the family favorite, touch football. 
His adventurous spirit led him to pursue a pilot's license; he 
received it last year, and flew himself to a Labor Day gathering at 
the family's Hyannisport compound. 
</P>
<P>
	As a prosecutor, Kennedy acquitted himself well. He won all six  
of his cases, but he wasn't fulfilled by the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted something quicker,'' a co-worker once said. ``He  
wanted the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He found it in 1995, when he launched the magazine George --  
subtitled ``not just politics as usual.'' Its trademark became 
celebrity covers; the first issue featured Cindy Crawford dressed 
as George Washington, sporting a bra top, white wig and tight 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
	He demonstrated a sense of humor at a news conference announcing  
his project. ``I don't think I've seen as many of you in one 
place,'' he told the assembled reporters, ``since they announced 
the results of my first bar exam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine kept Kennedy in the limelight, and allowed him to  
do a bit of reporting. He interviewed ex-Alabama Gov. George 
Wallace and Mike Tyson, among others. He made headlines when he 
wrote an article criticizing cousins Joe and Michael, who both had 
troubled marriages, as ``poster boys for bad behavior.'' The essay 
was accompanied by a photo of JFK apparently posing in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's bachelor days ended Sept. 21, 1996, when he married  
girlfriend Carolyn Bessette, a onetime publicist for Calvin Klein 
Ltd., in an ultra-secret wedding held on an island off the coast of 
Georgia. His best man, typically, was one of his cousins, Anthony 
Radziwill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy, the tall, blond daughter of a Greenwich,  
Conn., doctor, succeeded where many women had failed in getting JFK 
Jr. to the altar. They have lived quietly in lower Manhattan, doing 
their best to avoid the attention of paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	With the wedding came a fishbowl existence, along with  
inevitable comparisons to her husband's late mother, Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis. The Daily News dubbed Bessette Kennedy ``Camelot's 
New Queen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After their wedding, Kennedy asked the paparazzi to cut his new  
bride a bit of slack. It didn't really work; even a mundane task 
like walking the dog would bring photographers running.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Pay Judges Back Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered the government to  
pay back wages and future cost-of-living increases to him and his 
colleagues under a law ignored for three of the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn also said the failure to  
pay the cost-of-living increases violated the Constitution, which 
says federal judges' compensation ``shall not be diminished during 
their continuance in office.'' The restriction was made part of the 
country's basic law to protect the independence of the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty U.S. District Court judges had filed the suit, and the  
lead plaintiff in the case was Spencer Williams, a senior judge 
from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn's ruling gave no monetary figures on how much was due the  
judges. He ordered the government to calculate raises based on 
allowances given most government employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting the ruling Saturday, The Washington Post said that  
would amount to roughly 10 percent per judge for the years in which 
the government omitted the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Chief Justice William Rehnquist's annual  
salary would rise to $192,500 from $175,400 and the salaries of the 
other eight justices to $184,100 from $167,900. Federal appellate 
judges' salaries would go to $159,100 a year from $145,000, and 
district judges would increase to $150,000 from $136,700 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was the government's interpretation of the 1989 Ethics  
Reform Act which revised the pay system for around 1,000 federal 
judges and other high-ranking government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court concludes that history, precedent and the law can  
lead to only one result,'' Penn wrote in the opinion released 
Thursday. ``The Ethics Reform Act granted federal judges a COLA ... 
effective at the time of the enactment of the act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law established a new review system for judges' salaries.  
But their outside income was severely limited, they were forbidden 
to accept honorariums, and they would receive cost-of-living 
increases when most other federal employees do. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the act, which took effect Jan. 1, 1991, judges received  
increases in 1991-1993 and should have received increases in 1995, 
1996 and 1997. They did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The government relied on a series of consistent opinions by the  
comptroller general that an amendment former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., 
attached to an earlier law continued in effect and would not allow 
increases without specific congressional authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the amendment long had since died. Even if it had not,  
he ruled, the 1989 law specifically overrode it. And, he said, even 
if that were not the case, the amendment was an unconstitutional 
denial of judges' compensation, which the allowances amounted to.

<HEADLINE> Van de Velde Leads Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	All these overworked, overmatched, overwrought pros getting  
their brains beat out at the British Open complain nonstop about 
the Mickey Mouse course and conditions. So guess who turns up atop 
the leaderboard heading into the final round? 
</P>
<P>
	The pro from Disneyland, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	By way of Paris.  
</P>
<P>
	``I test all the rides,'' Frenchman Jean Van de Velde said,  
going along with the gag, ``and walk around with all the 
characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people don't know there are topflight golfers in France,  
let alone a topflight course attached to Disneyland outside Paris. 
And that includes more than a few of Van de Velde's countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that could change by close of light Sunday if the  
33-year-old former Masters champion (that's the Roma Masters, not 
THE Masters) can play one more round nearly as courageously as the 
last two he's already thrown at the devilishly difficult Carnoustie 
Golf Links. 
</P>
<P>
	``What would the reaction back home be?'' someone asked Van de  
Velde. ``Would there be dancing in the streets?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He considered the possibility for the briefest of moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's only 300,000 people playing golf in the country,'' Van  
de Velde said, ``so I hope they will all be in Paris tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is obviously an entertaining man, but he came here to play  
golf, not tell jokes. And besides, there are larger questions to be 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
	First, even starting the final day with a five-stroke lead, can  
Van de Velde stay ahead of a pursuing pack that includes Tiger 
Woods and former British champions Justin Leonard and Greg Norman? 
And if he does, will that victory be regarded as a fluke? 
</P>
<P>
	After all, this is supposed to be the toughest venue of the  
toughest championship in golf, and all five of the previous Open 
champions Carnoustie has produced rank among the game's greatest: 
Tommy Armour (1931); Henry Cotton (1937); Ben Hogan (1953); Gary 
Player (1968); and Tom Watson (1975). 
</P>
<P>
	And considering some of the weird bounces and breaks that have  
been dealt out this week in the wind, rain and rough, there would 
be temptation to write a Van de Velde victory off as nothing more 
than a generous alignment of his planets. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike first-round leader and relative unknown Rodney  
Pampling -- who followed up a 71 with an 86 and was last seen 
booking a flight to Australia after missing the cut -- third-round 
leader and relative unknown Van de Velde has shown real staying 
power. Every time a bogey threatened his momentum Saturday, he 
pulled a birdie out of his hat. That surprised everyone but him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody can beat anybody, and that's the beauty of the  
game,'' he said. ``You're out there and you're playing with Mr. 
Norman or Mr. Woods or whoever and still, at the end of the day, 
you're going to beat them by one'' -- and here Van de Velde paused -- 
``maybe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is a longshot in every sense of the word, a one-time winner  
on the European tour who had to play his way into the Open in a 
qualifying tournament, a kid who grew up in a country that once 
cared as little for golf as the Disney characters Van de Velde now 
works for as a frontman. 
</P>
<P>
	He discovered his life's work as a 6 1/2-year-old, tired of playing  
at the beach where his family vacationed every year, near Biarritz, 
France. He watched golfers walk past the family's summer home and 
nagged his parents to let him play until they finally gave in. 
</P>
<P>
	He had precious few role models. Arnaud Massey, the only  
Frenchman ever to win the British Open, did it 92 years ago. The 
last time one of his countrymen even led this tournament was 1964, 
when Jean Garaialde did before eventually fading to 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder then, that when Van de Velde got serious about the  
game, the man he emulated was the swashbuckling Seve Ballesteros, 
who lived some 100 miles across the border in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	By 20, Van de Velde was good enough to turn pro. Now, more than  
a dozen years later, he has his first chance to set the world on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you tee off here, it's because you deserve to be here.  
That's the first thing. If you believe you can make it through, 
then, you know, it might happen. If you don't, then it never will 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a first time. Even the big guys,'' he said,  
``they had to do it once.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nolan Ryan Speeds Into Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALVIN, Texas (AP) -- A larger-than-life-sized poster of Nolan  
Ryan greets visitors at the museum entrance. A few feet away, he 
describes himself in large red type on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know who I am. I'm a country kid from Texas with the ability  
to throw a ball and the dedication to keep myself in shape. I'm 
just a man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's easily the most understated comment about the soon-to-be  
Hall of Fame pitcher at the Nolan Ryan Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	No one else would dare call him ``just a man.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ryan will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in  
Cooperstown, N.Y., next Sunday. He was elected on his first try, 
making it with the second-highest percentage ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout Texas, Ryan already has been enshrined.  
</P>
<P>
	A section of highway leading into in his hometown of Alvin --  
about 35 miles south of Houston -- is called the Nolan Ryan 
Expressway. The Texas House of Representatives made him an official 
Texas hero in April 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nolan Ryan Historical Foundation built the  
12,000-square-foot Nolan Ryan Center for Continuing Education at 
Alvin Junior College. About one-third of the building, which opened 
in April, is dedicated to the city's most famous resident. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Ryan's prized possessions, his first glove, is among the  
displayed memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember going to Alvin Hardware with my dad and being the  
last of six kids, to pick out, for the first time, anything new for 
myself and it not being a hand-me-down,'' Ryan said. ``I go by that 
display and see that glove and that's one of the things I think 
about. That was a real high spot in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Ryan's favorite memories are from his childhood,  
including when he earned a spot on his first team. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make that team, go out and try out, that was a big event in  
your life,'' Ryan said. ``I look back at that and those days were 
some of my fondest memories in baseball, being on Little League 
teams and just playing the game for the enjoyment of playing and 
feeling no pressure whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guests can tour Ryan's museum while hearing the sounds of  
baseball. Press a button and a different part of Ryan's unmatched 
career will appear on one of six video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	The first video recounts Ryan's early years with the Alvin  
Yellowjackets and when he was discovered by scout Red Murff. 
</P>
<P>
	Other videos recount his career stops with the New York Mets,  
California Angels, Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Familiar quotes about Ryan dot the exhibit walls.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Dave Duncan: ``A good night against Nolan Ryan is going  
0-for-4 and you don't get hit in the head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rickey Henderson, Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim: ``If you  
haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hall of Famer Don Sutton, after watching Ryan's fifth  
no-hitter: ``I'm going to pitch tomorrow with an inferiority 
complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan retired in 1993 with 5,714 strikeouts, seven no-hitters and  
324 victories. The strikeouts and no-hitters are major league 
records -- two of the 53 times his name is in baseball's record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	He has kept busy the last six years, expanding his cattle and  
banking businesses, holding a state office and investing in a minor 
league team. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, fittingly called the Express, will play in Round Rock,  
near Austin. It will be a Class 2A affiliate of the Astros and 
Ryan's oldest son, Reid, will be the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two years I was out of the game I had a real problem  
with the adjustment of not being a player, that change in my 
life,'' Ryan said. ``Now, I've really kind of overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd much rather be introduced as a Hall of Famer than a future  
Hall of Famer. I never was real comfortable with people introducing 
you that way. It's kind of nice to have that behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, though, the competitive fires still flare up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved the opportunity to face Ted Williams, who  
is considered the greatest hitter to ever play the game,'' Ryan 
said. ``I think that would have been a challenge to try to figure 
how to get him out and what would be the proper approach to get him 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A brush-back pitch wouldn't be out of the question, a Ryan  
tactic noted by slugger Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just an intimidator,'' McGwire said. ``He'd knock you  
down in a heartbeat. The thing that made him so nasty was his 
breaking ball. Nobody ever talks about his breaking ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``His breaking ball broke from Arlington to Houston and he threw  
pretty close to 100 mph. It's pretty hard to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Ryan hasn't forgotten those who helped him along  
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	When a Southwest Airlines plane dubbed The Nolan Ryan Express  
takes off for Cooperstown, the passenger list will include Ryan's 
high school coach Jim Watson and Murff, who signed Ryan to his 
first pro contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the highlight of my life in sports,'' Watson said.  
``When we were going through it, we just knew that we had a good 
high school pitcher. We had no idea it would go this far. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only claim to fame with Nolan is that I kept him in shape,  
didn't hurt his arm and made sure he was ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's family -- wife Ruth, sons Reid and Reese and daughter  
Wendy -- also will be making the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said being the son of a famous player made for ``a great  
childhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the fondest memories were summers spent with him on  
the road,'' said Reid, who pitched in college and had a brief minor 
league career. ``A lot of kids went camping with their dads. My 
brother and I just so happened to spend ours in big league parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did things like take batting practice at Fenway or  
Candlestick. My mom never told him to do that. It just shows the 
kind of person he really is, especially as we got older and he had 
to fight with managers to involve us kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went through a lot of stuff to make sure we had a normal  
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murff, who has stayed close to Ryan through the years, is one of  
only a few people who think some of his records will be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't it be fun to be a fly on the wall at some future time  
when a kid comes along and starts breaking Nolan's records?'' Murff 
said. ``I'd like to think that I'll be up there smiling and saying 
`Go for it, kid.'''

<HEADLINE> De Ferran Takes Toronto Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Gil de Ferran won a heated duel with Dario  
Franchitti on Saturday to take the pole position for the Toronto 
Molson Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran, earning his second pole in three races, turned a lap  
in a track record 110.121 mph to bump provisional pole winner 
Franchitti into second with just over 12 minutes remaining in the 
30-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, he upped the mark on the 1.755-mile, 11-turn  
temporary road course tucked between downtown Toronto and Lake 
Ontario to 110.565. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bit of a nailbiting session for us,'' de Ferran said.  
``I did a good lap early and fell to fourth and that wasn't good. 
Then I came in to change to my second set of tires and I stayed for 
a while to think about it a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before de Ferran drove his Walker Racing Reynard-Honda  
onto the track, Franchitti, who won the provisional pole on Friday 
with a lap of 109.023, set a new target at 110.102. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did a pretty good lap and the next time I looked up Gil was  
two tenths faster,'' Franchitti said. ``My only problem in 
qualifying was not being fast enough. But it was a great 
performance by Gil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Franchitti just missed winning his third straight  
Toronto pole, he again showed his ability to get around this track 
in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 26-year-old Scotsman needs to find a way to get to the  
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the last two years, Franchitti has started at the front  
of the 95-lap race only to run into race-ending problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he collided with Bobby Rahal on the start and finished  
26th. Last year, Franchitti was solidly in the lead when his brakes 
gave way and he crashed, relegating him to 20th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just looking for a change of luck,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran could say the me. The 31-year-old Brazilian has never  
finished better than 16th in four races here. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a track where caution flags usually come in bunches and  
passing is often an exercise in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be a normal Toronto race,'' noted five-time winner  
Michael Andretti, who will start third after qualifying at 109.594. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will probably be a yellow come out on that magical lap  
where you have to make a decision whether to come in to pit or 
not,'' Andretti said. ``Depending on the decision, it will probably 
become a fuel conservation race after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Vasser, like Andretti a former series champion, qualified  
fourth at 109.520, followed by Christian Fittipaldi, Andretti's 
teammate and last Sunday's race winner at Road America, at 109.384. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Juan Montoya, Vasser's teammate and the series points  
leader, will start eighth -- his worst qualifying effort since 
starting 15th in Japan, the second race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya's best lap was 108.637, putting him behind last year's  
top rookie, Tony Kanaan, and local favorite Paul Tracy, a native of 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Colombian showed his lack of patience and his  
inexperience Saturday by tearing up both sets of qualifying tires 
in an effort to improve his car's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Montoya heads into Sunday's race with leads of 18 points  
over Andretti, 25 over de Ferran and 28 over Franchitti. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the single point for winning the pole, the race winner  
gets 20 points and leading the most laps is worth one point for a 
maximum of 22 in any race weekend.

<HEADLINE> CIA: Export Controls Slow Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Syria, Libya and some other nations  
aggressively strive to make their own weapons of mass destruction, 
but their progress has been slowed by tight export controls and 
their own inability to fully develop chemical, nuclear or 
biological arms, according to a new CIA report. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Chinese theft of nuclear secrets from the United  
States and worries about proliferation from China have been the 
recent focus of such concerns, the CIA points to Russia as the 
primary supplier of mass destruction weapons and materials, because 
of unreliable export controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's twice-yearly report on developments in proliferation  
of weapons of mass destruction -- this one covering the second half 
of last year -- was submitted to Congress Thursday and made 
available Friday after it was declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea is also aggressively exporting missile technology as  
a key source of hard currency for its strapped economy. But North 
Korea's overall weapons capabilities are far less than those of 
Russia and China. 
</P>
<P>
	And Iraq appears to be providing some technical assistance,  
though no actual materials, to Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries ``of concern'' to the United States that are seeking  
these weapons include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Syria and 
Sudan. Egypt is also seeking to buy technology for improved 
missiles. And India and Pakistan continue to try to improve their 
nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But all of these countries, according to the CIA, depend heavily  
on outside suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside assistance is critical to keeping (Libya's) ballistic  
missile development programs from becoming moribund,'' the CIA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	For Syria, ``Foreign equipment and assistance have been and will  
continue to be essential'' to a solid-fuel rocket program. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan were able to obtain ``only a limited amount''  
of nuclear weapons-related assistance during the second half of 
1998, just after the two longtime enemies rattled the world with a 
series of underground nuclear test explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the report, the emphasis appeared to be on the  
difficulty these countries have had in getting around export 
controls being imposed in China and Russia, the countries the CIA 
identifies as the main sources of mass destruction weapons 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's overall assessment is that China is tightening control  
on export of weapons technology by a growing number of 
quasi-independent development and manufacturing ``entities'' that 
have been difficult to police in recent years. The report indicates 
China is sticking to its export control pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effectiveness, however, of China's nascent nuclear export  
controls is not yet clear; restructuring among oversight entities 
and the defense industries may impede implementation in the near 
term,'' the CIA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, the report cited some ``positive steps'' toward  
weapons export control taken by Moscow under ``intense and 
continuing engagement'' with the Clinton administration, including 
decrees broadening the list of items banned for export and 
increasing government control of Russian companies that make these 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite these decrees, the government's commitment,  
willingness and ability to curb proliferation-related transfers 
remain uncertain,'' the CIA reported. ``Moreover, economic 
conditions in Russia continued to deteriorate, putting more 
pressure on Russian entities to circumvent export controls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report indicates that economics, rather than some grander  
ideological plan, lies behind much of the world's weapons 
proliferation, with Russia and North Korea grappling with troubled 
or failing economies and Iraq hemmed in by embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the improvements being made in export controls, the  
CIA reports, would-be developers of mass destruction arsenals are 
focusing their efforts on buying so-called dual use equipment -- 
civilian nuclear reactors for Iran, chemical production equipment 
for Iraq -- that could be converted to weapons production.

<HEADLINE> Americans in Pakistan Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department says it has received a  
growing body of information strongly suggesting that extremists 
based in Afghanistan are preparing to attack U.S. interests in 
Pakistan in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	In a travel warning, the department on Friday noted that reputed  
international terrorist Osama bin Laden, who is on the FBI's 10 
most wanted list, lives in Afghanistan and has supporters in 
Pakistan. Bin Laden is wanted for bombings of American embassies 
last August in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory also said that groups in Pakistan opposed to any  
Pakistani efforts to de-escalate tensions with India over Kashmir 
have issued threats against Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	One such group, the Harakat-Ul-Muhajideen, recently issued a  
``ban'' on Americans, including diplomats, traveling to the Kashmir 
sector of India, it said, adding that the group has been active on 
both sides of the line of control between India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory warned U.S. citizens to evaluate carefully the  
implications for their security and safety before deciding to 
travel to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	It also urged them to register and obtain updated security  
information at U.S. diplomatic missions in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE>  JFK Jr.'s Wife Made Her Own Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was born to privilege  
and glamour, the beautiful daughter of a Greenwich, Conn., doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	That was nothing compared to life in the Kennedy clan.  
</P>
<P>
	An instant tabloid favorite after she married John F. Kennedy  
Jr., Bessette Kennedy was tailed by paparazzi, gossiped about by 
columnists and compared to her husband's late mother, Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Calvin Klein publicist, 33, joined her husband in the  
jet-set life he knew from birth -- honeymoon in Turkey and the Greek 
islands, dinner at the White House, and, on Friday, a private 
flight to a Cape Cod wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	She wed Kennedy in September, 1996, on Cumberland Island along  
the Georgia coast, in a ceremony so secret that even some family 
members weren't invited. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy's high-school classmates had dubbed her ``The  
Ultimate Beautiful Person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was so stunning, reports had it, that she landed a job at a  
Calvin Klein shop in Boston just by walking down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein himself later hired her to work as a publicist in his New  
York office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News dubbed her ``Camelot's New Queen'' and some  
observers said her grace and elegance put her in a class with Mrs. 
Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is one of those mysterious creatures that understands, on  
some deep level, mystical femininity,'' JFK Jr.'s friend John Perry 
Barlow gushed to New York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is very good at making people feel they are special and  
important, and largely because she means it. It was the same thing 
with Jackie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But life in the spotlight brought pressures as well as  
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	Paparazzi photographed Kennedy and his bride-to-be arguing in  
Central Park in February 1996 -- he reportedly pulled a ring off her 
finger -- and a television newsmagazine aired a videotape of the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy asked paparazzi to give the couple some privacy after  
their wedding, but few heeded his pleas. He lashed out at one 
photographer after a group of paparazzi refused to leave the couple 
alone as they walked their dog near their Tribeca apartment.

<HEADLINE>  JFK Jr.'s Wife Made Her Own Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was born to privilege  
and glamour, the beautiful daughter of a Greenwich, Conn., doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	That was nothing compared to life in the Kennedy clan.  
</P>
<P>
	An instant tabloid favorite after she married John F. Kennedy  
Jr., Bessette Kennedy was tailed by paparazzi, gossiped about by 
columnists and compared to her husband's late mother, Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Calvin Klein publicist, 33, joined her husband in the  
jet-set life he knew from birth -- honeymoon in Turkey and the Greek 
islands, dinner at the White House, and, on Friday, a private 
flight to a Cape Cod wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	She wed Kennedy in September, 1996, on Cumberland Island along  
the Georgia coast, in a ceremony so secret that even some family 
members weren't invited. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy's high-school classmates had dubbed her ``The  
Ultimate Beautiful Person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was so stunning, reports had it, that she landed a job at a  
Calvin Klein shop in Boston just by walking down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein himself later hired her to work as a publicist in his New  
York office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News dubbed her ``Camelot's New Queen'' and some  
observers said her grace and elegance put her in a class with Mrs. 
Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is one of those mysterious creatures that understands, on  
some deep level, mystical femininity,'' JFK Jr.'s friend John Perry 
Barlow gushed to New York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is very good at making people feel they are special and  
important, and largely because she means it. It was the same thing 
with Jackie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But life in the spotlight brought pressures as well as  
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	Paparazzi photographed Kennedy and his bride-to-be arguing in  
Central Park in February 1996 -- he reportedly pulled a ring off her 
finger -- and a television newsmagazine aired a videotape of the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy asked paparazzi to give the couple some privacy after  
their wedding, but few heeded his pleas. He lashed out at one 
photographer after a group of paparazzi refused to leave the couple 
alone as they walked their dog near their Tribeca apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	And speculation about a new Kennedy heir was endless. Every time  
Bessette Kennedy gained an ounce, it seemed, the tabloids had her 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The willowy blond was raised in wealthy Greenwich, Conn., the

<HEADLINE> Africa Trade Bill Headed for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of legislation that would grant  
trade benefits to Africa are optimistic for its chances this year 
after it gained broad bipartisan support in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, designed to spur economic growth and private  
investment in 48 sub-Saharan countries, now goes to the Senate 
after Friday's 234-163 House vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed almost identical legislation last year, but it  
died in the Senate. Some senators based opposition partly on fears 
that the legislation could hurt American textile workers. Others 
opposed it over an unrelated trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the measure's Senate sponsor, said  
the legislation ``encourages a transition from aid to trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a historic opportunity to help integrate African  
countries into the global economy,'' he said. The region, with 700 
million people, now accounts for only 2 percent of U.S. trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would grant duty-free and quota-free treatment to  
many products, particularly textiles and apparel, and promote 
private investment in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for the trade preferences, the countries would have  
to establish and maintain market-driven economies and refrain from 
violating their citizens' human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky called the House  
vote ``a vital step toward promoting further economic growth and 
reform in Africa. ... It is the best opportunity in decades to 
create the right relationship with the Africa of the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the bill came from lawmakers from Southeastern  
textile states and from those who suggested it would benefit large 
multinational corporations at the expense of African sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	Some opponents said they worried that China and other low-wage  
Asian countries would send products to Africa to be relabeled and 
shipped to the United States to avoid duties and tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a national holiday in China when this bill  
passes,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``There's going to be a 
stamp that says `Made in Africa,' but the slave labor will come 
from China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., chairman of the International  
Relations subcommittee on Africa, said any country found to be 
engaging in such so-called transshipment could be removed from the 
program of trade preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said the House vote ``sends a  
strong message to the Senate that the emerging democracies of 
Africa must be included when it comes to U.S. trade policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 434.

<HEADLINE> 4 GOP Presidential Hopefuls in Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Texas Gov. George W. Bush sets  
fund-raising records, four of his Republican opponents are in debt 
months before the first primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Through June 30, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,  
conservative activist Gary Bauer, former Vice President Dan Quayle 
and publisher Steve Forbes all reported owing more money than they 
held in their campaign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer and Quayle are each $500,000 in debt.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bush raised a record $37 million and has $30 million  
in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a millionaire who is largely financing his own campaign,  
can simply write a personal check and pay off his $221,555 debt. 
The other three candidates are in a more precarious position. But 
officials at each campaign say they have a plan for financing their 
efforts until they begin receiving matching funds from the 
government next January. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer and Quayle have met the threshold for receiving the funds,  
collecting $5,000 in contributions of $250 or less in 20 different 
states. Alexander has yet to be certified to receive the federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on what they have raised so far, Bauer is to receive $2.5  
million and Quayle $1.8 million in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have the money required to get out Dan Quayle's  
message of principled conservative leadership,'' Quayle spokesman 
Jonathan Baron said. ``Ultimately, that's what activists care most 
about. There's no question George W. Bush has created an extremely 
tight fund-raising environment, but ultimately ideas will 
triumph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, like Bush, has said he will not accept matching funds,  
freeing him from spending limits the others will have to abide by. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush vacuuming up so much money, it will be even more  
difficult for the other candidates to raise enough to pay their 
debts and continue their campaigns through next winter's Iowa 
caucuses and New Hampshire primary, said Herbert Alexander, 
professor emeritus of political science at the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who know that they're in debt would have to be  
especially dedicated to their candidates to continue at this 
point,'' he said. ``They probably have already hit the cream of 
their support. Now it's going to be harder and harder. Six months 
is an awfully long time to stick in there and accrue even more 
debt. I don't see how a candidate can really do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Sen. John McCain and former American Red  
Cross President Elizabeth Dole both reported having more than 
enough money in the bank to pay off their debts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is another sign that this race is heading toward  
a two-person contest between Governor Bush and Elizabeth Dole,'' 
Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye toward next month's Iowa straw poll, the other  
candidates said they will have enough money to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to do is keep current with our payables and  
continue to raise money,'' said Brian Kennedy, campaign manager for 
Alexander, the former Tennessee governor who earlier laid off staff 
in order to conserve funds. ``We'll be able to fully compete in 
Iowa and New Hampshire and the other early contests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander raised $2.5 million through June 30, and was $143,373  
in debt. At this period four years ago, he had raised three times 
that amount, $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bauer and Quayle are relying heavily on expensive direct  
mail. Quayle spent $1.9 million on fund raising, 57 percent of the 
$3.4 million he has spent on his campaign during the first six 
months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Between April and June, Bauer spent $475,179 on direct mail, his  
largest individual expenditure. He also spent $443,733 on salaries. 
Overall, Bauer spent $2.2 million during the three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign's happening fast now,'' campaign manager Frank  
Cannon said. ``We're actively setting up organizations and hiring 
people. We're competing, and that costs money.''

<P>
	Lines of scattered thunderstorms extended across the Great  
Lakes, the Ohio Valley and the Gulf Coast states on Saturday. 
Temperatures hit record highs in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon, storms and showers were scattered from Texas  
across the Mississippi and Ohio valleys into the Great Lakes, and 
on into eastern Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong storms moved across southeastern Michigan, and funnel  
clouds were reported around the middle of the day over northern 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those stronger storms also spread into parts of Indiana,  
Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New York state. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that rain was expected to move eastward into northern  
New England during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahead of the wet weather, a heat wave covered much of the  
Northeast on Saturday. Harrisburg, Pa., tied its record for the 
date with a high of 100, and Boston tied its record at 98, the 
National Weather Service reported. Temperatures hit records of 97 
at Portland, Maine; Burlington, Vt.; and Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms also developed during the afternoon along the  
coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from southern Texas across Louisiana, 
Mississippi and Alabama into most of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Widely scattered thunderstorms also developed during the  
afternoon along the Appalachians, from Georgia into central 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southwest, showers and a few thunderstorms formed during  
the afternoon across eastern Arizona, wide areas of New Mexico and 
parts of Colorado, with a few areas of rain spreading eastward into 
Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle and northward into Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, an area of locally heavy rain and thunderstorms  
formed over the Dakotas during the afternoon and moved eastward 
toward Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers also moved across western Washington state and from  
northern Utah through Idaho into western Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a  
morning low of 33 at Stanley, Idaho, to the high of 100 Harrisburg, 
Pa. The lowest wind chill was 27 at Sexton, Ore., and the highest

<HEADLINE> Homeless Agency's Funding Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A group that helps homeless people has  
lost federal funding because its application for assistance asks 
too many questions about religion, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	In the application form, Operation Blessing asked whether  
applicants considered themselves saved from eternal damnation 
because they are observant Christians. The agency also asked 
whether people needing aid believed they will go to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
	About two years ago, Operation Blessing applied for and received  
a $50,000 federal grant. It used the money to house, clothe and 
feed the homeless. The group also helped pay utility bills and 
mortgage payments to prevent homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials who manage the grant money informed Operation  
Blessing's officials in May that asking about an applicant's faith 
is considered a violation of federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Group officials wonder why their grant was approved in the first  
place since they provided a sample of the application form. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Blessings board president Martin Rasmussen said the  
message seemed to him to be that ``Christian organizations should 
not work with the government on helping people.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Ruling Allows Late-Term Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- State attorneys say they will appeal a  
federal court ruling that blocks Virginia from enforcing its ban on 
a type of late-term abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert E. Payne on Friday ruled that the ban  
is unconstitutional, saying it is too vague and infringes upon a 
woman's right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Mark L. Earley disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe Virginia's statute is well-reasoned, legally  
sound and crafted narrowly enough to pass constitutional muster,'' 
Earley said. ``It is designed for one purpose: to ban this 
disturbing procedure which, by all accounts, borders on 
infanticide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne issued a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the  
law, which took effect on July 1, 1998, and bans the procedure that 
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the procedure, a doctor delivers part of a fetus, destroys  
it, then removes the dead fetus from the mother's body. The law 
provided an exception to save the life of the mother, but did not 
make any exception to protect the mother's health. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the procedure say it is never medically necessary  
and can be banned without violating court rulings that say women 
have a right to have abortions. Abortion doctors, however, say the 
procedure is sometimes the best option for protecting the health of 
pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the law ``infringes upon the fundamental right to  
choose an abortion because it imposes an undue burden on that right 
and because it contains no health exception and an inadequate life 
exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia and a group of abortion  
providers challenged the law shortly after it was passed. They 
claimed the law was so broad that it could be construed as banning 
many types of conventional abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Violation of the law was a misdemeanor punishable by up to one  
year in jail and a $2,500 fine. A doctor also could lose his 
medical license. 
</P>
<P>
	Bans on the procedure have been blocked or severely limited in  
19 of the 20 states where they have been challenged, the New 
York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy said. Abortion 
providers have appealed a federal judge's decision upholding a ban 
in Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Looms With Prophecies of Doom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The early forecast for the year 2000 calls for colliding comets,  
sinking continents, mass conflagrations, assorted reigns of terror 
and widespread gnashing of teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	As one millennium fades and another looms, prophets of doom and  
gloom are going into overdrive. Would-be oracles claim harbingers 
of The End are everywhere for the looking -- monstrous floods, 
deadly earthquakes, wars, bombs, the AIDS virus and computer 
viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious fervor is ratcheting up among those who believe 2000  
marks the beginning of the end. Israeli officials are already on 
alert for extremists seeking front-row seats for Christ's second 
coming. The World Wide Web is peppered with sites predicting all 
manner of Earthly ends, ranging from simple planetary destruction 
to space warps. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly supermarket tabloid Sun summed up the millennial  
mania in a front-page teaser: ``Exact date of Judgment Day -- Are 
you prepared?'' 
</P>
<P>
	No? Take solace, then, in the fact that predictions of  
civilization's demise have been around since civilization's birth. 
Ancient Greek Stoics spoke of the Earth being cleansed by fire. 
Long-ago Hindu writings describe a cycle of cosmic ends and 
rebirths. Europeans in the Middle Ages considered plagues and 
famines early portents of coming disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last century, thousands of believers across New York and  
New England left crops unharvested or gave away cattle after 
farmer-turned-preacher William Miller predicted Christ was coming 
the evening of Oct. 22, 1844. When the fateful night proved less 
than fateful, believers ridiculed Miller's prediction as the 
``Great Disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Christians continue to pin precise dates on Biblical  
prophecies, particularly those from the New Testament's Book of 
Revelation. The book, based on the apostle John's visions of the 
final judgment, is chock-full of horrific detail: men gnawing their 
tongues in agony, rivers of blood, lakes of fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Revelation remains a touchstone for much of Western apocalyptic  
thought, but not the only one. A sampler of doomsday scenarios: 

</P>
<P>
                          	 *NOSTRADAMUS   	
</P>
<P>
	PREDICTION: The 16th century French soothsayer, whose  
predictions still show up in supermarket tabloids, supposedly 
foretold such events as the French Revolution and the rise of 
Hitler -- in quatrains no less. One prediction: 
</P>
<P>
	``In the year 1999 and seven months,  
</P>
<P>
	From the skies will come a Great King of Terror.  
</P>
<P>
	He will bring back to life the King of the Mongols,  
</P>
<P>
	Before and after the war reigns.''  
</P>
<P>
	Who is this terrible king? And is he due this month or in July  
2000? Some interpreters say he is a comet or meteor. Others 
interpret the prediction to mean vast war. 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND OPINION: Many of Nostradamus' vaguely worded predictions  
have been hailed for accuracy -- after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the Rorschach ink blot test,'' says Paul Kurtz,  
chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of 
Claims of the Paranormal, located in Amherst, N.Y., outside 
Buffalo. ``You can read into it what you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider this partial verse that supposedly predicted the rise  
of Hitler: 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of the deepest part of the west of Europe;  
</P>
<P>
	From poor people a young child shall be born;  
</P>
<P>
	Who with his tongue shall seduce many people ...''  

</P>
<P>
                          	 *EDGAR CAYCE   	
</P>
<P>
	PREDICTION: The ``sleeping psychic'' from Kentucky put himself  
into hypnotic trances then tuned in telepathically to the minds and 
bodies of faraway people, diagnosed ills and prescribed remedies. 
He also looked into the future: Look for severe weather disruptions 
and worldwide chaos when the Earth's poles ``shift'' in 2000 or 
2001, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND OPINION:   	
</P>
<P>
	Cayce, who died in 1945, also predicted that 1958-98 would be a  
time of earthly tumult, with parts of continents tumbling into the 
seas. Even Cayce's grandson, Charles Thomas Cayce, president of the 
Edgar Cayce Foundation in Virginia, concedes his grandfather's 
forte was distant diagnosis rather than prophesizing doom. 

</P>
<P>
                         	 *LADY OF FATIMA   	
</P>
<P>
	PREDICTION: According to many accounts, the Blessed Mother  
revealed herself to three Portuguese children at Fatima in 1917 and 
told them World War I would end soon but be followed by a second 
war. She then revealed three secrets, including a vision of hell 
and the need for religious devotion. The third secret was sealed 
until 1960, when Pope John XXIII read it and promptly fainted, the 
stories say. He had it resealed. 
</P>
<P>
	A common belief is that the third secret predicted the end of  
the world -- soon -- and that the Vatican keeps it secret for fear it 
would demoralize the masses. 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND OPINION: The Catholic Church never officially sanctioned  
the Fatima story, although some in the church hierarchy give it 
credence, says Father James Wiseman, associate professor of 
theology at Catholic University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there a third secret? Wiseman says if there is, it's likely  
to remain that way. 

</P>
<P>
                         	 *DOOMSDAY CLOCK   	
</P>
<P>
	PREDICTION: The Doomsday Clock, published sporadically in the  
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, was set in 1947 at seven minutes 
to midnight to represent the impending danger of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The clock became a prime indicator of the Cold War, the minute  
hand nudging perilously close to midnight when East-West tensions 
heated up. 
</P>
<P>
	Why seven minutes? The clock was designed by a Chicago artist  
married to one of the founding physicists, Alexander Langsdorf. She 
explained the placement of the hands as ``just good design.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND OPINION: The Doomsday Clock was designed with a fail-safe  
feature -- a minute hand that backs up when nuclear tensions ease. 
The scientists rigged their clock so their hypothesis could never 
be proved wrong. The current time is nine minutes to midnight. 

</P>
<P>
                         	 *THE QUICKENING   	
</P>
<P>
	PREDICTION: Definitions of this New Age concept vary, but it's  
easiest to think of it as humanity moving beyond its increasingly 
grim reality to a more spiritual plain. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs that the Quickening is coming, according to adherents,  
include outbreaks of the Ebola virus, a planetary alignment in May 
2000, Hopi Indian prophecies and a purported growth in alien 
abductions. Unfortunately, the Quickening may also be preceded by 
rising oceans and sinking continents. 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND OPINION: Jon Roe, publisher of a New Age magazine called  
the Door Opener, says he's seen numerous apocalyptic predictions 
come and go. One common explanation after prophecies flop is that 
the changes took place just as predicted, but on a ``spiritual'' or 
``energy'' level instead of a physical level, he says. That, of 
course, makes prophecies hard to check out. 

</P>
<P>
	Another complication is that target dates gets squishy as many  
of the prophesized doomsday events draw near. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent hot topic in New Age circles, for instance, was not the  
pending turn of the millennium but the approaching end of a roughly 
5,000-year cycle in the Mayan calendar. That comes in about 13 
years, supposedly to be accompanied by a huge flood or a similar 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Roe, ``People are beginning to predict that 2012 is more  
important.''

<HEADLINE> PBS Contributor List Flap Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The controversy over political contributor  
list-swapping at public broadcasting stations is growing, with a 
congressional hearing scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be facing just the tip of the iceberg,'' Ken Johnson,  
spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said documents indicate public television stations KQED  
in San Francisco and KCET in Los Angeles and public radio station 
WNYC in New York have provided their donor lists to brokers who, in 
turn, may have provided them to the Democratic Party or other 
political organizations. He would not release the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, three other television stations, WGBH-TV in Boston,  
WNET in New York and WETA in Washington, D.C., are under scrutiny. 
Also, KERA, a television-radio PBS combination in Dallas, admitted 
Friday it had provided lists to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, chairman of the House Commerce telecommunications  
subcommittee, has scheduled a hearing on the matter Tuesday. Rep. 
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., has requested a separate hearing by 
Commerce's oversight subcommittee, which has investigative 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin plans to ask for a study by the General Accounting  
Office, Congress' investigative arm, into whether list-swapping 
occurred at other stations or involved individual candidates as 
well as parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a political witch hunt,'' Johnson said. ``If it  
turns out that Republicans have engaged in the same activities, 
we'll take them out to the woodshed too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the controversy, Republicans have also demanded  
a review of federal funding for public broadcasting. The 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets about $250 million a year 
from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether public broadcasting stations violated  
federal tax law by swapping, selling, renting or otherwise 
providing their donor lists to political parties. There is 
typically a three-year statute of limitations on such violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although sharing membership lists is a legitimate business  
practice done daily by countless organizations, the CPB is a 
private, nonprofit entity that's considered a charity for tax 
purposes. As such, it is prohibited from direct or indirect 
intervention in political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing a donor list to a political party or candidate  
wouldn't necessarily constitute an improper intervention, as long 
as all political parties or candidates were given equal access to 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurel Lambert, KCET's director of advertising and promotions,  
said the station prohibits providing membership lists to political 
organizations. However, the reverse -- the station's buying names 
from both the Democratic and Republican parties -- has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers, Lambert said, are also told to get station approval for  
any new membership list requests. So far, a search of station 
records hasn't turned up any violations dating back to 1996, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At WNYC, there is also a ban on sharing, selling or renting  
membership lists to political organizations, according to statement 
released by the station late Friday. Tad Roebuck, a spokesman, said 
he didn't know if the station provided lists to brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	At KQED, the station reviewed its records and found that a  
membership list was leased, through a broker, to the Democratic 
National Committee in 1996, said David Shaw, a spokesman. Shaw said 
the station's policy was to exchange lists, one-for-one, with other 
nonprofits, but that is now being revised to excluded exchanges 
with advocacy and political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	At WGBH, where names have been swapped with the Democratic  
National Committee, officials said they instituted a policy against 
trading names with political organizations in 1994 but continued 
after that because of a ``debt'' incurred by a 1993 list 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	After that was resolved, subsequent swapping occurred because of  
administrative error, they said. Officials said they admitted the 
mistake to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, WNET said it had started an internal investigation  
after learning a list broker working for the station had swapped 
names with the Democratic and Republican parties. 
</P>
<P>
	WETA spokeswoman Cecily Van Praagh said the station traded donor  
lists with the DNC and ``conservative and liberal'' political 
organizations. The station planned to re-evaluate the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	KERA spokeswoman Sharon Philippart said the station discontinued  
the list swapping about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the DNC, said the committee  
obtained the WGBH names through a broker. She said the committee 
always goes through brokers and does not deal directly with 
individual stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are standard and routine business practices,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Nude Portrait in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Easily embarrassed residents of lower Manhattan  
should keep their curtains closed Sunday morning. The more curious 
might peek outside at dawn to catch sight of 100 nude bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled Friday that an outdoor portrait of the  
naked models qualifies as art, and rejected city attempts to block 
a photographer from taking the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The privacy interests of the residents of this neighborhood  
who can avert their eyes cannot outweigh the rights of others to 
exercise their First Amendment right to artistic expression,'' said 
U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided in favor of photographer Spencer Tunick, finding that  
artistic nude photography is expression protected by the First 
Amendment as well as New York state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Baer said artistic nude photography is ``comparable to nudity as  
part of a performance, show or exhibition,'' all of which are 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge added that the fact that the photograph will be taken  
at 5:30 a.m. means it will not threaten the privacy rights of the 
block's residents or present overwhelming concerns for traffic or 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Tunick said he was pleased with the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly think the body can be used by an artist as an art  
object, not as a sexual object,'' he said. ``Someone walking down 
the street should be able to differentiate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrill Kurland, a lawyer for the city, said she will appeal,  
though Baer refused to stay his written opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes in the past, Tunick did his work without complaint  
from the police, but recently he has been threatened with arrest. 
As a result, he filed a lawsuit earlier this week in federal court 
in Manhattan seeking protection on First Amendment grounds.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Might Reduce Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans may reduce their proposed  
$864 billion tax cut by nearly $72 billion, partly because of 
tricky Senate budget rules and partly to appease rebellious 
moderates in their own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides said Friday that the plan adopted this week by  
the Ways and Means Committee may be scaled back to $792 billion 
over 10 years, the same level as a proposal offered by Sen. William 
Roth, R-Del. 
</P>
<P>
	One key reason, the aides said, is that Senate budget rules  
apparently will only allow a tax cut of the larger size to pass the 
Senate with a simple majority. If the House sent over a large cut, 
it may require approval of 60 of the 100 senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to getting as big a bill as possible,'' said  
Trent Duffy, spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee chairman, 
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas. ``This is being realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with a slender majority and Democrats solidly opposed,  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., met with about a dozen GOP 
moderates who have objected that the House tax cut is much too 
large. A GOP aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the lower 
figure may help bring the moderates on board so the bill can clear 
the House next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans and Democrats outlined competing  
plans Friday that are some $500 billion apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, called his plan an  
effort to ``work in a bipartisan spirit'' by targeting income tax 
cuts at middle-class people, broad expansion of individual 
retirement accounts and 401(k)s and omission of cuts in capital 
gains taxes or repeal of estate taxes as sought by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic that we will have some Democratic support,''  
Roth said. ``It embodies objectives shared by Republicans, 
Democrats and the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, however, has repeatedly said he will veto any  
tax cut of the size proposed by congressional Republicans. Clinton 
contends it will crowd out money from the $2.9 trillion, 10-year 
surplus he says is needed to ensure the survival of Social Security 
and Medicare and prevent deep cuts in defense and domestic 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything in the $800 billion range fails to meet the  
president's test of doing first things first,'' said Linda Ricci, 
spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed cuts of about $250 billion over 10 years,  
including new government-sponsored retirement investment accounts 
that would supplement Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	In an early effort at compromise, Senate Democrats proposed  
splitting the surplus not set aside for Social Security -- an 
estimated $996 billion -- into thirds: one for Medicare, one for net 
tax cuts of $295 billion and one for increased spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unwise to enact into law permanent, huge tax cuts  
based simply on projections of surpluses,'' said Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan of New York, senior Democrat on the Finance 
Committee. ``If we enact into law huge tax cuts, a relatively minor 
economic change would push the budget back into deficit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic tax plan would most benefit the middle class by  
raising the standard income tax deduction by 2007 from $7,200 now 
to $11,550 for a married couple and from $4,300 to $5,600 for 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also benefit two-earner married couples by allowing  
them a new itemized deduction of up to $4,340, if they earn below 
$95,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, however, say the surplus is so large that bigger  
tax cuts are possible. Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob 
Kerrey of Nebraska may offer an alternative in the $500 billion 
range when the Finance Committee begins work on the tax cut next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic tax cut is too small and the Republican tax cut  
is too big,'' Breaux said. ``There should be some figure in 
between.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman Accused of Pinching Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A Las Vegas Hilton cocktail waitress has filed  
a federal lawsuit against her employer and basketball star Dennis 
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Chapa accuses the former Chicago Bulls star of pinching  
and grabbing her breasts while he was seated at a gambling table in 
June 1998. She filed the suit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapa is the fourth woman to accuse Rodman, 37, of such behavior  
at the resort last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapa, 59, also named Hilton in the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hilton tolerates Rodman's behavior because Hilton desires  
Rodman's business,'' her lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton spokesman Alan Hopper declined to comment on the  
allegations. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr.'s Plane Reported Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MATTITUCK, N.Y. (AP) -- An intensive search was under way today  
for John F. Kennedy Jr., whose small plane was missing en route to 
a family wedding in Massachusetts. The only son of the 35th 
president was traveling with his wife and sister-in-law, the Coast 
Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Piper Saratoga took off from Essex Airport in Caldwell,  
N.J., at 8:45 p.m. Friday and was heading to the Cape Cod-Martha's 
Vineyard area en route to a wedding today in Hyannisport, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers were due to arrive in Martha's Vineyard at 10  
p.m. Friday, but never arrived, a source in Washington told The 
Associated Press. The plane carried Kennedy, 38, his wife Carolyn 
Bessette, and her sister, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under hot, hazy skies, Coast Guard crews scoured a 150-mile-long  
swath of sea today from eastern Long Island to Cape Cod, along the 
presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane. Assisting were Civil Air 
Patrol forces from five states -- Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Government sources said an emergency beeper signal was received  
at about 2:15 a.m. today off Long Island, and rescue crews were 
sent to the area off Mattituck. No subsequent signal was heard. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to Coast Guard Lt. Craig Jaramillo, the plane was  
last detected on radar just miles west of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who is spending the weekend at Camp David in  
western Maryland, was told about the disappearance of the Kennedy 
plane by John Podesta, his chief of staff, shortly after 7 a.m. 
Saturday, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president called several members of the Kennedy family,  
including Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; John Kennedy Jr.'s sister, 
Caroline; and Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, husband of Kerry 
Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton was informed early this morning of the  
reported disappearance of the airplane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr. 
and others, including his wife, Carolyn,'' the White House 
statement said. ``All our prayers and thoughts are with the 
families of those on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Gaspar, an operations specialist at Martha's Vineyard  
Airport, said Kennedy's plane was supposed to arrive Friday night, 
but never did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little worried, because I know him personally,'' Gaspar  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was headed for Martha's Vineyard and was then to go to  
the wedding of a cousin, Rory, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy, in Hyannisport. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Martin, of Hyannisport, who described himself as a friend  
of the family, said the plane was stopping in Martha's Vineyard to 
drop off Carolyn's sister, Lauren, before Kennedy and his wife 
continued on to Hyannisport. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an earlier announcement from the office of U.S.  
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the couple was to be married today 
before 275 guests in a private ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedding was postponed indefinitely and family members were  
sequestered in the family's Hyannisport compound, said Brian 
O'Connor, a spokesman for Joseph P. Kennedy II, the former 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	With word of the missing plane, Cape Cod residents began  
arriving outside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be the most incredibly painful thing,'' said Sarah  
Wood, a neighbor.''This family has been through so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source familiar with the search told the AP that the Kennedy  
plane had no flight plan, to the knowledge of the Federal Aviation 
Administration, though the pilot was not required to file one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy family contacted the FAA when the plane, a Piper  
Saratoga, was overdue, and the agency began checking airports along 
the route, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard and Air National Guard then started a search.  
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy is the only surviving son of the 35th president, and was  
born Nov. 25, 1960, just 2 1/2 weeks after his father was elected 
president. As a toddler, he charmed the nation when he was 
photographed romping in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after his father's assassination, he saluted as his  
father's funeral procession passed, and the photograph became one 
of the most poignant images of that tragic time. It was the little 
boy's third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics.  
After graduating from Brown University, he went to law school and 
joined the Manhattan district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The law didn't hold much appeal for Kennedy, and in 1995 he  
launched the magazine George -- subtitled ``not just politics as 
usual.'' A year later, Kennedy -- once dubbed ``the sexiest man 
alive'' by People magazine -- married girlfriend Carolyn Bessette, a 
30-year-old public relations specialist at Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	They wed in a private ceremony with only a few dozen guests in a  
small Baptist church on secluded Cumberland Island off the Georgia 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other son born to President Kennedy was Patrick Bouvier  
Kennedy, born five weeks premature on Aug. 7, 1963. He died three 
days later. A daughter, Caroline, was born in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years ago Sunday, a car driven by Kennedy's uncle, Sen.  
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., plunged off a bridge and into water on 
Chappaquiddick Island near Martha's Vineyard. A passenger in the 
car, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, was found dead in the car's back 
seat about 10 hours later.

<HEADLINE> Company Hurt by Surgeons' Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new type of super glue that closes skin  
lacerations and surgical incisions isn't catching on with doctors 
as quickly as once hoped, leaving the manufacturer with a deep 
wound of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Raleigh, N.C.-based Closure Medical Corp. fell 36  
percent Friday after it disclosed that its distributor, Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson, was cutting back orders for the glue, sold under the name 
Dermabond. Closure on Friday dropped $10.25 to $18 in Nasdaq Stock 
Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J spokeswoman Susan Odenthal said doctors need more training  
to know how and when to use the glue instead of traditional 
sutures, and that has slowed demand for the Dermabond. J&AMP;J still 
believes Dermabond will eventually obtain a major portion of the 
wound-care market, partly because it eliminates the need for an 
injection of anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the earliest assumptions at the pace that this would  
become established may have been more ambitious than it turned out 
to be,'' Odenthal said. ``It takes a while for doctors to become 
comfortable with (Dermabond) 
</P>
<P>
	Closure, whose primary product is Dermabond, on Thursday  
reported a second-quarter profit was $15,000, compared to a a loss 
of $2.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales rose to $4.28 
million from $1.34 million in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Dermabond has been stocked in about 80 percent of hospital  
emergency room departments, Odenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dermabond costs about $25 per application, which is more than  
traditional stitches. It must be administered by doctors and is not 
available for consumer purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has argued the product saves money because it saves  
time for the doctors. Officials from Closure would not return calls 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dermabond contains a variation of the chemical used in Super  
Glue. It quickly forms a flexible film over the wound that 
gradually wears off as new skin cells grow beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dermabond is intended to replace stitches in skin-deep cuts. It  
is for topical use only -- not for deep wounds under the skin. For 
larger wounds, doctors still need to use small sutures beneath the 
skin surface.

	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- An intensive search was under way today

	ASUNCION, Paraguay, (AP) -- Miguel Zepeda's goal in the 87th  
minute gave Mexico a 2-1 victory over Chile on Saturday in the 
third-place game of the Copa America soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico opened the scoring in the 25th minute on a play crafted  
by attacker Luis Hernandez. He broke up the left side and fired a 
shot that goalie Marcelo Ramirez couldn't control. The rebound went 
out to Francisco Palencia, who tapped it in for a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico came out swarming in the second half, but it was Chile  
that scored the equalizer in the 80th minute. Raul Palacios stole 
the ball, worked a give-and-go with Jose Luis Sierra and eluded 
Mexican goalie Jorge Campos to make it 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	With three minutes left, Hernandez set up the game winner,  
feeding Zepeda for the easy score.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Co. Charged in Iran Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A high-tech company that makes equipment  
to diagnose computer problems has been indicted by a federal grand 
jury on charges it violated a 1995 Clinton administration trade 
embargo on selling computer equipment to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Microtek International Development Systems, a division of  
Microtek International of Taiwan, manufactures computer-processor 
emulators, which mimic the operation of computer chips at a slower 
speed so operators can troubleshoot problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1997, Joe-Pin Ouyang, president of the Hillsboro  
division, began negotiating the sale of emulators to a company in 
Tehran, according to the indictment, which was unsealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amir Janversan, an Iranian citizen, and Hamid Janversan of Salt  
Lake City, were charged because they acted as brokers between the 
Iranian buyer and Ouyang and Microtek, the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
	It claims that in October 1997, more than $100,000 was wired  
from Switzerland and Italy to two credit union accounts in Utah 
controlled by the Janversans, an attempt to hide the identity of 
the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Customs agents at Portland International Airport seized the  
emulators Oct. 30, 1997, after an investigation by FBI, Customs and 
Commerce Department agents, said Charles Gorder, an assistant U.S. 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment charges Microtek, Ouyang and the Janversans with  
conspiracy, attempting to violate the embargo and money laundering. 
Each defendant could face a maximum of 35 years in prison if 
convicted of all three counts. And Microtek could face fines of as 
much as $1 million, in addition to forfeiting $75,125 it received 
during the alleged illegal transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the company, George Newhouse of Los Angeles, said  
he could not discuss details of the case, but he denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company can say that it has cooperated with the government  
in every respect from the very beginning and is extremely 
disappointed by the decision of the grand jury to proceed with an 
indictment,'' Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The export laws are very complicated, and the company and its  
president, Joe-Pin Ouyang, feel they will be completely vindicated 
at trial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microtek, Ouyang and Hamid Janversan are scheduled to be  
arraigned in federal court in Portland July 30. An arrest warrant 
has been issued for Amir Janversan, who is thought to be in Iran, 
Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Reese, a Portland attorney for Hamid Janversan, said ``he  
believes he will be completely exonerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Clinton administration imposed the trade embargo  
against Iran after finding it was a threat to U.S. security by 
supporting international terrorists, undermining the Middle East 
peace effort and trying to buy weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Dole Calls for Farm Relief Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole  
called Saturday for a farm disaster relief package larger than the 
$6 billion approved by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get this cash to them now, there are real problems  
in agriculture today,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening her latest campaign swing, Mrs. Dole became the latest  
candidate to focus on a struggling farm economy that's important in 
Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the presidential nominating 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	While most sectors of the economy have been humming along well  
and the stock market has soared, farmers have been struggling with 
historically low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers are worried that a bumper crop is maturing in the  
fields, but the price farmers will likely get is less than the cost 
of producing the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to need another supplemental to assist our farmers  
and this is going to have to be larger than the funding that was 
provided last year because this is the second year now that farmers 
have been hit with low prices,'' said Mrs. Dole, who has served as 
Labor secretary and Transportation secretary in Republican 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said commodity prices have been driven down by a big  
supply, but also because the economic crisis in Asia has driven 
down demand in that region. 
</P>
<P>
	She argued for immediate cash aid for farmers, and said  
long-term assistance would come by more aggressively seeking to pry 
open foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also should make the whole western hemisphere a free trade  
zone,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a big debate in the Republican Party over China policy.  
Social conservatives take a hostile stance toward China, arguing 
its a rising threat. Others argue it's a giant market to be 
exploited. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole suggested a middle ground, pushing China on human  
rights and other issues while seeking to expand trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has 20 percent of the world's population,'' Mrs. Dole  
said. ``On a separate track we can negotiate with them to expand 
our trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In focusing on farming, Mrs. Dole argued she's been the most  
specific and has the longest track record, including a husband who 
spent more than three decades in Congress dealing with farm issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'd be a good adviser on agriculture,'' Mrs. Dole  
said. ``We were out there early with our farm program.''

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers To Receive $100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Struggling hog farmers next month will begin  
to receive $100 million in aid from the government to help offset 
low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments, capped at $5,000 per hog operation, are in  
addition to $50 million in assistance given to hog farmers earlier 
this year as they suffered through their lowest prices in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current farm crisis has been disastrous for small hog  
producers, so this additional assistance is really needed,'' Vice 
President Al Gore said in a statement Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has  
been actively courting the farm vote for several months and making 
various agriculture related announcements for the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sign-up for the new round of assistance is set to begin Aug. 9  
and is aimed at small- and medium-sized hog operations that sold 
less than 2,500 hogs. Hog farmers who received the earlier payments 
will automatically get the new payment and are not required to 
reapply or fill out additional paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligible producers will receive $10 per slaughter-weight hog  
marketed during the last six months of 1998 on up to 500 market 
hogs. Hog farmers who received payments under the earlier 
disbursement would receive a pro-rated amount to bring their total 
payment amount to $10 per slaughter-weight.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rep. Forbes Joining Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUOGUE, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Michael Forbes, a New Yorker with a  
strong independent streak, said today he is bolting a Republican 
Party that has become ``a captive of extremists'' so he can join a 
more open Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party over the last 4 1/2 years has been defined  
through the actions of its extremists in the House of 
Representatives,'' Forbes said in announcing his decision at a news 
conference at his Long Island, N.Y., home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become an angry, narrow-minded, intolerant and uncaring  
majority, incapable of governing at all, much less from the center, 
and tone-deaf to the concerns of a vast majority of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he talked over his decision in a personal, private  
meeting and also met with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. An 
aide said Hastert tried to persuade Forbes to stay in the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton welcomed the new Democrat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Forbes has changed parties because he believes it is  
best for his constituents, for the people of New York and for our 
country,'' Clinton said in a statement. ``He is joining a party 
that welcomes independent thinking and the courage to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A switch would provide a huge psychological boost for Democrats,  
who need to gain only a half-dozen seats in next year's elections 
to be assured of winning control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, 47, defeated a Democrat in 1994 to win his seat, one of  
more than 70 GOP first-termers who helped usher in a Republican 
majority in the House for the first time in 40 years. He was 
rewarded with a prized seat on the Appropriations Committee, a 
panel with enormous influence over federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes supported the Contract With America in 1995, and has  
carved out a generally conservative voting record, opposing 
abortion and voting in 1996 to repeal the ban on certain 
semiautomatic assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he voted in favor of all four impeachment charges  
brought against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he has sided with environmentalists on some  
issues, and voted to raise the minimum wage in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He infuriated the GOP leadership in 1997 when he refused to vote  
for former Rep. Newt Gingrich's re-election as speaker, citing 
concerns over a just-completed ethics investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	His defection on that vote was followed by a snub from party  
regulars, who promptly disinvited him from a dinner honoring 
outgoing Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1998, though, Forbes' stock in the House GOP moved up  
sharply, the result of his close ties to Rep. Bob Livingston, the 
Louisiana Republican who was briefly in line to succeed Gingrich as 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' standing plummeted overnight when Livingston renounced  
the speakership after admitting to past extra-marital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He would be the first congressional Republican to switch to the  
Democrats since the GOP gained a majority in both the House and 
Senate six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold 223 seats in the House; Democrats have 210.  
There is one independent and one vacancy following the death on 
Thursday of California Democratic Rep. George Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Five House Democrats switched to the GOP in 1995, and two  
Democratic senators have done likewise in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is the second Republican to leave his party in less than  
a week. On Wednesday, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., running at the back 
of the pack in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, became 
an independent.

	Debris From Kennedy Plane Found  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- The search is continuing for John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister who disappeared last night 
while flying to Martha's Vineyard. The couple was heading to a 
family wedding in Hyannisport after dropping off Mrs. Kennedy's 
sister on the Vineyard. At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah,''some 
luggage,'' a wheel, a headrest and part of a plane support had 
washed up, said Coast Guard Lt. Craig Jaramillo. However, Rear 
Admiral Richard M. Larrabee said the search would continue. ``I can 
tell you miraculous stories of people surviving,'' he said.

	OLD GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- The family of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s  
wife and sister-in-law gathered at their home here today, as 
searchers looked for the small plane the three disappeared in over 
the Atlantic. Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33; her older sister, 
Lauren Bessette and Kennedy were en route from Fairfield, N.J. to a 
Kennedy cousin's wedding when they vanished from radar last night. 
Richard Freeman, the sisters' stepfather, declined to comment.

	Overpumping Affects Food Supply  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overpumping is sucking out too much of the  
world's underground fresh water, with a stable world food supply 
now dependent on an increasing global water deficit, Worldwatch 
Institute said today. Annually, the study estimates, 160 billion 
cubic meters of water is lost to thirsty cities and farms that are 
not returning it to underground aquifers. The biggest known losses 
are in India, China, the United States, North Africa and Saudi 
Arabia. The lost water would be enough to grow 10 percent of world 
grain, said Worldwatch, a nongovernment research group funded by 
grants and sales of its publications.

	Palestinians Protest Water Shortage  
</P>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Several hundred Palestinians burned  
tires and chanted during a protest today over a water shortage in 
the West Bank. The protesters who blocked the road leading to the 
Deheishe refugee camp with flaming tires said they blamed Israel, 
and not the Palestinian Authority that controls their area, for the 
acute water shortage. Israel controls 80 percent of the aquifers in 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians control the 
rest.

	GOP Rep. Forbes Joining Democrats  
</P>
<P>
	QUOGUE, N.Y. (AP) -- A Republican switched allegiance to the  
Democrats today, the first such defection since the GOP took 
control of Congress five years ago. Rep. Michael Forbes drew praise 
from President Clinton for having the ``courage to change'' and 
scorn from the GOP for placing ``ego ahead of principle.'' 
Republicans will now hold 222 seats in the 435-member House, with 
211 Democrats and an independent who usually votes with the 
Democrats. One seat is vacant.

25-year-old western lowland gorilla, is expecting. The baby, 
Rosie's eighth, is due in November. It will be Cincinnati's 47th

	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- A 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th  
gave Jean Van de Velde a round of even-par 70 today and put him in 
a remarkable position -- the only player not over par, a five-stroke 
lead and a chance to become the first qualifier to win the British 
Open since 1962. Only three players broke par in the third round, 
led by the best score of the tournament. Justin Leonard and Craig 
Parry were five behind Van de Velde at 218.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kevin Young and Al Martin each homered twice  
and the Pittsburgh Pirates again turned to big innings to beat the 
Cleveland Indians at their own game, winning 13-10 today. Young 
matched a career high with five RBIs on a two-run homer following 
Martin's two-run shot in the fourth and a three-run drive off 
reliever Steve Reed in the sixth. The second Young homer made it 
11-6 after the Indians had cut Pittsburgh's 7-2 lead to 7-6.

<HEADLINE> Smooth Player Wins Hollywood Oaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Smooth Player beat favored Excellent  
Meeting by a half-length on Saturday in the $150,000 Hollywood Oaks 
at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, the 13-1 longshot alternated on  
the early lead of the 1 1/8-mile stake, then withstood the closing bid 
of Excellent Meeting and jockey Kent Desormeaux while running the 
distance in 1:48. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-5 favorite, Excellent Meeting was pinned along the rail  
turning for home, managing to break free at the eighth pole. By 
that time, however, Smooth Player was two lengths ahead and 
Excellent Meeting was unable to make up the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nany's Sweep, who battled Smooth Player for the lead, wound up  
four lengths behind Excellent Meeting in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Smooth Player won $90,000, boosting her career earnings for  
owner John Spohler and Marty and Pam Wygod to $223,000. She has won 
five of eight starts, with one second and one third. 
</P>
<P>
	Smooth Player paid $29.80, $6.80, and $2.10. Excellent Meeting  
was worth $2.60 and $2.10 and Nany's Sweep returned $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, Tuzla won a three-quarter-length victory over  
Isle de France in the $70,400 Royal Heroine Stakes for fillies and 
mares aged 3 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuzla ($3.40) went a mile in 1:34 1-5 and earned $42,240 for  
owner David Milch to bring her lifetime total to $734,247. She has 
won 11 of 18 starts, with three seconds and a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Isle de France finished two lengths ahead of pacesetter Chime  
After Chime.

<HEADLINE> Diana Saw JFK Jr. As Role Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Princess Diana saw John F. Kennedy Jr. as a role  
model for her son, Prince William, especially in handling of the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping he'll grow up to be as smart about it as John  
Kennedy Jr.,'' she said two months before her death in a 1997 Paris 
traffic crash. William is second in line for the throne of England, 
behind his father, Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want William to be able to handle things as well as John  
does,'' The New Yorker magazine quoted her as saying in an article 
published after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Kennedy's airplane was missing on a flight from New  
Jersey to Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. Also on the plane were 
Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren 
Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the attention that had been focused on him and his  
sister, Caroline, Kennedy responded then that he believed he had it 
easier growing up in the public eye than William and his brother, 
Prince Harry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really able to lead a normal life from about the age of  
5. I went to boarding school and then college,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing I went through could compare to what they are  
facing,'' Kennedy told reporters about two weeks after Diana's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had taught  
him about handling fame, Kennedy said: ``We didn't actually sit 
down and have a tutorial session. But you pick things up.''

<HEADLINE> Kennedy's Fate Remains Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The summer sky was clear and hazy, and the little plane that  
ascended into the sky over Fairfield, N.J., disappeared quietly 
into the spreading night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the single-engine Piper Saratoga II HP soaring away from the  
tree-lined Essex County Airport and the Friday evening sunset 
contained no ordinary pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside was a man who, for many, was the very embodiment of the  
most celebrated American family ever -- John F. Kennedy Jr., heading 
northeast with his wife and sister-in-law toward the famous 
Hyannisport family compound for a cousin's wedding, a happy day. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be five hours before his absence would be officially  
noticed, more than 10 before the world would know this: The son of 
the fallen president, the heir and namesake to Camelot, the 
``sexiest man alive'' and the founder-editor of George magazine, 
was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no wedding this day for Rory Kennedy and her  
clan. There would be only uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked to me like he was limping,'' said the last person to  
see JFK Jr. on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Bailey, who saw Kennedy undergo his pre-takeoff routine at  
Essex County Airport, said Kennedy, who arrived in his convertible, 
might have even had crutches from a recent paragliding injury. 
Bailey watched as Carolyn Bessette Kennedy arrived by car service, 
but never got a look at Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and his wife, married for nearly three years, were due  
Saturday at the Hyannisport compound, where Kennedys from all over 
had already gathered, as they have for three generations, to 
celebrate. In this case, it was the nuptials of the late Sen. 
Robert F. Kennedy's youngest daughter that drew them together. 
</P>
<P>
	For Rory Kennedy, it was to be a happy day in a life marred by  
tragedy. Her father was assassinated before she was born; her 
brother David died of a drug overdose in 1984; and she was the one 
who cradled her dying brother Michael after a 1997 skiing accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 275 guests had been expected for the private 6 p.m. wedding  
ceremony for Rory, a producer and documentary director, and Mark 
Bailey, a writer-editor. The bridal party was to include 30 family 
members and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. was getting there in a relatively new way; he got his  
pilot's license only last year, and had spent many weekends of late 
tending his brand-new, well-instrumented plane at the Essex County 
Airport, where 350 private craft are based. He'd said he loved the 
new way of traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane and  
fly off,'' he told USA Today in May 1998. But not everyone was so 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who  
looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was supposed to make a stop on Martha's Vineyard at 10  
p.m. to drop off his sister-in-law at a house once owned by his 
mother, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Then the couple was 
set to fly on to Hyannisport for the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy hadn't filed a flight plan, which is often normal for  
planes of such size; none is required. The FAA last heard from him 
at 9:39 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Then nothing. And more nothing. From John F. Kennedy Jr. and his  
airplane, there was only silence. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At the Hyannisport compound, uneasiness set in after midnight. A  
family friend reported the plane missing and called the Coast Guard 
at Woods Hole at 2:15 a.m. The Guard began an immediate search; the 
Federal Aviation Administration was notified and called in more 
military rescuers about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also tried to see if the plane had landed elsewhere.  
It hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3:30 a.m., the Air Force got a ``positive hit'' on an  
emergency signal emanating from northern Long Island. Rescuers 
searched that area for three hours, but found nothing. At 7:30 
a.m., the Coast Guard launched an aggressive search of the area 
around Martha's Vineyard and Montauk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the search area was narrowed significantly when officials  
reviewed radar records and found the plane's last known location 
was about 17 miles southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The word went forth, and soon the networks were reporting that  
something was amiss. Those Americans who watch TV news on their 
Saturday mornings would get up to learn that for the Kennedys, yet 
again, something unimaginable was afoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday would be a surreal day in a lot of places. At the  
compound, the family huddled inside, the wedding priests performing 
a Mass of prayer for the missing. Outside, the curious and the 
media gathered to watch and wait for word. And in the Atlantic 
Ocean, helicopters and boats scoured the water for something -- 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who were grim held their tongues. Those who were hopeful  
spoke about Kennedy. They used the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was already Saturday afternoon when the luggage appeared.  
</P>
<P>
	At first, it was simply ``debris,'' found by some Martha's  
Vineyard beachgoers soaking up the sunny, 90-degree day. But the 
image quickly sharpened into focus: a piece of luggage, washing up 
on Philbin Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Its tag bore a business card with a name: Lauren Bessette.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like, 'Oh God.' It seemed like it would be  
pretty bad news. Everyone was shaking,'' said Erin McCarthy, 31, 
whose friend, Damon Seligson, found the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	They looked inside at the contents: a bathing suit. A hairdryer.  
Some makeup. Supplies for a fun weekend. They called 911, and the 
search refocused to the waters roughly 17 miles west of the 
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon helicopters were hovering offshore. Boats were searching.  
Swimmers and sunbathers were told to get off the beach; they might 
get cut by debris, authorities told them. 
</P>
<P>
	As afternoon ebbed into evening, the Kennedys stayed sequestered  
in their storied compound, on the phone to searchers and praying. 
The 6 p.m. mark passed, the moment when Rory Kennedy was to take 
her vows, and all was quiet inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, an unused white tent stood by the sea, and a flag  
billowed in the breeze at full staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Around America and the world, from Arlington National Cemetery  
to Italy and Israel, the world tried to process the news: The boy 
who saluted his father's casket perfectly, now lost at sea. 
Uncertainty for a man whose father captured the imagination of a 
generation, whom Vice President Al Gore described as being ``at the 
high noon of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in Hyannisport, home of so many smiles and sorrows, Kennedy  
tears flowing once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,''  
said Christina Rivers of Hyannis, who was to style the hair of the 
bridal party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not fair,'' she said. ``I don't know what it is, but  
it's not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- Rep. George E. Brown Jr., the  
oldest member of the House of Representatives who championed 
technological issues ranging from the space race to the Internet, 
died Thursday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	He was first elected to the House in 1962, representing the 29th  
Congressional District of Los Angeles County for eight years and 
making a name for himself as a foe of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, he gave up the seat to run for the Senate, but was  
defeated in a primary by Sen. John Tunney. Two years later, he won 
the seat in the 42nd District. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also championed the establishment of the Environmental  
Protection Agency in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career, Brown used his post on the Science  
Committee to support space exploration, both manned and unmanned, 
earning him the title ``Mr. Science.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles P. Roman, the New York City advertising  
pioneer who turned bodybuilder Charles Atlas into an icon of 
American manhood, died Friday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman came up with the Atlas ``Dynamic-Tension'' trademark, as  
well as the ``I was a 97 pound weakling'' slogan. He also devised 
the long-running comic strip ad in which a brawny bully kicks sand 
in the face of a skinny man, who then takes the Atlas course, 
becomes muscle-bound and knocks out the bully. The slogan and the 
incident at the beach were based on the life of Atlas, who was 
sickly as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman met Atlas in 1928. By then, Atlas was already a champion  
bodybuilder. They soon formed a partnership, Charles Atlas Ltd., of 
which Roman became sole owner in 1969, 3 years before Atlas' death. 
Roman sold the company in 1997.

<HEADLINE> The Panderosa Wins Meadowlands Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- John Campbell won his fifth  
Meadowlands Pace, guiding The Panderosa to a stakes-record victory 
in the $1 million race on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving trainer Brett Pelling a great 41st birthday present, The  
Panderosa paced the mile in 1:49 3-5, taking 1-5 of a second off 
the stakes record set by Precious Bunny in 1991. It also equaled 
the track record shared by three other horses, including Nihilator. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panderosa not only won by 2 3/4 lengths, but overcame the  
outside No. 10 post position in winning for the fourth time in five 
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any other pacer could do what he did tonight,''  
Campbell said after winning his 18th million-dollar race. ``He is 
the greatest pacer I have ever driven at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panderosa paid $4.20, $3.20 and $2.20 and earned $500,000  
for Peter Pan Stables, owned by Robert Glazer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mystical Shark, making his fifth lifetime start, finished second  
and returned $4.80 and $3.20. Art's Conquest, winner of the New 
Jersey Classic, placed third and returned $4.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Goliath Bayama, who led the field entering the stretch, finished  
fourth and was followed by Grinfromeartoear, Badlands Hanover, 
Blissfull Hall, Washington VC, Sign of Success and Stutzpan, who 
was coupled in the wagering with The Panderosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Stutzpan, who broke from the No. 8 post with William O'Donnell,  
and Mystical Shark led the field of 10 3-year-olds through the 
first quarter in 26 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell had moved The Panderosa into fourth place by that point  
and he had the winner of the North America Cup in third by the 
half-mile pole. 
</P>
<P>
	By that point, Goliath Bayama was on the lead and driver Sylvain  
Filion kept him there until Campbell attacked on the outside at the 
top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Goliath Bayama stayed with The Panderosa for a few strides, but  
Campbell and his Western Hanover offspring found another gear and 
drew away. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before they got to the wire, Campbell thrust his whip up in  
the air in victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Mystical Shark angled off the rail to finish second but never  
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell's other victories in the Meadowlands Pace were with  
Hilarion (1982), Dexter Nukes (1989), Cam's Card Shark (1994) and 
David's Pass (1995).

<HEADLINE> Clue on JFK Jr. Found in Remote Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Erin McCarthy and her friends felt safely  
away from the world as they frolicked about Philbin Beach on 
Martha's Vineyard Saturday, until they saw something in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Their pulses raced, for they had heard on the radio that a plane  
carrying John F. Kennedy Jr. had disappeared on a flight toward the 
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of McCarthy's, Damon Seligson, waded into the water and  
grabbed what turned out to be a piece of luggage. On the black 
suitcase was a Velcro-covered pouch. McCarthy and her friends 
peeled it back to see a business card. Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the sister of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, the wife of JFK  
Jr. All three had been aboard the plane when it disappeared Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like, 'Oh God.' It seemed like it would be  
pretty bad news. Everyone was shaking,'' said McCarthy, 31. ``I 
think Damon almost had a heart attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said she and her friends looked inside the bag and saw  
several items, including a bathing suit, a hairdryer and some 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her friends called 911. Now the search for Kennedy that  
had extended from Fairfield, N.J. -- where he took off -- to Buzzards 
Bay off Cape Cod was focused. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon helicopters were hovering offshore, boats were searching  
the waters and swimmers and sunbathers were told to get off the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like mad pandemonium,'' said Mel Maddalene, a woman  
vacationing along the scenic beach that sits below sandy cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed Philbin Beach to the public about 2 p.m.,  
telling more than 200 sunbathers they might be in danger of getting 
cut by debris while swimming, said beach worker Will Codding, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no idea what was going when we came,'' said Katie  
Rossetti, 30, of Orange County, Calif. ``But now that I know, I'd 
be afraid to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was flying with his wife and her sister to Cape Cod for  
the wedding of Kennedy's cousin, Rory Kennedy, when the plane 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The search by late Saturday was focused near Philbin Beach at  
the edge of this community, which changed its name several years 
ago, although it is still most commonly known as Gay Head. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few houses in the area, which is covered by rolling  
hills of brambles and other scrub growth leading to sand cliffs and 
white beaches, which include a nearby lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The beaches, remote as they are, were busy Saturday as  
temperatures were in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really looking forward to going to the beach. It's a  
beautiful day, but you just feel so bad. You just can't be angry,'' 
said Janine Rossetti.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Recall Two Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP)-- The Chicago Cubs made four roster moves before the  
team's Saturday afternoon game with the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief pitcher Matt Karchner was placed on the 15-day disabled  
list with a right groin strain he suffered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, backup catcher Sandy Martinez cleared waivers and was sent  
outright to Triple-A Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers Kyle Farnsworth and Steve Rain were both recalled to  
fill the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Saturday's game, Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said both  
Farnsworth and Rain would be used out of the bullpen, though 
Farnsworth could start if called upon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs previously disabled Karchner from April 26 to June 24  
with a right groin strain. Karchner also had to leave the July 9 
game against the White Sox after he felt a pop in the same side of 
his groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Karchner was 1-0 with a 2.50 ERA in 16 games for the Cubs.  
</P>
<P>
	Farnsworth returns to the Cubs after being optioned to Triple-A  
Iowa on July 4. With Chicago, Farnsworth started 11 games, going 
2-3 with a 7.38 ERA. While at Iowa, he made one start and pitched 8 
1-3 innings without getting a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain's contract was purchased by the Cubs' Double-A team at West  
Tenn. He pitched in 40 games, going 3-1 with 24 saves and a 1.59 
ERA. Rain struck out 55 batters and walked 16. He was selected to 
both the Southern League and class Double-A All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was the Cubs' 11th round draft pick in 1993. He is looking  
to make his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez hit .167 with one homer in 17 games for Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Accused of Pinching Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A Las Vegas Hilton cocktail waitress has filed  
a federal lawsuit against her employer and basketball star Dennis 
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Chapa accuses the former Chicago Bulls star of pinching  
and grabbing her breasts while he was seated at a gambling table in 
June 1998. She filed the suit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapa is the fourth woman to accuse Rodman, 37, of such behavior  
at the resort last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapa, 59, also named Hilton in the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hilton tolerates Rodman's behavior because Hilton desires  
Rodman's business,'' her lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton spokesman Alan Hopper declined to comment on the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's publicist, Matt Lebov, did not return a phone call  
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Caddie Collapses at Ameritech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- Two weeks after a caddie collapsed at  
another Chicago-area golf course, a caddie at the Ameritech Senior 
Open was taken to the hospital after experiencing chest pains 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The caddie, whose name was not released, was checked out by  
tournament medical personnel. Tournament spokesman Mike Brand said 
there were no signs of any problem, but added that the caddie was 
taken to Good Shepherd Hospital in nearby Barrington as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Garland Dempsey collapsed and his heart stopped  
as he walked off the 15th tee at the Western Open. Paramedics had 
to use a defibrillator to get a pulse before he was loaded onto a 
stretcher and taken to a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still not clear why Dempsey, 51, collapsed, but he had been  
taking medication for pancreatitis. Temperatures also were in the 
high 90s that day, with humidity making it feel over 100. 
</P>
<P>
	It was cloudy and cool on Saturday with periods of rain.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy Shakes JFK Museum Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- At the downtown monument to President John F.  
Kennedy, visitors gathered around TV monitors to watch the search 
for the missing plane of the assassinated president's son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so ironic to be in the place where his father died,''  
said Michele Chilingerian of Portland, Ore. ``It's creepy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin McCarthy agreed the experience was surreal.  
</P>
<P>
	``It reminds me of what happened the day JFK died,'' said  
McCarthy, of St. Louis. ``I couldn't believe it. I was in Catholic 
School and we started praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her  
sister, Lauren, were missing aboard a plane that left New Jersey 
headed for a family wedding Saturday in Hyannisport, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Several visitors said they did not know about the missing plane  
until they visited the downtown museum dedicated to President 
Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not registering,'' Georgette Sarkisian of Boston said  
with disbelief. ``We know the area where they live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the museum, visitors placed wreaths near the grassy  
knoll and Paul Crute tied a black flag to the antenna of his 1961 
convertible limousine. Crute gives tours along the route that 
President Kennedy traveled when he was killed 36 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitor volume was about normal for a Saturday afternoon at the  
Kennedy-related sites. 
</P>
<P>
	By 3 p.m., about 1,800 people had passed through the Sixth Floor  
Museum, located in the former Texas School Book Depository. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Jeff West said the atmosphere was more subdued  
than usual.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Names Could Get Naughty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the newest addresses on the Internet  
may soon be along the lines of wash-your-mouth-out-dot-com. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of recent changes to the way addresses are assigned,  
people have been permitted to register dozens of Web sites this 
week with names previously deemed too objectionable by the 
government's exclusive contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	The contractor, Network Solutions Inc., decided it will no  
longer accept responsibility for rejecting vulgar names from the 
world's master list of Internet addresses ending in ``com,'' 
``net'' and ``org,'' which the company controls from its offices 
near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is under orders from the White House to begin  
letting consumers sign up for Web addresses with other companies, 
too, but it's decided to require its competitors to develop their 
own vulgarity filters. 
</P>
<P>
	The vulgar Web addresses could be another boon for the world's  
pornography industry. Although some adult sites disguise themselves 
-- one's Web address is almost identical to the White House's -- many 
pornographers are taking steps to identify their content more 
explicitly, fearing new regulations from lawmakers to avoid 
accidental visits to the sites by children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's outrageous this is happening,'' said Monique Nelson,  
chief operating officer of Enough is Enough, a group pushing for 
protection of children on the Internet. ``It will make it easier 
and easier for children to find these types of sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But advocates of the new smutty Web addresses praised the move  
to relax restrictions, arguing that the global nature of the 
Internet makes it impossible to impose local standards of 
propriety. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't police the world,'' said Gary Cohn of Northbrook,  
Ill., who previously registered for a Web address so filthy it 
can't be printed here. ``It's none of their business to be telling 
people to be the morality police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The obscenity controversy is the latest flap in what has become  
a tumultuous transition as the federal government largely hands 
over management of the Internet to a nonprofit group, the Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``ICANN is not in the censorship business,'' President Michael  
Roberts said. But the group's lawyer accused Network Solutions of 
inciting trouble over losing its lucrative contract as the 
exclusive company registering addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``A cynical person might say they saw this as another  
opportunity to portray this as complicated and messy if opened to 
competition,'' lawyer Joe Sims said. ``If NSI was trying to do the 
right thing, as opposed to creating as much commotion as possible, 
it would have simply maintained its old policy until or if an ICANN 
policy was adopted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions spokesman Chris Clough said the company still  
won't sell Web addresses it considers objectionable. But it won't 
prevent other companies from doing so, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's confusion out there. No direction,'' complained Ken  
Stubbs, executive chairman of the Council of Internet 
Registrations. ``They've pushed dealing with the problem out to 
each and every registrar everywhere in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, one of the newest companies to register sites  
acknowledged it inadvertently allowed customers to buy roughly 
three dozen filthy Web addresses before it realized Network 
Solutions was no longer filtering them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first few days were interesting,'' said Hal Lubsen,  
president of Domain Bank Inc. of Bethlehem, Pa., which later added 
its own smut filter. ``We're coming down the learning curve very 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another company newly registering Web addresses,  
California-based Net Wizards Inc., said it will allow customers to 
register any name that isn't illegal. ``People think those are 
worth a lot of money,'' vice president Bill Rockefeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is ... everyone will start doing it,'' Rockefeller  
said. ``I don't see anything morally wrong with accepting those 
names. It's not my position to impose my beliefs on anyone else.''

<HEADLINE> Teacher Dress Codes at Some Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Now it's teachers who might be sent to  
the principal's office if their clothes aren't up to par. 
</P>
<P>
	A school board southeast of Nashville is joining several  
districts nationwide in setting standards for the way its teachers 
dress: no sleeveless dresses, revealing skirts, low-cut shirts or 
sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted our teachers to look professional. For the most part  
they do ... but there were a few coaches who would wear sweat pants 
all day long,'' Cannon County school board member Glenda Harris 
said Friday of the district's new dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, students have been scrutinized by school officials  
who could send them home for inappropriate clothing. In fact, the 
Cannon County school board included a dress code and optional 
uniform for students in its directive last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also included strict guidelines for teachers, teacher  
assistants and secretaries in the system's seven schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In Denver, banned teacher attire includes mid-thigh skirts,  
Spandex, tube tops and thongs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important kids learn that appearance does matter,''  
Denver school board member Laura Lefkowits said after the district 
adopted the guidelines in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Gentry, a middle school principal in Warner Robins, Ga.,  
about 90 miles southeast of Atlanta, wants to take the dress code 
idea a step further -- he would like to see school uniforms for 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that school uniforms worn by the entire faculty  
would present a positive, professional image to both our parents 
and students,'' he wrote in a recent letter to faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers would wear khaki or navy pants, skirts or jumpers  
starting in the 2000-2001 school year, with student uniforms 
required the following year. The school board hasn't yet considered 
his request. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, the Cannon County school dress guidelines came  
from a committee that included a teacher and principal from each 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Education Association spokesman Jerry Winters, whose  
association represents teachers, said he had never heard of teacher 
dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's a crying need for it,'' he said,  
explaining that a principal can talk individually with a faculty 
member who is dressed inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``It's reasonable to expect any professional to  
project a professional image. In order to get respect, you need to 
look respectable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Bush, a teacher and coach at Cannon County High School,  
said he sometimes wore a warm-up suit in a history class wedged 
between two wellness classes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new guidelines may make it difficult for him to  
change clothes and make it to class on time. Still, he welcomes the 
dress code, saying it will set an example for students and require 
his female colleagues to dress more modestly . 
</P>
<P>
	``I always felt a little uncomfortable wearing that warm-up suit  
in history class,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> F-22 Fighter Suffers New Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon efforts to save the F-22 fighter  
suffered another blow when the House Appropriations Committee 
endorsed a recommendation to suspend production. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel went along Friday with the decision of its defense  
subcommittee to spend $1.8 billion on buying more current fighter 
jets and to increase bonuses for military pilots instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel then approved an overall $266.1 billion defense  
spending bill, sending it to the full House for a vote later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, is  
$15.5 billion above spending in the current fiscal year and $2.8 
billion more than requested by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes money for a 4.8 percent across-the-board military  
pay raise beginning in January, up from the 4.4 percent increase 
Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also includes $94 million to upgrade ``readiness  
shortfalls'' in the Army's Apache attack helicopter program. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was included after the commander of the 24 Apache  
helicopters sent to the Balkans, Brig. Gen. Richard Cody, 
complained last month of equipment and pilot training inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopters were sent to Albania. None flew against Serb  
forces. But two crewmen were killed when two helicopters crashed in 
a night training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon had requested $3 billion for the F-22 program. The  
Air Force considers the costly and sophisticated fighter to be its 
top warplane in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $3 billion, $1.8 billion was to go to buying six of the  
new planes from Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon mounted a heavy lobbying campaign this week to try  
to save the program. A Senate-passed bill contains the full $3 
billion for the program.

<HEADLINE> Russ Davis Gets First Safeco Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- It wasn't Ken Griffey Jr. or Alex Rodriguez who  
hit the first home run for the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Davis, the Mariners' third baseman, got that honor Saturday  
when he led off the bottom of the fifth inning with a 366-foot shot 
over the left-field scoreboard off San Diego's Woody Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	After a walk to David Bell, Rodriguez hit the second homer for  
the Mariners in Safeco, the team's new $517.6 million stadium, a 
347-foot homer that barely cleared the fence in right. That gave 
Seattle a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners were homerless in their first two games at Safeco  
on Thursday and Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey began the day with 29 homers, second in the American  
League to Jose Canseco's 31 for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey led the AL with 56 homers last season, while Rodriguez  
became the third player in baseball history to have 40 homers (42) 
and 40 stolen bases (46) in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners moved to their new ballpark from the Kingdome,  
considered one of baseball's most prolific home run parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners set a major league record by hitting 151 homers  
before the All-Star break.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Soaring Softly, undefeated in four career starts  
on turf, won by a nose in Saturday's 56th running of the $250,000 
New York Handicap at Belmont Park. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampico finished second in the field of six.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in the New York's last three runnings  
that Mike Smith rode the winner. He was aboard for Maxzene's 
victory in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Soaring Softly covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:02:1 to earn the $150,000  
winner's share of the $250,000 pot for Joan G. and John W. 
Phillips. It was the seventh win in thirteen career starts for the 
4-year-old filly by Kris S. from the Key to the Mint mare, Wings of 
Grace. 
</P>
<P>
	Soaring Softly returned $4.40, $2.90 and $2.10. Tampico paid  
$4.60 and $2.30 and Anguilla was $2.20 to show.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Blasts Smith for Leaving GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Alan Keyes said  
Saturday he isn't all that happy with the Republican Party, but is 
even more unhappy with Sen. Bob Smith, who bolted from the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes, a conservative Republican talk show host and former  
Reagan administration official, blasted the New Hampshire senator, 
who declared himself an independent after charging that the GOP had 
betrayed conservatives by softening its stances on abortion and gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes said conservatives should focus on changing the party  
rather than leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	While conservatives shouldn't support a hollowed-out party, they  
also shouldn't abandon lightly the moral and political capital that 
generations of Republicans have built up, he told about 40 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes, whose own views put him in direct competition with Smith  
for the more conservative voters in the GOP, charged that by 
leaving, Smith is dividing conservative power and influence, making 
it easier for Democrats and more moderate Republicans to win 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Voters) won't show up when it really counts,'' Keyes said.  
``We need to concentrate our attention and our focus, and a third 
party is not the way.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Coach Marries Girlfriend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAVERNIER, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson  
married longtime girlfriend Rhonda Rookmaaker on Saturday, 
fulfilling a commitment he made when he flirted with the idea of 
retirement earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedding took place in a private ceremony at an oceanfront  
home Johnson recently purchased in the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second marriage for both Johnson, who turned 56  
Friday, and Rookmaaker, 45. They met in 1984 while he was coaching 
the University of Miami and she was a hairdresser at a Coral Gables 
salon. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, Johnson split with his first wife shortly  
after being hired by the Dallas Cowboys. He awkwardly ended his 
marriage to the former Linda Kay Cooper after 26 years, telling 
reporters he no longer needed the social prop of a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookmaaker moved to Dallas shortly thereafter, and both returned  
to South Florida following his 1994 departure from the Cowboys 
after winning two Super Bowl titles. 
</P>
<P>
	After 15 years, the couple became engaged last January as a  
distraught Johnson nearly decided to retire from coaching. He 
disclosed their engagement at the news conference in which he was 
to announce his retirement, but suddenly decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Johnson emphasized that the change of heart was  
only about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing she said was, `I'm not letting you off the  
hook. You're still marrying me,''' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Give Receiver Owens 7-Yr Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wide receiver Terrell Owens has reached a  
7-year contract agreement with the San Francisco 49ers worth at 
least $23 million, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes a signing bonus of $7.5 million and an  
escalator clause that could push the total value of the deal to as 
much as $35 million, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was approved Friday by the NFL's Management  
Council. The 49ers and Owens scheduled a press conference for 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Owens had 67 receptions for 1,097 yards and 14  
touchdowns, including a 79-yard scoring catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, he had signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract,  
which counted against the team's salary cap. The new agreement 
spreads the economic impact over several years.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Not Worried About Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Even at $517.6 million, major league baseball's  
most expensive stadium isn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, when the retractable roof on Safeco Field was  
closed because it was raining, Seattle Mariners and San Diego 
Padres complained the roof wasn't water proof. 
</P>
<P>
	Water dripped into right field and near second base on the dirt  
part of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said two of the three panels that make up the  
11,000-ton roof weren't aligned right by a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roof does not leak,'' Rebecca Hale, the Mariners' director  
of public information, said Saturday. ``It's not a major thing. 
We're still adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second and third panels were not overlapped as they should  
be last night. We had a little water coming in, but it wasn't a 
leak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said fans on the first level of the three-tier stadium near  
the Mariners' dugout on the first base side got rained on, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The computer tells us when the panels are out of alignment,''  
groundskeeper Steve Peeler said. ``But apparently there are still 
some glitches. With a structure this big, you're going to have some 
things. But we'll get them worked out.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns of Defect in Clot-Buster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shortages of the clot-busting drug Abbokinase  
will continue for the foreseeable future. The government has issued 
a stern letter saying maker Abbott Laboratories still has not 
corrected important safety defects. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals have experienced shortages of Abbokinase, one of many  
drugs used to dissolve blood clots, since last fall. That's when 
the Food and Drug Administration suspended Abbokinase sales, saying 
Abbott failed to ensure the drug's ingredients -- the kidney cells 
of foreign newborns who died -- were free of hepatitis B and other 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, viral and bacterial contamination has been found  
in the factory, as well as additional problems with testing the 
donor kidney cells, the FDA said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	No contamination was found in any Abbokinase sold for patient  
use -- the drug is pasteurized before sale. So the FDA has never 
ordered a recall of the scarce supplies that some hospitals still 
have on pharmacy shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA has urged doctors to use remaining Abbokinase  
supplies only in emergencies, saying it does have the potential to 
contain infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the FDA asked doctors Friday to report any infections  
that might be attributable to Abbokinase, used to dissolve blood 
clots in lungs and heart arteries and to clear hospital patients' 
catheters. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, almost a year after the FDA first uncovered problems,  
the government wrote Abbott that it still had not corrected serious 
defects. One concern, the agency said, is that the manufacturing 
defects could lead to Abbokinase contamination not yet discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	An Abbott spokeswoman would not say why it is taking so long to  
correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abbott is continuing to work with the FDA and we're committed  
to resolving the remaining issues,'' said spokeswoman Rhonda 
Luniak. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer advocate urged FDA to recall remaining Abbokinase.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much more evidence of serious,  
health-threatening problems there have to be before FDA lowers the 
boom,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the advocacy group Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott cannot begin selling Abbokinase again until it institutes  
proper testing of the kidney cells and proper processes to safely 
store and handle ingredients and sterilize the product, the FDA 
said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Singer McBride Had Tough Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer Martina McBride sells out  
her own concerts now but vividly remembers her anxiety over being a 
relatively unknown opening act for Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	She worried about being ``some chick singer'' that concertgoers  
would yell off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing was a baptism by fire -- sink or swim,''  
McBride tells Country Weekly magazine in its July 27 issue. 
</P>
<P>
	She swam, obviously, and credits the Brooks experience for  
bolstering her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, there's not much concert-wise that can be any more  
difficult,'' said the Kansas-born singer of hits such as 
``Independence Day,'' ``Wild Angels'' and ``A Broken Wing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McBride, 32, moved to Nashville in 1989 with husband John  
McBride, who became a sound man for Brooks while she sold T-shirts 
for the superstar on the road. She later recorded ``Cheap 
Whiskey,'' a duet with Brooks, and went on to score her first hit, 
``My Baby Loves Me.''
