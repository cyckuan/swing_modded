<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who

Malaysia, said that "for Bangladesh, Malaysia is a big labor
market" which will be expanded in the future.
</P>
<P>

the hope that Malaysia would continue to recruit Bangladeshi
nationals in larger numbers.
</P>

Malaysia. During 1998-99 fiscal year, Bangladeshis in Malaysia
sent 67.52 million U.S. dollars as remittance.
</P>
<P>
Referring to enlistment of Malaysia in the Board of Investment
as the third largest foreign investor in Bangladesh with a total
investment of 1.32 billion dollars, Sheikh Hasina stressed that "
it is very import for Bangladesh to further promote relations with
Malaysia in all fields, especially in the field of labor market,
investment and bilateral trade."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina said during her visit to Malaysia, she unveiled a
12-point package of incentives for foreign investors and made a
clarion call to the Malaysian entrepreneurs to explore the
potentialities available in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>

software, telecommunications and textiles are the unique areas
where the Malaysian entrepreneurs can make potential investments
and earn profits, Hasina Stressed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad assured her that Malaysia will continue recruitment of
workers from Bangladesh as and when necessary, and would buy more
products from Bangladesh to strike a balance in the two-way trade.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Party Urges to Lift Restrictions on Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian reformist party on
Saturday urged the Majlis (parliament) to lift restrictions on the
press by amending the tough press law.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, the Islamic Labor Party (ILP) called on the lawmakers to
halt the suspension of "reformist press."
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary on Saturday ordered the closure of
another reformist weekly, "Tavana" (Capable), on charges of
violating the press law and defamation, bringing the total number
of the closed papers to 21 since April.
</P>
<P>
The clampdown on newspapers was part of the stepped-up efforts
by the conservatives to contain the reformist movement, which
succeeded in ending the long-time conservative dominance of the
Majlis in the February election.
</P>
<P>
"The deputies should be aware of the recent wholesale suspension
of the pro-reform dailies and the crackdown by the conservatives on
the reformist journalists have struck heavy political, cultural and
economic blows to the country and jeopardized Iran's international
reputation," the ILP said.
</P>
<P>
The party urged the Majlis members to pay attention to the
people's opinion under any circumstances. "The people demand
democracy, political development and amendments to the draconian
press law in order to lift the approbatory supervision on the
press," it said.
</P>
<P>
If the Majlis deputies turn a deaf ear to the people's demands,
a mistrust wall will come into being between the government and the
general public, the party warned.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Talks Cannot Continue in Current Form: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said Saturday that the talks on Cyprus could not continue in the
current form, with no direct negotiations being held between the
two sides of the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his return after the conclusion of the third round
of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks, Clerides said however that
decisions on how long the Greek Cypriot side would follow this
procedure would not be made at this point.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island after an abortive pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the island have had three rounds of U.N.-
sponsored indirect talks in an effort to prepare the ground for
substantive talks which may lead to a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
In the indirect, or proximity, talks, the two sides did not meet
face to face but talked through United Nations coordinators
shuttling between them.
</P>
<P>
Such a form of talks was adopted due to the Turkish Cypriots'
refusal of direct talks unless their breakaway regime, declared in
1983 and recognized only by Ankara, be recognized.
</P>
<P>
The request was rejected by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks concluded Friday in Geneva, with no
breakthrough reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said useful work was done in Geneva and the Greek
Cypriot side gave a detailed analysis of its positions on the
issues of constitution, territory, security, refugees, missing
persons and property.
</P>
<P>
"We talked with the special adviser of the U.N. Secretary
General on Cyprus, we expressed our views on the issues as the U.N.
chief asked us to do but we do not know what the other side does,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also said that the U.N. has made no reference to the
Greek Cypriot side of a confederation solution.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots want a two-state confederation which would
imply recognition of their breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side insists on a bizonal, bicommunal
federation with a strong central government, a formula which has
been outlined in numerous U.N. resolutions. It has also repeatedly
expressed the hope that the talks would be direct and substantive.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Turn Agriculture into Economic Driving Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
determined to turn agricultural sector into the driving force for
the country's economy, said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the 74th Agricultural and Commercial Show
themed "2000-The Challenge" in Lusaka, the president said
agricultural development will not only generate viable and
sustainable employment, income and food for the country, but will
also contribute significantly to the gross domestic product,
uplift the living standards of women and children in the rural
areas, and help reduce malnutrition and poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president emphasized the need to promote sustainable
methods of farming, saying "it is important to maintain our
agricultural resource base for future generations by adopting
sustainable agricultural and land use practices."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "it is necessary for us all to recognize the
important inter-linkages between agricultural production and
industry."
</P>
<P>
Industry needs to continue to provide quality machinery and
other requisites to agriculture, while farmers should engage in
production and provide the raw materials critical to industry, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A strong business relationship is being established between
farmers and the other sectors in the area of agribusiness, the
president said, vowing that "my government will continue to focus
on developing infrastructure especially the road network in
outlying areas so that business for and with farmers can grow, and
grow fruitfully."
</P>
<P>
According to Chiluba, Zambia's agricultural production during
the 1999/2000 period has recorded increases in a number of food
crops such as maize, sorghum, millet and beans. This is essential
for household and national food security generally, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged agricultural investors, both local and foreign, "to
take up the challenge of increasing productivity, improving
incomes for your households and reduce poverty in the communities".
</P>
<P>
The president mentioned Zambia's vast potential for development,
saying "the good lord almighty has blessed us with abundant land,
42 million hectares of arable land, of which only 14 percent is
cropped."
</P>
<P>
Noting that only 11.8 percent of the country's irrigation
potential has been put to use, Chiluba stressed that "a developed,
dependable irrigation system will not only increase production,
but will make crop production predictable, incomes assured,
employment more secure and will enhance national food security."
</P>
<P>
The president also urged cooperating partners to continue
supporting Zambia on bilateral and multilateral basis in
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"I can only urge them to honor their financial pledges so that
we can accelerate the implementation of the various programs that
we agreed on. The development of this country will not come out of
a once-and-for all effort. Rather it will come out of consistent
efforts, policies and actions, over years and generations with the
cooperation and interdependence on neighbors, regional and
international economies," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Health Minister Expresses Concern on Breast-feeding Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Although the breast-feeding rates
in Zimbabwe have doubled from 16 percent in 1995 to 39 percent in
1999, this is still cause for concern, said Zimbabwe's Health and
Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This means that about 60 percent of mothers still continue to
give other foods or liquids such as water, traditional herbs,
formula, fresh cows' milk to infants less than six months of age,"
he said at the launch of the World Breast-Feeding Week in Harare.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the full potential of breast-feeding
for infants' health especially prevention of infections is not
full realized.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Breast-Feeding Week will be focused on breast-
feeding as a human right.
</P>
<P>
Breast-feeding makes a major contribution to the realization of
the child's right to food and health care, Stamps said.
</P>
<P>
He said "Zimbabwe's labor regulations provide 12 weeks paid
maternity leave for working women. This is fully paid leave for
civil servants and only partially for women employed in the
private sector. The government will seek to harmonize these
regulations for all working women."
</P>
<P>
The new International Labor Organization Convention on
Maternity Protection now provides for 14 weeks paid maternity
leave. The relevant ministries would see to it that the Law in
Zimbabwe is amended to ensure that the new convention is effected,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Breast-Feeding Week, which runs from August 1 to 7, is a U.
N. initiative and organized by the World Alliance for Breast-
feeding Action.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Refutes Honduran Statements Over Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government
Saturday rejected the statements made by a Honduran government
official about the sovereignty over four islets in the Caribbean
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran Foreign Ministry's Limits and International Waters
Commission president Ramon Valladares Soto said in Tegucigalpa
that the Sur, Robel, Arrecife Alargado and Media Luna islets are
the property of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister Jose Adan Guerra said that the
Honduran official "is completely wrong because those keys are
fully Nicaraguan."
</P>
<P>
Those islets are part of Nicaragua's continental platform and "
that is why we protested when we learned of the presence of the
Honduran Naval Force on them," said Guerra.
</P>
<P>
Guerra said that Nicaragua has sent two protest notes in July
to the Honduran government for the violation of Nicaraguan
sovereignty by the armed forces of that country.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that the four keys are located in Parallel 14.
50, which is fully Nicaraguan.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua and Honduras maintain another conflict of limits in
the Caribbean after the Honduran congress ratified in November a
maritime limits treaty with Colombia, which establishes the
maritime border between Honduras and Nicaragua in Parallel 15,
while Nicaragua says that it is in parallel 17.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua says that the treaty deprives it of 130,000 square
kilometers from the continental platform in the Caribbean, and
filed a lawsuit against Honduras before the International Court of
the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Deployment of UNIFIL in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi here on Saturday welcomed the deployment of the United
Nations peace keepers all along the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Through the presence of the U.N. force on new positions in
southern Lebanon, any Israeli re-invasion of Lebanon and violation
of its territorial integrity is expected to be repelled, Kharrazi
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the U.N. Security Council would act
strongly and speedily against any new Israeli aggression after it
withdrew all troops from south Lebanon on May 24, ending a 22-year
occupation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) started taking up
positions along the Lebanese-Israeli border on Saturday in the
final phase of its deployment that came more than two months after
Israel ended its occupation of the area.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which refuses to recognize the Jewish state, hailed the
Israeli withdrawal as a major victory of the Lebanese resistance
movement backed by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Saturday, Kharrazi met with speaker of
the Lebanese National Assembly Nabih Berri, calling on the
Palestinians to follow the suit of the Lebanese resistance groups.
</P>
<P>
Armed struggle is the only means for the Palestinians to restore
their legitimate rights, Kharrazi said during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Jerusalem belongs to the Islamic world, and the
Palestinians and Muslim countries would not make any concession on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
Berri on Saturday ended a four-day official visit to Iran,
during which he also met with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, President Mohammad Khatami and parliament speaker Mehdi
Karrubi.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The value of Kuwait's exports
in the first five months of this year reached 65 million dinars
(214.5 million U.S. dollars), up 81 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Commerce and Industry,
carried by the Kuwaiti News Agency on Saturday, attributed the rise
to export-supporting strategies adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Exports to other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the
period totalled 30 million dinars (99 million dollars), a rise of
47 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia topped the list of GCC importers of Kuwaiti goods
worth 16 million dinars (52.8 million dollars), accounting for 52
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The value of Kuwaiti exports to other Arab countries amounted to
16.5 million dinar (54.45 million dollars), a rise of 25 percent
from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Denies Vying with Egypt for Security Council Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa denied on Saturday that
it was competing with Egypt for a permanent seat for the African
continent at an enlarged United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency,
South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said in
Pretoria that the reports in this respect are baseless.
</P>
<P>
Increase of permanent members at the U.N. Security Council,
which are now standing at five, is under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Africa may win a place in the most important body of the world
organization. Egypt and South Africa, in the continent's northeast
and south respectively, play key roles in African issues, with
outstanding political and economic weight in the region.
</P>
<P>
It was groundless to talk about competition between South Africa
and Egypt over something that has yet to be endorsed, Zuma
stressed. She said her country supports a call for securing a fair
representation at the Security Council on a geographical basis.
</P>
<P>
Before the international community decides on the expansion of
the council, South Africa backs the demand of the Organization of
African Unity that Africa have two non-permanent seats at the
council.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that she discussed the issue with her Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa during his visit to South Africa in mid-July
and that the two sides had an identical view.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are held continually between South African President
Thabo Mbeki and Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, as well as between
senior officials on both sides concerning bilateral ties and
regional issues, in order to remove any obstacles hindering the
development of political and economic ties, she added.

<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Local financial sources said the value of Abu
Dhabi's export of crude oil is expected to reach 74 billion dirhams
(20 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000, up 45 percent, or 34 billion
dirhams (9 billion dollars), from that of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The hike is attributed to the soaring prices in the world oil
market and the increase of the United Arab Emirates' production
quota within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to about 2.22 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Annual revenues of the Algerian fishing sector are
expected to rise to about 3 billion dollars from 2003 on, if the
government removes the administrative barriers and other obstacles
facing this sector.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Fishery Minister Omar Ghoul said the fishing sector has
not been successfully exploited. He urged Arab investors to exploit
the Algerian coasts which have abundant fishing resources.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- World fashion designers will meet in Istanbul at an
international fashion fair to be held on August 14-17.
</P>
<P>
Fair organizer Gungor Kesci said at a press conference Friday
that this is the first time that such a fair is being organized in
Turkey and its goal is to make Istanbul an international fashion
center.
</P>
<P>
World designers are expected to discuss the latest trends and
new avenues for cooperation, Gungor said.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish auto distributor, Sanko Otomotiv, plans to
set up a factory in the southeastern province of Gaziantep to
produce South Korean Daewoo trucks.
</P>
<P>
The production is planned to start by the end of 2001 and that
by the end of the third year, annual output will reach 2,000
trucks, up from 500 in the first year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Barmek Holding's power equipment supplier has
constructed two substations centers in Kyrgyzstan, which will go
into operation on August 8.
</P>
<P>
The 220 kilovolt (kv) and 550 kv substation centers were
financed by the European Investment Bank at a cost of 18 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Barmek had earlier installed substation centers in Iraq,
Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan.

<HEADLINE> SADC Unveils Security Organ Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Details of the proposed
restructuring of the Southern African Development Community (SADC )
controversial security organ have been made public for the first
time at the SADC Council of Ministers meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, South African
Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma told a press
conference in Windhoek, Namibia that the plan is to make the organ
clearly a substructure of SADC.
</P>
<P>
It will be chaired by a head of state working within a troika
of other senior SADC representatives rather than on his own, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, which will be forwarded to the Heads of State
summit on Monday if approved by the ministers, are the result of a
review ordered at last year's SADC summit.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Organ for Politics, Defense and Security, set up in
1996, is the body responsible for formulating and co-ordinating a
common SADC response to conflicts such as those raging in Angola
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
However, it has never been made fully operational because of a
difference of opinion over whether it is meant to be fully
independent or to be a SADC structure.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which has chaired the organ since its inception,
maintained that it should function independently.
</P>
<P>
South Africa supports the new proposal that it should be a
substructure of SADC, Dlamini-Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
"What has been agreed so far by the ministers who have been
working on it, which will obviously still have to go to the heads
of state, is that there is one SADC, and there is the chair of
SADC, and the chair of SADC is the only person who calls and
presides over summits of SADC, but that the organ would be a
substructure of SADC," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
She said the security organ's troika may initially coincide
with the troika that runs SADC itself, which after this weekend's
summit will be Namibia, as new SADC chair, Mozambique as past
chair and a chair-designate.

<HEADLINE> Congolese President Still to Decide on Attending SADC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- It is still unpredictable
whether the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) President
Laurent Kabila will attend the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) summit meeting, DRC Foreign Affairs Minister
Abdoulaye Yerodia told South African Press Association Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, DRC representatives will walk out of any session of
the summit attended by Ketumile Masire, former Botswana president
and facilitator of the DRC peace initiative chosen by the
Organization of African Unity, Yerodia said.
</P>
<P>
He attacked Masire in a closed session of the SADC Council of
Ministers meeting on Friday, accusing him of complicating the
country's peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior source in the Namibian government, which is
one of the three countries that have sent troops to the DRC to
support Kabila against rebels, said the DRC leader will definitely
not be at the summit to be held in Windhoek on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has urged African leaders to pressure Kabila
to abide by the terms of the Lusaka peace accord signed a year ago
by all warring parties concerned, and not to set preconditions
for the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping troops.

<HEADLINE> IMF Cautions Zambia Over Sudden Salary Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) warned here Saturday that a sudden increase of salaries for
Zambia's civil servants will cause inflation to the country's
already poor economy.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the civil servants' salaries would not improve the
country's economy but would instead worsen it, said visiting IMF
Deputy Director Stanely Feicher.
</P>
<P>
He said if the Zambian government wants to increase wages for
the public workers, the percentage should not be so high as making
it high would cause inflation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Feicher, who has been in the country for the past week,
suggested that instead of raising the salaries by high percentages,
the government should consider doing so gradually and according to
the prevailing economic situation.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to consider trimming the civil service
to make it more efficient, smaller and more manageable.
</P>
<P>
Urging all Zambians to join hands and improve their standards
of living for their own good, Feicher said he is impressed by the
vast potential Zambia has for development.
</P>
<P>
The question of improving the low salaries of civil servants
has been a burning issue for the Zambian government, which is
under attack by both employees and international partners like IMF.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Launch Five-Year Women Empowerment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will launch in
September this year a five-year national women development program
in a bid to ensure women empowerment, a senior woman official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar in Nazareth, about 90 kilometers east of
Addis Ababa, Tadelech Haile-Michael, in charge of women affairs in
the Prime Minister's Office, said the program will focus on
ensuring the rights of women stipulated in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to Tadelech, the execution of the program, which is
due to be endorsed by the parliament in September, will cost about
7.4 million U.S. dollars to be supplied by the World Bank and the
Italian government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to international donations, the Ethiopian
government has also set aside 17.5 million birr (about 2 million U.
S. dollars) worth materials, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said some 600 people have been trained to execute the
program. The training courses include project designing, ways on
organizing women, income-generating project preparation,
information exchange and poverty alleviation methods.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Economy Grows 6 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Peru's national production grew 6
percent during the first half of this year over the same period of
1999, the National Statistics and Information Institute (INEI)
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The positive behavior of production in the first six months of
2000 reflected the recovery of the Peruvian economy from the same
period of last year," said the INEI bulletin.
</P>
<P>
It could be seen in an itemized account of the figures reported
by the different productive activities in the sixth month of the
year that all the sectors recorded a growth, with fishing, and
manufacturing and agriculture standing out, which rose above the
global average.
</P>
<P>
The INEI highlighted the 26.7 percent advance achieved by
fishing because of the better conditions of anchovy availability
that made possible the increase of its capture.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing grew 10.3 percent in June thanks to a bigger
production of the food, beverages, chemicals, metals and apparel
industries.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry increased 17.3 percent because of the
contribution of spinning, weaving and finishing of textile
products.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture expanded 8.2 percent, sustained by the growth of
its subsectors by 8.8 percent and livestock that had a 6.9 percent
increase.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
provide over the next six months humanitarian aid for Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Iran to assist the most vulnerable people affected by
drought.
</P>

BRASILIA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Oil National
Agency (ANP) is planning to invest 333 million U.S. dollars in the
year 2001 for seismic research to identify natural gas and oil
reserves in Brazilian inland basins.
</P>
<P>
The volume to be invested is 10 times bigger than the resources
available to the ANP for the same purpose, according to the agency
's general manager David Zylbersztajn.
</P>
<P>
The available data about seismic investigations in Brazilian
inland fields are few and sparse. This kind of information is
fundamental to awakening the investors' interest.
</P>
<P>
Zylbersztajn said that there will be in the first half of this
year a call to bid for mature (of small production) inland fields
of Petrobras to probe the interest for the oil-rich inland.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian proven oil reserves were at the close of last year 17.
3 billion barrels. The country wants to be self-sufficient with a

<HEADLINE> Iran to Release 721 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran will soon release 721 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs), 12 years after the eight-year bloody war
between the two countries ended.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis will be handed over to the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC), said an announcement from Iran's special
commission in charge of POW affairs.
</P>
<P>
But the official Islamic Republic News Agency did not give a
specific date in its report.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also called on the Iraqi government to respond
positively by releasing Iranian POWs still held in Iraqi prisons.
</P>
<P>
Iran said in June that it had freed a total of 3,389 Iraqi POWs
since the start of the current Iranian year on March 20. All the
POWs were freed through the supervision of ICRC, which has
monitored repatriation of almost 98,000 POWs from both sides since
1980.
</P>
<P>
The fate of thousands of POWs has been one of the thorniest
issues hindering the improvement of ties between Iran and Iraq
since the end their war in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Iran says it has documents showing that more than 3,000 Iranian
POWs are still being held in Iraq, while Iraq claims that almost 9,
000 more Iraqi soldiers are kept in Iranian prisons despite
Tehran's claim that a large number of Iraqis released are not
willing to return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq war claimed some 1 million lives and caused severe
damage to the two countries' economy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Republican Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday vetoed the Republican-sponsored tax cut bill for married
couples.
</P>
<P>
"We can't retreat from this opportunity of a lifetime to keep
our economy strong and move our country forward," Clinton said in
his weekly radio address. "That's why I'm vetoing legislation that
represents the first installment of a fiscally reckless tax
strategy."
</P>
<P>
"On Capitol Hill, the Republican majority has passed a series
of expensive tax breaks to drain nearly a trillion dollars from
the projected surplus" in federal budget coffers, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He returned the legislation to Congress with a letter in which
he said the tax plan was regressive.
</P>
<P>
"It provides little relief to families that need it most, while
devoting a large fraction of its benefits to families with higher
incomes," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vowed to kill the 292 billion dollar, 10-year tax cut
even before the Senate gave final congressional approval to the
legislation on July 21.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed both the Senate and the House by less than the
two-thirds majorities needed to override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's veto came at a sensitive time between the Republican
and Democratic national conventions as tax cut is a major issue in
the presidential campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore call the Republican tax cut
plan irresponsible while Republicans argue that the measure would
benefit millions of middle-class Americans.

LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Buckingham Palace will open to
visitors Sunday for the summer season with its ballroom added to
the list of state rooms on the tour for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The ballroom, built in 1856 under Queen Victoria to celebrate
the end of the Crimean War, is the largest and last of Buckingham
Palace's state rooms to be shown to visitors.
</P>
<P>
The ballroom, 37.5 meters in length and 18 meters in width, is
used by the queen for state banquets and official reception.
</P>
<P>
Palace officials hope that thousands of tourists will visit the
palace during the eight weeks it is open to the public and have
unveiled plans to make it a top summer attraction.
</P>
<P>
The royal residence has been falling in the popularity stakes
amongst tourists.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of visitors to the palace in central
London fell for the first time. It was criticized by the Consumer'
s Association for being sterile and overpriced.
</P>
<P>
The high value of the pound has been blamed for the drop in
visitor numbers at all of London's top tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
According to the English Tourism Council, the Tower of London
and Canterbury Cathedral also saw a fall in visitor numbers last
year.
</P>
<P>
Buckingham Palace is open to the public from August 6 to

<HEADLINE> South Korean Soccer Chief to Double as KOWOC President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's soccer chief Chung
Mong Joon will take charge of the country's organizing committee
for the 2002 World Cup (KOWOC) next week.
</P>
<P>
KOWOC sources said on Saturday that Chung will become the
acting president on Tuesday and may stay on until October at the
earliest, after which an experienced political figure is expected
to take over on a full-time basis until the 2002 World Cup, to be
co-hosted by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing president Park Seh Jik, 67, resigned on July 27 after
his alleged authoritarian style of leadership as well as his
handling of KOWOC's annual budget put himself under fire. He had
been in charge of KOWOC for two years.
</P>
<P>
Delays to construction of South Korea's 10 stadiums for the
2002 World Cup also frustrated government ministers, who have
lobbied to replace Park, formerly a top organizer for the 1988
Seoul Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Georgia For Expansion of Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Georgia on Saturday
expressed their willingness to enhance bilateral relations and
cooperation, the official IRNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Georgian Foreign Minister Iraklii
Menagarichvili, President Mohammad Khatami said the two countries
should further develop political and economic relations in addition
to cultural bonds.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that cultural ties supported by political and
economic cooperation could lay the foundation for constant,
effective relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Menagarichvili, who presented a written message from Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze to Khatami, said his country's
foreign policy advocates the expansion of relations and cooperation
with regional countries, Iran in particular.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Georgia's support for the idea of dialog among
civilizations around the world, which was initiated by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian foreign minister, who arrived here Friday, held
talks with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Kharrazi said Iranian companies are ready to
contribute to dam and road building projects as well as
establishment of cement factories and oil and gas refineries in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers underlined the importance of establishing a
security arrangement in the Caucasus in order to maintain stability
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Such a security arrangement should not result in the
infiltration of foreigners into the region who are after their own
interests, Kharrazi said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi voiced Iran's support for Georgia's territorial
integrity, saying that Iran has always been ready to contribute to
strengthening security and peace in the Caucasus and help remove
problems facing Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Menagarichvili said Iran and Georgia have similar stances in
protecting stability and security in the region.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Renews Call for World Assistance in Removing Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Saturday renewed a call for
world countries and specialized international organizations to help
remove millions of landmines in its Western Desert left behind in
the World War II.
</P>
<P>
A committee in charge of coordinating efforts to remove
landmines met in the day to review its work and a report released
by a United Nations mission following an inspection to affected
areas in Egypt in February, state-run Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of State for Planning and International
Cooperation Ahmed el-Darsh, who heads the committee, urged world
countries and the organizations to offer Egypt funds and equipment
for clearing landmines planted by the belligerent parties in the
war along the northern stretch of the Western Desert.
</P>
<P>
The deadly devices have killed and maimed thousands of people
during the past 55 years after the World War II, and are still
threatening people's life and hindering development projects, el-
Darsh said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Egypt is estimated to have about 20 million mines
in the Western Desert and needs 250 million U.S. dollars to have
them removed.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Germany, Italy and the U.N. have pledged to provide
Egypt with financial and technical assistance, including maps
depicting landmines, in efforts to remove the landmines. But Egypt
says the assistance is far less than needed.

<HEADLINE> Japan Adamant in Confederations Cup Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan refused again on Saturday to
stage the Confederations Cup next year as a dress rehearsal for
the 2002 World Cup, which it is co-hosting with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Japan, who had rejected a proposal by the FIFA executive
committee last March to stage the biennial Confederations Cup in
2001, were told on Thursday that they would be staging the event
anyhow.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Saturday morning,
the Japanese protested that the proposal was "without any
consultation beforehand" and "neglecting the Japanese association'
s independence".
</P>
<P>
The Japanese instead offered to host the tournament in 2005,
but FIFA said it go against the purpose of staging the tournament,
which include the champions from the six confederations and the
two co-hosts. South Korea, however, appeared willing to take on
the event.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA executive committee had decided earlier this week that
organizers of the 2002 and 2006 World Cups needed to stage the
Confederations Cup beforehand as a dress rehearsal.

<HEADLINE> Africa Football Confederation Ends Cooperation with Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The African Football Confederation
ended cooperation with its Asian counterpart in retaliation for
the "lack of support" from Asian representatives on FIFA's
executive committee, the organizations said in Zurich on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement posted on its Internet site, the African
Football Confederation said it informed Asian soccer officials
Thursday that it would "put an end to the Afro-Asian cooperation
between the two confederations in the field of Afro-Asian
championships and exchange of officials."
</P>
<P>
The statement concluded that "This decision, which takes effect
beginning August 2000, comes as a result of the lack of support by
the Asian FIFA executive committee members in matters involving
African interests within FIFA."
</P>
<P>
Asian Football Confederation secretary-general Peter Velappan
said "there was no chance for discussion" with the Africans. "It
was very unexpected. It really shocked us."
</P>
<P>
FIFA officials said they had not been officially informed of
the African move, which coincided with South Africa's decision to
drop attempts to have the 2006 World Cup vote reviewed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets World Famous Scientists (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang is very concerned with the issue of scientific ethics. He
said that science and technology have greatly improved the ability
of human beings to control nature and themselves. However, more
and more problems have also occurred when science and technology
are applied in practice.
</P>
<P>
Industrial development, for example, has brought about polluted
waters and an unclean atmosphere. Large-scale reclamation and
excessive herding have also damaged the eco-system of forests and
grassland. The development of information science and life
sciences has raised issues concerning people's dignity, health,
and inheritance, as well as ecological security and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The Internet can swiftly and broadly convey a wealth of useful
information, but contains a lot of useless and false information
as well. How to distinguish what is true and what is distorted
information on the Net are also difficult for science and
technology themselves to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang finally noted that mankind faces two big issues. The
first is peace, the other is development. The solutions to these
two issues are entwined with the development of science and
technology.

<P>
President Jiang pointed out that as the largest developing
country in the world with inadequate per capita resources and
unbalanced development, China faces the arduous task of
modernization that requires long-term hard work.
</P>
<P>
"We are drafting the tenth five-year plan that will guide the
economic and social development of China in the first five years
of the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that one of the important prerequisites of
pushing forward scientific and technological progress is to
develop a sound mechanism that integrates scientific research,
technological development, social production, market demand,
investment and government support, and to foster a culture of
respecting knowledge and talents and encourage innovation.
</P>
<P>
"We have to continue reforms, strengthen integral links between
science and technology and production and promote scientific
innovation and developments of knowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the innovation of science and technology, Jiang
noted that the history of mankind is a process of continuous
innovation and progress. Without innovation, there will be no
progress, and there will be no future for mankind either, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is extremely important for China to make
great efforts to push forward scientific and technological
innovation and make great leaps in the development of technology.
</P>
<P>
"We must closely follow global trends, firmly push forward key
research and development projects that have strategic, basic and
crucial significance for the development of the economy, science
and technology, national defense and Chinese society, and
accelerate research on key subjects and make innovations by
ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we should actively strengthen exchange and
cooperation with our international counterparts, and work hard to
learn from the achievements of advanced science and technology,"
said Jiang.

<P>
With the development of economic globalization and the rapid
progress of science and technology, all countries are facing new
opportunities and challenges, Jiang said, adding that problems
facing developing countries, especially the poorest ones, are the
concern of all governments around the globe.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the North and South and that between the rich
and the poor are becoming more and more obvious, Jiang pointed out.
The significant unbalance between developed and developing
countries regarding science and technology has expanded the gap
between the North and South, he continued. The development of
information technology has promoted the rapid growth of the
information industry and the growth economy. However, he said, the
growth and the interests as a result of the growth mainly benefit
developed countries, not the large number of poor people in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the more science and technology develop, the
more people should do to solve scientific and technological gaps
that exist between the rich and poor countries, and promote the
common development and prosperity of all the countries.
</P>
<P>
To this end, it is necessary for all state governments, people
and scientists in the world to join their hands, Jiang said,
adding that "We should strive to use scientific and technological
achievements to help many countries and people to eradicate
violence, ignorance and poverty, and enhance peace and development
of mankind."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Chinese president gave a dinner in honor
of the scientists.

Vice-premiers Li Lanqing and Wen Jiabao accompanied Jiang in
meeting with the scientists.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Blast Death Toll Rises to 27 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of an explosion
at a firecracker factory in east China's Jiangxi province rose to
27 by 10:20 this evening.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed that one of the dead was the owner of the
factory Huang Lexiang.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the explosion may have been caused by a spark
as Huang's daughter rubbed a container of explosives against a
wall. Her daughter was also killed.
</P>
<P>
The explosion completely destroyed the 60-meter-long five-
storey factory building. Police and rescuers had to use three
excavators to clean up the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Police are still investigating the exact cause of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened around 14:50 on Wednesday. Another 26
were injured, including two who are in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Police said that Huang illegally transported two tons of
explosive materials from Inner Mongolia in north China to his
factory in Shangli county in Jiangxi province.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place as he and his daughter unloaded the
explosives.
</P>
<P>
Another firecracker explosion killed 33 in the same county on
March 11.

<HEADLINE> Solid Recovery But Too Early for Housewarming: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- While a series of propitious
events starting in mid-June led to a solid recovery in primary
physical market in Hong Kong, but it is "too early for a
housewarming," analysts here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The recent series of local events helped to firm up Hong Kong'
s primary residential market, but we believe it is really the
softer economic numbers coming out of the U.S. that have fueled
the rally in property stocks," said Otto Wong, a Salomon Smith
Barney (SSB)'s senior analyst for Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent quarterly report on global real estate
released by SSB, during the second quarter of 2000, the Real
Estate Investment Trusts outperformed all major indices in the
United States, with a positive total return of 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the SSB analyst said the Real Estate Investment Trusts
' strong showing had more to due with market sentiment than the
healthy underlying fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the most recent lower-than-expected non-farm
payroll number is apparently convincing an ever greater number of
investors that signs of inflation are benign enough to obviate any
further U.S. rate hikes for this year, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
"Developers have not yet been able to flex any pricing muscle,
through we have seen very strong market responses to recent market
launches in term of volume," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order for price increases to be implemented and sustained,
the analyst believed that three conditions must be in place,
namely, a decrease in interest rates, a reappearance of
speculative and investment interest, and an increase in wages.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Closes Another Pro-reform Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A Tehran public court has ordered
the suspension of the "Tavana" (Capable) weekly on charges of
defamation and violation of the press law, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iraj Rastegar, managing director of the weekly, has been accused
of 30 cases of violating the press law and publishing defamatory
articles against government officials, said the court.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the pro-reform weekly brings the total number of
newspapers and journals shut down by the conservative judiciary in
the past few months to 21.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale clampdown on pro-reform newspapers was part of the
stepped-up conservative effort to contain the reformist movement,
which has succeeded in upsetting the long-time conservative
dominance of the Majlis (parliament) in the February elections.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 papers and journals closed down, at least 19 belong to
the reformist camp, which played a critical role in publicizing
reformers' views in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives still dominate most of the powerful state
organs, including the judiciary and the military.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests Reformist Cleric for Attending Controversial Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Hassan Yusefi Ashkevari, a
reformist Iranian clergy, was arrested early Saturday morning and
sent to prison for participating in a controversial conference on
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ashkevari was detained upon his arrival from abroad, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted prosecutor of the Special Clergy Court
(SCC) Mohammad-Ebrahim Nekounam as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nekounam said Ashkevari will stand trial at the SCC.
</P>
<P>
The cleric was accused of acting against national security,
publicizing defamatory articles in certain domestic and foreign
dailies against officials of the clergy system and launching
publicity campaign against the system.
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with insulting and denying "the absolute
sanctities of the holy religion of Islam, questioning its rules and
committing practices which ran contrary to dignity of clergymen.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor also said that Ashkevari's home was searched in
his and his family's presence to complete preliminary examination.
</P>
<P>
The SCC issued the arrest warrant in April for Ashkevari, who
had remained abroad for trips to various European countries.
</P>
<P>
All of the Iranian reformist participants in the Berlin
conference on Iran held in April have been summoned to courts or
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Iran's powerful conservatives, after losing the presidential and
parliamentary elections in the past three years, have condemned the
conference attended by the allies of the reformist President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
They accused the reformists of advocating "U.S.-style reforms in
Iran," which has been fiercely opposed by the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

<HEADLINE> Architects Concern About Protecting Traditional Houses in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 architects from home and
abroad gathered today in Beijing, discussing ways to protect China
's architecture, focusing on old houses in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China has a rich tapestry of architecture. For example, Beijing
has imperial palaces and traditional courtyards, the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region has yurts on the grasslands and the Dai
minority live in bamboo houses.
</P>
<P>
However, economic development and city restructuring are
threatening the very existence of traditional houses.
</P>
<P>
Traditional houses need to be protected, the architects noted,
adding that they also bring incomes for cities. For example,
Xicheng District in Beijing earned 2 billion yuan (about 240
million U.S. dollars) in tourism income in 1998 with 114 buildings
under cultural protection, 16 archeological sites and 264 scenic
spots and historic places.

President Jiang said that advance of modern science and
technology has opened up many new fields that were unimaginable in
the past. For example, there are now proton, biological and
quantum computer researchers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the next century, scientific research should
place greater importance on global issues that are directly
related to the fate and future of human beings, focusing on inter-

make further progress on the origin of matter, the integration and
unification of systems and further promote closer ties with
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Noting that science and technology know no borders, he said
that study of space, life and origin of the physical world needs
great amount of human, material and financial resources that
exceed the scope of strength of any single nation. Therefore,
greater efforts should be made to enhance international scientific
and technological exchanges and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Backs Palestinian-Israeli Peace: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here on Saturday that Turkey will continue its support
for a just solution in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after a one-hour meeting with visiting
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said the Turkish people cherish a deep affection for the
Palestinians as Turkey has not only geographical but also
historical ties with Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leader was apparently referring to the fact that the
Ottoman Empire ruled Palestine and the rest of the Middle East for
400 years until the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the talks, Ecevit said the
information Arafat conveyed to him regarding the collapsed Camp
David summit was very beneficial to him.
</P>
<P>
He said "a constructive approach" was expected to be found on
the problem concerning Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the issue of an independent Palestinian state, which
Arafat has vowed to declare on September 13 with or without a peace
deal with Israel, Ecevit said this would not be a problem for
Turkey. "We recognize Palestine since 1988. They have an embassy in
Ankara."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also congratulated Arafat on his 71st birthday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on his part said he had briefed Ecevit on the failed U.
S.-brokered summit between him and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak at Camp David last month, as well as problems regarding the
holy city of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed his conviction that Turkey would continue to
extend support for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Camp David talks, the Palestinian
leader has embarked on a lengthy journey of Asia, Europe and
Africa, seeking international support for his steadfast positions
in the peace talks and his pledge of declaring a Palestinian state
on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the latest leg on his multi-nation tour, which has
already taken him to Egypt, France, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Morocco,

ANKARA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- About 100 Turkish lawyers gathered on Friday at Istanbul and
launched one-day hunger strike, protesting a regulation which
prevents lawyers of meeting with their inmate.
</P>
<P>
Zeynel Ozturk, one of the lawyers who participated in the
strike, said that "the construction of prisons formed by cells in
Turkey, namely the F-type prisons, should be immediately stopped."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the F-type prisons and the regulation are not
cancelled, they will continue their protests in various platforms.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said on Friday
that "everybody has religious freedom according to the
constitution, so nobody should be forced to reveal its religion on
its identity card."
</P>

He said this in a bid to defend the removal of religion from the
new identity card which will be used in Turkey.
</P>
<P>

flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of talks will start in New York on September
12.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkey sent its troops to the

<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese students, taking flights
of the United Airlines to the U.S. during August 1- November 31,
will enjoy a 60 percent discount on airfares to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
However, the discounted fare is only from Shanghai and
students must have a valid student ID, an official with the
airlines said.
</P>
<P>
Those students will also receive an additional 5,000 bonus
miles after their first flight and extra 10-kg baggage allowance,
he said.

a Shanghai-San Francisco non-stop daily flight in March this year
as well as a Beijing-San Francisco non-stop flight in June.

<HEADLINE> Kenya May Send Only Two Marathoners for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Boston marathon champion Elijah
Lagat of Kenya is yet to confirm his willingness to run in the
Sydney Olympics, a Kenyan athletics official said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This would leave Kenya only two runners in the men's marathon
at the upcoming Olympic Games if Lagat finally opted to skip the
Games.
</P>
<P>
Lagat, together with Moses Tanui and Japheth Kosgei, had been
originally selected for the Olympics, only to be all dropped from
the Olympic squad in July, allegedly for being inconsistent with
their training.
</P>
<P>
Lagat was later reinstated to replace Ondoro Osoro, who was
injured after his selection, but he reportedly had declined the
offer, insisting that he would rejoin the team only if Tanui and
Kosgei were also reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Amateur Athletics Association (KAAA) chairman Isaiah
Kiplagat said that they wanted to "put the controversy to rest
once and for all".
</P>
<P>
Kiplagat had earlier stated that after the KAAA had spoken to
Lagat's Italian coach and manager, Rosa Gabrielle, the athlete had
been willing to join the team that leaves for Adelaide on August
10.
</P>
<P>
The other marathon runners in the Kenyan team are Kennedy
Cheruiyot and Eric Wainaina.

<HEADLINE> UNIFIL Begins Final, Full Deployment in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Interim Force in

Lebanon (UNIFIL) began the final and full deployment Saturday
morning in south Lebanon after getting permission from the Lebanese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman announced that the operation started from 6 a.m.
(0300 GMT) in 20 positions along the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL had put its troops in six positions several days ago
and the deployment suspended after the Lebanese government decided
to
verify the final border encroachment at Yaroun that was surrounded
by landmines.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Friday the verification process
of Israel's post-withdrawal border violations was over and the
peacekeeping forces were free to fan out across the liberated zone.
</P>
<P>
"We have been notified that the encroachment has been
terminated", Hoss said, adding that UNIFIL can now carry out the
deployment along the entire border line any time it deems proper.
</P>
<P>
Later on Friday, President Emile Lahoud also gave nod to the
UNIFIL's deployment in the south.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Middle East envoy Roed Larsen, who is mediating between
Beirut and Jerusalem in a bid to launch the UNIFIL deployment along
the border as soon as possible, released a statement in Beirut,
praising the cooperation of both sides with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister
Michel Murr will discuss with other Lebanese leaders the deployment
of a Lebanese joint task force of 500 army and 500 policemen in
south Lebanon. The task force is expected to start the deployment
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hezbollah, who controlled south Lebanon after
Israel's pullout on May 24, withdrew two observation post along the
border before UNIFIL's full deployment.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL was set up under U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 of
March 1978 to enter south Lebanon as soon as Israel withdrew from
the area, which it invaded in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government had delayed UNIFIL's full deployment
several times since the Israeli pullout, citing Israeli violations
of
the so-called "blue line", drafted by the United Nations to ensure
Israel's withdrawal fulfilled Security Council resolutions of 1978.

the desire of Manila to send a three-man police team to assist in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
A powerful car bomb exploded at the entrance of the residence
of Philippine ambassador Leonides Caday on Tuesday, killing two
persons and injuring some 20 others, including Caday.
</P>
<P>
The team is expected to join a special agent from the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation who arrived in Jakarta on Friday.
They are expected to help the Indonesian authorities go through
all the evidence gathered at the blast site to unmask those behind
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Ebdalin clarified that the Philippine police team is not being
sent to Jakarta to conduct its own probe on the case as the
Indonesian authorities still have not completed their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are reportedly looking at Indonesian supporters
of Philippines' Muslim rebels as the possible suspects in the
bombing.

<P>
MACAO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Asian champion China stormed back
from one game down to overwhelm the United States 3-1 here on
Saturday at the 2000 World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix China's
Macao Leg.
</P>
<P>
The scores are 25-27, 25-15, 25-16 and 25-21.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are making progress," said Chinese head coach Hu
Jin.
</P>
<P>
Hu explained that China lost the first game was mainly due to
its being too eager to win.
</P>
<P>
On the chances to beat China in the coming Olympics, Treinador
Principal, head coach of the U.S.team said it would pick a right
time.
</P>
<P>
The Americans opened a flying start by leading at 8-7 in the
first game, but after the first technical time-out, the Chinese
spikers found their defending and attacking rhythm, collecting
five points in a row and enlarging the advantage to 20-10.
</P>
<P>
But the fighting Americans stormed back to catch up and level
the score at 23-all with powerful spikes and solid blocks. After
saving one game point, the Chinese lost the set at 27-25.
</P>
<P>
Leading at 21-12 in the second game, China was again tested but
this time they did not repeat the defense errors occurred in the
first. Some sound defense allowed them to make a lot of fast
attacks that the Americans could not cope with.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese took the second at 25-15.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese kept their winning rhythm with delicate attacks and
firm defense, sealing the match 25-16 and 25-20 in 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In another match on Saturday, three-time winner Brazil showed
its superiority of attacking and blocking, finishing the match 37-
35, 25-18, 25-21 over the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
With two wins against no loss, China and Brazil are going to
vie for the title of the leg on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Oil-For-Food Program Fails to Meet Iraq's Needs: Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations oil-for-food
program, as an interim measure, has failed to meet the basic needs
of the Iraqi people, the official weekly Al-Rafidain reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's crude exports since 1996 have generated 28 billion U.S.
dollars, but Iraq received goods worth only 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, only 25 percent of
the oil revenue has been allocated for Iraqi people's humanitarian
needs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report accused the United States and British delegates at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the implementation of the
program by shelving vital contracts Iraq signed with foreign
countries to import humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
For example, only 62 percent of the medical contracts were
approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, and 40 agricultural
contracts worth 50 million dollars Iraq signed under the sixth
phase of the U.N.oil-for-food deal were put on hold.
</P>
<P>
The deal is just an interim measure and "should not be an
alternative for the overall and immediate lifting of the genocidal
embargo," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The deal is mere "a pretext to tighten measures of the embargo
clamped on Iraq since August 1990," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has launched an offensive against the U.N. program as Benon
Sevan, the U.N. oil-for-food executive director, began his two-week
visit to Iraq on August 1.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Sevan on Wednesday, Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammad Mehdi Salah said that the deal has been turned into a
program for covering expenses of U.N. activities and paying
reparations stemming from the 1991 Gulf War, instead of alleviating
the plight of Iraqi people reeling under 10 years of U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in
1990 and the end of it is still not in sight due to strong U.S.
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1996, the U.N. has allowed Iraq to export oil on
a renewable basis to buy food and medicines. The embargo will not
be lifted unless U.N. arms experts declare that Iraq is free of all
weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- A report made by Middle East News Agency said the results of
the recent talks by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Camp David uncovered the real
intentions of Israel concerning the holy city of Jerusalem, the
matter which led to failure of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian leadership held its weekly meeting in Gaza
last night to discuss the status of the peace talks with Israel and
the outcome of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's international

<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 rampaging Moro Islami
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels massacred 16 people, mostly
children, including a two-year-old child in a province in the
southern island of Mindanao early Friday evening, a military
report said.
</P>
<P>
It was the third massacre incident committed by the MILF in
Central Mindanao in a span of three weeks, killing 51 people in
all.
</P>
<P>
The report on the massacre was relayed to Armed Forces chief
of staff Gen. Angelo T. Reyes by Gov. Manny P. Pinol of North
Cotabato Province Saturday morning, according to the Philippines
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Pinol said in the report that a group of 100 heavily armed
MILF men stopped three passing vehicles carrying 26 passengers at
a place in Carmen, North Cotabato, early Friday evening, and
divested terrified passengers of their money, jewelry, and other
personal belongings before they were ordered to step out of the
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The rebels ordered the passengers to board their respective
vehicles and then shot them at close range, Pinol said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people were killed, mostly children, including a two-
year-old-boy and an eight-year-old girl, he added.

The governor denounced the MILF rebels for their "inhuman and
indiscriminate action" in killing innocent and defenseless
civilians and asked Gen. Reyes to "conduct a relentless pursuit
operation by our government forces and the police to ensure that
justice will be delivered to the victims."

<HEADLINE> Manila Won't File Protest Against Jakarta on Bombing: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A foreign ministry official said
Saturday that the Philippines will not file a diplomatic protest
over the bombing of the Philippine ambassador's residence in
Jakarta, Indonesia
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Willy Gaa told journalists
in a media forum that "the government is not thinking at this
moment this move against Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
A powerful car bomb exploded at the entrance of the residence
of Philippine ambassador Leonides Caday on Tuesday, killing two
persons and injuring some 20 others, including Caday.
</P>
<P>
"You only file diplomatic protest if you think that the host
government has anything to do with it. In this case, the
Indonesian government has shown, in fact, a very high level of
cooperation as far as the investigation of the incident is
concerned," Gaa said.
</P>
<P>
He said no less than Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has
issued a statement condemning the attack. "The Indonesian Vice
President and the governor of Jakarta personally visited Caday in
the hospital, so I don't think it will be appropriate (to file
diplomatic protest)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gaa also said that the Indonesian authorities are now running a
check on a particular group called Mujahiddin Khalq -- a group
which claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Philippine government said if necessary, it would
send an intelligence and diplomatic team to Indonesia to
coordinate with the authorities there and extend assistance in the
investigation of the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronald Zamora said Friday that the bombing
may have been committed by Indonesians with links to Philippines'
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

Zamora, quoting an Indonesian intelligence report, said, "the
report of the Indonesian intelligence authorities points to
Indonesians possibly with an MILF connection."
</P>
<P>
he said the bombers may have been trying to avenge the death of
some colleges during recent skirmishes between MILF guerrillas and
government troops, culminating in the military capture of MILF's
headquarters, Camp Abubakar in July.
</P>
<P>
"There were Indonesian separatists in Abubakar. We understand
some may be injured. That could be a motive," he explained.

JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian women's doubles
specialist Elysa Nathanael's leg injury worries partner Deyana
Lomban on their ambition to reach the semifinals in the Olympic
Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to reach the Olympics semifinals. But Elysa's injury
has spoiled our preparation as she will miss the Malaysian Open
next week," Deyana was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe our target sounds unrealistic but we are working hard to
reach it," Deyana said, adding that Chinese pairs are still the
best in the world.
</P>
<P>
Due to Elysa's injury, Deyana will partner Carmelita in
Malaysia. They reached the quarterfinals of the Thailand Open last
month before losing to world number one Ge Fei and Gu Jun of China.
</P>
<P>
"Elysa decided to miss the tournament to recover her physical
condition and focus her attention more on the Olympics. While I
need more competitive spirit before the Olympics so I opted to
compete in Malaysia," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Indonesian said she would partner Carmelita
after the Olympics as Elysa plans to retire after the quadrennial
event.
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll reach higher with Carmelita. We match one another
on and off court," she added.

MACAO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil met strong resistance from
the Japanese before clinching a 3-0 victory in the second round of
China's Macao leg of the 104 million-U.S.-dollar World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The match did not proceed as the easy score of 3-0 indicated.
Leading at 24-22 in the first game, three time winners Brazil
could not seal the match before the Japanese leveled the score at
24-all.
</P>
<P>
Then the match went to a see-saw game until the two sides drew
at 35-35. The Brazilians took the next crucial points by a spike
and a drop to take the game in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The score of the game is believed the highest one in women's
international volleyball tournament since the 25 points system
went in force from the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the following two games, the match also turned out to be a
tough match as the Brazilian spikers, physically more powerful
than their opponents, had to do their best to win the match with a
score of 37-35 25-18 and 25-21.
</P>
<P>
China is to meet the United States in the following match.

<HEADLINE> Expedition to Silk Road Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The expedition team to the
ancient "Silk Road", which is organized by the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH), today left Beijing for
treasured heritage sites in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six journalists from media organizations such as Xinhua
News Agency, the People's Daily and China Central Television, are
expected to tour many well-known spots along the desolated
commercial route and excavation sites in the coming 25 days in
Gansu Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The reporters are scheduled to start their westward journey
tomorrow from Gansu's Tianshui, which was believed birthplace of
legendary ancestors of Fuxi and Nuwa who lived 8,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
During their 5,000-km expedition, the reporters will also visit
Lanzhou, Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiayuguan, Anxi, Dunhuang, Hami, Shanshan,
Turpan, Korla, Kuqa, Kizil, Shihezi, Jimsar and Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
The "Silk Road", stretching through Tianshui, Lanzhou, Dunhuang,
Turpan and Urumqi, was the most important commercial route linking
prosperous central China with foreign countries in central Asia at
ancient times. The route is a treasure trove of cultural relics
and of China's heritage, archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
China is carrying out the drive to develop the west region.
Therefore, the SACH expected that the special expedition team will
help worldwide readers know more about the country's mysterious
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua staff reporters among the group will tell stories and
anecdotes about the journey. Internet-surfers could also catch
latest news through Xinhua's official website, www.xinhuanet.com.

<HEADLINE> Floods Affect Vietnam's Rice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A battering by unusual weather
patterns over the Mekong Delta, Vietnam's rice bowl, and many
other parts of Vietnam is likely to reduce the year's rice
production of the country by as much as 450,000 tons, local
English daily Vietnam News (VNS) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates put the country's total rice output for the
year at 31.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, early flooding of the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta,
reportedly the most severe in four decades, coupled with erratic
and unusual weather in other parts of the country, means
production will come in well below these targets.
</P>
<P>
During early flooding of the delta provinces of Dong Thap, Long
An, An Giang, Kien Giang and Can Tho, last month over 137,000
hectares of crops were inundated with 26,000 hectares totally
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy downpours in northern regions of the country
have already destroyed about 5,700 hectares of rice, and 1,000
hectares of upland crops and vegetables in Lao Cai, Tuyen Quang,
Vinh Phuc and Bac Giang.
</P>
<P>
While Vietnamese farmers have already produced 15.2 million
tons of rice in the winter-spring season, securing the remainder
of the year's rice target seems unlikely with further flooding
expected in the Cuu Long Delta and on-going risks of flooding and
insect damage to crops in northern areas, said VNS.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A joint trade commission (JTC)
between Myanmar and Thailand held its session here Friday to
review the economic development and bilateral trade between the
two countries under a memorandum of understanding signed in
February 1990, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Attending the second session of the JTC were Myanmar commercial
delegation, led by Commerce Minister Brigadier-General Pyi Sone,

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opens Homepage to Promote Thai-African Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Foreign Ministry has
opened a new homepage to specially promote trade and investment
between Thailand and countries in Africa, an official report said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in the report that the development of
the Thai-African homepage (www.mfa.go.th/Africa) was part of its
expanded role to help promote external trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Thai investors should now be aware of the potential of the
African region, as neighboring countries, namely Singapore,
Malaysia and India, have benefited from their pilot investment in
the region, particularly those in the automobile and electronic
industries, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that some countries in Africa have abundant
energy resources, including oil and natural gas, which could be
exchanged with other Thai products based on the traditional barter
trade.
</P>
<P>
Thai-African trade has steadily increased over the recent years.
Thai exports to Africa accounted for 44.94 billion baht (1.1
billion U.S. dollars ) over the past six years, with rice, ready-
made clothes, cement plastic products, footwares, and rubber
products being major exports; while imports from Africa touched 30.
29 billion baht (750 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Estrada Gets More Than Expected in U.S. Visit  by Chen Zhanjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada returned to Manila Saturday morning from his first
official working visit to the United States, a trip resulted in
more than expected fruits eyed by himself and some analysts.
</P>
<P>
During his U.S. journey which started on July 24, Estrada
obtained Washington's commitments on issues like the modernization
of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Mindanao insurgency,
and the possible remediation of contaminated sites that used to
house American facilities.
</P>
<P>
The commitments were mainly reflected in seven bilateral
agreements that cover defense and security, economic and
development cooperation, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed on July 27, the same date when
Estrada and U.S. President Bill Clinton held talks in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was very pleased with his talks with President
Clinton, adding that the discussion paved the way for cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In one of the major agreements, the United States agreed to
provide 105-million-U.S.- dollar military equipment to the
Philippines, a development that augurs well for the revitalization
of the Philippines-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries had somewhat been
affected by the 1991 termination of the Americans' lease on
various military installations in the Philippines, particularly
the Subic Bay Naval Facility and Clark Air Base.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines-U.S. relations were enhanced anew last year
with the Philippine Senate's approval of the Visiting Forces
Agreement, which Estrada had endorsed to bring back joint military
operations by Filipino and America soldiers, as well as port calls
by U.S. vessels.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the possible remediation of contaminated sites
that used to house American facilities, the two governments signed
a joint statement to cooperate on dealing with environmental and
public health problems in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines-U.S. joint statement on bilateral cooperation
on the environment and public health said the two countries will "
enhance the institutional and technical capacity of the
Philippines to address environmental and public health problems."
</P>
<P>
The statement was silent on the fate of toxic waste victims in
the vicinity of the former U.S. bases, saying vaguely that the
armed forces of both countries will "discuss ways to reduce the
environmental impact of peacetime military activities."
</P>
<P>
On Mindanao issue, Estrada got some support from the United
States. Estrada said he explained to Clinton why he pursued
military action against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The
United States also committed to providing 20-million-dollar food
aid to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president said Clinton was "very happy" about
the Philippine government's handling of the conflict with Moro
rebels in southern Philippines and "assured me of America's
support to our peace process" in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Selling the Philippines to U.S. investors was another major
agenda of Estrada's trip.
</P>
<P>
In addressing U.S. business executives and Filipino-Americans,
Estrada said that the Philippine economy is on the rebound and is
now a hot place for investment, particularly in e-commerce (
electronic commerce) that has defined the world's New Economy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the Philippines has the potential of becoming
"information technology (IT) services hub" of Asia, boasting a
highly skilled, English-speaking young workforce that was
considered among the world's best IT managers and professionals.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, Estrada discussed with Microsoft honcho Bill Gates
on the IT development in the Philippines. He also received 12
million U.S. dollars worth of software donation for some 1,000
public high schools in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said Estrada's U.S.
trip "is a defining moment not only for the century-old Philippine-
American relations but for the Estrada presidency as well."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts also said the U.S. trip has succeeded in setting
the tone for a more strategic partnership between these two long-
standing allies into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine president failed to get U.S.
commitments on several key issues between the two countries, such
as the clearing of former U.S. bases, the dumping of U.S. products
in the Philippines, and the compensation to Filipino war veterans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as U.S. President Clinton will step down from office
in next January and President Estrada has many difficult problems
to deal with at home, the future relations between the two
countries still remain to be seen.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Prepares for Assembly's Annual Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- As Indonesia's national flag of "
the Merah Putih" was hoisted at the front yard of the Parliament
Building in South Jakarta, various big posters were put up to
welcome the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) annual session to
be held from August 7 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day session, seen as an important event for the country'
s future development, will listen to President Abdurrahman Wahid's
working report and make amendments to some articles of the 1945
constitution including a direct election for the country's
president and vice president in the 2004 general election.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian people, who have been waiting for the
forthcoming annual session of the MPR, the country's highest law-
making body, hoped that an active result could be produced by the
Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
The session will be the first ever staged by the Assembly
within one year after it was established. An assembly session used
to be held once every five years.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Assembly's office said that in a bid to make the
meeting successful, at least 1,400 people have been hired during
the session along with 250 employees of the Assembly's secretariat.
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 security forces, military and police officers are
being deployed to help secure the session and safeguard the
participants of the Assembly, while as many as 1,884 local
journalists and 262 foreign journalists are expected to cover the
event.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the National Police General Roesdihardjo
has also said that the police will deploy at least 68,000
personnel nationwide to back up the session, and in the capital
itself 19,000 police personnel and 4,000 military personnel will
be deployed to protect Jakarta against any unexpected incidents.
</P>
<P>
It seems that many parties at home and abroad really want to
know what is going to happen during the session.
</P>
<P>
Some people, particularly those who supported Wahid in the last
October presidential election, are worried about an impeachment
motion against the president voiced earlier by some MPR members.
</P>
<P>
Since May this year, the political struggle among the rival
parties has been going on in the country as the political and
economic reforms launched by the government had encroached on the
interests of the people of "status quo" headed by former president
Soeharto. They criticized Wahid for his failure in dealing with
thorny problems facing the country like the prolonged economic and
political crisis and wide spread communal conflicts in various
areas which have claimed thousands of lives and damaged the
country's social and economical infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economic Growth Reaches 4.13 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
announced that the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
second quarter increased by 4.13 percent over the same period of
1999.
</P>
<P>
"It exceeded forecasts of 3.4 percent growth and the first
quarter's revised target of 3.6 percent, Kusmadi Saleh, deputy
chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP grew at a meager level of 0.38 percent in the April-
June period, much lower than the quarterly growth level of 2.36
percent in the previous quarter. "But if compared to the same
period last year, the growth rate reached 4.13 percent," Antara
news agency Saturday quoted Kusmadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the major contribution to the GDP growth in the second
quarter were the non- oil industries, utility sector and
construction as well as services.
</P>
<P>
The report is quite surprising as the country has been hit by
heightening political and security tensions.
</P>
<P>
Following the outbreak of the regional currency turmoil in mid-
1997 and the downfall of former president Soeharto in May 1998,
the country's GDP shrank 0.2 percent in 1999 and 13 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Kusmadi said he was upbeat that the GDP growth in the third
quarter would continue to show a positive trend, but refused to
disclose any figures.

The firm measures include shooting on sight any rioters,
Jakarta police chief Inspector General Nurfaizi said.

<P>
He also said that his personnel would prohibit any rallies or
protests breaching the law and disperse any groups staging
protests without previously notifying the police as ruled by a
prevailing law.
</P>
<P>
The police will, however, first adopt a persuasive approach in
all of their actions to avoid unrest.

"As long as the personnel act in line with standard operating
procedures, everything will be OK," he was quoted by the Jakarta

</P>
<P>
Jakarta will be packed by some 66,300 security personnel,
including those from other provincial police forces, to help

Attorney General's Office (AGO) spokesman Yushar Yahya said
that Soeharto's dossier, which is now at the Jakarta High
Prosecutor's office, will be filed at the South Jakarta court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The indictment and a dossier detailing the case will be
submitted to a judge in the South Jakarta District Court on Monday,
" he was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the AGO declared Soeharto as a defendant in
corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutors said Soeharto, 79, would be charged with
corruption for the misuse of 1.4 trillion rupiah (150 million U.S.
dollars) from seven charities controlled during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
No less than 150 witnesses will be summoned to the courtroom
including nine expert witnesses from the Jakarta-based University
of Indonesia's Legal Study Center and one expert witness from the
State Audit Board.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the South Jakarta Court will decide a team of judges
who will handle Soeharto's case.
</P>
<P>
Yahya said it was not certain whether the ailing Soeharto, who
is under house arrest, would attend Monday's court hearing, which
will be largely procedural.
</P>
<P>
"That depends on the judge," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Denny Kailimang, a member of Soeharto's legal
defense team, said his client would not be in court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down from his presidential office
in May 1998 following an economic and political crisis in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy's public debt reached 2,497.2
trillion liras (1.25 trillion U.S. dollars) by the end of April, 7.
6 trillion (3.8 billion dollars) more than the highest record set
last September, the Central Bank of Italy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the public debt has kept rising since
this February. By the end of April, it increased 1.7 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union's statistics showed that Italy's
public debt continued to grow in the past four months. Its
foreign debt reached 149.8 trillion liras (75 billion dollars) by
the end of July, the highest of the past several years. Its civil
debt is 2,298 trillion liras (1.15 trillion dollars), just 2
trillion (1 billion dollars) less than that of last October.
</P>
<P>
The soaring debt burden makes it difficult for Italy to realize
the promise of cutting the proportion of the public debt in its
gross national product to meet the criteria required to join the
European single currency.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Chief Warns of Excessive Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have exceeded their oil
production quota by 200,000 to 700,000 barrels per day and that
will lead to a further decrease of the oil price, Venezuelan
Petroleum and Mine Minister Ali Rodriques said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC leadership are waiting for a report on the
implementation of the agreement on production hikes by OPEC
members, said Rodrigques, who is also the rotating OPEC chairman.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members agreed to produce an additional 500,000 barrels of
oil per day, raising the overall oil output to 25.4 million
barrels per day during a ministerial meeting late March in Vienna,
Austria. The agreement excluded the oil production in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rodriques said that he will accompany Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez on a visit to 10 OPEC members and discuss the issue with
leaders of those countries.
</P>
<P>
The energy ministers from Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia
will not meet before the scheduled meeting by all OPEC members in
September, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique released by the Venezuelan Petroleum
and Mine Ministry, OPEC oil price has decreased to 26.12 U.S.
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Though the price is acceptable, Rodriques expressed worries
that the price will slump further.

BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is building a "man-made
peninsular" into the sea to increase the size of its deepwater
docks, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Gao Wenzhong, director of Shanghai Man-
made Half Island Building and Development Co Ltd, as saying that
Shanghai lacks deep-water port facilities, which is hampering the
city's attempts to become an international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
The company is sponsoring the project designed to reclaim about
9,840 ha of land from the sea with a total investment of 1.8
billion yuan (130 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The peninsula will stretch from Shi Pile Port, in eastern
Shanghai's Nanhui District, to the north of Hangzhou Bay in a 30-
km-long belt.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, which was completed in June
reclaimed 2,460 ha of land at a cost of 200 million Yuan (24.15
million US dollars). It will be a harbor handling area.
</P>
<P>
The other two phases of the project are due to be completed by
June 2002. Shanghai will by then have about 38.7 square kilometers
more dock area.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's port is now the biggest in China, handling about 4.
22 million TEUs (Twenties Equivalent Units) of containers last
year. Up until July this year, the volume of freight it handled
had reached about 3.05 million TEUs, 35.8 percent more than the

United Nations, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in response to a move by Senegal and a few
other countries, which on August 3 (New York time) wrote to the UN
secretary-general asking for the 55th General Assembly of the UN
to consider Taiwan's "participation" in the UN. Those countries

</P>
<P>
-- The State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Ministry of
Education issued a circular, calling for improving vocational
education in China's ethnic minority regions.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that "experiences in the past two decades
show that reliance on science and technology, as well as education,
is an inevitable route for the economic rejuvenation of China's
ethnic minority regions".
</P>
<P>
By 1997, the total number of students enrolled by secondary
vocational schools in minority regions was much less than the that
of students at senior middle schools. The layout of vocational
schools and the curricula could not meet the needs of minority
regions.
</P>
<P>
"For comparatively developed minority regions, efforts should
be made to help the junior and senior middle school students to
learn techniques applicable to modern agriculture."
</P>
<P>
-- China Southern Airlines, one of China's major civil aviation
companies, took over a provincial aviation company.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a national pillar aviation company
took over a local aviation company since the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, also known as CAAC,
announced that China would form three big airline groups-- Air
China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The local aviation company, Zhongyuan Airlines, was founded by
central China's Henan Province in 1986. The total asset of the
local company was 1.46 billion yuan. The company has five Boeing
737s and two home-made aircraft in operation. It offers more than
100 flights each week. It has had no air crashes in the past 14

medical policies announced by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Private hospitals are also exempted from business tax, and
their self-made drugs are free from value-added tax during the

<HEADLINE> China's Private Hospitals to Fix Own Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China is carrying out a reform of
the medical sector, which is expected to benefit patients' health
and pockets, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Sino-overseas joint-venture hospitals are now allowed to set
their own prices for medical services, according to the new
medical policies announced by the Ministry of Health yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Private hospitals are also exempted from business tax, and
their self-made drugs are free from value-added tax during the
first three years the hospitals are running, but only if the money
they generate is used to improve medical care.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health set out a series of reforms and has
divided the health-care system into two parts, profit-making and
non-profit making, said Liu Xinming, director of the ministry's
Planning and Financial Department.
</P>
<P>
Profit-making hospitals, including Sino-foreign joint-ventures,
private clinics and shareholding hospitals, are permitted to fix
their medical service prices according to the actual cost of a
service and the demand for it.
</P>
<P>
However, independent drug retail shops separate from these
profit-making hospitals should pay duties according to law. When
the three-year period expires, all the hospitals will pay taxes as
required by law.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show there are 18 joint-venture hospitals
and more than 60 jointly-funded clinics in China. Solely foreign-
funded hospitals and clinics are still not permitted in China.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: SADC Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming summit meeting
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in the
Namibian capital of Windhoek on Sunday and Monday is expected to
give a go-ahead for the implementation of the free trade agreement
on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Free Trade Agreement is widely seen as a significant
drive towards regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
SADC was established on August 17, 1992 in Windhoek, Namibia
when the member countries of the former Southern African
Development Coordination Conference signed an agreement to give
green light to form SADC, which was aimed to step up the economic
integration in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
It has become a 14-nation regional bloc, including Angola,
Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
SADC member countries began negotiations on cutting trade
tariffs after SADC leaders agreed in August 1996 to establish a
free trade zone in the southern African region, which now has a
total population of nearly 200 million.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999 trade ministers from SADC member states held a
meeting in Gaborone, Botswana and signed the SADC Free Trade
Agreement, originally set to be implemented by January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The agreement envisages that 85 percent of SADC trade will be
liberalized by 2008 and the remaining 15 percent will be tariff-
free by 2012.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the big divergences on tariff elimination for
textile products, the implementation of the free trade agreement
was delayed twice, from January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2000 and then
to September 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Except Angola, DRC, Seychelles and Zambia, 10 other SADC
countries have generally concluded the preparatory work to
implement the free trade agreement on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Angola, DRC and Seychelles have yet to sign the trade agreement
while Zambia has signed but not yet ratified it.
</P>
<P>
However, the SADC Executive Secretariat still hopes that the
four nations will begin implementing the free trade agreement by
January 1, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Fuel Supply to Be Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The continuing running-short of
fuel supply in Nigeria will be much improved with the re-
production of the Port Harcourt Refinery in the southern River
state following a turn-around maintenance, a senior government
official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said the Port Harcourt
Refinery, currently under production at 91 percent installed
capacity, would be fully operational by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The re-production would ease off the fuel shortage in eastern
parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said the importation of fuel would
continue until all refineries go into full operation.
</P>
<P>
He called on his fellow Nigerians to be patient because the
turn-around maintenance campaign being effected in the country's
refineries needs to be done properly.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to oil-producing communities to assist the
NNPC to arrest the pipeline vandalization by enlightening the
people on the risks concerned.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the biggest oil-producing country in Africa with a
daily output of over 2 million barrels, but it has to depend on
the importation of fuel to meet the domestic market because of the
collapse of three of the country's four refineries.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Accord to Be signed on August 28: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Peace in Burundi is just a
few weeks away, said former South African president Nelson Mandela
here on Friday after talks with visiting Burundi President Pierre
Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
He said the Burundian peace process has made "tremendous
progress" and he is encouraged that everything is going smoothly
according to plan.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, he is confident "we will be able to
remove all impediments before August 28", the scheduled date for
all warring parties in Burundi to sign a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Buyoyo described the talks with Mandela as very positive,
saying "we have agreed on a way of working that will propel peace
negotiations forward."
</P>
<P>
Mandela was appointed mediator for the seven-year conflict in
Burundi last December to succeed the late former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Burundian government and opposition
leaders stalled last month over the release of political prisoners
and the implementation of the forthcoming peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Mandela indicated that he has asked President Thabo Mbeki to
take time to meet his Burundian counterpart over the matter, which
he regarded as very important.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya is due to meet South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma
on Saturday.

The drop follows the positive trend of the last few months and

Large and medium-sized companies have been doing particularly
well recently. However, the catering industry remains the most
precarious. One in every hundred caterers went bankrupt this year,

MEXICO CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President-elect
Vicent Fox will visit  Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay from
Sunday to Friday to meet with the presidents of those countries
and explore trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The conservative National Action Party (PAN) winning candidate
will travel with a numerous retinue of businessmen and his team of
foreign relations advisors.
</P>
<P>
Fox announced, after defeating the candidate of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that has governed Mexico
for the last 71 years since 1929, that he is going to change in a
significant way the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He has announced his purposes of strengthening his country's
relations with its Latin American neighbors, especially with the
group that makes up the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and of
implementing a change of strategy toward the United States,
especially in what concerns the war against drug trafficking and
illegal emigration.
</P>
<P>
A few days after his triumph, Fox commented that the ideal
would be to include into four biggest Latin American economies -
- Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico -- to promote the growth of
the region in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect bets to create in the long term a great and
unique American market similar to the one formed by the European
Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay make up Mercosur, and
Chile and Bolivia have free trade agreements with the group
awaiting the possibility of a full integration in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur has become the third largest commercial bloc in the
world, with more than 210 million consumers and a global gross
domestic product of more than 1 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Strong earthquakes, jolting Russia
's Far East region of Sakhalin Saturday, has caused great damage
to local houses with no casualties reported so far, the Russian
Emergency Situations Ministry said in a latest announcement.
</P>
<P>
Three underground tremors rocking the Sakhalin Island Saturday
morning with a maximum measure of 7.0 degrees on the Richter scale
decimated the island's housing sector. The first earthquake struck
the island at 8:13 a.m. local time (2113 GMT Friday) and was felt
in the entire island, said the ministry press service.
</P>
<P>
In the Tomarin district of the region, 1,073 houses were
damaged, 14 of them beyond repair. In the Uglegor district 108
buildings were damaged, 10 of them have to be demolished. Quake
damage in other districts is being calculated.
</P>
<P>
At the earthquake's epicenter on Sakhalin, about 200 kilometers
north of the regional administrative center Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on
the border between the districts of Makarov and Poronai, the
tremors measured up to seven points on the Richter scale with a
top quake intensity of 8.0 to 8.5 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The press service said that a group from the ministry has
arrived in Sakhalin from Moscow to estimate the damage and the

<HEADLINE> Ships Collision in Uruguay Leaves 8 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The collision between an
Uruguayan ship and a Panamanian merchant early Saturday left eight
people dead, said the commander-in-chief of the Uruguayan fleet,
Rear Admiral Raul Lecumberry.
</P>
<P>
The "Valiente" minesweeper, which was performing vigilance
tasks across the Uruguayan coast, was rammed by the Panamanian
freighter "Skyros" of 21,000 tons at 4:35 local time Saturday
south of Cabo Polonio off the Rocha department.
</P>
<P>
The strong impact opened a leak in the engine room and the ship
sank in eight minutes. This is one of the worst accidents in the
history of the Uruguayan Navy since its creation in 1825, said
Lecumberry.
</P>
<P>
The "Valiente" minesweeper has a crew of 24 -- seven officers
and 17 mariners, of whom 13 were rescued alive, eight died, and
three were unaccounted for, said the officer.
</P>
<P>
Lecumberry explained that the accident was caused by the dense
fog because "visibility in the area was practically nil."
</P>
<P>
The minesweeper was launched on December 22, 1972, and is 56.76
meters long, 7.8 meters wide, and displaces 516 tons.

BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Belgian police officers have
complained about the lack of Dutch cooperation in combating
illegal drug trafficking, according to local press reports over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A federal police officer said that the Dutch police do
virtually nothing to investigate the organizers of the drug
runners caught in Brussels international airport.
</P>
<P>
A Brussels magistrate said that his requests for assistance

<P>
Meanwhile, the Dutch authorities admitted there is a problem in
anti-drug cooperation between the two countries and the Dutch
government has taken measures to deal with foreign requests for
assistance more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Now, Belgium has become the country through which drugs from
Surinam and Curacao pass to reach the Netherlands. Flights to
Brussels international airport are cheaper than flights to
Schiphol airport in the Netherlands.

Since the beginning of the year, there have been direct flights

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will not attend the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit meeting, a
senior official in the SADC Secretariat confirmed on Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, the news followed
several days of uncertainty over whether Kabila will show at the
meeting, at which the faltering DRC peace process is expected to
be a focus of discussion.
</P>
<P>
Co-ordinator of the DRC peace process and Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba said earlier on Sunday when he arrived at
Windhoek Eros Airport that he was still unsure whether Kabila will
join the rest 13 SADC leaders.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it will be a setback for the peace process if
Kabila did not arrive, Chiluba said: "I guess it may just be a
little delay. But I am sure he realizes the importance of this as
much as we all do and I think he will avail himself to an
opportunity that will put things back on track."
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't come perhaps we will decide I must travel to go
and see him or we make other arrangements for other heads of state.
This is a critical question for all of us," Chiluba added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is scheduled to meet Kabila in the southern DRC town of
Lubumbashi earlier next week.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Has Not Arrived Namibia for SADC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has not arrived in
Windhoek, Namibia, for the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) summit meeting, Namibian Foreign Affairs Minister Theo-Ben
Gurirab said on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking at Windhoek Eros Airport, Gurirab, who is
also current president of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly,
also denied that a no-show by Kabila will not be regarded as a
snub to SADC, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"SADC is also his organization, so it will not be a snub at all.
He will have missed an opportunity to talk to his brothers and
friends to inform them about the current situation in his own
country," Gurirab noted.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Kabila would come because the summit is as
important for him as it is for the rest of SADC.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said the summit will try to find ways of getting
parties to the DRC conflict to implement the Lusaka peace accord
signed in July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Kabila's rejection to facilitator Ketumile Masire,
the former Botswana president chosen by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) to speed up DRC's peace process, the minister
said: "There are areas of disagreement. Our leaders are here to
establish whether indeed these are disagreement or
misunderstandings."
</P>
<P>
"If indeed there are misunderstandings, they have to be
clarified. If there are disagreements, we have to identify them,
making all parties engaged in dialog and find solutions."

<HEADLINE> Mobile Telephone Welcome in Ethiopian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Mobile telephone, absolutely
new to residents in Ethiopian capital just one year ago, is
becoming a best-seller on the market in the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation (ETC), currently sole
importer and distributor of cellphones in Ethiopia, has to start
to turn away mobile customers because it is running short of the
mobiles, ETC sources disclosed recently.
</P>
<P>
ETC imported 20,000 mobile terminals in 1999 which saw the
launch of mobile phone service in the capital. So far, 19,500
subscribers have contracted to receive mobile service from the
company.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 500 terminals have to be reserved as spare parts
until a new batch of mobiles imported from abroad, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of mobile telephone in Addis Ababa is in a way to
promote a reform of the telecommunication industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate the development of national telecommunication
industry, the issue of allowing other companies to import and sell
mobile terminals has been studied by the Prime Minister's Office,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mobile telephone service, data
communications and internet service, all currently belonging to
the ETC, will possibly privatized within one year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) has put off making a decision on the
keenly-awaited restructuring of the organization, chairman of its
ministers' council Leonardo Simao said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Windhoek, Namibia, Simao, who
is also Mozambican Foreign Affairs Minister, told South African
Press Association there has not been enough time for SADC member
states to weigh up the "very complex" proposals they received only
at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council will present a progress report to the SADC
heads of state summit meeting, which will start on Sunday
afternoon, and ask to be allowed to continue working on the
proposals until it has a final product.
</P>
<P>
At the 14-nation regional bloc's summit meeting in Maputo in
August 1999, the heads of state set a six-month deadline for
finalization of the restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
However, that work of submitting restructuring plan in fact
only began in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposals include a restructuring of SADC's controversial
security organ, which is said to be put it firmly under the
control of the parent body, and a plan to remove sectoral
responsibilities from individual states and locate them in the
SADC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Simao also announced that the SADC member states' arrears
contributions have dropped from 11 million U.S. dollars a few
years ago to 6 million at present.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition that depicts
ancient Ethiopian religion and colorful icon painting in the
Middle Ages was opened in the capital of Ethiopia Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On display are 95 pieces of ancient cultural relics, mainly
wooden diptyches and bronze professional crosses which could be
dated back to 13th-19th century.
</P>
<P>
"These cultural relics were collected in the past two years
from individuals abroad, mainly from France, Vice Education
Minister Teklehaimanot Haileselassie told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia, now with a population
of 62 million, has a history of civilization for 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to countless number of historical relics in
Ethiopia, there are tens of thousands of pieces of ancient
handicraft scattered abroad, Teklehaimanot said.
</P>
<P>
One of the most well-known historical relics remain outside
Ethiopia is a 28-meter-high obelisk looted during the Italian
occupation of Ethiopia during 1936-1941.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has agreed to returned the 400-ton
monument to Ethiopia, but due to technical problems, it takes time
before the obelisk is back, the vice minister said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 representatives from the Ethiopian government and
local Christian churches, and diplomats based in Addis Ababa
participated in the inauguration of the exhibition.

<HEADLINE> SADC Countries to Sign Water-Sharing Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of southern African
countries are looking at diverting the mighty rivers of the region
to make the deserts bloom, South African Press Association said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The presidents from the 14 countries of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to meet on Sunday and Monday, are
expected to sign a broad agreement on sharing water, a project
that will take many years and necessitate outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on managing the water of the Orange River, which
rises deep in southern Africa in the Lesotho highlands and empties
into the Atlantic on the South Africa-Namibia border, was
scuppered on Saturday by last-minute technical objections by
Lesotho. But experts will look at diverting water from the vast
Congo River into the Orange.
</P>
<P>
The project, with water also diverted from South Africa's Vaal
River, will see the Molopo River in Botswana and the Nossob River
along the border between Botswana and Namibia flowing again after
many years as dry beds.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's Water Affairs Minister Boometswe Mokgothu said that
will benefit what is now "basically desert."
</P>
<P>
"We need a lot of water in our country. Agriculture will come
into force, wildlife will come up, and tourism will be revived."

<HEADLINE> Congo Peace Process to Continue: Zambian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said efforts to complete the ceasefire peace process in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will continue despite
President Laurent Kabila's negative attitude.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said on Sunday that member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) would continue to push for a
ceasefire in the country. He made the remarks before leaving for
Windhoek, Namibia, for a SADC summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC countries would continue arranging meetings with
Kabila to convince him about the importance of sticking to the
Lusaka Peace Agreement signed last year because he was that
country's president and his contribution was very important.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was commenting on reports by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) which quoted the Congolese leader as having said
he would not attend the SADC meeting.
</P>
<P>
The President said SADC would at the meeting in Namibia revisit
the issue on the conflict in the DRC and get the dialog moving for
the benefit of that country's people.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba however said the issue of Kabila not attending the
meeting in Namibia where it was hoped the Congo conflict would be
talked about, would be critically looked at by the SADC member
states.
</P>
<P>
And speaking when he made a brief stop-over in Lusaka on Sunday,
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said he would be immensely
disappointed if Kabila did not turn up for the SADC meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the whole lot of the SADC region was geared to recover
the momentum in trying to find a solution to the Congo conflict
and Kabila's absence would be a major setback.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa described the Namibian meeting as a critical one in
trying to review and remove the obstacles to the Lusaka Peace
process.

<HEADLINE> SADC Calls for Cheaper Anti-AIDS Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Development Community's (SADC) council of ministers has thrown its
weight behind a call for western pharmaceutical companies to offer
cheaper anti-AIDS drugs to SADC countries, South African Press
Association reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The council's decision, taken at its meeting in Windhoek,
Namibia, followed a recommendation by regional health ministers
advocating a "holistic" approach to the drug offer.
</P>
<P>
SADC health sector co-ordinator Thuthula Balfour said the
ministers have developed a minimum package of services that will
have to be provided if anti-AIDS drugs are used.
</P>
<P>
She said SADC member states will use the minimum package in
negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies that have offered
discounts of anti-AIDS drugs to poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing chairman of the council of ministers and Mozambican
Foreign Affairs Minister Leonardo Simao said the SADC member
states have agreed that the western pharmaceutical companies
should work with SADC and the United Nations (UN) to try to be "as
comprehensive as possible" and provide not only medicines but the
whole range of services needed to make these interventions
effective.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Assures Conductive Environment for Regional Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has pledged
conductive environment for strategic investors in the Mtwara
Development Corridor (MtDC) connecting Tanzania and its southern
African neighbors so as to attract more funds for the project.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers here on Sunday quoted the Vice-President Omar Ali
Juma as saying that the government is committed to create enabling
environment for investment, including attractive and acceptable
fiscal regime in the economic zone, which is located in Tanzania's
southern Mtwara region.
</P>
<P>
Opening a one-day National Consultative Committee for the
Mtwara Development Corridor here on Saturday, the vice-president
challenged investors in the country to expand their investment
portfolio in projects with potentials in the corridor area.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed projects of mine exploitation, power
production and transmission, development of Mtwara Port and road
construction will help to develop southern regions economically.
</P>
<P>
Juma affirmed the government's commitment to ensure that the
proposed projects were executed at the earliest time to speed up
economic and social development of southern part of the country
and the neighboring countries of Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said involvement of these countries is a great incentive to
investors because it embodies the spirit of sub-regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Mtwara Development Corridor is a possible heaven for transit
trade, which can help member countries in this era of
globalization to acquire an effective voice through maximum joint
utilization of our potentials," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The MtDC is one of the development initiatives established
within the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) with the
focus of fostering the socioeconomic development and integration
by unlocking the underdeveloped potential in the corridor area.
</P>
<P>
The corridor will be a shortcut for the transportation of goods
from the Indian Ocean to the landlocked Malawi and Zambia. It is
also expected to spur the economic development of the forgotten
areas in northern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
However, shortage of funds has hampered the project.
Bureaucracy, poor infrastructure and inadequate facilities are
also cited as a snag to investors in the project.

KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan National Agricultural
Research Organization (NARO) has petitioned the Parliament to ask
the government to have a long term policy on irrigation to

"The technology for irrigation is known but the problem is
investment. We ask Parliament to encourage government to have a
long term policy," NARO Director General Joseph Mukiibi was quoted

appealed to the government to avail them with the proper improved
seeds.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is an agricultural country with over 80 percent of

Famine and food shortage have loomed in many parts of the east
Africa country. In the northeastern region of Uganda, over 100
people reportedly died of starvation due to the drought-caused
famine.

ADDIS ABABA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian health authorities
denied at weekend reports that the epidemic meningitis is
circulating in the capital of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The Health Bureau of the Addis Ababa Administration said
Saturday that meningitis has not surfaced on a scale of epidemic
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Only 175 people were diagnosed positive with the meningitis
during an 18-week follow-up conducted to assess the extent of the
disease in the capital, the bureau chief Eyob Kamil told local
press, noting the number did not indicate meningitis outbreak on
the scale of pandemic.
</P>
<P>
According to a criterion set by the World Health Organization,
epidemic is 15 infections per week in every 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Eyob, however, said that the number of infections identified
was higher than what had been the case during the rainy seasons.
</P>
<P>
He said his bureau is doing preparations to provide
vaccinations against the disease in the event of any possible
meningitis outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Vaccinations have been provided in prisons, camps, orphanages
and hospitals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis, a fatal and air-borne disease, is reported to be
spreading among most of the countries below the Sahara in a period
varying from eight to 10 years.

BOGOTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) said Saturday that the impending visit
of U.S. President Bill Clinton is the beginning of a direct
Washington intervention in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This visit (of Clinton to Colombia) is not the visit of a

<P>
"It is the visit of a president that has been intervening in a

approaching," said Lozada.

Clinton announced Friday that he will visit Colombia on August
30, where he will underscore the support of the United States to
the search for peace, the combat to drug trafficking, the
construction of the economy, and the intensification of democracy
in the country.
</P>

<P>
BRASILIA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Environment and
Renewable Natural Resources Institute (Ibama) has fined with 277,
000 U.S. dollars each of the two ships involved in a spillage of
crude in the south of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Ibama decided to fine because it was proven that human failure
caused the accident Tuesday near the La Paz island in the north of
the Santa Catarina state, said an institute spokesman in
statements quoted Saturday by the press.
</P>
<P>
The 345-liter oil spillage occurred when a cargo ship from
Chipre was being refueled in the high seas by a boat chartered by
the Petroleos de Brasil (Petrobras) state oil firm.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras technicians immediately implemented an operation to
reduce the damage and deployed contention booms.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Francisco do Sul port authority said that the fuel
spilled was recovered in time and did not contaminate the beaches
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Each of the two countries will pay 277,000 dollars. Ibama
technicians in Santa Catarina will intensify the supervision of
fuel resupplying in the high seas to prevent other accidents.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian authorities are making efforts to eliminate pollution.
</P>
<P>
On July 17, the Brazilian government fined the state oil
company Petrobras with 28 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the worst oil spill in a quarter century, more than 4
million liters of crude oil spewed from a burst pipeline on July
16 at the Getulio Vargas refinery in Araucaria, some 700
kilometers southwest of Rio de Janeiro. Most of it spilled into a
tributary of the Iguacu River, which runs through the state to the
world-famous Iguacu Falls, near Brazil's border with Argentina and
Paraguay.
