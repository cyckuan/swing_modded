<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Republican Juvenile Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday condemned a Republican bill as "the same old rhetoric
without any prevention."
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was passed Thursday by the
Republican-controlled House of Representatives, orders adult
trials for violent Americans barely in their teens.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, on a week-long trip to Latin America and the
Caribbean, taped his address in San Jose, Costa Rica before flying
to Barbados on Friday
</P>
<P>
In his address, Clinton criticized the bill for lacking
crime-prevention programs. "It walks away from the crime
prevention initiatives that can save a teen-ager from a life of
crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Republican bill is the "same old rhetoric
without any prevention, without any change in the environment to
make it harder for gangs to function, or without real toughness in
every state in America.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the juvenile crime bill by a vote of 286-132,
sending it to the Senate, where the Judiciary Committee is
preparing to work on a bill that also envisions more adult trials
of juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
Under the House bill, adult trials of youths as young as 14
would become routine for federal crimes including murder, rape,
aggravated assault, armed robbery and major drug offenses.

<HEADLINE> Over  800 Killed in Strong Quake in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 were killed and 5,000
others injured in a strong earthquake which rocked eastern Iran
today.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Qa'en governor's office said that 80 out
of 150 villages in the region, about 800 kilometers east of
Tehran, were destroyed by 80 percent while the others damaged up
to 60 percent in the 7.1 magnitude quake.
</P>
<P>
The quake-stricken rural areas of Qa'en had a population of
more than 40,000, according to a report by the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The wounded people are being rushed to hospitals in Birjand,
Gonabad, Ferdows, Bidokht and Mashhad, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that some 30 aftershocks jolted Birjand
of Khorasan province until 16:00 hours local time (11:30 GMT)
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported that the quake occurred at 12:28 hours local time
today.
</P>
<P>
The Geophysics Institute of Mashhad reported that the epicenter
of the quake was 370 kilometers southeast of the provincial
capital of Mashhad, near the Iran-Afghanistan border.
</P>
<P>
Qa'en Governor Mojtaba Sadeqian called for the dispatch of
medical assistance including ambulances to the area.
</P>
<P>
He said that the quake has wreaked havoc on the rural areas at
the foot of Qa'en mountain which is close to the epicenter of the
quake.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the tremor has inflicted substantial
damage on the region, also shaking three neighboring provinces of
Sistan-Baluchestan, Kerman and Yazd in central and southeastern
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile head of the provincial headquarters for natural
disasters Seyed Mahdi Siadati said that his organization has
already set up disaster management centers in the quake-hit region
and the first groups of relief workers have been rushed to rescue
the victims.
</P>
<P>
That was the third strong earthquake within four months this
year. A total of 965 people were killed and more than 2,600
wounded in the deadly earthquake which rocked Ardebil in
northeastern Iran on February 28.
</P>
<P>
The quake measuring six degrees on the Richter scale was
followed by over 350 aftershocks, the most powerful of which had
a magnitude of 5.5.
</P>
<P>
On February 4, a quake measuring 6.1 degrees on the Richter
scale jolted northern Khorasan province, killing a total of 86
people and injuring hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 villages suffered varied degrees of destruction, some
totally razed. Over 11,000 houses were damaged, forcing thousands
of inhabitants to become homeless.

<HEADLINE> School Teacher Arrested for Pedophile in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A 59-year-old retired school teacher
was arrested on Tuesday in Nevers, central France, for having
raped dozens of schoolchildren over the past 30 years, according
to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Jacky Kaisersmertz, who was described by local people as
"gentlemanly" and active in sports activity of the local
community, lured school boys into his home and raped or sexually
assaulted dozens of them in a period dating from 1966 until
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The case was first uncovered by the suicide of a 27-year-old
policeman, Thierry Debain, who once told his parents that he was
raped by Kaisersmertz when he was eight and 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
Kaisersmertz used to teach gymnastics in a school in the town
of Cosne-sur-Loire, in the central department of Nievre.
</P>
<P>
Debain suffered from psychological torment after he grew up and
was perpetually worrying about losing his job as a member of the
elite anti-riot Compagnie Republicain de Securite, according to
his parents.
</P>
<P>
He committed suicide on January 26, 1997, and left a note in
his room which said: "Kaisersmertz, raper of children, is my
enemy."

<HEADLINE> Irish INLA Claims Responsibility for Policeman Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A terrorist group in Northern
Ireland claimed responsibility for the killing of an off-duty
policeman Friday night, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), an outlawed Catholic
extremist group, made the claim in a telephone call to the BBC
using a recognized codeword in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"We executed the policeman last night in the Parliament Bar,"
an INLA call said over the phone.
</P>
<P>
Two gunmen approached policeman Darren Bradshaw in a crowded
Belfast bar in the city center and shot him with a number of
bullets, killing him on the spot and then fleeing away.
</P>
<P>
The INLA was formed in 1975 and has killed many British
security forces personnel in the 30-year Northern Ireland
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army, another anti-British guerrilla
group, denied involvement in the killing.

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK Talks Break Down With No Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Representatives form the United
States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea(DPRK) have
ended their talks here with no agreement reached on cooperation in
accounting for American soldiers missing from the 1950-53 Korean
War, the U.S. delegation said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held in an undiscovered location in New York, broke
off late Friday after six days of meetings between the U.S.
delegation led by James W. Wold, Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Prisoners and Missing Personnel, and the DPRK
delegation led by Ambassador Kim Byong Hong.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were focused on join search for missing
American soldiers, returning remains of the U.S. soldiers who died
in the War and access for U.S. researchers to the DPRK military
archives, sources close to the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite assurance in advance that the talks would deal
conclusively with all issues, their delegation was unable to
respond constructively to U.S. proposals," the U.S. delegation
chief said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side requested a one-or two-day extension of the talks
on Friday, but the American side refused, Larry Greer, spokesman
for the U.S. Defense Department's POW-MIA office, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the second between the U.S. and DPRK
delegations in recent two months. In early March, U.S. and DPRK
officials held 11-hour session to discuss a wide range of
bilateral issues.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Camerounian Premiers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, CAMEROUN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
and his Camerounian counterpart Mafany Musonge Peter had talks
this morning shortly after Li arrived in the capital of Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Musonge extended welcome to Li and said he was
honored to host the premier from the great country of China.
Cameroun and China are separated afar, but they enjoy much in
common and their relations have been developing well, Musonge
said, citing President Paul Biya's two trips to China.
</P>
<P>
Musonge said Cameroun highly appreciates the spectacular
achievements China has scored and highly respects the endless
vitality and pioneering spirit displayed by the Chinese people on
their way of advance. He believed Premier Li's ongoing trip would
help advance the Camerounian-Chinese relations to new heights.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng extended his congratulations to the Camerounian
government and the people for their progress in developing the
economy. He noted, the African continent is entitled with rich
resources and favorable conditions plus diligent people. On this
account, he said, Africa promises a great potential and bright
prospect for economic development.
</P>
<P>
China and Cameroun, both developing countries, are facing the
hard task of rebuilding their countries. As developing countries,
they should base themselves on national conditions in deciding
their own social systems and road of development, while
maintaining a stable political and social environment so as to
create a favorable condition for developing economy, Li Peng
said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic relations, Li Peng said, the
Sino-Camerounian economic cooperation has entered a new stage of
mutually beneficial cooperation. It is also necessary to follow
the internationally applicable ways to expand scope of
cooperation with a view to generating genuine efficiency for the
benefit of both sides. As Cameroun has the advantage of natural
resources while China is well positioned to provide with relevant
fund, technology and equipment, the cooperation can be conducted
in diverse ways. The forestry cooperation projects between the
two countries now under negotiation would be conducive to
protecting ecological environment and forestry resources and
beneficial to the implementation of the sustained development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
Musonge shared Li's view, saying he welcomed Chinese
enterprises to invest in Cameroun and resolutely support, without
any reservation, the establishment of joint ventures and
cooperative firms in Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also gained common acknowledgement on
a wide-range of issues, including mutual investment protection,
health care of women and children, agricultural machinery as well
as the employment of handicapped people. The two sides also
agreed to effect the cooperation in those areas through the mixed
economic and trade working committee of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Musonge stressed the Camerounian government has always upheld
the "One China" policy and considers Taiwan as an inseparable
part of China's territory. Li Peng expressed appreciation for the
stance and thanked the Camerounian government for its sympathy
with and support to China in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Premier Li Peng and Prime Minister Musonge
oversaw the signing of two agreements between the two countries,
namely, the agreement on mutual protection of investment and the
agreement on Sino-Camerounian economic and technological
cooperation.

According to eyewitnesses, Margus and two of his bodyguards were
on a taxi when the firing started.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said the bodyguards of Margus returned no
fire after having probably felt that they were less armed than
the perpetrators who ordered them to lay down their weapons. The
gunmen numbering five, of whom four armed with assault rifles
have fished Margus out of his taxi and packed him in their
Cresida unhurt before they sped away to an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the kidnapping is not yet known. However
sources close to the relatives of Margus said he had had some
trouble with young men who asked him for a refund of an allegedly
looted truck loaded with sorghum by the clansmen of Margus in
Baidoa some time ago.
</P>
<P>
Margus had survived an attempt of kidnapping last week when
armed men attacked him in one of the streets of North Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> UN Undersecretary General to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Undersecretary General Sir
Kieran Prendergast will visit Cyprus later this month to prepare a
report for U.N. Chief Kofi Annan on possible solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides told
reporters here today that the visit, which will also take the
U.N. official to Ankara and Athens, is part of the U.N. efforts to
facilitate direct negotiations between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities in the island country.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said Prendergast will meet with the parties
concerned in Cyprus, officials in Greece and Turkey to prepare the
report for the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said that Prendergast will not take
part in the on-going U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, however, said earlier
that the U.N. official's visit would contribute to the proximity
talks, underway since March in a bid to prepare the ground for
direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, leader
of Turkish Cypriots, are expected to meet face-to-face in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after the Turkish troops took control of its
northern third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States will provide
Bosnia's Muslim Croat Federation with more than 100 heavy cannons,
the Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The weapons are part of a 100 million U.S. dollars
train-and-equip program for the Muslim-Croat army, sponsored by
Washington and heavily criticized by European allies," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
James Pardew, the U.S. diplomat in charge of the program, was
quoted as saying in Sarajevo that 116 155mm howizers will be sent
to the Federation's forces while additional 51 smaller howitzers
will be manufactured locally withe the help of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The 155mm howitzer has a range of nearly nine miles.
</P>
<P>
The military program has been under sharp criticism of the
European countries, which believe that it is a mistake to pour
more weapons into Bosnia, where peace is still unstable.
</P>
<P>
"This runs counter to everything we are tryingg to do here, " an
official overseeing the 1995 Bosnia peace accords was quoted as
saying.
</P>

The Federation in Bosnia received 45 military surplus M60A3
tanks and 80 armored personnel carriers from the U.S. last

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it had
signed a major oil contract with a foreign company to develop the
Balal oilfield.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) withheld the
details of the contract and did not even identify the foreign
company by name.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the contract defied the d'Amato Law that
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed on August 6, 1996 to impose
sanctions agaisnt oil companies which invest annually more than
40 million U.S. dollars in Iran or Libya.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Libya are accused by the U.S. of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Balal
oilfield, located southwest of Lavan island, has a reserve of
80 million barrels of oil and is capable of producing 35,000 to
40,00 barrels of oil per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
The Balal oilfield is one of 11 development projects in the
oil and gas sector offered by the NIOC to international oil
companies in 1995 with a total investment of 6 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Hadi Nejad-Husseinian, deputy oil minister for
international affairs, said that his ministry does not limit its
activities to specific arrangements and is ready to sign various
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the second largest oil exporter and the fourth largest
oil producer in the world, pumps out 3.6 million bpd and exports
2.5 million bpd in line with the quota set by the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The country earned a total of 19.5 billion U.S. dollars
through oil export in 1996, which made up about 70 percent of
the total export revenue.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Sudan Hold Peace Talks in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today chaired a peace talk between Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Sudanese President Hassan el Bashir in a bid to
resolve their long-standing differences.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader urged the two countries to seek an amicable
solution to their differences in order to use their resources for
development and for the welfare of their people.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks initiated by President Moi, current chairman
of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), were
held today in Eldoret, northwest Kenya, according to a Kenya News
Agency report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Uganda has been accusing the Sudanese
government of supporting the rebel Lord Resistance Army while
Sudan has been censuring Uganda for supporting the rebel Sudanese
People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Moi stressed that progress could only be
made if countries involved worked "in an atmosphere of trust".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that today's meeting will be a firm
beginning of trust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is a Sub-Committee on Peace in Southern
Sudan within IGAD, Moi called upon the other members including
Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia to proceed with seeking a lasting
solution in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Before the peace talks, President Moi held separate meetings
with the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his brief remarks, President Bashir said that Sudan is keen
to resolve the problems among the IGAD member countries on the
basis of mutual respect and good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni pointed out that Uganda has no long-term
problem with the Sudan and he described the peace talk held by
the two countries as historic and courageous.

heads of state to land at the newly-built Eldoret International
Airport.

<HEADLINE> Fight Against Crime Will Be Won in S. Africa: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will win its war
against crime as the government and the ruling African National
Congress are making this a priority, President Nelson Mandela
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an anti-crime rally in Cape Town, Mandela said the
National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS) will defeat the
criminals because it is turning the criminal justice system into
an effective weapon against crime.
</P>
<P>
The NCPS, announced by the government earlier this year in a
bid to crack down upon the rampant crime, will bring about
positive results because it combines tough action against
criminals with the improvement of living conditions, said the
President.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also stressed that the key to success "is for everyone
to condemn criminality and not to tolerate any sort of crime, no
matter how petty".
</P>
<P>
"People need to say no to crime in the same way they said no
to apartheid," added Mandela.

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges Continued Aid to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
pledged to continue providing development assistance to African
countries, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by Gabriel Lee, head of an EU delegation,
at a function in Mbabane, capital of Swaziland, in a bid to
dispel fears that the EU would end its assistance to Africa when
the Lome Agreement expires, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Lee, currently visiting Swaziland to celebrate the 40th
anniversary of the founding of the European Economic Community,
said the EU will continue to provide development assistance to
African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU community, the biggest trading block in the
world, saw regional economic integration as an indispensable step
towards successful integration of African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) countries into the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
A new way for the EU to promote regional economic integration
is through free trade area agreements in which the EU and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) states are
involved, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While referring to continued cooperation between the EU and
ACP states into the 21st century, Lee said an EU green paper, now
in circulation among member states, has set out challenges and
options for a new partnership.
</P>
<P>
The EU hopes to have open and frank responses from all SADC
and ACP member countries to the green paper, said Lee, adding the
EU will not unilaterally establish a formula for future
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Liberals Lead in Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's ruling Liberal Party
seems headed for a majority government in an election to be called
on June 2, a new poll suggests.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the Liberals hold a strong lead with the support of
42 percent of decided voters, which is 23 percentage points higher
than its nearest competitor -- the Progressive Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party enjoys the support of 18 percent of decided
voters, and the New Democratic Party of 11 percent, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Quebec-only Bloc Quebecois fell 13 points
to 36 percent of decided Quebec voters. It equals to only nine
percent of support nationally.
</P>
<P>
A Reform Party surge in the West, coupled with a decline in
support for the Bloc, may see Reform emerge as the official
opposition in the next Parliament, according to a Southam News-CTV
poll conducted by the Angus Reid Group.
</P>
<P>
"What it's looking like, increasingly, is that you'll have a
very strong Liberal majority, stronger than it is today, with a
Reform party official opposition," said Darrell Bricker, senior
vice-president of the Angus Reid Group.
</P>
<P>
"While people aren't excited by the Liberals, they still
acknowledge their competence and they're a good, safe choice, and
they acknowledge that they've the party best able to deliver on
the issues" such as job creation, health care, deficit reduction
and national unity, Bricker added.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 3,208 voters was conducted May 5 to 8, with a
margin of error 2.25 percentage points 19 out of 20.

ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) said today that efforts are
still underway to buy food grain locally with funds obtained from
donor organizations.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued after discussions on grain supply
between donors and grain suppliers, the commission said since the
establishment of the national task force in charge of buying food
grain, maximum efforts are being made to purchase grain locally.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, Simon Michele, commissioner of the
DPPC urged purchasers to make orders quickly as it will be
difficult for transportation once the rainy season sets in.
</P>
<P>
He said the purchase was not carried out at the desired speed,
even though the task force composed of the various government
offices, suppliers, donors and other international organizations
have made efforts to ensure the execution of the program as
envisaged.
</P>
<P>
He further said, at the discussions the donors claimed that
the delay was due to failure on the part of domestic suppliers to
supply them with the quantity required and as quickly as they
want it to be.
</P>
<P>
Local suppliers has so far supplied only 5 percent of the
90,000 tons donors plan to buy this Ethiopian year locally, they
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The donors revealed at the meeting that they intend to buy
265,000 tons of food grain from domestic market, according to the
release.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) of South Africa today continued its disciplinary hearing
against its former president Clarence Makwetu, said an informed
source here.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door hearing, held at a building of the University
of the Western Cape in Cape Town with Makwetu's supporters
protesting outside, is expected to continue on Sunday morning,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
Three witnesses had testified at the hearing, and another
seven still had to give evidence, PAC spokeswoman Patricia de
Lille was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, now PAC's national chairman, is facing three charges
relating to allegations that he has divided the party, created
factions, and has violated the party's oath of allegiance which
states that a member will accept party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu lost the presidency to former Methodist Bishop Stanley
Mogoba at the PAC's national conference in December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu's supporters claimed that the elections were
unconstitutional, refusing to recognize the party's new
leadership, thus causing an internal strife and rival factions.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said today he

negotiations, according to a report of the Itar-Tass news agency
reaching here from Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
There is no alternative to a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan
with participation of all sides involved, Tajik Foreign Minister
Talbak Zazarov said after the three presidents had talks.
</P>
<P>
Zazarov stressed that the Afghan conflict cannot be resolved by
military means, which can only lead to an endless devastating war.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held by Tajik President, Iranian President Ali
Akbar Hashimi-Rafsanjani, who was in Tajikistan on an official
visit, and Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who arrived in

<HEADLINE> Report: Child Poverty Surges in Washington Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of poor school-age
children in the Washington suburbs grew three times faster from
1990 to 1994 than the national rate, according to new U.S. Census
Bureau figures.
</P>
<P>
In the 12 suburban counties closest to the nation's capital,
the bureau reports that the number of children aged 5 to 17 living
in households with incomes below the federal poverty level
increased from 31,038 in 1990 to 57,349 in 1994 -- a rise of about
85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the number of school-age children below the poverty
line increased by 28 percent during the four-year period.
</P>
<P>
The federal poverty line for a family of four is 16,000
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia had also more poor children in 1994
than in 1990, despite a declining population. The increase of 28
percent was the smallest rise of any Washington-area jurisdiction,
but the district had a higher percentage of poor children, 31
percent, than any of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Demographers attributed the increase to an influx of immigrant
families, a continuing rise in the number of single-parent
households and a recession that cost the region 90,000 retail and
construction jobs from 1990 to 1992.

<HEADLINE> Mobutu Returns to Zaire, Parliament Speaker Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko
today returned to Kinshasa from Gabon, where he attended a
regional summit of central African heads of state, while Zaire's
political parties promoted the country's former parliament speaker
to the same post.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu also met with South African Vice President Tabo Mbeki in
the Gabonese capital Libreville and they discussed the possible
next meeting with rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a chaotic atmosphere, Zaire's political parties today
elected Monseigneur Laurent Monsengwo, who is the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Kisangani and former parliament speaker, the
president of the High Council of the Republic, or transitional
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Libreville regional summit Thursday called on Zairian
political parties to elect a parliament speaker as soon as
possible to prepare for the country's peaceful transition of
power.
</P>
<P>
President Mobutu, who is suffering from developed prostate
cancer, has promised to step down once a new president is elected
in the end of the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Monsengwo, who is now living in Rome, told Radio
France Internationale that he has not yet been contacted by the
Zairian parties and has not asked for the post.
</P>
<P>
He was forced to resign from the same post in 1995 by the same
political parties, because he refused to join the political
quarrel between the presidential party and the opposition party of
Etienne Tshisekedi.
</P>
<P>
According to a constitutional clause of Zaire adopted in 1995,
parliament speaker can take over the responsibility of the head of
state if the latter resigns or is prevented from fulfilling his
duty.

<HEADLINE> Seismologist Unveils Mysteries of Killer Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The collision of continental plates
has caused the Saturday earthquake, which has killed 2,400 people
and wound 6,000 others in east Iran, a seismologist said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabia plate on the earth has moved northward and collided
with the stationary Russia plate and created tremors, said
Mohammad Reza Gheitanchi, head of the Earthquake Seismology
Institute of Geophysics in Tehran University, in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake measuring 7.1 degrees on the Richter scale,
rocked the cities of Birjand and Qaen, about 800 kilometers east
of the capital of Tehran, said the seismologist while analyzing
the mysteries of the powerful earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is being sandwitched between the two plates -- the
Arabia plate and the Russian plate. That is the cause of the
earthquake," said the seismologist.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are other two factors leading to the strong
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
First, the Indian plate is also moving northward to the
Himalayas in China, thus causing lateral pressure upon the eastern
part of the Iranian plateau.
</P>
<P>
Second, there is interaction in the eastern part of the
Iranian plateau due to direct and indirect forces generated by
the two moving plates. The Arabian plate is moving three
centimeters each year.
</P>
<P>
Gheitanchi said "We have earthquake belts in plate boundaries
such as the Zagros plate boundaries and the Alborz plate
boundaries. We have also many folds and faults inside the
Iranian plateau."
</P>
<P>
"There are also some local forces from the interaction of
these several forces. We have had several activities in the past
30 years," he added.
</P>
<P>
The seismologist told Xinhua that the activities have
significantly increased in the area during this century. The
most powerful earthquake was the Dash Bayaz earthquake with a
7.3 degrees on the Richter scale in 1968 and was followed by
other two 7-degree quakes in east Iran in 1978 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
He said that Saturday's quake is the fourth strongest quake in
the region, adding "the death toll in the Qaen-Birjand region will
go most likely as high as 6,000 because the quake-stricken area
is wide and the intensity is high."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he added, poor quality of houses should be
ascribed as one of the reasons for high death toll and heavy
casualty since most of the houses are built of mud and brick.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, more than 130 aftershocks
with magnitude ranging from 2.8 degrees to 5.5 degrees on the
Richter scale have been registered in the quake-stricken area
until 11 a.m. (06:30 GMT) Sunday since the 7.1-degree killer
earthquake was recorded at 12:28 hours local time (07:58 GMT)
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to initial estimates, Saturday's earthquake destroyed
148 villages with a total population of 50,000 to the extent from
20 percent to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Interior Ministry claimed that the earthquake has
already inflicted more than 200 billion Iranian rials (66 million
U.S. dollars) damage on the cities of Qaen and Birjand.
</P>
<P>
This is the strongest earthquake ever occurred in Iran in the
past eight years. A 7.3-degree quake claimed 40,000 lives in
northern Iran on June 21, 1990.
</P>
<P>
This is also the third strong earthquake within four months
this year. A total of 965 people were killed and more than 2,600
wounded following a deadly six degrees earthquake which rocked Ardebil
region in northeastern Iran on February 28.
</P>
<P>
On February 4, the quake measuring 6.1 degrees on the Richter
scale jolted northern Khorasan province, killing a total of 86
people and injuring hundreds others.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Major Exporter of Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With fruit exports increasing by 20
percent annually over the past two years, east China's Shandong
Province has become one of China's leading fruit exporters,
accounting for ten percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Every year Shandong exports 60,000 tons of apples and pears,
some 18 percent of the country's total exports of the two kinds of
fruit. The province is also a big exporter of dates and other
dried or fresh fruits.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996 Shandong sold some 100,000 tons of fresh and
dry fruit abroad, worth a total of 90 million US dollars. This
year alone, the province is expected to export 70,000 tons of
fruit and earn 60 million US dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Of the province's fruit-exporting companies, 53 percent are
state-owned, while 46 percent are overseas-funded firms. Only one
percent of them are private Chinese-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shandong fruit is exported to 31 countries and
regions, with 70 percent sold to East and Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia is also a big buyer of Shandong fruit, importing 6,000
tons a year. Britain and the US have also increased their fruit
imports from Shandong.

<HEADLINE> China Wins First Gold and Leads Medal Tally at EAG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With one world record and five gold
medals, China had a flying start in the first-day competition at the
current East Asian Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yinsu launched China's gold hunting when she won the game's
first title in the women's 100m freestyle swimming event in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese girl, aged 15, was clocked 56.72 seconds for the crown.
</P>
<P>
"I have expected to win the first gold of the games," she said. "I
have confidence in my power."
</P>
<P>
A total of four golds were decided in the pool, with South Korean
taking one and Japanese swimmers collecting two.
</P>
<P>
Chinese men's and women's hercules displayed their overwhelming
strength on the weightlifting arena, clean sweeping three golds on
offer and setting a new world record.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yinsu, from Hu Bei province, set a snatch world mark in the
women's 46-kg category, lifting 81.5 kilograms to beat the previous
mark by 0.5 kilograms on her way to take the first title at the Pusan
Games.
</P>
<P>
Other two golds in weightlifting were notched up by China's Bi
Zhongxiang in the 54-kg category and Atlanta Olympics gold medal
winner Tang Lingsheng in the 59-kg division.
</P>
<P>
Lifters from Chinese Taipei finished second in the three events.
Tsai Huey Woan had the silver in the women's 46-kg, Wang Shin Yuan and
Liu Te Tsung claimed two more silvers in the men's 54- and 59-kg
classes respectively.
</P>
<P>
China won the only team title on the day, beating South Korea and
Japan to take the men's gymnastics team event.
</P>
<P>
Although Li Xiaoshuang, the Olympic individual all-round champion,
was absent due to injuries, China still enjoys the upperhands against
its two chief rivals in East Asia, with both squads composed of the
Olympians, said Qian Kui, team manager of the Chinese gymnastic
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Our gymnasts regained their top forms in the rings, vault horse
and parallel bars after two failures apiece in both the floor exercise
and pommel horse," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Fan Bin, member of the Olympic second-place Chinese team in
Atlanta, suffered tumbles twice in his personal strong events of
pommel horse and horizontal bar.
</P>
<P>
"However, I am encouraged by the performance of our young athletes,
especially the 19-year-old Lu Yufu who got the most accumulated point
of 56.500 from the apparatuses," said the manager.
</P>
<P>
The competition has witnessed a higher frequence of failures due to
new rules introduced every four years by the International Gymnastics
Federation to reduce difficulty and scoring merits, Qian explained.
</P>
<P>
In the men's basketball preliminaries, China defeated Kazakhstan
76-65, South Korea beat Chinese Taipei 94-83, while the men's soccer
tournament featured lop-sided games with Japan blanking Guam 12-0 and
China clouding Mongolia 6-0. In another tough game, South Korea
outplayed Kazakhstan 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Monday's competitions will decide 12 gold medals, with five in
swimming, four in weightlifting, two in diving and one in gymnastics.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China began a program recently to
further promote the use of original software.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is called "Original Software Users
Recognition Program," is aimed at encouraging the use of original
software and enhancing protection of intellectual property rights
by publicizing and rewarding corporations and organizations that
use original software in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, its co-sponsors, the China Software
Alliance (CSA) and the US-based Business Software Alliance (BSA),
will nominate businesses and organizations using original software
in China to participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the program will make a commitment to use
only original software in their business activities, and they will
also implement a program of internal controls to prevent the
making and using of illegal software.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, every other month, BSA and CSA will hold a press
conference to issue certificates to corporations and organizations
that join the program.
</P>
<P>
Among those first participants of the program are the People's
Bank of China, China National Nuclear Corporation, Huaneng Group
and Tianjin Municipal Telephone Bureau.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that BSA had launched similar programs in
Indonesia and Malaysia, and had achieved very good results.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the program, BSA cooperated with the Chinese side to
hold a Sino-US workshop on intellectual property rights
enforcement techniques in Beijing, and opened a hotline in China
for report of illegal use of software.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Calls for Early Realization of Free-Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of
the member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) ended their two-day meeting today with a call
for an early realization of a free-trade zone in the region.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, who met on Bandos Island near the
capital Male, agreed that the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA),
an ambitious plan formulated by the member countries, should be
realized "in the shortest possible time," Maldivian Foreign
Minister Fathulla Jameel told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
SAARC launched the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) in 1995 with the aim to create SAFTA in the region
hopefully by the year 2000 but not later than 2005.
</P>
<P>
In a related effort to liberalize regional trade, the foreign
ministers directed an inter-government group, which will meet in
Bhutan next month, to discuss the issue of removal of non-tariffs
and other barriers and continue negotiations on extending
preferential concessions to the least developed member countries
of SAARC, Jameel said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC member countries have already completed two rounds of
trade negotiations under SAPTA and there are over 2,000 products
for tariff concessions among them. The third round will start
shortly.
</P>
<P>
He said all the member countries had noted the success of SAPTA
and stressed the need now to move from SAPTA to SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
Poverty eradication is a priority area within SAARC where a
number of activities had been geared towards the improvement of
the situation in the region, he said. However, he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The environment issue has been given a high priority in
regional development and cooperation, he said. The environment
ministers of SAARC' member countries met recently in New Delhi and
finalized a common and collective position for the coming special
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made by member countries in carrying out
recommendations of two regional reports on "the causes and
consequences of natural disasters" and "the protection and
preservation of the environment," and on the greenhouse effect and
its effect on the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The environment ministers will try to formulate a plan of
action for immediate implementation of recommendations of these
two reports, he said, adding that the Maldives has offered to host
a meeting of the SAARC environment ministers to discuss "more
directly" the environment concerns of the region and specific
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Jameel also said the first SAARC tourism ministers' meeting
will be held in September this year in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The
foreign ministers also discussed the issue of simplification of
visa procedures across the board.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the SAARC member states, most of them are
arriving today for their summit scheduled for May 12-14 in Male,
will endorse or even add to what the foreign ministers
recommended, Jameel said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, taking note of 12 years of SAARC's
existence, also decided to set up an eminent persons' group to
undertake a comprehensive appraisal of the association and
identify measures to "revitalize" the effectiveness of the
grouping in achieving its objectives, he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985 to promote regional cooperation
in economic, social, cultural and other fields, embraces
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.

and the score remained 0-0 after the first half.
</P>
<P>

against the Chinese defence line. But the Chinese team gradually
fought back and finally took the iniative of the match after
taking control of the midfield.

over-head pass from Li Jinyu in a quick counter-attack and beat
the goal-keeper with a right-foot shoot.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the goal, the Chinese team kept a constant
pressure on the host team with their fast counter-attacks. They
got at least three more scoring chances but failed to convert any
of them.
</P>
<P>
The Tajikistan team missed their golden chance of levelling
the score late in the match as one of their shots hit the right
post.
</P>
<P>
After the match, China lead the group with 6 points from two
matches. Tajikistan are second with one win against one loss.

<HEADLINE> China Clean Sweeps Weightlifting Golds at East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With one world record and three gold
medals on first day of the weightlifting tournament at the second East
Asian Games here on Sunday, Chinese hercules once again proved their
dominating force on the weightlifting arena in the region.
</P>
<P>
After China's Jiang Yingsu won the women's 46-kg category, her
compatriots Bi Zhongxiang and Atlanta Olympics gold medal winner Tang
Lingsheng garnered the titles in the men's 54-kg and 59-kg categories.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yingsu, from central China's Hubei province, met no challenge
on the platform. With the winning weight of 72.5 kilograms in the
snatch in hands, she continued to asked for a new world record weight
of 81.5kg in her second attempt, and lifted that weight in her try.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese girl, who was second at the 1995 Asian Championships in
Pusan, continued her lifting strength in the jerk and took the title
with a total weight of 172.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huey Woan of Chinese Taipei was second at 162.5 kilograms with
72.5 from snatch and 90 from jerk. Shin Young Joo of South Korea, who
has the same weight of 162.5kg, was third due to heavier bodyweight.

dislocated.
</P>
<P>
For Tang Lingsheng, who appeared as a darkhorse at the Atlanta
Olympic Games to win the gold last summer, the competition is by no
means a head-to-head one.
</P>
<P>

snatch and 150 from jerk for a winning total weight of 255kg.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Visit Is Landmark,  Says Mkapa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin and Hu Xinrong)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today said Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Tanzania will be a
landmark in deciding the form of co-operation between the two
countries and how they will relate to the international
commmunity in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks in an interview with Chinese reporters
on the eve of Li's visit.
</P>
<P>
Reviewig relations between Tanzania and China, Mkapa said they
are growing stronger in political, economic and other areas of
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the memorable visit of retired President Mwalimu
Julius Nyerere to China in February 1965, which was later
reciprocated by the late Premier Zhou Enlai, Mkapa said these
visits served as ice-breaking events as they laid down a strong
foundation for the excellent relations that have continued to
flourish todate.
</P>
<P>
Since then, numerous visits have been made by leaders from
both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa pointed out that such visits have provided excellent
opportunities not only for leaders of the two countries to know each
other but also for official delegations to discuss details on the
modalities for strengthening co-operation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He said the numerous projects established in Tanzania with
Chinese assistance are a product of agreements reached following
discussions during these visits.
</P>
<P>
The president said the visit of Premier Li Peng to Tanzania,
starting from tomorrow, is held by the Tanzanian government and people
with high satisfaction and great expectations. "For us, the visit by
such a high ranking Chinese leader is considered as a manifestation of
how the government and people of China value their special
relationship with Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the visit of Premier Li Peng is especially sigificant to
Tanzania due to the fact that it is being made at a time there have
been substantial changes in the political and economic systems not
only in the two countries but also in the entire world.
</P>
<P>
"This visit will therefore enable the two sides to analyse and then
formulate the most suitable program of co-operation in context of the
new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange of ideas during the visit will assist both countries
to evolve a common vision and strategies on how to strengthen our
political, cultural, technical and economic co-operation at a time the
dominant world power configuration has changed, and the interational
economic forces are strongly in favour of liberalization and
globalization of trade and industry."
</P>
<P>
On how Tanzania and China could strengthen their co-operation
under a new international situation, President Mkapa said that
Tanzania and China need to strengthen their relations in all
aspects of co-operation. He said their economic co-opeation have
to be strengthened with a view of making it more mutually
beneficial to both sides.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard we evisage a change in the pattern of economic
co-opeation from the hitherto existing system whereby relations were
mainly conducted through governments. The emphasis therefore, should
now be for our two governments to facilitate and encourage more
participation by corporate and private business enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, a way forward has been shown through the recent
conclusion of a joint-venture with a Chinese company's
participation in the Friendship Textile industry in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
There are many other avenues for Chinese companies or
businessmen's participation in the existing industries in
Tanzania, and naturally, with special emphasis on those which had
been established through Chinese assistance, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said the hitherto existing patern of
economic co-operation has basically been one-sided --
Tanzania receiving assistance from China. "It is now
high time that Chinese investors were enouraged to come to
Tanzania with a profit motive. The financial and legal
regulations in Tanzania have been restrucured to allow free
repatriation of profits by investors."
</P>
<P>
On the international scene, President Mkapa said, Tanzania will
seek closer co-operation with China in defending mutually agreed
political and economic principles at the Uited Nations and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
He reitarated that Tanzania shall continue to support the
principle of One China at all international fora and advocae for
more democratization of the United Nations system so as to
provide adequate regional balance and paticipation.
</P>
<P>
In the international economic relations, he said, Tanzania
will seek closer co-operation with China in advocating for the
rights and interests of the developing nations. "We shall for
instance continue to call for further enhanced efforts by the
wealthier nations to contribute to the developmet of the poorer
states so as to enable them participate more effectively in the
global economy than it is at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Mkapa further said, "We shall together seek to defend the
developing nations against attempts by International BIG BUSINESS
to marginalise the poor through the emerging forces for immediate
globalization and liberalization of the entire world economy."
</P>
<P>
"The process should not be allowed to hurt the poor states which
are at the moment not in position to compete on equal footing with
the rich states," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye told Chinese journalists
that the political problems facing some of the African countries were
mainly caused by differencies in religion, triblism and new multiparty
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said Tanzania, concerned about peace and calm in Africa,
had worked closely with international orgaizations like the OAU in
finding lasting solution to the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania was faced with a great problem caring for
thousands of refugees from different conflicting countries especially
Burundi, Zaire and Rwanda. He said among the damages caused by the
refugees included destruction of environment and criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister urged China to play more role in
internationl fora and Africa in particular.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Industry Shows Upturn in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The macro-economic situation and
overall industry performance in Shanghai shows marked improvement
in this year's second quarter, according to an industrial survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted from late March to mid-April in the city,
covered a total of 270 industrial enterprises, involving 147.9
billion yuan in gross industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Great improvement has taken place in the macro-economic
situation, overall industrial performance, sales ratio of
industrial products, profits record, and production cost of the
city's industrial sector, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
Average individual income for Shanghai workers also rose by a
large margin, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
But the enterprises still face the trouble of cash shortages,
and continued to be haunted by the problem of triangle debt, said
the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that a major force to turn the business
climate for the better came from the manufacturing or processing
industries in food, tobacco, textile, clothes, furniture, paper,
and paper products.
</P>
<P>
Technology-intensive industries of machinery manufacturing,
electronics, and telecommunications equipment manufacturing have
bottomed out during the period, leaving only a few in a sluggish
state, such as industries in leather, fur, wood, and chemical
fibers, said the survey.

<HEADLINE> China Clean Sweeps Weightlifting Golds at East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With one world record and three gold
medals on first day of the weightlifting tournament at the second East
Asian Games here on Sunday, Chinese hercules once again proved their
dominating force on the weightlifting arena in the region.
</P>
<P>
After China's Jiang Yingsu won the women's 46-kg category, her
compatriots Bi Zhongxiang and Atlanta Olympics gold medal winner Tang
Lingsheng garnered the titles in the men's 54-kg and 59-kg categories.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yingsu, from central China's Hubei province, met no challenge
on the platform. With the winning weight of 72.5 kilograms in the
snatch in hands, she continued to asked for a new world record weight
of 81.5kg in her second attempt, and lifted that weight in her try.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese girl, who was second at the 1995 Asian Championships in
Pusan, continued her lifting strength in the jerk and took the title
with a total weight of 172.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huey Woan of Chinese Taipei was second at 162.5 kilograms with
72.5 from snatch and 90 from jerk. Shin Young Joo of South Korea, who
has the same weight of 162.5kg, was third due to heavier bodyweight.
</P>
<P>
The men's competitions witnessed an easy win for the Chinese
lifters. After first attempt in snatch and jerk, both Bi Zhongxiang
and Tang Lingsheng established their winning status on the arena. Bi
Zhongxiang, who snatched 120kg and jerked 140kg for a total of 260kg,
defeated his rivals from Chinese Taipei and Japan to the second and
third. Wang Shinyuan, from Chinese Taipei, had the silver at 250 and
Japanese Notomi Yoshiyuki third at 247.5.
</P>
<P>
After lifting 140 kilograms in his first attempt in the jerk, Bi
Zhongxiang tried 150kg in his second try but had his left elbow
dislocated.
</P>
<P>
For Tang Lingsheng, who appeared as a darkhorse at the Atlanta
Olympic Games to win the gold last summer, the competition is by no
means a head-to-head one.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most relaxed competition I have ever experienced," he
said after taking the gold in the men's 59kg category, with 127.5 from
snatch and 150 from jerk for a winning total weight of 255kg.
</P>
<P>
Liu Te-tsung of Chinese Taipei was second at 257.5 and Lee
Bae-young of South Korea third at 255.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Gymnasts Win Men's Team Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese gymnasts outpowered the host
South Korea and Japan to take the men's team title here on Sunday at
the on-going 10-day second East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
China accumulated a total of 277.850 points, beating South Korea to
second on 274.600. Japan went home with the bronze medals on 273.800
while Chinese Taipei finished fourth on 253.950 points.
</P>
<P>
Although Li Xiaoshuang, the Olympic individual all-round champion,
was absent due to injuries, China still enjoys the upperhands against
South Korea and Japan, both squads were mainly composed of the
Olympians, said Qian Kui, team manager of the Chinese gymnastic
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Our gymnasts regained their top forms in the rings, vault horse
and parallel bars after two failures apiece in both the floor exercise
and pommel horse," said manager Qian after the competition in the
Gymnasum of Pusan Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
Fan Bin, member of the Olympic second-place Chinese team in
Atlanta, slipped off from the pommel horse and dropped to the floor in
the horizontal bar, the two personal strong apparatuses for the
23-year-old veteran.
</P>
<P>
"However, I am encouraged by the performance of our young athletes,
especially the 19-year-old Lu Yufu who got the most accumulated point
of 56.500 from the apparatuses," said the manager who caculated all
the scores after each round as no scoreboard showed the overall
standings throughout the competition.
</P>
<P>
The event-highest mark of 9.800 was scored by Alexey Dmitriyenko of
Kazakhstan from the vault horse who competed in the mixed team
composed of two Hong Kong players, two Kazakhstan gymnasts and
Mongolian Batsuuri Anhbayar.
</P>
<P>
Dmitriyenko failed to stand firm and kneed down to the floor in his
landing in the floor exercise but still managed for a total of 54.100
points to rank 11th in the individual overall standings where Lee
Joo-hyung of South Korea finished second, next to Chinese Lu Yufu.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Lu had scored three event-bests of 9.500 points in the
pommel horse, 9.550 in the parallel bars and 9.100 in the horizontal
bar. South Korean Yeo Hong-chol netted the most of 9.500 in the floor
exercise and Fan Hongbin of China was awarded the highest of 9.750
points in the rings.
</P>
<P>
The competition has witnessed a higher frequence of failures due to
new rules introduced every four years by the International Gymnastics
Federation to reduce difficulty and scoring merits, Qian explained.
</P>
<P>
The gymnasts from South Korea awarded their home fans with
top-class performances on the vault floor, but talented Lee Joo-hyung
failed to show up his top forms in the horizontal bar, floor exercise
and parallel bars, he commented.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 gymnasts from China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong,
Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and South Korea competed in the men's
gymnastics.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A full-strength Australian
national cricket team won their confrontation against a Rest of
the World Selection side in the Super Challenge Cup, a one-day
international here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Australians won the match 248-245 under a sunny sky which
was described by the organizers as "a miracle" after consistent
rain here for the last few days.
</P>
<P>
The Australian team took the Hong Kong event as part of their
final preparations for the upcoming Ashes Test Series in England.
</P>
<P>
The Australians, known as the "blockbusters", are regarded by
many as the cricket world's leading team while the Rest of the
World side boasted star players mainly drawn from India, Pakistan,
South Africa and the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
Australian Mark Waugh, a 31-year-old, right-handed batsman from
New South Wales, was named the Man of the Match today and the Rest
of the World's Anthony Correa, a substitute player from Hong
Kong, was selected the winner of a Magical Moment trophy.
</P>
<P>

first ever eleven-a-side, one-day international cricket
competition in Hong Kong. It was organized by the Cricket World
International and the Hong Kong Cricket Association.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong hosted its first ever six-a-side cricket
international in 1992, at the very same KCC pitch, with a crowd of
3,000. And the event has been held annually ever since.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Libyan leader Colonel Muammar
Ghaddafi and his Niger counterpart Ibrahim Mainasara Barre
were granted on Friday the grand commander of the federal republic,
one of Nigeria's highest national honours.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet in Abuja, Nigerian head of state,
General Sani Abacha said the honour "is in recognition of their
selfless and dedicated leadership, warm and affectionate relationship
with Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
Abacha described Ghaddafi's visit as historic, as he last came to
Nigeria over a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
He commended the three countries' consistent efforts in fighting
"against the involvement of extra-African powers in our local
conflicts".
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in the Great Lakes region, Abacha renewed the pledge
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to support all genuine
efforts to reconcile the warring factions in Zaire, urging them to
co-operate with the United Nations and the OAU.
</P>
<P>
"It is time, we, as African leaders, recognized that it is our
primary responsiblity to restore peace in Zaire and other troubled
spots in the contient," said Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ghaddafi expressed Libya's support of Nigeria's bid for a
permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a
representative of the third world.
</P>
<P>
Ghaddafi arrived in Nigeria on Friday morning aboard a Libyan
airline Boeing 727 in defiance of a United Nations air embargo imposed
on Libya in 1992. He was accompanied by Niger President
Mainasara Barre on his trip. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Maneuvers in Persian Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 Iranian air and naval
forces launched a joint military drill code-named "Ya Hussein
Shahid" in the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the military
exercises cover an area of 24,000 nautical miles in south of the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the war games started in Jask port and
will extend to the second naval base in Bushehr, about 1,230
kilometers south of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Destroyers, helicopter gunships, missile launching vessels,
amphibious forces as well as the jet fighters of the air force are
engaged in the war games. The last stage of the games will be
carried out on May 17.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the maneuvers is to upgrade the military power of
the participating units and to apply various operational
strategies and new tactics to counter the blitz assault of an
hypothetical enemy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) carried
out war games in an area covering 2,000 square kilometers in the
Persian Gulf water. Over 200,000 IRGC and Basij (volunteer) forces
took part in the maneuvers.

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent Nigerians Live in Darkness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- About 70 million Nigerians, or 70 percent
of the country's population do not have access to electricity and
there is little hope of supplying them power in near future,
the Sunday Vanguard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Power and Steel Alhaji Bashir Dalhatu said in a
recent forum in Kano State that only 2.45 megawatts of the 5.95
megawatts capacity of the National Electric Power Authority are
untilized currently due to various constraints.
</P>
<P>
These contstraints include the lack of foreign exchange to carry
out the rehabilitation of breakdown power stations, overloaded
transformers, poor distribution network, vandalization of transimision
lines, illegal connections and unpaid electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
The minister regretted that Nigeria's electricity cost is the
lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, yet any idea of raising the tariff has
been strongly resisted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the goverment to invest more in the electricity industry
and to take measures to encourage private participation in the sector.

<HEADLINE> British Government Plans to Ban Handguns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government is planning
to introduce a bill in parliament this week banning all handguns,
government sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Prime Minister Tony Blair had insisted that the
government make time for legislation to ban all handguns by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Britain introduced a partial firearms ban in reaction to the
massacre of 16 Scottish schoolchildren and their teacher in
Dunblane in March 1996 by a crazed gunman who then shot himself.
</P>
<P>
The move by the new government means granting MPs a free vote
on extending the prohibition of large-calibre handguns to include
those of 22 mm and below.
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of Labor members of the parliament
are said to back a total ban, the proposed bill has sparked an
angry retort from members of shooting clubs who claimed it unjust

<HEADLINE> India Welcomes Economic Cooperation Among SAARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral
today said that India welcomed the new emphasis being laid on
trade and economic cooperation among seven South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen before his departure for Male to participate
in the summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), Gujral said that there had been growing
economic cooperation among the SAARC countries in various fields
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving fast towards free trade in the SAARC," he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces seven South Asian nations of
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Male summit meeting of the SAARC to be held on May 12-14 is
reported to focus on enhancement of trade and economic cooperation
among the member nations. In the past more than 10 years, the
achievement of the SAARC is not so big as expected due to
misunderstanding and differences among the member nations,
especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Gujral is scheduled to meet his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz
Sharif during the meeting and discuss all outstanding issues in a
bid to improve ties between the two neighbors. Since last year,
leaders of the two countries have shown their willingness to
normalize their soured ties through peaceful dialogue. They
resumed their foreign secretary-level talks at the end of March.
And another round of the same level talks will be held later this
month.
</P>
<P>
When asked about India's stand on the Pakistan proposal for
setting up a joint working group on Kashmir, the main dispute
between the two countries, the Indian prime minister parried the
question.

<HEADLINE> SAP Impacts on Zambians' Living Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Structural Adjustment Program (SAP)
embarked in Zambia in 1991 has had a great impact on Zambians' living
standard, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey by the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey
(LCMS), the privatization, health and education reforms have rendered
people in poverty while setting a positive direction for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The survey launched shows that food is by far the most
important expenditure item, constituting 64 percent of the total
expendiure of a Zambian family.
</P>
<P>
The percentage share of food is lower in urban areas than in rural
areas and female-headed households spend a somewhat larger share on
food than male-headed households, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the LCMS shows that 51 percent of the country's
population is female and 550,000 children have lost at least a parent,
most of whom lost their fathers.
</P>
<P>
Boys continue to outnumber girls in schools and most girls drop out
from schools during their early grades, especially the fourth grade,
it says.
</P>
<P>
The LCMS says in its survey that 49 percent of husbands make a
final say on how many children they should have but women have no say
in overall decision-making in families.
</P>
<P>
The survey is aimed at giving policy makers, researchers and the
public the first hand information of living conditions of Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Swaps Oil with Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to deliver the first cargo
of its crude oil to Kazakhstan's client in the Persian Gulf next
week under a swap deal, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Tehran Times quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh as saying that "the first cargo of the Iranian crude is
going to be delivered on behalf of Kazakhstan next week."
</P>
<P>
Under the swap deal agreed last year between the two countries,
Iran would initially
refine 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Kazakh crude blended with
its own Iranian light crude. After two years, the amount would
increase to 120,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
In return, landlocked Kazakhstan would be entitled to the
same value of crude at Iranian export terminals in the Persian
Gulf or at Iran's storage facilities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the deal has been stalled in a dispute over crude
quality to be delivered by tankers to northern Iran across the
Caspian Sea. The main stumbling bloc was the high concentration
of mercaptan in Kazakh oil.
</P>
<P>
Trial shipments of Kazakh oil across the Caspian Sea to
an Iranian port had began in January.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Restrain Oil Production to Boost Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An official from the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) called on member states
to restrain oil production and abide by quotas in order to boost
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC, made a statement
published today by English daily Kayhan International, saying
that something should be done to improve prices.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil production by OPEC is estimated at nearly 27
million barrels per day, about 2 million barrels above OPEC's
imposed ceiling of 25.03 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
OPEC has decided this week to raise one dollar per barrel of
crude oil on the basis of the present level in the international
oil market.
</P>
<P>
Lukman, who was in Isfahan, about 400 kilometers south of the
capital of Tehran, this week to attend an international
conference on oil and gas, said "We can not force non-OPEC
producers to curt production but we call on them to exercise some
sort of restraints so that the balance between supply and demand
is not dislocated to the extent of driving prices very low."
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of the world's oil reserves belong to OPEC
member countries while the group is producing only 40 percent of
the world oil supply, according to Lukman.
</P>
<P>
"The target price for our basket is 21 U.S. dollars. The price
rose to 24 dollars at their peak at the end of last year. In the
past couple of weeks prices have been weakened and now they have
moved back to over 18 dollars a barrel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the plan to reduce OPEC output ceiling, he
said it depends on what is going to happen in the market.
</P>
<P>
"But this is up to OPEC to decide during its meeting in
Vienna in June," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Beat Hawks 100-80, Jazz Downs Lakers 110-95 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls regained the
advantage to beat the Atlanta Hawks 100-80 Saturday in Atlanta,
leading their NBA Eastern Conference semifinal series 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, which led 52-46 at halftime, scored only 28 points in
the second half, a franchise low for a playoff game. While the
Bulls got a superb effort from their bench to win the game.
</P>
<P>
With Michael Jordan having another poor shooting game and
Dennis Rodman a non-factor, the Bulls dominated the fourth quarter
behind the play of Brian Williams and Toni Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
That duo scored 20 of Chicago's 29 points in the decisive final
period as the Bulls broke open a tight game and reclaimed the
home-court advantage. Game 4 is Sunday evening at the Omni before
the series shifts back to the United Center on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Rodman didn't start, giving up his spot in the lineup to Jason
Caffey, and wound up playing just six minutes. That was long
enough for him to pick up his eighth technical in six playoff
games with five seconds left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Kukoc finished with 16 points and Williams, showing no effects
of a knee injury in Game 2, added 14. Jordan hit only 8-of-20
shots but still led the Bulls in scoring with 21.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks shot only 25 percent in the second half and missed
all 11 attempts from beyond the 3-point arc. Atlanta's previous
low for points in the second half of a playoff game was 33, set in
1994 against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Mutombo led the Hawks with 16.
</P>
<P>
At Inglewood, California, Karl Malone scored 42 points to lead
the Utah Jazz over the Los Angeles Lakers to take a 3-1 lead in
the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Byron Russell added a career playoff-high 29 points and 10
rebounds for the Jazz, who could advance to the conference finals
with a victory Monday night when the best-of-7 series resumes in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal had 34 points and 11 rebounds to lead the
Lakers, who scored the game's first basket and then played
catch-up the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
Malone's shooting still wasn't great Saturday (12-of-27), but
he was perfect in 18 trips to the free-throw line. Russell, who
blossomed in the 1996 playoffs, contributed timely 3-point
shooting, going 4-of-6 from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
Stockton added 11 points and 11 assists and Jeff Hornacek
scored 14.

<HEADLINE> First GEF Biodiversity Project in China Yields Positive Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Officials in charge of the
biodiversity investment project in China funded by the Global
Environment Facility are now busy receiving and revising
management plans sent by the ten project natural reserves across
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the project has yielded positive
results and come to a new stage of work after nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with the progress of the project, which so
far is proceeding quite smoothly," said Susan Shen, a senior
ecologist from GEF's agency for this project--the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Named the GEF China Natural Reserves Management Project, the
project was started in 1995 jointly by the GEF and the Ministry of
Forestry of China. The expected investment for the project totals
23.6 million US dollars, with some 70 percent donated by the GEF.
</P>
<P>
"The project aims to establish ten demonstration natural
reserves throughout China by formulating detailed and practical
management plans and encouraging more local participation, and
thus protect biodiversity in China," said Yin Hong, an official
from the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
One positive result of the GEF project-- a new national natural
reserve in northwest China's Shaanxi province has been established
to put more than 80 giant pandas well under protection.
</P>
<P>
And data bases for resources within the ten project natural
reserves as well as management information systems have been
founded to lay a foundation for further realizing the project's
expected goals.
</P>
<P>
The GEF project has also found its positive results in
spreading biodiversity protection awareness among local
residents. By environmental education and through aid-the-poor
efforts within and around the natural reserves, the project has
raised the interest of local farmers to be involved in the natural
reserves management process.
</P>
<P>
The management plans are also believed to represent a big step
forward in terms of biodiversity protection works in the ten
demonstration natural reserves.
</P>
<P>
"In the past most of our work was only to keep our reserve from
illegal cutting and hunting, but with the management plan which we
worked on for nearly one year, we know that we can do our job much
better, and how," said Zhang Jian, the director of Foping National
Reserve.

<HEADLINE> Higher Primate's Fossilized Remains Found in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The fossilized remains of a
primate, discovered from the 40-million-year-old Pondaung
formation in Myanmar recently, belong to a higher primate, experts
said at a press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar experts said the latest discovery will be helpful for
tracing the origin of anthropoids.
</P>
<P>
The primate's remains are 10 million years earlier than those
discovered in Egypt, they added.
</P>
<P>
They were found in the Sagaing division, Northwest Myanmar, by
a Myanmar exploration team in March and April this year.
</P>
<P>
They added that the latest find, which has fully-developed jaw
 bones, molars and premolars of a primate of a higher genus, leads
to their assumption as the catarrhine primate, the earliest one,
thus providing important clues to trace the origin of anthropoids.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebel Chief Kabila to Visit Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader Laurent
Kabila will visit Kenya within the coming week and hold talks
with Kenyan leaders, his "Foreign Minister" Bizima Karaha was
quoted by today's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Karaha, said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, as an elder
statesman in the Great Lakes region, has a definite role to play
in ending the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan officials saw this as a major step forward because
Kabila had previously refused to come to Nairobi, saying Moi was
"too close" to ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has
ruled Zaire for 32 years, according to the press report.
</P>
<P>
Kabila spoke for the first time to Moi by telephone on Friday
since his rebels launched attacks on Motutu in October last year.
Kabila's forces have occupied three quarters of that vast
country.
</P>
<P>
The phone talk came soon after Kabila's two-hour meeting with
Moi's special envoy Mark Too at his headquarters in Zaire's
second-largest city of Lubumbashi on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Too delivered a special message from Moi to Kabila. The
details of the message so far have not been available.
</P>
<P>
Moi has chaired two regional summits on how to end the Zairean
war, culminating in a special Organization of African Unity
summit on the issue in Lome, Togo, last March. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Facing Three Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army is prepared for
three major challenges to national security, including terrorism
and military threats from Syria and Iran, Israeli deputy Chief
of Staff Matan Vilnai said today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with The Jerusalem Post published
on the remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israeli Wars, Vilnai
said his main job nowadays was planning for the increased
prospect of war.
</P>
<P>
He added he hoped for the best but expecting the worst,
which could be a preemptive missile strike from Israel's two
arch rivals Syria and Iran which both have huge arsenals of
chemical and biological weapons. He expressed great concern
about the efforts by Syria and Iran to develop long-range
ballistic missiles which can reach Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's main challenge would be to protect its citizens,
knock out as many incoming missiles as possible and launch a
swift and lethal counterback, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vilnai said that Syria has begun waving the option of war
with Israel since last August due to the deadlock in the
peace process. He did not rule out the possibility of
Syria's launching a sudden and short-lived attack on the Golan
Heights "in order to achieve something."
</P>
<P>
He said Syrians learned a lesson from the Gulf War by
focusing their efforts on acquiring missiles that could be
used either for deterrence or attacks against Israel. "The
Syrians learned the lesson from the Gulf War. They saw the
influence of 42 Iraqi missiles against Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he pointed out that Syria is in the process of
arming its missiles with VX nerve gas which "is a
dangerous gas that has an effect over time."
</P>
<P>
The general said that the United States, Israel's closest
ally, is committed to maintaining Israel's qualitative edge
over its Arab neighbors in the arms race. "Because of the
complicated situation in the Middle East, we have to
constantly maintain this edge," he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to maintain Israel's qualitative
edge, the U.S. is willing to supply Israel the most advanced
fighter planes along with other systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vilnai played down the press reports about the drop in
fighting spirit among Israeli soldiers when the society has
changed with more prosperity and material comfort. He believed
that Israeli people are still willing to sacrifice their lives
for the nation despite "some developments that we have to
cope with."
</P>
<P>
But Vilnai did express his worry about the current budget
cut in military expenditures, saying the army simply could not
make do with its budget of 10 billion U.S. dollars in face
of the current challenges. "There is no doubt that we are
reaching a red line ... We are saying day and night that
the budget is too small for our missions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Beware of Mischief Makers: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has
warned the nation to guard against some mischief makers, among them,
religous personalities he said were bent on dividing the nation
by reviving factionalism.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of mourners gathered at the National
Heroes Acre to rest the late Zanu (PF) Deputy Secretary for
Finance Stephen Vuma yesterday, Mugabe said those were
building divisions among the people by publishing differences and
the wrongs of the past and denouncing the leaders of today.
</P>
<P>
He said such people wanted to destroy the unity that prevailed in
the country and they would use all kinds of tactics to revive
factionalism of the past.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said such people ''preferred to wear the religious garb and
publish reports that are decidedly meant to divide us and go into the
past, to go into conflict again, to fight those differences which we
have overcome''. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A historic movie "The Opium War"
will be shown throughout the country starting from mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The movie, which is about the war of aggression launched by

<HEADLINE> International Forum to Be Held to Discuss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) --An international forum will
be held in Zanzibar next month to discuss political crisis
in the isles, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the National Assembly Pius Msekwa told
journalists Saturday that the three-day international forum would
be attended by Academicians from the University of Dar es Salaam,
political scientist Ali Mazrui from Kenya and seasoned journalist
David Matin based in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Others are Goran Hyden from Honda University of the USA and a
social scientist David Anqlin.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's major opposition party, the Civic United Front
(CUF) has been contesting results of the 1995 presidential
election in which Salmin Amour, the candidate of the ruling
Revolutionary Party (CCM) was declared winner, alleging that the
polls were rigged.
</P>
<P>
"We shall hold general discussions to broadern our horizons of
the crisis," said the Speaker who will jointly chair the panel
discussions with Speaker of the Zanzibar House of Representatives
Pandu Ameir Kificho.
</P>
<P>
Msekwa said discussants would speak on the theories of
democracy and table proposals for a solution to the Zanziba
crisis. The two contending sides would not be invited to the
discussions because this is an academic exercise, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "we have invited Members of Parliament and
the House of Representatives and political parties each to send
delegations."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chairman of the meeting's preparatory committee,
Ibrahim Msaaha, said that the National Assembly on April 25 this
year appointed a committee of nine people to prepare the
international panel.

MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- "My work requires me to wake up by 5
a.m. and sleep at midnight. I wash pots and pans, some of which
are even bigger than I am. When I got sick, my employer told me
that I had no right to be sick."
</P>
<P>
These were personal accounts given by 15-year-old Cabero Jo-Ann
about her two-year experience as domestic help to the First
National Congress on Child Labor held in Manila recently.
</P>
<P>
"One day my mother told me to quit school and work for that
family because we were too poor to pay the rent," recalled Jo-Ann,
who came from Pasay city of Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Jo-Ann worked for nearly 20 hours a day but was paid only 375
pesos (14.3 U.S. dollars) a month, much lower than the average
monthly wage of about 1,000 pesos (38.2 dollars) for a maid in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Jo-Ann was rescued by social workers in February and will soon
return to primary school with the help of a non-governmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
She was fortunate compared with 16-year-old Arthur Joro-Joro
from Davao city in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Through an interpreter, Joro-Joro, who never attended school
and cannot speak English, told Xinhua that he first worked as a
car-washer in 1987 and seven years later worked in a mining site
in a remote mountainous village near Davao.
</P>
<P>
"Everyday, I should work more than 12 hours, carrying 50 kilos
of silica stones and walking through a 400-meter-long underground
tunnel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of blasts, smoke of dynamite and dust in the site,
Joro-Joro contracted chronic headache and a kind of lung disease.
But he said he had to return to the site to help support his
family after the labor congress.
</P>
<P>
Jo-Ann and Joro-Joro were but two of the millions of children
working in numerous industries across the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Under the criteria set by the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF),
child labor is work that is essential to the survival of his
family but is hazardous, exploitative and harmful to his normal
development and child laborers are minors aged 17 and below.
</P>
<P>
Citing a 1995 survey by the National Statistics Office, Aura
Sabilano, director of the Bureau of Women and Young Workers under
the Labor and Employment Department, confirmed that of the 22
million Filipino children aged 5 to 17, about 3.7 million are
child laborers.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in cooperation with the labor department,
showed that of these working children, about 60 percent are
exposed to hazardous working conditions and 42 percent work more
than 10 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
One out of 100 working children suffers from work-related
injuries or illnesses, according to the survey. The injuries range
from cuts and bruises to burns and skin diseases.
</P>
<P>
Most of the working children are employed in the agricultural
sector and come from the rural areas, particularly from southern
Tagalog, western Visayas and southern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is listed as the top cause of child labor in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study by the UNICEF on child labor trends
in the Philippines, 65 percent of the working children cited
economic reasons for working.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the working children were driven to work to help their
parents who are themselves unemployed to augment the family
income," said Henry Modilla, director for the government's
anti-child program in Davao.
</P>
<P>
But Modilla said poverty was not the sole reason for child
labor because "not all poor families send their children to work."
</P>
<P>
Lack of awareness of child rights and the harm of labor to
children's normal development is another main reason for parents
to do so, Modilla said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, children are hired because they are
cheaper and easier to exploit and control.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the large number of children in the country's
workforce, the Philippine government began its campaign against
the problem in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the government began to cooperate with the
International Labor Organization (ILO) in pushing an anti-child
labor program in communities all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Later, the country adopted the Convention on the Rights of
Child, two ILO conventions on child labor and other local laws to
protect child rights.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, an inter-agency quick action team
and a national police task force have been created to detect,
monitor and rescue children in bond labor, commercial sexual
exploitation and hazardous work.
</P>
<P>
But social workers here said these measures are just a
beginning toward the abolition of child labor in the country and
the government still has a lot to do to cure this protracted
disease.
</P>
<P>
Ana Dionela, a member of the UNICEF resident mission to Manila,
said there is great need for the government to step up education
of parents to raise their awareness of the rights of their kids.
</P>
<P>
The government should also create more employment opportunities
in poor areas, try to meet the basic needs of poor families and
provide alternative economic programs for the livelihood of child
laborers, she said.
</P>
<P>
While admitting child labor is "a vast, complex, multi-faceted
phenomenon" which can not be eliminated in a short time, Dionela
said all walks of life, including the private sector and trade
unions, should be mobilized to help fight child labor, which she
described as "an offense against civilization."

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Resumes Talks With Tribal Insurgents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
resume peace talks here this afternoon with tribal insurgents from
the southern Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), while Muslim settlers
are staging a dawn-to-dusk strike in this troubled area.
</P>
<P>
A three-day dialogue between the National Committee on CHT and
the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sahhati Samiti (PCJSS), the political
wing of the armed tribal rebels, will be the fourth such meeting
since the present government took power last June.
</P>
<P>
The talks have entered a crucial phase in the wake of the last
two rounds in the capital, Dhaka, in which the negotiators failed
to agree on some vital issues like the expulsion of the settlers,
withdrawal of the military from the CHT and land rights for the
tribal people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a settler-dominated group with backing from
opposition political parties has called a strike in the three hill
districts today.
</P>
<P>
They are demanding that representatives of Bangalee settlers
and tribesmen who are out of the ambit of the PCJSS be included in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the settlers' resentment, a splinter group of the
tribal insurgents also dogs the peace prospects in the 14,200
square kilometer region, rich in hydrocarbon deposits and teak.
</P>
<P>
By attacking police and security forces in the hill areas, the
independence-seeking faction has been trying to torpedo the peace
talks and continue the nearly two-decade-old bush war, which has
cost thousands of lives.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Chinese Premier's Visit Surely to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng is
to pay an official good-will visit to Tanzania from May 12 to 14,
a big event which is expected to open up a new page in the
history of Sino-Tanzanian friendship relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Tanzanian friendship, nurtured carefully by the first
generation of leaders of the two countries and watered
assiduously by their successors, is of long-standing and
well-established.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had sympathized with and supported each
other in the long-term fight for national liberation and in the
worldwide struggle against imperialism and colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Tanzania forged diplomatic ties in 1961, they
have not only supported each other in the international affairs,
but also closely cooperated in the internal political, economic,
cultural, scientific and technological fields.
</P>
<P>
The 1,860-kilometer-long Tanzania-Zambia railway, also called
Uhuru (freedom) railway, was built with Chinese assistance 20
years ago and has since then played an important role in the
development of national economies of Tanzania, Zambia and other
eastern and southern African states.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Tanzanian Joint Shipping Company, set up in 1960s,
makes profits every year and has been praised as a "shining
example of South-South cooperation ".
</P>
<P>
China has sent medical teams to Tanzania since 1964. The
Chinese doctors' enthusiasm, high responsibility and outstanding
skills have won widespread acclaim in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
China also provides assistance to Tanzania's projects such as
textile mill, coal mine, farms, sugar factory, and
tools-producing plant, making a big contribution to the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Although drastic changes have taken place in the world
situation in the past more than three decades, the Sino-Tanzanian
friendship has stood up to all tests and been strengthened
through frequent exchange of visits by leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's former President and famous politician Mwalimu
Juliu Nyerere visited China almost every year since he retired
from presidency in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Chinese Premier's Visit Surely to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Former President Ali Hassan
Mwinyi, former Prime Minister John Malacela and Zanzibar's
incumbent President Salmin Amour visited China respectively
between 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's State Councillor and Defence Minister Chi Haotian,
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, as well as State Councillor and
Secretary General of the State Council Luo Gan, visited Tanzania
respectively in 1994, 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has been very grateful for the support given by
Tanzanian people in the international arena and pays high tribute
to the Tanzanian government policy of upholding peace and
non-alignment, its efforts for maintaining regional peace and
stability and for enhancing the South-South cooperation and the
important role it played in the African and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania also treasures its friendship with China. Nyerere
spoke highly of China's profound friendship with Tanzania, saying
"a friend in need is a friend indeed".
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi also described China as "a most trustworthy friend of
Tanzania".
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Mkapa, as soon as he took power, declared
that Tanzania will never change its established policy of "one
China". The president expressed the hope that more and more
Chinese companies would come to Tanzania and make investment to
promote cooperation between the two states in multiple forms.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, cooperation between Tanzania and China has
taken a remarkable step forward with the involvement of
enterprises of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania-China Friendship Textile Company Ltd., the first
joint venture between the two countries, was put into production
on April 1, this year. The joint venture was established on the
basis of the Tanzania Friendship Textile (FTM ) with an aim to
make profitable the poorly-managed FTM which was set up in 1968
with Chinese assistance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ubungo Farm Implements (UFI), Mbarali Rice
Farm, Ruvu Rice Farm, Mahonda Sugar Factory and other projects,
are all underway to be transformed into joint ventures or to be
run in cooperational ways.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Chinese companies have established in Tanzania
Jiefang and Yuejin tracks assembling plants, shoe factory,
clinics and restaurants, all with their own investments or
jointly invested.
</P>
<P>
Eight Chinese civil engineering companies have set up offices
in Dar es Salaam, and since 1990, they have won 172 contracts
worth about 160 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Tanzanian two-way trade reached 83.71 million U.S.
Dollars in 1995 and 83.15 million Dollars in 1996, compared with
74.83 million in 1994 and some 50 million Dollars in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the Chinese premier's visit will
inject fresh vigor into the further development of cooperation
and friendship between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel Imposes Closure On Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel has imposed closure again
on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, not because of intelligence
warning on terrorist attacks this time, but for Israel's Army
Memory Day and Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the state-run Israel Radio today,
quoting an army spokesman announcement as saying, the closure,
which starts today and will remain in effect until 4:00 a.m. local
time (1:00 a.m. GMT) Tuesday, bars all Palestinians from entering
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman said that only in life-threatening emergency
situations would Palestinians and ambulances from the Palestinian
territories be allowed in. Palestinians holding Class 1 VIP
passes, diplomats and non-Palestinians holding foreign passports
are also exempt from the closure.
</P>
<P>
Food, medicine and medical equipment would be allowed into the
territories, said the army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Border closure is a special phenomenon in the Middle
East. Israel uses it as a means of security in its relations with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians condemn it as a collective punishment. The
last closure came after a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv carried out
by an activist of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in
March. It was lifted on April 29.

It records the endeavours made by members of the Committee for
Drafting the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), members of the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR
and Hong Kong residents who love China and Hong Kong to maintain the
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and the smooth transfer of
power there as well as to establish the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
It also depicts the contributions to the solution of the Hong Kong
question made by British statesmen who have breadth of vision and
other friends from Britain.

<HEADLINE> Asia Faces Social, Economic Challenges: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Asia's economic and social landscape
will be transformed again in the next three decades after an
unparalleled rate of change in the past 30 years, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said in a study released today.
</P>
<P>
"The changes should be vastly for the better -- but the
potential for progress could also be squandered," the ADB said in
the study "Emerging Asia: changes and challenges."
</P>
<P>
Examining the social and economic trends that will shape the
region in the next three decades, the study says globalization and
technological change will increase Asia's economic opportunities
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Robust economic growth will continue in Asia, especially South
Asia, over the next three decades. Although East Asia will
experience a slowdown in growth, it does not face a Soviet
Union-style collapse," it says.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, with the change in Asia's population
structure, East Asia will age but South Asia will see a massive
increase in the number of young workers.
</P>
<P>
Social and economic developments promise a great improvement in
the quality of life for millions of Asians, who will live longer
and be healthier, better educated and more prosperous and the gap
between haves and have-nots could narrow rather than widen.
</P>
<P>
But the study notes that economic advance and a higher quality
of life are not automatic and "determined governments," "good
policy choices" and "a strong implementation capacity" will all be
needed to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade challenges, the study says globalization
will create ever larger markets and generate increasing returns
from trade and specialization but will also bring new challenges.
</P>
<P>
The harmonization of international rules of trade will limit
the freedom of individual governments, it points out.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot adopt protectionist policies of old for these will
be incompatible with international norms," it says.
</P>
<P>
On the environment issue, the study says Asia's record is
dismal as 13 of the world's 15 most polluted cities are in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"One in three Asians does not have safe drinking water and one
in two lacks access to sanitation," it says.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, the study says, soil loss and salination caused
by waterlogging has reached crisis proportions and in the forest
and the sea, degradation and depletion are alarming.
</P>
<P>
The study stresses that Asia's environmental crisis, which
threatens economic prosperity as well as quality of life, has been
caused more by failed policies and neglect than by consequences of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But the outlook is not necessarily bleak because a change in
the policy and institutional approaches to environmental issues is
within reach.
</P>
<P>
The study notes a growing awareness that the "pollute now, pay
later" approach makes no sense economically and ecologically.
</P>
<P>
However, the study says, most profound challenges for the
region may result from social and demographic changes because the
traditional Asian family with strong inter-generational links will
change further.
</P>
<P>
"Families will shrink, more children will leave home, more
parents will fend for themselves," the study says.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it says, governments are likely to face more
demands for better tertiary health care and education, pensions
and public safety.

<HEADLINE> ADB Calls Poverty Asia's Most Urgent Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is Asia's largest, most
urgent, and most fundamental problem because almost 1 billion
Asians, or roughly one-third of the region's population, live in
absolute poverty, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a study
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The ADB study, "Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges," says,
"Although Asia's rapid economic growth has led to a significant
drop in poverty, it remains a pressing concern."
</P>
<P>
In terms of a straight headcount, it says, South Asia has more
people living in poverty than Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa
together.
</P>
<P>
"The poverty rate is highest in South Asia where it is 43
percent. By comparison, in East Asia the poverty rate is 26
percent," according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Within South Asia, most of the poor are in India, where the
poverty rate is 52 percent, it says.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, the study says, poverty rates vary
enormously: from 6 percent in Malaysia to 27 in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, Singapore has virtually no poverty while China's
poverty rate is 29 percent, it says.
</P>
<P>
Because most Asians live in rural areas and rural poverty rates
are typically much higher than urban rates, Asia's poverty is
still primarily a rural phenomenon, it says.
</P>
<P>
While growth is the most effective long-term strategy for
reducing poverty, eliminating poverty through growth takes time,
it says.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the study calls for a variety of direct support
programs to protect the poor, provision of credit to the poor and
direct transfer of cash or food to landless farm workers with few
or no productive assets.
</P>
<P>
However, it says, economic growth remains the most effective
path to sustained reduction in poverty rates.
</P>
<P>
"Provided that Asia continues on a path of rapid growth, the
incidence of poverty could be reduced sharply," it says.

<HEADLINE> ADB Sees Progress in Basic Education in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Asia has made remarkable progress in
basic education in the past 30 years, but some countries in the
region have lagged severely behind this education push, says an
Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released here today.
</P>
<P>
The study, titled "Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges," says
that in two-thirds of the Asian countries, more than 95 percent of
children between the ages of six and 11 now reportedly go to
primary school.
</P>
<P>
These include Asia's three most populous countries -- China,
India and Indonesia, it says.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, adult literacy has increased dramatically: eight
out of 10 people in East Asia can now read."
</P>
<P>
While 86 percent of the population in Southeast Asia is
literate, 50 percent of the people in South Asia can read,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The study says secondary school enrollment has also risen in
Asia and nearly 50 percent of children aged between 12 and 17 in
the region attend school.
</P>
<P>
However, it says, in South Asia, where income grew more slowly,
relatively fewer children go to secondary school.
</P>
<P>
In general, East Asian countries have seen the biggest increase
in secondary school enrollments, the study says.
</P>
<P>
But some Asian countries have lagged severely behind the
education drive, the study says, adding that in Pakistan the
primary school enrollment rate is 44 percent and in Afghanistan it
is even lower, at 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Asia has the region's lowest adult literacy rates: 26
percent in Nepal, 30 percent in Afghanistan, 36 percent in
Pakistan, 37 percent in Bangladesh and 40 percent in Bhutan, it
says.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, South Asia has an estimated 420 million illiterate
adults, most of them in rural areas, where both schools and
teachers are most scarce," the study says.
</P>
<P>
The study notes that for some South Asian countries the major
challenge remains increasing access to basic education, but for
the more advanced countries, the biggest future challenge will be
expanding higher education.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Environmental Quality Deteriorates: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Asia's environmental performance has
not matched its remarkable economic progress in the past 30 years
and Asia is now one of the most polluted regions in the world,
according to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) study released here
today.
</P>
<P>
"While rapid economic development has created dynamism and
wealth, Asia has at the same time become dirtier, less
ecologically diverse and more environmentally vulnerable," says
the ADB study titled "Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges."
</P>
<P>
During the past 30 years, the study says, Asia has lost half
its forest cover and countless unique animal and plant species.
</P>
<P>
"No other region has as many as heavily polluted cities, and
its rivers and lakes are among the world's most polluted."
</P>
<P>
The study says that despite rapid and steady growth in income
and wealth, at least one in three Asians still has no access to
safe drinking water and at least one in two has no access to
sanitation services.
</P>
<P>
On air pollution in the region, the study says the air in Asian
cities is among the dirtiest in the world with the levels of
ambient particulates generally twice the world average and more
than five times as high as in industrial countries and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
"Among 41 cities ranked by the total range and average level of
particulate pollution, 13 of the dirtiest are in Asia," it says.
</P>
<P>
Referring to water pollution in Asia, the study says the
region's rivers are far more polluted than those in the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, untreated municipal sewage, industrial
effluents and runoff from urban and agricultural activities are
the main sources of water pollution in Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of deforestation, the study says Asia's forest
cover is shrinking by 1 percent a year and "this is particularly
serious as Asia has relatively less forest cover than the rest of
the world."
</P>
<P>
"With 13 percent of the world's forestland and half its
population, Asia has just one third as much forest per person as
the world average, and only one tenth as much as forest per person
as Latin America."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the causes for the environmental problems, the study
says they are not a result of the promotion of rapid rates of
growth.
</P>
<P>
"First, for too long Asian policymakers ignored the
environmental impact of rapid growth. Concern about pollution or
degradation was simply not a priority," it says.
</P>
<P>
"Second, once governments did adopt environmental regulations,
they were ineffectively designed and inadequately implemented. Too
many approaches were simply copied from industrial countries, yet
Asian governments did not learn from the industrial countries'
mistakes."
</P>
<P>
The study suggests that Asian governments should be vigilant
about the environmental impact of their rapid growth and design
public policy to keep pollution, congestion, and resource
depletion within safe and manageable bounds.

</P>
<P>
Brazil will ban medicines such as Entercal, Ortocilin,

<HEADLINE> India's Aluminum Industry Poised for Record Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indian aluminum industry is
heading for a record growth with an expected spurt of demand that
could lead to a price hike in the international market, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
As Indian aluminum companies enjoy low production costs, any
rise in aluminum prices in the international metal market would
bring good profit for them.
</P>
<P>
Besides, as the country's major aluminum producers such as
Nalco and Hindalco have large exposure in primary metal, they
enjoy a better leverage on rising material prices in global
markets.
</P>
<P>
The production cost of Nalco and Hindalco is 950 U.S. dollars
per ton against the global average of 1,249 dollars and 1,225
dollars for global majors like Alcoa, Reynolds and Alcam.
Proximate availability of high-quality bauxite and cheap captive
power and labor are largely responsible for the lower production
costs.

<HEADLINE> Many Blue Chips Crash Under Selling Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices generally remained
mixed last week on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market mainly
on alternative bouts of buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
Bank and petroleum shares remained bullish on interested buying
by foreign institutional investors. Several blue chips shares,
however, crashed under selling pressure in view of discouraging
working results. Weekend rates showed small to modest changes,
with the volume of business remaining below normal.
</P>
<P>
The BSE Sensitive Index moved between 3812.63 and 3751.93
points before finishing at 3769.34 with a modest loss of 31.37
points compared to the previous week's level of 3801.71. The
national index also lost 13.45 points to 1619.57 from the previous
week's level of 1633.02.
</P>
<P>
Despite the passing of the Finance Bill in the parliament
recently, the general sentiment still appeared to be shaky mainly
due to the political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares generally attracted heavy buying support by foreign
institutional investors mainly on hopes that the major banks were
likely to achieve better profits during the current year.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum companies' shares like BPCL, HPCL and others also
attracted brisk speculative support by investors on expectations
of petroleum price hikes shortly.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Sees Remarkable Rise in Tea Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh, a traditional tea
exporter, saw a remarkable rise in tea export during the first
nine months of the current fiscal year beginning last July,
Bangladesh Tea Board sources said.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 22.92 million kilograms of tea from July
of 1996 to March of 1997 and earned about 28.8 million U.S.
dollars. In the corresponding period of the last fiscal year, 24
million dollars was earned by exporting 17.47 million kilograms of
tea.
</P>
<P>
The export target for the current fiscal year has been set at
34 million kilograms to earn 40 million dollars. The Bangladesh
Tea Board hoped that the target of export could be attained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 37.68 million kilograms of tea was
produced during the nine months and the production target for the
current fiscal year has been fixed at 54 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Tea experts said Bangladesh tea growers were receiving a lot of
 inquiries about their output from international buyers as two
large exporters, Sri Lanka and India, have experienced production
shortfalls due to drought.
</P>
<P>
The growers are also hoping for a higher price this year. The
average price of tea is likely to rise to 1.5 dollars per kilogram
from 1.125 dollars last year, due to both domestic and overseas
demand.

<HEADLINE> Italian, Albanian Prime Ministers Meet in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian and Albanian prime ministers
held talks here today on the upcoming general election in Albania,
the mandate of the multinational force in that country and the
plight of Albanian refugees in Italy.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi,
Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino has left for Washington on a
five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the talks attended by
foreign, finance and justice ministers from both countries, Prodi
praised the agreement reached on Friday by Albania's 10 main
political parties to hold a general election by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the election will be transparent and conform to
the conventional standards.
</P>
<P>
But Prodi noted that holding the election will be only one of
the goals of national salvation. Economic rehabilitation and
development and refugee repatriation are also two of the top
priorities for Albania, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi stressed that efforts in solving all these issues should
involve not only the relevant countries and international
organizations but also the participation of the representatives
from various sectors of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Italy will try to convene an international
conference to help and coordinate the reconstruction of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Both Prodi and Fino agreed that the multi-national force in
Albania, whose deployment is both "necessary and timely", will be
needed not only now, but also during and after the general
election.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-strong Italian-led force with a three-month
U.N. mandate is in Albania to secure the delivery of humanitarian
aid and the safety of the strategic facilities such as airports
and arms depots.
</P>
<P>
Fino, who heads a nine-party interim government of National
Reconciliation set up in March, thanked Italy for its help in
bringing about law and order in Albania and its humanitarian
treatment of the Albanian refugees in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Albania plunged into crisis in March following the collapse of
fraudulent saving schemes which led to mass demonstrations and
riots. Angry protesters in the south looted army depots and waged
a rebellion.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (75-76) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (75-76) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will foreign passenger aircraft be able to fly
directly to Hong Kong after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law contains eight provisions on civil
aviation, which is one of the single-item areas receiving the most
detailed attention from the law.
</P>
<P>
These provisions can be summarized in one sentence, that is,
the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will
"provide conditions and take measures for the maintenance of the
status of Hong Kong as a center of international and regional
aviation" after 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the question of flights to Hong Kong of passenger aircraft
from foreign airlines, Article 134 stipulates that the central
government shall give the government of the Hong Kong SAR
authority to "issue permits to foreign airlines for services other
than those to, from or through the mainland of China."
</P>
<P>
That is to say, with authorization from the central government,
the government of the Hong Kong SAR may issue permits to foreign
passenger aircraft that fly to Hong Kong as their only destination
and those that fly to Hong Kong for a stopover.
</P>
<P>
Article 133 also stipulates that, with authorization from the
central government, the government of the Hong Kong SAR "may
negotiate and conclude new air service agreements."
</P>
<P>
It can be believed that Hong Kong's international passenger and
cargo air transport will be more developed and offer greater
convenience after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Question: Why are consulations with the Chinese side required
for large infrastructure projects straddling 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to stipulations in Annex 2 of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the governments of both sides will
establish a joint liaison group to discuss matters relating to the
smooth transfer of government in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the latter stage of the transitional period, the group
will discuss and examine procedures to be adopted to ensure the
smooth transition in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the
Construction of the New Airport in Hong Kong and Related
Questions, the governments of the two countries agree that the two
sides will conduct consultations on importants matters relating to
the airport project straddling 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum also provides that the British side will consult
with the Chinese side before the British Hong Kong government
grants major airport-related franchises or contracts, or provides
guarantees for airport-related debt that goes beyond 1997, or
before the British Hong Kong government proceeds with any major
airport projects other than those contained in the Annex to the
Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that, according to the spirit of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration and related agreements between the two sides,
the British side must consult with the Chinese side, instead of
acting unilaterally, on all major infrastructure projects and the
new airport and related projects that straddle 1997, projects that
relate to the future development of Hong Kong and the smooth
transfer of government.

ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Illegal activities of the so-called
ecomafia in southern Italy have caused approximately 11 billion
U.S. dollars of yearly losses to the country, said a report

</P>
<P>
The ecomafia now controls about half of the construction firms

other construction materials there, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It has profited through activities such as illegal construction
and the transportation and burying of toxic garbage.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 75 percent of houses built within
the past 10 years in the country were illicit. These construction
activities have done damage to many historic spots and posed a
ecological threat, the report said.

<P>
LIMA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today decorated posthumously Juan Valer and Raul
Jimenez, two Peruvian commandos killed in the operation to rescue
72 hostages last month.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who arrived in Lima this morning for a one-day
visit, granted medals to the relatives of the two soldiers at a
ceremony held in the Peruvian capital.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto reiterated his "heartfelt gratitude" to Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori and his government for their efforts to
end the four-month-old hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy.
</P>
<P>
A group of Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas
stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima last December
and took hostage hundreds of foreign diplomats and dignitaries
inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
They released many of their captives in several batches, but
still held 72 until the rescue. All the rebels were killed in the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said it was really deplorable that Valer and Jimenez,
two of the 140 commandos which participated in the Chavin de
Huantar operation, had lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the decorations, the Japanese primer minister
delivered gratitude diplomas to the 138 commandos who survived the
operation.
</P>

circumstances during the execution of a difficult rescue
operation, and for that, I certify your merits and express to you

<HEADLINE> Ruggiero Calls for Flexibility in China's WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Renato Ruggiero, director-general
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), called for flexibility on
all sides in the "final stage" of China's accession process.
</P>
<P>
"Now, as we approach the final stage of the Chinese accession
process, there is a need for flexibility on all sides and a
determination to resolve the crucial outstanding issues in the
negotiations," the WTO chief told a meeting of trade ministers of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
"I have just returned from China, and I came away with a very
positive impression of the Chinese government's commitment to
becoming a WTO member," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts for its re-entry into the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor the WTO in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
"The success of this negotiation is a shared responsibility,
and it can be assured only if we keep up the momentum established
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"In concrete terms, this means making substantive progress on
both the rules issues and market access in the near future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 28 countries and territories are applying for
WTO membership. Accession negotiations are a "very high priority"
on WTO's "ambitious agenda", Ruggiero noted.
</P>
<P>
APEC trade ministers also issued a statement affirming their
"strong support" for the WTO's universal membership.
</P>
<P>
The ministers "confirmed their support for the early accession
of applicants in accordance with WTO rules and based on effective
market access commitments," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day APEC trade ministers' meeting is the first in a
series of ministerial meetings to advance preparations for the
APEC leaders' meeting in Vancouver in November.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also explored how APEC can best support the
ongoing work of the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Defends Status as Buddha's Birthplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepal said today that Lumbini in
the west of the country has long been proved the birthplace of
Lord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, on the basis of scientific
evidence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Nepal's Department of Archaeology
reaffirmed the country's claim for the birthplace of Lord Buddha,
or Sakyamuni, who was a prince of the ancient Sakya dynasty which
existed about 25 centuries ago in today's Indian Subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after what are deemed misleading news
reports here about Buddhism's holy place.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers earlier said a brochure jointly prepared by
Thailand's Department of Fine Arts and the National Museum of
India asserted that the Buddha's birthplace was in India.
</P>
<P>
The Ashoka pillar at Lumbini, which was erected to mark
Buddha's birthplace by ancient Indian Emperor Ashoka around 250
B.C., bears inscriptions providing enough evidence that the Buddha
was born at the very place, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Recent archeological studies by researchers from different
countries have concluded that a stone placed at Lumbini, about 150
kilometers west of Kathmandu and not far from the Indian border,
marks the sacred site of the exact birthplace of Lord Buddha, the
department added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Nepali Foreign Ministry has directed the department
to draft a protest letter to the Thai Embassy here on the
assertion of the Thai-Indian brochure, which has drawn anger among
Buddhist groups and the general public here.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a plan to develop Lumbini as a destination for
foreign pilgrims and tourists with a view to boosting the
country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Although the small town in West Nepal was generally recognized
as the birthplace of Lord Buddha and has become the mecca of
Buddhists all over the world, some Indian researchers have long
tried to include the holy site of Buddhism in their national
territory, Nepali sources said.

PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- All is not gold that glitters. Taken

There are a total of 328 gold and silver medals each and 404 bronze

<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government is "fighting"
to push a bill through parliament to allow millions of overseas
Italians to vote in the parliamentary election, Prime Minister
Romano Prodi said this evening.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony honoring the members of the crack Alpine regiment

Committee approved the bill to amend the Italian constitution,
allowing overseas Italians to have the voting right in the
parliament election.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of the Italian Foreign Ministry Piero Fassino
described the measure as "a decisive and important step" and said
it was "based on unanimous consensus among various parliamentary
groups that allows us to look ahead confidently to the vote on the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch Operation Against LTTE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government forces
will launch a massive operation soon to destroy the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) hideouts in the north of the country,
according to military sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this operation was supposed to be carried out
sometime ago, but has been postponed due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
The troops are expected to clear the road from Vavuniya to
Kilinochchi District to help cut off expenses of transportation.
</P>
<P>
The troops received information to the effect that 3,500 LTTE
rebels are undergoing training in the Mullaitivu jungles, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LTTE rebels are reportedly facing a shortage of
equipment and in the last three months they have removed all
possible food and building materials from Kilinochchi District.
</P>
<P>
Authorities however refuse to disclose the exact date and other
details of the scheduled operation.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 14-year guerrilla war against the
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
island country.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Reforms Bank Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China will speed up financial
regulations and monetary policy reforms this year to assure rapid
economic growth, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Based on the macro-control in previous years and China's
macro-economic objective in 1997, the central bank sets the
monetary policy targets.
</P>
<P>
M0, or newly increased renminbi will grow 120 billion yuan (14
billion US dollars), or about 13.6 percent, compared to 11.6
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
M1, which covers cash, demand deposits and checks, is expected
to grow 18 percent. M2, which includes time deposits and M1, is
expected to grow 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's M1 rose 18.9 percent and M2 rose 25.3
percent. To achieve the targets and ensure the price rise margin
is less than 6.1 percent of 1996, and to preserve rapid, sustained
economic growth, the central bank will adopt various measures in
monetary policy operation.
</P>
<P>
Mandatory control by the central bank on the size of working
capital loans to commercial banks would change gradually to self
control by commercial banks under the supervision of the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
Besides the State-owned commercial banks, other banks will
conduct asset/liability ratio management.
</P>
<P>
The central bank would accelerate indirect regulation reforms
including forming a quarterly money supply plan, monitoring money
supply, checking its asset and liability accounts, improving the
depositing reserve system, conducting special deposit business and
increasing transaction categories and amounts of the national
interbank market.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to speed up construction of the
registration system of national bonds, unify the trusteeship and
clearing system of bonds and operate the bond trustee system's
computer network and the national interbank market.
</P>
<P>
The interbank market will give full play to the central bank's
role in controlling money supply through open market
operation.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Institutions Expand Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to encourage
more financial institutions to expand abroad to satisfy the
nation's fast-growing of foreign trade, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes an official of People's Bank
of China as saying that after more than a decade of development,
Sino-funded financial institutions have a solid presence abroad
and contribute to China's exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, about 660 China-funded financial
institutions including banks, insurance, securities and finance
companies, had been established in over 20 countries and
regions. Most are in major international financial centers such as
Hong Kong, London and New York.
</P>
<P>
Their financial assets exceeded 160 billion US dollars last
year. By providing various financial services for Chinese
companies doing business abroad, the financial institutions cater
to the country's foreign trade. They also help domestic companies
raise foreign funds for the country's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
With the increasingly risky international financial market,
Chinese financial institutions overseas need to improve their
competitiveness and prevent financial risks, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the central bank would intensify
supervision of China-funded financial firms overseas.
</P>
<P>
PBOC, the central bank, will strengthen co-operation with
foreign counterparts in information exchanges so they can learn
more about Chinese financial institutions' operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also will require the financial institutions
to improve their inspection system and perfect auditing
departments.

<HEADLINE> Renminbi Inches Up Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The renminbi continued to
appreciate against the US dollar last month on China's national
foreign exchange interbank market, ignoring the green-back's surge
in the international market, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper says that in China, the renminbi
inched higher against the US dollar at 8.2948 on April 30, up from
8.2955 on April 1. The yuan hit a high of 8.2938 on April 29, the
highest closing price since February.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures show China posted a 6.71 billion US dollars
trade surplus in the first three months of the year, up 25.7
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment inched up 0.37 percent to 4.55
billion US dollars in the first two months. As a result, foreign
exchange reserves totalled 112.06 billion US dollars at the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
Economic figures released by the State Statistics Bureau said
China's benchmark retail price inflation rate was 2.6 percent in
the first quarter, well below the government target of six percent
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the yuan is under pressure to rise against the
US dollar as the foreign exchange supply continues to exceed
demand.
</P>
<P>
The yuan also edged up against the Japanese yen in April,
taking advantage of yen's weakness in the world market, the paper
says.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon President's Banquet in Honor of Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, CAMEROON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Premier Li Peng
was given a grand banquet by Cameroun's President Paul Biya here
today.
</P>
<P>
The banquet was also attended by Prime Minister Musonge Peter
and other cabinet ministers, parliamentarians and foreign
diplomatic envoys in the capital.
</P>
<P>
In his toast, Biya said he was honored to host the visit by a
leader of a country that is playing vital role in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li peng spoke highly of Cameroun government's efforts in
maintaining political stability and developing economy. In foreign
affairs, Cameroun follows the policy of independence,
non-alignment and extensive international cooperation and it is
exerting an increasingly important impact on the regional and
African affairs, Li peng said.
</P>
<P>
On China's limited aid to Cameroun and other African
countries, Li Peng said, the aid is just to express the feeling of
the Chinese people to their African friends. Help is always
mutual, Li Peng said. Li also thanked the Cameroun government for
its upholding of the "one China" policy and its support to China
on the human rights issue. As a matter fact, Li Peng said, China
and Cameroun have much in common and always stand on the same
frontline.
</P>
<P>
Li held that in the new world situation, the maintaining of
African stability and unity is of particular importance. China is
happy to notice that an increasingly number of African countries
have gained common acknowledgement on that issue. In this aspect,
Li peng specified that many countries are endeavoring to bring
about and then maintain domestic peace and stability. They settle
disputes through consultation and relieving contradictions,
actively involve themselves in and promote regional cooperation so
as to seed common development, in addition to opposing power
politics and foreign interference and push ahead the establishment
of a new, just and equitable international political and economic
order.
</P>
<P>
President Biya described China as a loyal, selfless and
trust-worthing partner of Africa and China always best understands
the third world countries.
</P>
<P>
On the two-way trade and economic cooperation, Li Peng
promised that China would bring, without any reserve, its
technology and expertise and management experience to Africa when
conducting economic cooperation with Africa. The ways might
include running joint ventures, joint exploitation of resources
and manufacturing and prosessing what the African and the world
markets need.
</P>
<P>
According to Biya the Sino-Cameroun cooperation covers a lot
of projects related to public health, education, agriculture,
energy and other areas. Some of the projects have already been put
into operation. Both Cemeroun and China have the desire for
further cooperation and there is virtually a great potential for
further cooperation, Biya noted.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Has Interview With Xinhua Prior to China Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac told
Xinhua news agency today that he would lay the cornerstone of the
privileged partnership between China and France during his coming
state visit to China from May 15 to 18.
</P>
<P>
"I will throw the basis of a privileged partnership between
China and France, to the service of peace and a shared prosperity,
in line with the policy defined in 1964 by Chairman Mao Zedong and
General de Gaulle." said Chirac in an interview prior to the
visit, which will be the longest one to a foreign country since he
took office in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
France is glad to see the return to the world stage of China,
whose extraordinary economic and social development have impressed
the world over the past 20 years, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The president hoped that his visit would give a momentum to the
French-Chinese relations by taking advantage of the strong
complementarity between China and France in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
"France, which is the fourth economic power and the fourth
exporter in the world, does not occupy yet in China a place which
measures up to the potential of our two economies." said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should develop cooperation notably in
aeronautics, nuclear electricity and other forms of energy,
financial services and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The president will inaugurate in Shanghai the largest
technological exhibition that France will ever have organized
abroad.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 French enterprises, two thirds of which are small
and medium-sized enterprises, will be represented at the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the role which China and France play in the
multipolar world, the president thinks that China and France "can
together bring a major contribution to the peace of the world" as
two nuclear powers and permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he will sign a declaration with
President Jiang Zemin to illustrate the will of the two countries
"to multiply the opportunities for acting together to construct a
world with more security and more solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Western civilization and Eastern Civilization
are bound to clash as some people claim, the president answered
that the two civilizations will approach a new rendezvous "by
mutual knowledge and respect, and common adherence to the great
universal values."
</P>
<P>
The Conference of Bangkok in March 1996, the first summit
between eastern Asia and Europe in history, has illustrated this
new rendezvous, said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The president hoped the east and west can enrich from each
other and build a harmonious and multipolar world.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he would boost the development of Euro-Asia
relations.
</P>
<P>
"My ambition is to reinforce considerably the political,
cultural and economic relations between these two groups, to
rebalance the great triangle of the world economic growth which
consists of eastern Asia, Europe and North America." he said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that businessmen of the two continents are already
meeting each other, and a foundation for cultural cooperation has
been created, the president is convinced that the next Euro-Asia
summit scheduled in 1998 will be a great success.
</P>
<P>
The president indicated that the Chinese people, for the first
time in generations, are no more threatened on their frontiers and
are having at the same time stability and an exceptional economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
He gave his best wishes to the Chinese people, hoping that
each Chinese can fulfil his aspirations, in a China open to the
world in which it occupies its place.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Speech on Education in Patriotism (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out of self-interest, some people do not care about undermining
national prestige and moral integrity and do not care about the
damage to state and national interests. The remaining influence of
colonial culture left over from the past has also resurfaced in
some places. This must draw our close attention.
</P>
<P>
All in all, by means of various lively forms, the education and
publicity of patriotism should be strengthened extensively,
thoroughly, and long-lastingly to raise the national self-esteem
and sense of pride among the people throughout the country, to
further carry forward the fine tendency of viewing the love of the
motherland and contributing all energy to building the motherland
as the highest glory, and the tendency of viewing the damage to the
motherland's interests and dignity as the worst disgrace.
</P>
<P>
Our people must be made to value the friendship and cooperation
with the peoples in other countries, and also value national
independence and state sovereignty which have been won through the
blood-shed and sacrifice of generations of people.
</P>
<P>
Our youth should be made to know the motherland's long history
and splendid culture, to know the glorious achievements and fine
traditions of our Party and people, so as to confidently throw
themselves into the great current of the motherland's socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Our Party members and cadres should take the lead in expanding
awe-inspiring righteousness, maintaining national integrity, and
conscientiously safeguarding state dignity and national interests.
</P>
<P>
In one sentence: the enthusiasm about patriotism of the people
of all ethnic groups throughout the country should be turned
into a mighty force to push forward the reform, opening-up,
modernization, and revitalization of the Chinese nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- All is not gold that glitters. Taken
literally, this axiom may well ring true at the second Pusan East
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 402 gold and silver medals and 404 bronze
medals up for grabs in 15 categories of competition events, including
two demonstration sports of rowing and bowling.
</P>
<P>
Those gold medals, however, are only five percent pure gold, in
line with the regulations of the International Olympic Committee.

IOC rules specify that the gold medals should contain more than

<HEADLINE> China to Continue its Dominance in East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With lifters, swimmers and gymnasts
beginning to display their strength and skills on Sunday, the gold
medal race among China, South Korea and Japan will be in full swing at
the second East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that China will repeat what they did last time. At
the first edition of the meet in Shanghai in 1993, China collected 105
golds, 74 silvers and 34 bronzes from 168 events in 12 sports.
</P>
<P>
The Pusan games feature 15 sports including two demonstrations.
China is expected to a strong showing in track and field, a bonanza of
43 golds, as well as in swimming, gymnastics and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
Host South Korea and Japan will vie for the second place. Japan,
which was second at the last games with 25 golds, is determined to
defend that position, but it will face tough challenge from South
Korea, who takes advantage on home soil this time.
</P>
<P>
At a news conferences upon arrival, Yoshiro Okai, Chief-de-Mission
of the Japanese Sports Delegation, predicted that Japan will garner 26
golds in Pusan.
</P>
<P>
Japan is sending a first-rate team in track and field, swimming,
judo, soccer and gymnastics, but they will not have any advantage in
bowling, the sport that gave them six gold medals in Shanghai. Bowling
is listed as a demonstration sport this time.
</P>
<P>
Host South Korea, which was lagged behing Japan by two golds in
Shanghai, is expecting additional golds in taekwondo, the traditional
Korean martial art, along with wrestling and soft tennis in regular
sports.
</P>
<P>
South Korea expects at least five out of eight golds in taekwondo
when Chinese Taipei, Japan and China surfaced as principle rivals to
the hosts.
</P>
<P>
It is also anticipating nine golds in wrestling, led by the 1996
Atlanta Olympics silver medalist Yang Hyun-mo in the 85kg freestyle
division.
</P>
<P>
Swimming can be a factor in changing the medal count. Although
China has sent a second string team for the games, they may get the
most of the titles on offer.
</P>
<P>
Japan is sending its best swimmers, including Ayaro Aoyama, who set
an unofficial world record in the women's 100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's hope in swimming is Ji Sang-joon, whose personal best
of 2:01.39 in the men's 200m backstroke will challenge Japanese star
Hajime Itoi.
</P>
<P>
Diving competitions will be led by China, although Kazakhstan will
challenge them in those events.
</P>
<P>
With six Asian record holders, China will likely share track and
field golds with Japan. Host South Korea is expected just one gold in
athletics through high jumper Lee Jin-taek.
</P>
<P>
In boxing, Kazakhstan with three Atlanta Olympics medalists, will
face tough challenge by the hosts, which entered three Olympians in
the games.
</P>
<P>
The Korea-Japan rivalry in judo will continue this time as Kwak
Dae-sung from the host country will try hard to avange his Olympic
final loss to Kenzo Nakamura in the 71-kg class. Jung Sung-sook, 1995
world champion and bronze medalist in Atlanta will clash for the title
with Atlanta Olympic Games gold medalist Yuko Emoto.
</P>
<P>
Women's judo will also feature two more Atlanta gold medalists,
Korea's Cho Min-sun in the 66-kg and China's Sun Fuming in the over
72-kg category.
</P>
<P>
In gymnastics, China is expected to take a clean sweep in the
team and individual all-around events.
</P>
<P>
Shen Jian finished fifth in men's individual all-around in Atlanta
and claimed two golds at the Asian Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
In individual apparatus, three Olympic silver medalists, Yeo
Hong-chul of South Korea and Mo Huilan of China are among top gold
contenders in men's and women's vaulting event. China's Bi Wenjing
is the favourite for the gold in the uneven bars. It is expected
that Mo Huilan would take five gold medals in Pusan games.
</P>
<P>
With four world record holders and two Atlanta Olympic gold
medalists, weightlifting will bring a brilliant performance to the
games.
</P>
<P>
In the men's division, China is sending two Olympic gold medalists,
Tang Ningsheng in the 59-kg category and Zhan Xugang in the 70-kg
division. Kazakhstan is sending Atlanta silver medalist Anatoly
Khraparty in the 99-kg category. China's Cui Wenhua, Asian record
holder in the 108-kg division, will go head-to-head with South Korea's
Kim Tae-hyun, who finished fourth in Atlanta last summer.
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, Chen Shuchih of Chinese Taipei is the only
world record holder in te 83-kg class in weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
In team sports, China, South Korea and Japan will vie for the gold
medals in the men's and women's basketball tournament. South Korean
has sent its nationals while China and Japan are sending their juniors
for the games.
</P>
<P>
"If we are lucky, we have the possibility to beat the Koreans,"
said Chinese baksetball team manager Kuang Lubin.

<HEADLINE>   Myanmar Businesses Not Shaken by U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar merchants and industrialists
do not tremble at the U.S. economic sanctions against their
country, the official paper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted
an announcement of the Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(MCCI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here on Friday, the MCCI said it shows
no concern about the U.S. sanctions because Myanmar has had the
experience of standing its own economy under whatever situation.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to the change of economic system, private businesses did
not flourish in the period from 1962 to 1988," it noted. "However,
rich natural resources sustained the nation to stand on its own."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government announced a decision on April 22 to ban new
U.S. investment in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The statement disclosed that investments from 22 countries and
regions in Myanmar exceeded 6 billion U.S. dollars as of the end
of April this year and the United States ranks fourth with 582
million dollars in 16 projects after Britain, Singapore and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Without having proper information of the objective situation
in Myanmar, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on it," the statement
pointed out. It added that the United States, which is several
thousand kilometers away from Myanmar and having less trade ties
with the country, is wrong and unilateral in its decision.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks with Cameroun President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
held talks today with Cameroun President Paul Biya on bilateral
cooperation and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Li said he appreciated the efforts made by President Biya as
chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to attain the
goals of the organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU should continue to play an important role at a
time when the world is moving toward multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
Such a role will help safeguard the unity of Africa and
maintain peace and stability in the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said people in the world are now longing for peace and
seeking development, but there still exist factors that could lead
to unrest in the world.
</P>
<P>
There are still a few hot spots in Africa and the continent
faces a strong challenge of economic development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed poverty and backwardness in Africa mainly on the
unjust and unfair international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China stands for the establishment of a
new, just and fair international political and economic order, so
as to enable the people in various countries including African
countries to realize their aspiration for peace and development as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the economic and trade cooperation between China and
Cameroun, Li said the pattern of offering simple economic aid is
being replaced by that of forging economic, trade and
technological cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation between the two countries has a bright
future, and that China sees Cameroun as an important partner.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the enterprises of the two countries
will strengthen exchanges and consultations to seek common
development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier thanked Cameroun for supporting China on
the issue of human rights in the U.N. Human Rights Commission in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries share common views on human
rights. The fact that the attempts by a few countries to impose
their own values on other countries in the U.N. Human Rights
Commission were foiled represents a success by developing
countries in safeguarding their common interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Biya said he shared the view with Li on human
rights. He said the government and people of Cameroun are firmly
opposed to interference by some countries in the internal affairs
of other countries under the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Biya appreciated the important role played by China in
international affairs as a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said China has been always caring about and supporting the
just demands of developing countries, safeguarding their interests
and siding with them.
</P>
<P>
He cited the election of the U.N. secretary general, in which
China had given firm support to African candidates. Biya said the
African people will never forget it.
</P>
<P>
Biya also reiterated that the government of Cameroun will
always adhere to its "one China" stance.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed other issues of mutual concern
and reached broad consensus.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Speech on Education in Patriotism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily today carries a
speech made by Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), at the closing
meeting of the sixth plenary session of the CPC 14th Central
Committee on October 10, 1996, entitled "On Strengthening
Education in Patriotism". Following is the full text of the speech:
</P>
<P>
Education in patriotism is an important part of promoting
ethical and cultural progress. The strengthening of patriotism
education should be carried out throughout the entire process of
socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
Our motherland is a unitary great country with many ethnic
groups. For more than 5,000 years, the Chinese nation have worked
and lived on this land, various ethnic groups have united and
learned from each other. With their diligence and wisdom, they
have jointly developed the beautiful rivers and mountains of the
motherland, and created the splendid Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
A large number of great thinkers, statesmen, military
strategists, scientists, men of letters and artists have sprung
up. The Chinese civilization has not only exerted profound impact
on the Orient, but also made indelible contributions to the
civilization of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have never yielded to invaders, and they
have the glorious tradition of ardently loving freedom, seeking
progress, and safeguarding national dignity and state
sovereignty. Furious hatred of foreign invaders, boundless disdain
for the nation's scoundrels who sought power and wealth by
betraying the country, and great reverence for the noble-minded
patriots have become our precious national character.
</P>
<P>
In modern times, our motherland had been invaded and bullied by
foreign powers for a long time. In the cause of national
salvation, many noble-minded patriots and peoples of various
ethnic groups across the country pursued the hard and constant
path of unyielding struggle.

<TEXT>
<P>
The establishment of the Chinese Communist Party was the
historic marker of the struggle's turning from failure and
victory. Adopting Marxism to observe the fate of the country and
the nation, our party pointed out the right direction and road
towards national rejuvenation and the country's prosperity, and
united and attracted all patriots to fight together.
</P>
<P>
Our Party has inherited and carried on the fine traditions of
the Chinese nation, making the greatest sacrifice and the greatest
contribution in the struggle for national independence and in
defence of state sovereignty, only to win the heartfelt love and
esteem and support of the people of various ethnic groups
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communists are the staunchest and most thorough
patriots. The patriotism of the Communist Party of China is the
supreme example of patriotism of the Chinese nation and the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
As our motherland entered the socialist society, the people of
all ethnic groups across the country united in a joint struggle
and established an independent modern industry and national
economic system in a short period of time, creating miracles which
were unimaginable in old China.
</P>
<P>
In the new historical period, we march victoriously along the
road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the
national economy and various undertakings have made tremendous
achievements which have attracted the attention of the world. The
people of our country have come to realize from their own
experience that only socialism can save China, only socialism can
develop China, and patriotism and socialism are one.

<HEADLINE> Bowling Traces Back to 5,200 B.C. Egyptain Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Bowling is a sport gaining popularity
rapidly among East Asian people, however it seems to be paid less
attention than basketball, soccer or athletics.
</P>
<P>
Bowling is classified as a demonstration sport in the Pusan East
Asian Games, downgraded from the inaugural Shanghai meet where it
entered the official list in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the downgrade, competition in Pusan will be held in only
two divisions, the men's masters and the women's masters.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries and regions are China, Guam, Hong Kong,
Japan, South Korea, Macau and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Bowling has a rich heritage that can date back to the tomb of an
Egyptain child buried in 5200 B.C., according to officials of the
South Korea Bowling Congress.
</P>
<P>
They said the primitive implements included pieces of stone to be
set up as pins, at which a stone ball was rolled.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that another ancient discovery is the Polynesian
game of Ula Maika, also utilizing pins and balls of stone.
</P>
<P>
The stones were to be rolled for a distance of 60 feet, a criterion
that today is still one of the basic regulations of tenpins.
</P>
<P>
International Bowling Federation (FIQ) regulates two disciplines:
tenpin and ninepin. Ninepin is concentrated on the European Continent,
while tenpin is played worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Both disciplines conduct numerous world and regional championships
for men, women and youth.
</P>
<P>
Tenpins is the discipline to be contested at the East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
With 104 member federations in 93 countries and regions, FIQ,
founded in 1952, oversees more than 100 million participants and 10
million competitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the course of reform, opening-up and modernization, a large
number of heroic and model people have sprung up from various
walks of life, who have won honor for the country and created
glorious merits, making the patriotic tradition of the Chinese
nation shine with new splendor.
</P>
<P>
To continue pushing forward our undertakings, education in
patriotism among the people throughout the country, especially
among the youth, must be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Our patriotism is essentially different from narrow
nationalism. Our people must be made to understand that the
important contents of patriotism are to stick to opening-up, to
conscientiously study the strong points of various nations around
the world, to actively introduce advanced science and technology
and management experience, to enhance our self-reliance and to
accelerate the development of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, facing the challenge of power politics and
hegemonism, the vast number of cadres and the masses should be
taught all the time to give priority to the country's sovereignty
and security, and conscientiously safeguard the country's
unification, national unity, and the interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
Some people only see the gap of material production and living
standard between our country and developed countries in the west,
coming to the belief that the all things foreign are good,
worshiping foreign countries blindly and unduly underestimating
the development of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Kasparov plays to draw in Game Five with Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- World chess champion Garry
Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer have to play a final
game after both tied Saturday for the third straight time.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, who played just over four hours, offered the computer
a draw after the 49th move of the game.
</P>
<P>
The six-game match between the man and computer will finish
with a final contest Sunday. Kasparov will take home 700,000
U.S. dollars if he wins, 400,000 if he loses and 550,000 if he and
Deep Blue tie.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov and the computer split the first two games of the
match, then played to draw in Games 3 and 4 on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After two days of rest, Kasparov Saturday played white and had
the first move. As in all the previous games of the match,
Kasparov played cautiously at the outset, seeking to avoid
engagements that would allow the computer to take advantage of its
superior calculating skills.
</P>
<P>
On the 29th move of the game, the computer forced an exchange
of queens with Kasparov and also was able to take one of
Kasparov's weakened pawns. But in executing the move, Deep Blue
misplayed and on the 33rd move, Kasparov was able to regain the
pawn and take the advantage in the endgame.
</P>
<P>
But with Kasparov threatening to promote one of his pawns into
a queen, the computer was able to mount a counterthreat and create
a scenario in which it could place Kasparov's king in a perpetual
check.
</P>
<P>
That forced Kasparov to offer the draw, which the computer
accepted.

<HEADLINE> APEC Trade Ministers to Further Liberalize Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The trade ministers of Asia and
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ended their meeting here
today, after reviewing progress in APEC work programs and
identifying new initiatives for liberalization and facilitation of
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"The major significance of this meeting is the broad
support...to develop sectoral liberalization initiatives in APEC,"
said chair Art Eggleton, Canada's Minister of International Trade.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting has created the momentum to move forward
recommendations on specific sectors to leaders in November," he
told a news conference with other APEC trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is the first in a series of ministerial
meetings that Canada will chair to advance preparations for the
APEC Leaders' Meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
A number of sectors that might be candidates for early
voluntary liberalization have been discussed, according to the
statement of the chair.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers agreed to direct officials to examine the merits of
pursuing comprehensive liberalization in such sectors having
regard to defining scope and coverage, including those that
support enhanced infrastructure and sustainable development," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
These officials will complete their study by the end of August
and report to the ministers in time so as to let them make
recommendations on specific liberalization initiatives to the
leaders in Vancouver in November.
</P>
<P>
On Individual Action Plans (IAP), the ministers agreed that IAP
are key to the implementation of APEC's trade agenda. They will
provide reports by August 15 on actions taken to implement
commitments for 1997.
</P>
<P>
They "agreed to commit to the importance of taking IAP forward
progressively and continuously, with effective means to assess and
review them over time," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reviewed key APEC activities designed to
facilitate trade and lower the costs of doing business, and
emphasizing the importance of intensifying efforts in simplifying
customs procedures and enhancing investment environment.
</P>
<P>
On engaging business and the broader community, the ministers
reaffirmed "the central role of the business sector" and
determined to encourage greater business sector participation in
liberalization and facilitation of trade and in economic and
technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also exchanged views with World Trade
Organization (WTO) director general Renatto Ruggiero on how APEC
can best support the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers affirmed their strong support for a rules-based
international trading system of universal membership, and
confirmed their support for the early accession of applicants in
accordance with WTO rules, based on effective market access
commitments," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
APEC ministers responsible for trade have met jointly with
foreign affairs ministers once annually since November 1989. In
addition, they have begun meeting semi-annually to sustain the
momentum toward APEC's goal.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1989, the APEC forum is a group of Pacific Rim
economies working together to promote open trade, investment and
economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It comprises 18 member economies, including Australia, Brunei
Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Iran Kicks Off Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide presidential campaign
launched in Iran today with main streets of the capital inundated
with colorful banners, flags and pictures of presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Leaflets of candidates have been and are still quietly
being distributed door to door from one street to the next
among millions of Iranian households in early morning or in
the evening.
</P>
<P>
A political center of 62 million populated nation, the
downtown Tehran is filled with large banners carrying statements
by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or by the late
religious leader Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The statements call on 33 million eligible citizens to take
part in elections. "Taking part in the elections is a
religious duty," reads a statement attributed to Khomeini, who
passed away eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
This is the 7th presidential elections since late Ayatollah
Khomeini toppled the Pahlavi Dynasty and declared the founding
of the Islamic Republic of Iran in April 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian Council of Constitution (a supervisory body
above the Parliament) on Thursday approved four presidential
candidates out of 238 declaring them eligible to run for
presidential elections slated for May 23.
</P>
<P>
They are hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri,
former information minister Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, former
cultural and Islamic guidance minister Seyed Mohammad Khatami
and Deputy Judicial Chief Reza Zavarei.
</P>
<P>
Except the last, all the first three are clergymen, thus
giving a strong signal that Iran will firmly stick to the
Islamic doctrine laid down by late Ayatollah Khomeini and would
never turn to the secularism in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Constitution stipulates "The president shall be
elected from among religious and political personalities qualified
as follows: of Iranian extraction and nationality, organizer,
judicious, with good name, honesty and virtue, faithful in the
foundations of Iranian Islamic Republic and the state religion
of the country".
</P>
<P>
The council rejected 234, including eight women, who had
nominated themselves for the 7th presidential polls for failing
to meet the main constitutional criteria of being a "political
or religious personality."

<P>
ACC, the conservative faction backed by Ali Khamenei, has
launched a decisive battle against the joint forces of SCC,
the left wing, and G-6 supported by moderate President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
It seems that ACC has gain upper hand over the rival at
the first day of the 12-day nationwide election race since the
yellow flag of ACC and picture of Nateq-Nouri can be seen
every corner of the downtown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The strong momentum from the initial stage of the
presidential race also shows strong and solid financial support
and well-planned organization for hardliner Parliament Speaker
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The slogans in the yellow flag read: "Follow Imam's line,
obey leadership, curb inflation, maintain social justice, continue
construction and eliminate discrimination and deprivation".
</P>
<P>
While the blue flag of the moderate camp G-6 carries
slogans reading: "Choose the president with high votes, Islamic
honor, continue construction and development in Iran".
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that there is no clear and specific
line of the different political forces because there is no
political party system in the country.
</P>
<P>
Individuals are lined up behind various candidates depending
upon their personality and idea. But high-ranking officials follow
their candidates owing to their personal interest. Even the most
influential clergymen are not unanimous.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei drew a clear
line Wednesday for the four candidates. "Our people will not
vote for a candidate who shows the least sign of lenience
toward the United States, Western interference and cultural
invasion".
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that as May 23 draws nearer, more hectic
electioneering can be expected in the coming two weeks.
Khamenei has openly stated that clergymen should actively help
people to select the best candidate.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Constitution bars current President Rafsanjani from
running the third term of presidency and he has to step
down from the office in August.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the 64-year-old president urged officials in
charge of elections to observe neutrality in the upcoming
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani warned that those who violate the law and
regulations would be prosecuted and all state institutions
especially the Interior Ministry are expected to fully undertake
their legal obligations in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government organizations not to misuse the
state-owned facilities during the elections, otherwise "those
involved in such action would be prosecuted."
</P>
<P>
The four candidates are to launch their election campaign
beginning from Saturday until 24 hours before the balloting
starts on May 23. No mater who comes out victorious, the Islamic
value and structure of the society will remain as it is.

AMMAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan met here
today with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz prior to the
latter's departure for home, the Jordanian news agency Petra
reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz briefed King Hussein on the outcome of his recent visits

</P>

The agency added that the Jordanian king also discussed with
Aziz ways of relieving the sufferings of the Iraqi people and to
put an end to the tragic conditions experienced by them as a
result of the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions in 1990 to punish Iraq for
its invasion of Kuwait. The embargo-hit country is badly in need

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects Direct Negotiations to succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government wishes to
see a successful outcome from the projected direct negotiations
between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks when speaking to
reporters on the sidelines of the annual conference of the
country's Democratic Party in Limassol, the second largest city
of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said "we want the face-to-face talks to be
productive and yield results this time. We do not want them to
result in failure as they have done in the past."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make it absolutely clear that we should focus
our attention on efforts in the proximity talks and evaluate
their conclusion," Kasoulides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the on-going U.N.-led proximity talks
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides, conducted by the
U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel since March this
year.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at preparing ground for face-to-face
negotiations between Clerides and Denktash, proposed by the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have not met since October 1994 when the
two men held two rounds of informal talks in Nicosia under the
U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is pushing hard for more direct negotiations between
the two. They are expected to meet again this summer.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cypriot government's decision not to invite
Greek aircraft to overfly Cyprus during military maneuvers, the
foreign minister said his government "did not ask for any
commitments" when it announced its decision on overflights some
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"We laid down no preconditions about moves by the other side,
and each side should be judged on the basis of the decisions it
takes," he added.
</P>
<P>
The decision, he explained, was taken so as not to disturb the
climate in which negotiations are carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's decision to suspend Greek military
aircraft to overfly Cyprus has been welcomed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also welcomed the information from the Turkish
government that Turkey has no plans to overfly Cyprus as long as
Greek aircraft do not overfly the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took control of 37 percent of the island in the wake
of an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state, have been held on
and off for the past 23 years, but so far no tangible results have
been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Turkish General Renews Threats Against Cyprus' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Turkish army official has
threatened Cyprus with a preemptive strike if Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles are deployed in that country, according to
Turkish Cypriot press reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
General Cevik Bir, second-in-command at the Turkish Army's
General Command, sent out the stern warning during his current
visit to the Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He told Turkish Cypriot reporters that if and when the
missiles arrive in Cyprus early next year, Turkey "will not
remain an observer."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government announced the decision earlier this
year to purchase Russian-made surface-to-air missiles to upgrade
the country's defense capability.
</P>
<P>
The decision has caused concern among many circles, and Turkey
has threatened to carry out a preemptive strike if the missiles
are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish general said that his country will continue with
all its strength to support the Turkish Cypriots, and the
self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus which is only
recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Greek Cypriot National Guard's arms
acquisition program posed dangers and that Turkey has
the strength and ability to defend its rights.
</P>
<P>
Cevik Bir's remarks followed a U.S. statement welcoming
a decision by the Cypriot government not to invite Greek
aircraft to overfly Cyprus during military maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also welcomed the information from Ankara
that Turkey has no plans to overfly Cyprus as long as
Greek aircraft do not overfly the island.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believed that these actions will
contribute to a better atmosphere for a solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel has been
conducting proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Meets Senior PLO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara met here today with Farouk Kadoumy, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Political Department, the
Syrian Television reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Shara reviewed with Kadoumy the developments of the situation
on the Arab arena, the Palestinian scene in particular, and ways
of consolidating the Arab stand against the policies adopted by
the Israeli Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy's current visit to Syria comes at a time when the
Middle East peace process has stalled on account of Israel's
hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace march has been again deadlocked for about
two months since Israel started the building of a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Arabs, the Palestinians in particular, regard the move as
a unilateral attempt by Israel to pre-empt the geographic and
demographic status of Jerusalem which the Palestinians want as
the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Syria and the Palestinians have called on the international
community, especially the U.S. to intervene in order to induce
Israel to commit itself to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Although little was made known about the Shara-Kadoumy meeting,
it served as a sign of closer coordination between Syria and the
Palestinian National Authority based in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy, who functions like PNA's chief diplomat, remains in
Tunis to head the PLO political department, while most of the PLO
staff moved to the self-ruled territories in 1994.

<HEADLINE> US to Deploy New Warship in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send a new
frigate to join the U.S. navy stationed in the Gulf region, a top
U.S. military official said in Bahrain today.
</P>
<P>
The warship will be an "additional" one to the U.S. Naval
presence in the Gulf and it will be deployed in July, said Binford
Peay, Commander-in-chief of the U.S. Central Command, at a press
conference in Manama, Bahrain's capital.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini News Agency wired out the statement after Peay
ended a two-day visit and headed for Kuwait to continue his Gulf
tour.
</P>
<P>
Peay gave no details about the new deployment, but he
stressed that his country will continue to commit itself to
maintaining security and stability in the region and help the
Gulf states to face any "potential threat or crisis."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the sanctions the U.N. imposed against Iraq
in 1990 will not be lifted unless Baghdad abides by the related U.N.
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Along with its western allies, the U.S. has deployed some
20,000-strong troops in the Gulf to protect its oil interests, and
to enforce the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 of the U.S. troops are stationed in Saudi Arabia,
which supplies a bulk of oil to the U.S..

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Iran Kicks Off Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tehran, May 10 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
The front-runners are Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
and former cultural and Islamic guidance minister Seyed Mohammad
Khatami, representing respectively the conservatives and the left
wing.
</P>
<P>
The two others are former intelligence minister Mohammad
Mohammadi Reyshahri and Deputy Judicial Chief Seyed Reza
Zavarei. They also belong to the conservative camp close to the
supreme leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Although the regime has declared its neutrality and
impartiality in the elections, Nateq-Nouri has been enjoying
greater coverage by state television and radio. He has been also
giving more speeches in mosques and at other religious gatherings
since he declared presidential nominee on October 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
At 54, Nateq-Nouri is originally from Nour, a coastal city
in Mazandaran province on the Caspian Sea. He has eight
children, including six girls, and is an avid sportsman,
enjoying horseback riding, skiing and mountain climbing.
</P>
<P>
As an activist of the Islamic movement, Nateq-Nouri played an
important role in combating the former Shah since the 1960s.
He became Speaker of the Parliament in 1992, and has led
with a firm hand the powerful conservative faction called the
Association of Combatant Clergymen (ACC).
</P>
<P>
ACC has a majority in the 270-seat Parliament and supports
Nateq-Nouri along with its allies. He has also been backed
by the prestigious Association of Qom Seminary Teachers (AQST)
and is close to the bazaar, the traditional merchant class.
</P>
<P>
Seyed Mohammad Khatami, 54, is regarded as the new idol
of the leftist and liberal camps -- the Society of Combatant
Clergymen (SCC) headed by Mehdi Karrubi and the pro-Rafsanjani
group known as G-6.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is a black-turbaned clergy which means that he is
descending from the lineage of the prophet of Islam. Since
his declaration of the presidential nominee late January, his
campaign largely depends on his honest and clean personality
so he has been getting more and more popular with university
students and the young, with the educated and intellectual,
and with women and the middle class.
</P>
<P>
A well-read man with a tolerant spirit, Khatami is
currently the advisor to the president and head of the
National Library. He speaks English, German and Arabic besides
his mother tongue Persian.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is a liberal clergy who helped the growth of Iranian
cinema, literature and press with his liberal policies while he
was the minister of culture and Islamic guidance before 1993.
</P>
<P>
But he was sacked by Khamenei because he was labeled as
liberal-minded minister and failed to follow the spirit of the
Iranian leader.
</P>
<P>
He resurfaced at the beginning of the year to announce
his candidacy for the presidential election and has hit the
campaign trail hard, giving speeches and holding rallies across
the country, thus constituting real and grave threat to the
aspiration of Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
The two outsiders in the race for presidency are both
hardline conservatives whose lack of political backing or campaign
organization leaves them little chance of victory.

Iraq.

Aziz made this call after meeting with Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali here today.
</P>
<P>

left him the same impression, he added.

The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1990 soon
after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official described his meeting with the Jordanian
prime minister as "friendly and constructive." However, Majali was
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>

of developing bilateral ties between Iraq and Jordan in all
fields, especially in economy and trade.
