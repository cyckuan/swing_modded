<HEADLINE> HK Success Story Will Continue: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Although Hong Kong is going
through a painful readjustment, the city "will again be able to
compete in the global market-place" and will continue to be "a
compelling success story," a prominent banker said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sir William Purves, group chairman of HSBC Holdings, plc.,
delivered a farewell speech to the members of the Asia Society
Hong Kong Center and the wider public of Hong Kong before he
officially retires in June.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "Made in Hong Kong - Some Reflections by
Sir William Purves", the banker spoke highly of Hong Kong's
economic freedom and efficient regulation and in particular its
hard-working people, which justified his full confidence in Hong
Kong's medium-term economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Having been active in Hong Kong community for decades beyond
his financial commitment, Purves put the recent events such as
falling property prices and increasing unemployment, taking pace
in Hong Kong into "some kind of context."
</P>
<P>
"It is very easy to look at the day-to-day problems and lose
sight of the longer time picture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Having lived here through five decades, I have seen Hong Kong
go through recession, market crashes, rioting, bank failures and
political turmoil. And it has always bounced bank -- growing,
thriving -- making it possible for Hong Kong people to make a
better life for themselves and their children," Purves said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a unique place. It has a unique history. Partly
by historical accident, and mostly by sheer hard work, this island
has pulled itself up by its bootstraps to become one of the great
success stories of our era," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The people of Hong Kong, with the majority being Chinese, made
the success story happen, Purves noted.
</P>
<P>
For Asia as a whole, Purves predicted that the economic
downturn will not be a short-term phenomenon. "It looks like two
or three years before Asia picks itself up again."
</P>
<P>
"But pick itself up, it will. No region with high standards of
education, the willingness to work and a competitive export
opportunity will remain down for long in the global market-place,"
the banker noted.
</P>
<P>
One blessing for Asian recovery is that the American economy is
in pretty good shape and Europe is picking up again, he added. "As
the situation stabilizes and liquidity reappears in Asian markets,
economies will start to move again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese CPPCC Chairman Meets With French Senate President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), Tuesday met with the president of French
Senate, Rene Monory.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan invited Monory and other French parliament deputies
to visit China to increase mutual understanding and push forward
the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that both China and France have the tradition of
safeguarding national independence and share common or close views
on many important international issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries have strong complementarity in
economic cooperations and have great potentials in economic and
trade cooperations.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is not only beneficial for the interests of the
people of the two countries, but also for world peace, stability
and development for China and France to build a comprehensive
partnership oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li said that multiparty cooperation and political consultative
system under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the
fundamental political system of China, and CPPCC is the
organizational form to realize this system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CPPCC, which is participated by the Communist
Par ty and eight other political parties, as well as major social
groups and representatives of all ethnic and social groups, has a
wide representativeness and is playing an important role in
China's state political life.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the relationship between the CPPCC and the
French parliament is an important component of the bilateral
links, his visit to France is expected to push forward the
friendly cooperation between the two countries, including that
between CPPCC and the French parliament.
</P>
<P>
Monory said that he personally has a strong good feeling toward
China which he accumulated during his past visits to China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for the achievements made by China in
its reforms and opening to the world.
</P>
<P>
Monory said that as French Senate and the CPPCC have
established good cooperative relations, through mutual efforts,
the relations between France and China will attain new progresses.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan also met with the members of the French-Chinese
friendship group of the French Senate.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the French-Chinese friendship group of the
French Senate, Villiam Chervy, said that the objective of the
group is to stimulate the development of friendly relations
between the people of France and China and to consolidate the
existing friendly relations between the CPPCC and the French
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Chervy said that his group is willing to make a double effort
in seeking new ways for cooperations between France and China.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Gives "Go-ahead" to IMF Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday passed the
fourth letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
in which the government adjusted the country's major economic
figures for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry, the Bank of Thailand and the IMF made the
adjustment after reassessing the economic situation in Thailand to
make the figures more accurate in reflecting Thailand's current
economic situation and future direction.
</P>
<P>
After the adjustment, Thailand's economic growth rate will be
reduced from minus 3 to 3.5 percent in the third letter of intent
to minus 4 to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's export target is also lowered sharply from the
previous 6.2 percent to 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, there is also some good news as the current account
surplus will be increased from the previously estimated 4.4
billion U.S. dollars to 8.5 billion dollars, the inflation rate
lowered from 11.6 percent to 10.5 percent, and foreign reserves
improved from 23-25 billion dollars to 26-28 billion.
</P>
<P>
The IMF once again eased the condition of its 17.2 billion
dollar rescue package to Thailand, allowing the country's budget
deficit to reach 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The international organization agreed in Thailand's third
letter of intent to allow the country to have a budget deficit of
1.5 percent of GDP, which is considered later not enough to
stimulate the stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also approved that the Thai government could lower the
interest rates and issue long-term government bonds to ease the
liquidity crunch in the domestic financial sector.
</P>
<P>
After the IMF's approval of this letter of intent, expected on
June 10, Thailand will receive 800 million dollars from the
standby credit of the IMF's 17.2 billion dollar package.

<P>
BONN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The environmental movement Greenpeace
said Tuesday that it has brought legal charges against several
German power plants involved in a recent scandal of contaminated
nuclear waste shipments.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits were launched after the the recent disclosure that
some of Germany's nuclear-waste shipments to French and British
reprocessing plants had leaked much more radiation than official
standards permitted.
</P>
<P>
The German nuclear power plants are said to have been informed
of the contaminations as early as mid-1980s but have failed to
inform the government or take own initiative to stop the dangerous
shipments.
</P>
<P>
The scandal has sparked a public outcry in Germany and prompted
the government to order the suspension of all nuclear waste
shipments both within the country and to abroad.
</P>
<P>
The German parliament is also due to hold a special session on
Wednesday to clarify the issue.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE Announces Future Strategic Direction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) - The Board of the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) Tuesday issued its
proposals for the Exchange's future strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are designed to enable LIFFE to compete
effectively into the new millennium and emphasize the key role the
Exchange sees for its members as intermediaries in the future of
exchange-traded derivative markets.
</P>
<P>
The Board proposes to bring forward the introduction of its new
Automated Trading Platform (ATP) for financial futures by six
months to the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ATP will be an extension of LIFFE CONNECT for Equity
Options with the capability ultimately of trading the entire range
of the Exchange's futures and options contracts.
</P>
<P>
It is also being designed to enable members to provide
widespread access to LIFFE's products.
</P>
<P>
Other key features of the strategy are:
</P>
<P>
- LIFFE will adopt a profit-making objective, with a view to
generating value for shareholders and, where appropriate, paying
dividends;
</P>
<P>
- LIFFE will continue to enhance the open outcry environment to
provide members and their clients with the most appropriate
trading platform for each product;
</P>
<P>
- The Exchange's corporate structure will be fundamentally
revised to remove the requirements for members to be shareholders
and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
Jack Wigglesworth, LIFFE's Chairman said in a statement: "In
commissioning the development of Connect for Financial Futures for
the second quarter of 1999, the Board is convinced that it has
laid the foundations of a successful and effective automated
trading systems strategy."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Opposition Calls for Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The time was ripe for
cooperation between like-minded opposition parties, South
Africa's largest opposition party, the National Party (NP), said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk said opposition parties
would commit a strategic blunder and a historical error if they
waited until after the 1999 election to cooperate, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
This would only mean possibly smaller opposition will be in
existence in a few years' time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talks about cooperation should take place "on the basis of
equal status", and the NP proposed that the alliance be led by a
committee of leaders, in which leaders of larger and smaller
parties had equal status, van Schalkwyk said.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of an alliance on this basis was that supporters
of each party could still identify with their party's unique
characteristics, while at the same time being part of a greater
entity, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Democratic Party (DP), another major
opposition party in the country, was not opposed to the idea of
opposition parties holding talks on possible joint action ahead
of next year's election.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll said last week that the NP's support fell to
10 percent in May from 12 percent last November while the DP's
support gained from 3 percent to 5 percent over the same period.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 Iranian religious
instructors and students staged a rally in Qom on Tuesday in
protest against a recent ceremony to mark the anniversary of
President Mohammad Khatami's election victory.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators in the city in central Iran accused the ceremony
of having "violated the sanctity of the mourning month of Moharram
by applauding cheerfully in support of the president."
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of students gathered on Saturday at Tehran
University to mark Khatami's landslide victory, applauding his
open-minded policy.
</P>
<P>
Qom religious demonstrators described the cheerful action as
"desecration of the mourning month of Moharram."
</P>
<P>
During the mourning month of Moharram, Shiite Muslims usually
refrain from cheering to mourn the third Imam Hussein, who was
killed in Karbala, southern Iraq, 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Qom protesters said they could not tolerate desecration of
religious jurisprudents and called on religious leaders to
encounter violation of Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
A cleric said that "we warn those liberals and supporters of
the former (Shah) regime and elements working for foreign
espionage organizations to stop targeting the lofty Islamic
values."

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Killed, 2 Wounded in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanese Army (SLA) was killed, two others wounded and two
Lebanese civilians injured in a series of fire exchange between
Lebanese anti-Israeli guerrillas and Israeli troops in south
Lebanon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese radio Voice of the People said the militiaman was
killed when the SLA post at the town of Bint Jubil, inside the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon, was hit by mortar bombs fired by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The two SLA members were also wounded by Hezbollah guerrillas'
shelling on other areas in the western sector of the Israeli
occupied zone, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for Hezbollah's attack, Israeli artillery
troops, accompanied by warplanes, swooped down on suspected
Hezbollah targets inside and outside the zone.
</P>
<P>
Two Lebanese civilians living in the villages of Yatir and
Hadata on the edge of the zone were moderately wounded during the
Israeli harsh military response.
</P>
<P>
The attack brought to 43 the number of civilians wounded in
south Lebanon since the start of this year. Nine civilians were
killed in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese anti-occupation movement, spearheaded by
Hezbollah, has been staged in a bid to eject 2,000 Israeli
occupying troops and the 2,500 SLA militiamen from south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Blocking Yassin from Entering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official here Tuesday
denied media reports that Jordan had turned down a request by
Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, spiritual leader of the anti-Israeli Islamic
organization Hamas, to pay a visit to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It was only 24 hours earlier that the Jordanian government had
known Yassin wanted to visit Jordan, Deputy Prime Minister for
Services and Minister of Information Affairs Abdullah Ensour told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Jordan will accept such a request by Yassin, the
minister did not make a direct answer, but said that Yassin is "a
respected person" in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Ensour said Jordan's King Hussein had pressed hard to win
Yassin's release from Israeli jail last September, by making use
of the botched assassination attempt by two Israeli agents on a
Hamas' leader in Amman last September.
</P>
<P>
The king secured Yassin's freedom by setting free the two
Israeli agents arrested in Jordan. Yassin arrived in Amman on
October 1, 1997 and was immediately hospitalized. He later left
Jordan for his home in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was jailed by Israel in 1989 and had been expected to
serve a life sentence for ordering Hamas guerrilla attacks against
Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has kept silent about the existence of Hamas offices in
Amman, although it has a peace treaty with Israel signed in 1994.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposed to Missile Deployment in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States remains opposed
to the deployment of the Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile
system in Cyprus, said U.S. State Department special coordinator
for Cyprus Thomas Miller here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, Miller
told reporters that the U.S. is firm on its position that the
missile deployment does not help efforts for a settlement on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Miller and Clerides exchanged views on the latest developments
in the Cyprus problem during their 90-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
Miller told reporters that "our position on the S-300 hasn't
changed." "We think it's a bad idea for them to come here. We are
not challenging Cyprus' right to make decisions, we are just
saying that their delivery is not helpful," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the anti-aircraft missile system
in January 1997, in a bid to boost the island's air defense, and
it is expected to be deployed here later this year.
</P>
<P>
The deal has met strong opposition from Turkey, which has
threatened to destroy the missiles if they are deployed on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, who was present at
the meeting, reiterated to reporters that the reasons for the
government decided to place the order of the missiles "still exist
and there seems to be no change" in sight.
</P>
<P>
"If the reasons for which we ordered them stop existing then we
would not bring them," Kasoulides said, describing this issue as
"clear-cut."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has said it would consider not to deploy
the S-300s only if there is substantial progress in efforts to
settle the Cyprus problem or if the demilitarization of the island
is agreed upon by the two conflicting communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also said that Cypriot government had received
assurances that U.S. will continue its effort to help settle the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who is currently on the island to attend a business
conference, was here earlier this month with U.S. presidential
emissary Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
But their peace mission failed to produce any results due to
the preconditions set by the Turkish Cypriot side for recognition
of their breakaway state in northern Cyprus and withdrawal of
Cyprus' application to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," which no other country than Turkey
recognizes.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Lash out at Jewish "Inciting Act" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials Tuesday
accused the occupation of an area in a Muslim neighborhood in East
Jerusalem by Jewish students as being "an inciting act towards
violence."
</P>
<P>
"It is a new crime against the Palestinian people, lands and
properties (by Israelis)," Faisal Husseini, minister for Jerusalem
affairs of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), said after
Palestinians clashed with Israeli troops and police.
</P>
<P>
"In reality, it is an inciting act towards violence in this
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli religious students occupied the empty land some
three weeks ago in a response to the murder of a 28-year-old
fellow student by Arab suspects on May 7.
</P>
<P>
They set up seven tents Monday night, bring in furniture and
began to connect electricity. A young couple and their children
arrived in the morning to live in the tents.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC) rushed to the area in the day and joined Palestinian
residents to tear down the tents.
</P>
<P>
Several Palestinians were wounded and Husseini was one of the
several legislators beaten by Israeli police and troops.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place as recent efforts to restart the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have failed. The talks have been
stalled for 15 months due to the construction of a Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem and the delayed Israeli withdrawal
from West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"They occupied our lands, they took everything they want (from
us)," an angry middle-aged Palestinian woman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She led the reporters to a nearby roof overseeing the conflict
front, where dozens of Israeli soldiers and policemen were
guarding the area.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who also took part
in the protest, blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for leading the Palestinians and the Israelis "towards the edge of
violence."
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also PNA minister of local government, urged the
Israeli government to take measures to prevent such provocative
acts.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said after the clashes that the
construction was illegal because it was not permitted by the
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani held
emergency talks with PLC Speaker Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) to defuse
the tensions.
</P>
<P>
"The situation will not last long," a young Palestinian said,
referring to the Jewish occupation of the land.
</P>
<P>
"They will cause a lot of troubles, a lot of problems and I am
sure that they will leave soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
No issue is more sensitive than the status of Jerusalem in the
Palestinian-Israeli talks. Israel regards the city as its "eternal
and undivisible" capital while the Palestinians wants East
Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations continues
to stand ready to support efforts at enhancing African
peacekeeping capacity, said Bernard Miyet, Under-Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the one-day African Peacekeeping
Training Strategy Session to discuss the U.N. peacekeeping
training initiatives for Africa, U.N. stand-by arrangements and
the information process, according to U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
The event is a follow-on to the 5 December 1997 meeting on
improving the capacity of African countries to respond to crisis,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
After dwelling on recent U.N. involvement in peacekeeping in
Central African Republic, Liberia and Sierra Leone, Miyet said

<HEADLINE> Iranian Cabinet to Ask for Elections Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate cabinet is to take
steps to divest the conservative-dominated Guardians Council of
the power to screen candidates in elections.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri said on Tuesday that the
cabinet would present a bill to the Majlis (Parliament) asking for
the elimination of the council's authority.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Isfahan University in central Iran, Nouri told his
audience that after the death of late supreme leader Imam Khomeini
in 1989, the council's was interpreted "screening" rather than the
original "monitoring" in elections.
</P>
<P>
This echoed the outcry of the coalition of the leftists and
moderates, who argued the screening role is in contradiction with
Iran's Constitution, which only empowers the council to monitor.
</P>
<P>
The council's growing power to decide the eligibility of
candidates has worried the leftist and moderates and triggered a
hot debate as the country approached the November election of the
Assembly of Experts, which determines the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
The council had in March disqualified a number of famous
leftist and moderate candidates for the mid-term election of the
Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Former Majlis speaker Mehdi Karubi, a leftist, proposed that
top religious leaders assume the role of screening the
qualifications of candidates for the Assembly of Experts, which,
under the Constitution, also has the right to dismiss the supreme
leader in certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
A leftist student group staged a rally here Monday afternoon to
demand the elections reform, triggering violent clashes with
conservative supporters.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister told students a person who threw tear gas
canisters to disrupt the rally organized by the Islamic Union of
Students and University Graduates has been identified and arrested.
</P>
<P>
Nouri denied reports that tear gas had been used by the police
or it was the police that intervened in the rally, saying that a
group of 20-30 unidentified people were responsible for the
melee.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Villagers Resettled in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Government officials have started
resettling thousands of villagers that had been displaced by war
in northwest Rwanda, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Ruhengeri prefecture, food items and farming implements
were distributed to about 20,000 internally displaced residents
of Ruhengeri, some of whom had sought refuge near government
offices or in the town.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Interior Abdul Kharim Harelimana
encouraged the residents of Ruhengeri to cease any form of
support to the Hutu militia and to denounce anyone collaborating
with the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
"Let this week be a week of restoring security in Ruhengeri,"
the minister told the crowd, saying that the militias were chased
out of Ruhengeri town thanks to the work of residents, and
trouble-makers will never again dare come back."
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, Ruhengeri prefecture has launched a one-week
campaign aimed at sensitizing the local residents about
maintaining security in their own communes.
</P>
<P>
Kigombe commune was one of the badly affected areas of
Ruhengeri. Nowadays, security prevails on major roads leading to
the town and its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 residents from all communes of Ruhengeri gathered
at Kigombe local soccer stadium Tuesday in a public manifestation
in which the issue of the support of local population to the
armed insurgency was largely debated.
</P>
<P>
Artists participating in the festivities highlighted the
negative effects of war such as the destruction of
infrastructures, and the loss of human lives because of fighting
or abduction by the militia.
</P>
<P>
"Ten tons of rice, sugar, and beans were distributed, together
with about 4,000 hoes in each commune," a senior government
official in Ruhengeri told RNA.
</P>
<P>
But the quantities distributed are barely enough to cover the
needs of this high number of displaced and other villagers
breaking free from the Hutu militia's grips, the official
indicated.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seeks Closer Cooperation With Jordan on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has called for closer
cooperation with Jordan on Mideast peace process especially after
Washington has failed to reactivate the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a letter from Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to King Hussein of Jordan handed over by visiting
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are the only two Arab countries that have
signed peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The coordination and consultation between the two countries
should contribute to the restoration of the Palestinians'
legitimate rights on their national soil, the foremost of which is
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital, Mubarak said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the current deadlock of the peace
process is a result of the Israeli government's hardline policy
and its "backing down from the great principles for peace."
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters earlier Tuesday that it is urgent for
Egypt and Jordan to pursue closer cooperation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Development and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani told reporters after his meeting with
Moussa that the peace process is in real crisis now and it requires
full coordination by all the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Moussa arrived in Amman Tuesday on a one-day official visit. He
left later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
for 15 months due to the expansion of Jewish settlements in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts by the U.S. failed to bring the two sides back
to negotiations, as Israel rejected a U.S. proposal for its troops
to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the occupied Palestinian land.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan King Arrives in Cairo to Start Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan King Hassan II arrived here
Tuesday evening on a three-day official visit to Egypt for talks
with President Hosni Mubarak to coordinate stances on the Mideast
peace efforts and enhance bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The king was greeted at Cairo International Airport by Mubarak,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and other senior Egyptian officials.
He was accompanied by his son, Prince Rashid, and ministers of
information, justice, economy and finance, industry, and trade.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will hold talks on issues on the Arab, African,
Islamic and international arenas, especially the Mideast peace
process and the European-Mediterranean partnership.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian issue, in particular, will figure high on the
agenda as Mubarak was the chairman of the last Arab Summit and
Hassan is the chief of the Al Qods (Jerusalem) Committee of the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The economic dimension will have an ample place in
Mubarak-Hassan talks as an agreement on setting up a free trade
zone will be signed during the visit of the king. The deal would
in future constitute a nucleus for a common Arab market.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will preside over the second session of the
Egyptian-Moroccan Higher Committee, under which the two countries
are to sign 13 agreements to promote ties and enhance cooperation
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Hassan and Mubarak will also sign a free trade pact, under
which 57 items of commodities will be exempted from customs duties
as a first stage.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, a joint council of Egyptian
and Moroccan businessmen will be formed during the king's visit,
in order to promote investments and trade.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan king's visit to Cairo, his first trip abroad since
1995, is also aimed at increasing the annual two-way trade volume
from the present 35 million U.S. dollars to 200 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> IFAD to Finance Uganda's Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government and the
International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAG) have signed
a 20 million U.S. Dollars agreement to finance the vegetable oil
development project in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed Tuesday at IFAD's headquarters in
Rome by IFAD President Fawzi al Sultan and Ugandan Ambassador to
Italy Vincent Kirabo Kyamaria.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who commended the international organization
for its commitment and dedication to help the rural communities
in Uganda, said the project will end his country's dependence on
oil imports which are consuming a large portion of its foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Uganda depends heavily on imports for its edible oil, and the
first half of 1996 saw Uganda spend over 40 million Dollars on
these imports.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has a total of 60 million Dollars, aims at
developing palm oil industry, mainly involving small holder
producers and private sector processors.
</P>
<P>
The fund will increase productivity and create job
opportunities. An estimated 7,500 farm families, a total of
45,000 people, are expected to benefit directly from the project.

<HEADLINE> China-US Joint Economic Committee Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The China-U.S. Joint Economic
Committee met here Tuesday with both sides desiring to continue
regular consultations on bilateral issues and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Robert Rubin told his Chinese counterpart
Xiang Huaicheng at the eleventh session that the meetings between
the two of the world' largest economies are important to enable
both sides to better understand each other's views on a broad
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis "underscores the importance of
international cooperation and frequent consultation on economic
issues," Rubin said, praising China's role in seeking a solution
to the problems in cooperation with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"China, by maintaining its exchange rate policy, has been an
important island of stability in a turbulent region," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary stressed the necessity of maintaining sound
macroeconomic policies, strong financial sectors and transparency.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is particularly interested in reforms
of China's financial sector, state-owned enterprises and
government restructuring, and keen to discuss ways in which the
two sides could move their relationship and China's integration
into the world economy forward, particular in light of President
Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"Economic issues will play a major role in the Summit between
our presidents, and it is our job to contribute to significant
achievements in this area," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Willing to see China find its way to the World Trade
Organization, the secretary urged China to open its financial
services sector to international firms as part of the accession.
</P>
<P>
Minister Xiang shares the desire to have regular consultations
with the U.S., believing it is of great significance to the
development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since President Jiang Zemin visited the U.S. last
fall, the two countries have taken concrete efforts to promote the
relationship. "The Sino-U.S. Agreement on Peaceful Utilization of
Nuclear Energy has been launched, and a large number of trade and
economic contracts between the two countries were signed."
</P>
<P>
"Next month,the visit by President Clinton to China will
inevitably exert new vitality to the further development of
strategic partnership relations between China and the United
States of America," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
On the Asian financial crisis, Xiang pointed out:"It has been
proved that the prevention of financial crisis is no longer a
responsibility of any single country, but a common responsibility
of all the countries, as well as their interests."
</P>
<P>
He believed that there were four lessons which should be
learned from the crisis: a sound macroeconomic mechanism, sound
and improved banking system and mechanism, a balance of current
account and adequate structure of external debts.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China is also concerned about the trade
imbalance with the ~U.S.. It has sent quite a large number of
economic and trade delegations to the U.S. in recent years for
procurement totaling about 10 billion U.S. dollars in addition to
a new policy of tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
"We also expect that the American side can take active measures
to encourage export to China and reduce restriction on the exports
of high techs to China so as to increase its competitiveness of
American products in China," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
The single-day meeting will also cover cooperation in trade and
investment, trade liberalization as well as China's accession to
WTO. A joint statement is expected to be issued at the end of the
meeting.

WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has

<HEADLINE> Iran: Cooperation With Saudi Arabia Important for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
stated here on Tuesday that Iran is determined to expand friendly
and brotherly relations with Saudi Arabia for the sake of regional
security, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal,
Khatami said the two countries can expand their cooperation and
play more important roles in the world so as to benefit peace and
security in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), Khatami also called for Tehran-Riyadh
cooperation within the framework of the OIC, saying that "I am
sure that the new chapter of ties between the two countries would
have positive impact on the Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
He termed differences of views between countries as "natural,"
but saying that close stands between Iran and Saudi Arabia on
international issues, particularly the Afghan crisis, would help
solve the problems and prevent further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Faisal delivered a message from Saudi King Fahd to Khatami. No
contents of the message were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Faisal arrived here Tuesday morning and also held a round of
talks with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi, during which
the two sides reached an agreement to hold the first session of
Tehran-Riyadh joint economic commission in Riyadh in November.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations, like Tehran's relations with other
Gulf Arab states, deteriorated after Iran's Islamic Revolution in
1979 which ousted the late shah and brought to power the clerics.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Iranian ties warmed up following the election of
Khatami in May last year, and were also pushed forward by the
Islamic summit held in Tehran last December and the visit of the
chairman of Iran's State Expediency Council and former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani in February.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Backs Israeli Stand on Jerusalem: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States House
Speaker Newt Gingrich reiterated on Tuesday that the U.S. Congress
agrees to Israel's claim that Jerusalem is its indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
"We in (the U.S.) Congress stand with you today in recognizing
Jerusalem as the united and eternal capital of Israel," Gingrich
told the Israeli Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
He said the congress passed a resolution in 1995 endorsing
Jerusalem as Israel's capital and demanding the U.S. embassy in
Israel be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. But the resolution is
unbinding to the U.S. Administration.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue between
Israel and the Palestinians. Israel insists that Jerusalem is its
"united and eternal capital" while the Palestinians want East
Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Before Gingrich began the four-day regional tour on Saturday,
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) protested against his
position on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the PNA and the U.S. Administration,
Gingrich Monday canceled his scheduled visit to the proposed site
for a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich told the Knesset that he supports Israel to make
decisions on its own without interference on security issues.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process must ensure that Israel will retain the
ability to protect its own citizens from terrorism. It must
ensure that Israel maintains secure borders with its
neighbors. Without establishing those realities, it cannot
succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, we support the Clinton Administration when it
says that Israel alone must determines its security needs," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's complaints over the alleged Russian
missile technology transfer to Iran, Gingrich said the U.S. should
impose serious sanctions on Russia for its role.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for our patience with the Russian government to
come to an end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich is scheduled to meet with PNA President Yasser Arafat
on Wednesday in the West Bank city of Ramallah and then he will go
to Jordan.

LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Economic Minister
Adam Ingram said on Tuesday the province must seize the the peace
opportunities to translate international goodwill into foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
"We have for the time being a window of opportunity. There is
an excitement around still and there is a lot of goodwill in the
United States for Northern Ireland and the whole of Ireland," he
told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Ingram warned that the days of subsidies to Northern Ireland
might be numbered after the peace agreement to end the conflict
was reached last month and endorsed in referendum last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot live on European support for ever more in the same
way that we cannot live on government subsidies for ever more," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to encourage entrepreneurship, we have got to
encourage companies to invest here," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British government provides Northern Ireland about four
billion pounds (6.7 billion U.S. dollars) a year to support the
area stricken with bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has contributed one billion pounds (1.67
billion U.S. dollars) in structural funds. Nine community
initiatives are funded by Brussels.
</P>

In the past five years, manufacturing output has risen by
almost 22 percent -- twice the British national rate -- and
employment has risen by 6.9 percent compared to 1.7 percent
nationally.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: President Clinton to Visit China to US Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- State Department Spokesman James
Rubin said here Tuesday that President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit to China is aimed at advancing the U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
"Broadly speaking, we believe that America's interests are
advanced in the human rights field and the nonproliferation area,
in the trade area, in the environmental area, in the
anti-narcotics trafficking area, in the international crime area,
by our engagement with China and that is what the president's
visit is all about," he said at a routine press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The senior official was responding to questions that why
President Clinton was so determined to go to China despite strong
oppositions from the Congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The president planned to pay his visit, the first by a U.S.
head of state in almost 10 years, to China in late June. However,
the Republicans, suspicious of U.S. missile technology transfer to
China, have pressured him to call it off until relevant inquires
end.
</P>
<P>
But neither the president nor other government officials have
indicated any change in the plan. National Security Advisor Sandy
Berger warned Sunday that cancellation of the trip will be a "big
mistake."
</P>
<P>
Rubin echoed Berger by saying:"The State Department and
Secretary Albright are interested in the national interest of the
United States of America. And we believe it's in the national
interest of the United States, and the people of the United
States, to engage directly with the Chinese government to advance
America's interest."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the policy of engagement has so far made
progress in human rights and nonproliferation issues. "Part of
that policy of engagement has been to lead up to a trip by the
president to China. Secretary Albright strongly supports that
trip."
</P>
<P>
Rubin denied that high technology was leaked to China under
some policy of the president, saying "China does not benefit
militarily from U.S. commercial satellite launches in which proper
export licensing procedures are followed."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton came recently under criticism for permitting
Loral last February to launch commercial satellites atop Chinese
rockets. The critics alleged that the U.S. national security
interests might be endangered by possible high tech transfer. The
companies involved have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
"Let me repeat that: Contrary to what everyone is casually
saying, there are no policies to transfer sensitive technologies
to China. On the contrary, we go through enormous hoops to try to
prevent the transfer of high technology items to China, even while
advancing America's interest in getting satellites in space. So in
all these cases, what we are doing is advancing American
interests," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives voted last week to ban exports of
satellite and sensitive technologies to China, leaving little room
for the president to explore the possibility of cooperation with
China in space as planned.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Puts off Loans to India Due to Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank said here Tuesday
that it was postponing discussion of several loans totaling over
800 million U.S. dollars to India, which carried out a series of
nuclear tests this month.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the bank said that in response to
requests from several Executive Directors, and in consultation
with Board Members, consideration of three World Bank and one
International Finance Corporation (IFC) loans to India "has been
postponed for a date to be determined."
</P>
<P>
Four proposed projects were due to go the World Bank's board
this week: a 130 million dollar package to support India's
renewable energy program, a 450 million dollar loan to develop
India's national electric power grid, a 275 million dollar loan to
improve highways network in the State of Haryana and a 10 million
dollar IFC loan to a private-sector project.
</P>
<P>
These are among some 2 billion dollars of Indian loans the
World Bank had been expected to approve before June 30, the end of
the fiscal year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's Executive Board is made up of representatives
from 24 countries, and most board members look after the interests
of a number of countries. In all, the 24 members of the Executive
Board represents the total of 182 World Bank member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration ordered a wide range of sanctions
imposed on India earlier this month because of the nuclear tests.
That will end U.S. aid and credits and jeopardize billions of
dollars in additional money.

<HEADLINE> State Department Outraged by Gingrich Comment on Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Tuesday made a fierce counter-attack at House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who had described Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
as an agent of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary of state is pursuing policies at the direction
of the president that are designed to advance the national
security of the American people," State Department spokesman James
Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"She is an agent for the American people and any suggestion
that she is an agent for anyone else is extremely provocative,
unjustified and an outrageous suggestion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich made the comment in a visit to Israel where he
reaffirmed his support to right-wing Likud government headed by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who had flatly turned down a
U.S. proposal on Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Gingrich's suggestion that Albright was an agent
of the Palestinians was "particularly appalling and outrageous".

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader Urges for Palestinian Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader and founder of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), urged for unity of the Palestinians in order to liberate
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Yassin is on a visit to Syria. In a press conference here
Tuesday, Yassin stated Hamas' determination to go on with its
struggle until it achieves victory for "the Palestinian cause and
the Arab nation."
</P>
<P>
Yassin expressed support for convening an Arab summit to
discuss ways of strengthening solidarity among the Arabs in order
to confront Israel's aggressive policy.
</P>
<P>
As to the Middle East peace process, he said it has reached a
deadend and called on the Arab nation to close its ranks and
liberate its lands.
</P>
<P>
Yassin denied that Hamas will relocate its offices from
Jordan's capital Amman to Damascus, saying the movement has
representatives in all the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly being rejected from entering Jordan but the
Jordanian government has firmly dismissed the media reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yassin thanked the Arab countries for their support
to his movement and the Palestinian people. The wheelchair-bound,
quadriplegic Hamas leader was released from Israeli jail last
October where he was serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Yassin met with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, Parliament Speaker
Abdel Kader Kaddura and Information Minister Mohammad Sulman.
</P>
<P>
He discussed with them the latest developments in the Middle
East, including the Palestinian question and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yassin also met with Damascus-based Palestinian opposition
leaders in an effort to close the Palestinian rank.
</P>
<P>
He said he will leave for Baghdad, capital of Iraq, to discuss
with its leaders the release of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war who
have been detained in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Vows to Support Establishment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Tuesday that the Arab countries fully
support Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the battle to
establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian state is surely a reality in the making. Its
establishment would be the much-awaited fruition of the (Middle
East) peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks before a forum organized by the 22-member
organization to mark the 50th anniversary of the displacement of
the Palestinian people with the creation of the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"What really ensures Israel's security is its recognition of
the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East," Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have set May 1999 as the time to declare an
independent state with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital no
matter how the peace process goes.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes the move,
warning that the Jewish state may annex the West Bank if the
Palestinians go ahead with their plan.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been in a deadlock
since March 1997 when Israel started the construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and due to disputes over
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly proposed that Israel withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel has
not, insisting that the withdrawal scope will endanger its
security and that it will hand over no more than 9 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Most Part of Ellis Island Belongs to New Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday
ruled that the most part of Ellis Island belongs to New Jersey and
New York can lay claim to only five of the 27.5 acres (11.2
hectares) of the island, the nation's gateway for millions of
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"The lands surrounding the original island remained the
sovereign property of New Jersey when the United States added
landfill to them," Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
About 17 million immigrants getting in the United States first
touched the island in the New York Harbor between 1892 and 1954.
The immigration center has been restored as a museum visited each
year by thousands of tourists who travel to the island by ferry.
</P>
<P>
New York City officials have taken steps to have the whole
island declared a city landmark. States also have regulatory
authority over land within their borders.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey sued New York in 1993, basing its claim on an 1834
border agreement between the two states that was signed when the
island was only about three acres. The rest of the island was
created later by landfill.
</P>
<P>
The 1834 agreement gave New York the above-water land, while
New Jersey got the submerged areas. New Jersey held that the
surrounding areas remained part of the state when they were filled
in and became above-water land.
</P>
<P>
New York argued that when that area was filled in, it became
New York land and has long been recognized as part of the Empire
State. The state's lawyers told the justices that people born on
Ellis Island were listed as having been born in New York, and the
census listed Ellis Island residents as New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
The Court ruling set New York's border at the low-water mark of
the 1834 island and then adjusting the border to avoid splitting
buildings between the two states. As a result, New York claims all
the main immigration building and the area between it and the
ferry slip. Other buildings would be considered part of New
Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Donors' Grant for E. African Road Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
have raised more than one billion U.S. Dollars from the donor
community for the development of the east African road network.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at the end of the two-day donors conference
for east African road network in the north Tanzanian town of Arusha,
according to a news dispatch reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by the East Africa Cooperation
(EAC) economic block of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and funded by
the EAC, the World Bank and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The report said the amount of money raised at the conference
is enough to cover the first phase of the project which requires
some 1.4 billion U.S. Dollars. But the whole project, aimed at
repairing or constructing 15,273 km of roads, needs 4.6 billion
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jakaya Kikwete, chairman of the permanent tripartite
commission for EAC, who doubles as Tanzanian Foreign Minister,
was happy about the outcome of the conference, saying, "I'm
totally satisfied with the conference and we'll look for more
funds for other phases."
</P>
<P>
A statement during the conference said the European Commission
and the World Bank are prepared to work together with the EAC
members to mobilize additional assistance for the multi-billion
Dollars project.
</P>
<P>
The east African road network covers 6,605 kilometers of paved
roads and 8,668 kilometers of unpaved roads. The first phase to
benefit from the donors' promises covers Mombasa-Malaba-Katuba
corridor and Dar es Salaam-Dodoma-Isaka-Mutukula-Masaka corridor.
</P>
<P>
EAC said in a statement that the regional network is critical
to the facilitation of regional integration. It also said heavy
rains blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon from late 1997 to
this January have heavily damaged their already neglected roads.
The cost of repair is huge, which threatens economic development.
</P>
<P>
Other donor countries and organizations attending the Arusha
conference are: Belgium, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan,
the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Britain, the United States,
Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, African Development Bank, Arab
Bank for Economic Development in Africa, International Monetary
Fund and the United Nations Program.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of the east African countries Monday attended the
conference. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Rwanda
also sent observers to the function.

<HEADLINE> New Phase of "Oil for Food Program" Still under Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's new distribution plan
for an expanded "oil for food program" is still being reviewed at
the working level, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The draft plan may be finalized by the end of this week," he
told reporters at the routine briefing.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been banned from freely exporting oil since it invaded
Kuwait in 1990, with sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, Iraq was allowed to sell limited amounts of
oil under U.N. supervision, with a review set for every 6 months.
The next phase begins on June 3.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Council agreed to permit Iraq to
raise its oil exports from 2 billion U.S. dollars to 5.25 billion
dollars for a phase. Iraq submitted its distribution plan for the
next six months on May 14.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that the sanctions should be lifted due to
its compliance with the U.N. demand to destroy its long-range,
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons, but the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq's disarmament (UNSCOM) is still skeptical about
Iraq's promise.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saaed al-Sahhaf is
due to arrive in New York on Wednesday to meet UNSCOM officials
"to go over all aspects" related to Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM will give Security Council members a technical briefing
on June 3 on the remaining work to be done," he said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Ruling Gives More Protection to Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday that in high-speed chases, pursuing officers can be held
liable only if their actions would "shock the conscience."
</P>
<P>
The court ruled unanimously against the parents of a California
teen-ager killed in 1990 by a deputy sheriff's car.
</P>
<P>
The ruling set a standard even more protective of police than
one some lower courts had employed -- allowing such lawsuits if
police showed a "reckless disregard for life."
</P>
<P>
Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court that police are
entitled to considerable legal protection for the "split-second
judgments" their work demands.
</P>
<P>
Souter said that "high-speed chases with no intent to harm
suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give
rise to liability" under the Constitution or federal civil rights
law. "Only a purpose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate
object of arrest will satisfy the element of arbitrary conduct
shocking to the conscience, necessary for a due-process
violation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, reversing a federal appeals court ruling, killed
a lawsuit by the parents of 16-year-old Philip Lewis against
Sacramento County Deputy Sheriff James E. Smith over their son's
1990 death.
</P>
<P>
Lewis was a passenger on a motorcycle that failed to stop when
another deputy tried to flag it down. When Smith saw the
motorcycle keep going, he pursued it in his police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
The chase ended when the motorcycle skidded to a halt. Smith
tried to stop his car but hit Lewis, knocking him nearly 70 feet
down the road. The youth was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
His parents, Teri and Thomas Lewis, sued Smith in federal
court. The lawsuit now will not go to trial.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Reap 39 Billion U.S. Dollar Surplus This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to bumper tax revenues
swollen by strong economic growth and booming stock market, the
Clinton administration said Tuesday the nation's budget surplus is
expected to reach a record 39 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
"America can now turn off the deficit clock and turn on the
surplus clock," President Bill Clinton said in a White House
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, the president predicted a deficit of 22
billion dollars. However, a torrent of money has been pouring into
the treasury thanks to the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
"This is, of course, very good news for the American people,"
the president said. "Now it's official that this year, well ahead
of the most ambitious schedule, America has balanced the budget."
</P>
<P>
According to the latest projection, the five-year budget from
1999 to 2003 could produce the surplus of 495 billion dollars.
That is more than twice the estimate in February, 230 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The surplus would be the first since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the record surplus was the 12 billion dollars in
black ink the government registered in 1948. But because of
inflation, dollars are worth far less today than they were in
1948, when the entire federal budget was 30 billion dollars as
compared with 1.7 trillion dollars today.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Congressional Budget Office, which makes its own
forecasts, said it envisioned surpluses of 18 billion dollars this
year and 9 billion dollars for 1999.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Drops 2 Points in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Americans' confidence in the
economy dropped slightly in May, but most people are still
optimistic that the healthy pace of economic growth will continue
in coming months.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Conference Board reported Tuesday that its
index of consumer confidence fell to 135.2 in May from a revised
137.2 in April. The decline was smaller than Wall Street analysts'
expectations, and the index remains near the 29-year high of
137.4, which was reached in February.
</P>
<P>
As another sign that the economy is cooling off, the National
Association of Realtors reported home resales slipped 2.5 percent
in April from the record rate reached in March.
</P>
<P>
Investors initially cheered the reports. Stocks surged in early
trading before retreating at midday, while bond prices were
sharply higher, pushing down long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index, calculated since 1985 from a
base of 100, is based on the results of surveys among 5,000
households nationwide. The survey polls consumers on matters
ranging from job availability to buying plans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regrets to Mexico on Money-Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
told Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo he regrets the Mexican
government was not notified in advance of a U.S. money-laundering
sting, said the White House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that Clinton expressed
his regrets last week in a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton expressed regret that better prior
consultation had not been possible in this case," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Zedillo both agreed that "the U.S.-Mexico
counterdrug partnership is vital to success against the shared
threat that people in both Mexico and the United States face," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called
her Mexican counterpart Rosario Green last week to express the
same regrets.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin stressed the cooperation between the U.S. and
Mexico on anti-narcotics.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that we value our cooperation with the
Mexican government in the fight against drug traffickers," said
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities indicted more than 160, including dozens
of Mexican bankers, in a money-laundering sting operation
code-named Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials have condemned the operation as an attack on
Mexico's sovereignty, complaining that U.S. agents operated inside
Mexico without their knowledge and in violation of Mexican laws
and international agreements.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Central Bank Governor Speaks on Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Romania has
set as this year's monetary policy the shoring-up of the financial
markets and the control of inflation, its governor Mugur Isarescu
said in an interview published in the latest issue of the
Financial Market magazine.
</P>
<P>
The two points could be called key directions for the central
bank's monetary policy this year, economic analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the currency and financial markets, including state
bonds, Isarescu said that strengthening not only means avoiding a
step back by liberalizing the markets, but also a smooth operation
that is able to establish healthy habits which take time to
develop and make market dynamics predictable.
</P>
<P>
"Even if any figure linked to this objective is purely
conventional, I would risk saying that we have six more months to
go, to create that critical supply needed on the two markets --
that is, accumulating the good, conditioned habits operating on a
longer time span, its outcome being a genuine market culture and
less vulnerability of the markets when facing negative
expectations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the inflation, he said, "Even if the 45 percent
annual inflation target seems ambitious considering the tax
revisions early this year, we stick to it, although convergent
policy actions in domains such as currency, taxes, wages,
restructuring and privatization are called for, along with clear
means of delivering these signals to the micro-economy."
</P>
<P>
"Not only is high inflation bad for establishing a coherent
free market in the areas of production, consumption, monetary,
currency and capital, it is also difficult for the central bank to
handle. We should make sure this indicator also becomes
predictable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As far as next year is concerned, Isarescu showed a moderate
optimism, predicting that under certain circumstances, an annual
inflation of 25 percent could be achieved in 1999. For the year
2000, taking into account that structural reforms are lengthy and
that inflation is rooted deep in the real economy, he said that
inflation could be under 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the strategy of anti-inflationist
policies should duck the spectacular, politically and
electoral-loaded targets, which could risk inducing a latent
inflation in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Business on The Internet Set for Big Boom: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The amount of business done over the
Internet is set to undergo a period of explosive growth, according
to a report from the UK Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
Within two years, many businesses would be counducting more
than half of their transactions over the Internet as electronic
commerce grows by 300 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey polled more than 1,000 chief information officers in
six major industries in 25 countries. Asked about their
expectations for e-commerce, most said they thought it would
explode.
</P>
<P>
This explosion will bring many businesses and consumers into
regular contact with the Internet for the first time, marking the
long-awaited arrival of e-commerce as an accepted way of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
So far, the benefits of e-commerce are largely unrealised, but
that is about to change. The most rapid growth is likely to be in
the area of consumer transactions, where people and businesses
actually use the web to order goods.
</P>
<P>
Banking, retailing and energy are already aggressively
embracing the new business medium, along with the public sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the report showed that the growth of the number of
transactions over the Internet in North America is likely to be
twice that in Europe, further extending the lead that U.S
companies have in the field of e-commerce.

NEW YORK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks fell sharply Tuesday
in a late selloff, with the Dow Jones industrial average sliding
below 9,000 amid signs that the market's record-setting machine is
losing steam.
</P>
<P>
The Dow plunged 150.71 points to 8,963.73, its fourth trip back
below 9,000 since the blue-chip barometer first closed about that
milestone on April 6. An early 54-point gain had put the Dow
within 50 points of May 13's closing record of 9,211.84.

<P>
While the U.S. dollar surged, broad-market indicators also
plunged over the final hour after surrendering modest opening
gains. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index suffered heavy
losses for the fourth straight session.
</P>
<P>
In the broad market, declines beat advances by an almost 3 to
1 ratio on moderate volume of 533 million shares on the New York
Stock Exchange, compared to a slim 444.73 shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index was off 26.91 points, or 1.49

The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.76 points to

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Top flight sides suffered an early
exit from the Chinese Football Association (CAF) Cup on Wednesday
as a total of four of them bowed out to their lowly counterparts
in the first round of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Songri failed to salvage their 0-6 drubbing by second

and said an early good-bye as the newly-promoted team was forced
to a goalless draw on home turf.
</P>
<P>
Along with them out of the tournament are Shenzhen Pingan, who
crashed 1-3 to Tianjin Taida and got eliminated 3-4 on aggregate,
Yanbian Aodong, edged 0-1 by Wuhan Yaqi and sent home 0-2 on

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Importing Materials for Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi on Tuesday categorically denied reports in the
British press that China supplied Iran with material for chemical
weapons production.
</P>
<P>
"Iran, besides being a victim of chemical arms, is one of the
originators and signatories of the Convention Banning Production,
Employment and Stockpiling of Chemical Weapons," the Iranian
official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed Iran had constantly called on all
countries to join the convention and fully adhere to it.
</P>
<P>
On the recent visit by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi to the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), Mohammadi said the UAE could not be an
exception to the positive atmosphere of expanding ties with Iran
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed bilateral relations and developments in
the region and the world of Islam, agreed to expand dialogue to
boost bilateral ties, and resolve any outstanding mutual issues,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have arrived at the conclusion that they can
resolve the issues between them through dialogue and thus
contribute to the security of the region and its economic
development," he said.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz Raises Sales Projection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest industrial company
Daimler-Benz AG said Wednesday that it now expects its total sales
in 1998 to grow by 13 percent to 140 billion marks (79 billion
U.S. dollars) instead of 134 billion marks (75.9 billion dollars)
predicted earlier.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a shareholders' assembly in Stuttgart, Daimler
chief Juergen Schrempp attributed the upward revise mainly to the
stronger-than-expected performance by the company's passenger car
unit.
</P>
<P>
Daimler, which is currently in the process of merging with the
third-largest U.S. carmaker Chrysler, said Wednesday that its
sales in the first four months of this year had reached 43.8
billion marks (24.8 billion dollars), up 22 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The passenger car unit of the company alone achieved sales of
19.9 billion marks (11.3 billion dollars), up almost 23 percent
from the like period in 1997. Meanwhile, sales of Daimler's
commercial vehicles also rose 23 percent to 14.1 billion marks (10
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S. African Political Landscape May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Shang Xuqian)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South African political
landscape may undergo change as political parties jostle for
their positions ahead of the 1999 general election.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have expressed their interest in joining
hands to prevent the ruling African National Congress (ANC) from
obtaining a two-thirds majority in the election.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there are signs showing that the ruling
tripartite alliance of the ANC, the South African Communist Party
(SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu),
may break up and the three parties may contest the polls under
individual banners.
</P>
<P>
The National Party, South Africa's biggest opposition party,
on Tuesday reiterated its call on other opposition parties to
fight next year's election jointly. It said that the NP was
prepared to form an election alliance with other opposition
parties on the basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
In a public speech, NP leader Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said
that the NP and like-minded opposition parties should stop
wasting time, money and energy in fighting one another and start
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that once united, the opposition parties could win
four of the nine provinces in the 1999 polls and prevent the ANC
from gaining a two-thirds majority in the parliament which is
required to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The NP proposes that the alliance be led by a committee of
leaders, in which leaders of larger and smaller parties have
equal status," he said.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk said the advantage of an alliance on equal
status was that the supporters of each party can still identify
with their party's unique characteristics, while being part of a
greater entity.
</P>
<P>
But the NP agreed that the only way in which an alliance
between like-minded opposition parties could work is a shared
policy.
</P>
<P>
"An alliance of parties based merely on opposition to the ANC,
but among whom there is insufficient agreement on policy, is
obviously not the answer," said Van Schalkwyk.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party (DP) leader Tony Leon also endorsed the idea
of leadership talks to explore joint action against the ANC. But
obviously, the DP, which is rising on the political arena, is not
so eager on this issue.
</P>
<P>
United Democratic Movement (UDM) co-leaders, Bantu Holomisa
and Roelf Meyer, on Tuesday also called for an "opposition-party
convention" to weld the opposition into an effective vehicle to
challenge the ANC.
</P>
<P>
However, the UDM and the NP disagree on the form of an
alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The UDM, in the national interest, would invite opposition
parties who are serious about the realignment of South African
politics to disband themselves. This should take place at an
opposition-party convention where new leadership should be
elected for the new formation," Holomisa and Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
They believed that any formal or loose alliance between
existing opposition parties would not change South Africa's
political landscape.
</P>
<P>
"It will not attract a single vote from the ANC constituency,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent opinion poll, the opposition parties now
command just less than 30 percent of the votes. But 14 percent
of voters remain uncommitted, and they would be the target of any
new alliance.
</P>
<P>
The alliance movement gained momentum last week when the NP
indicated that it would be prepared to cooperate on an equal
basis with the other parties, a reversal of its earlier
insistence that any alliance must have the NP as the senior
partner.
</P>
<P>
Since then, both Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi and Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen have given
their guarded approval to a new opposition initiative.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, however, is not keen to be seen as part of an
alliance ganging up against the ANC, while Viljoen queried
whether the NP would still exist in its present form by the time
elections are called in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the opinion poll, the NP is losing its support to
the DP and the UDM and its status as South Africa's number one
opposition is challenged.
</P>
<P>
The ANC has repeatedly called on the IFP to merge with it. But
the future is not clear as the IFP refused to comment on the
issue. The IFP, which won about 10 percent of the votes in 1994,
now has a support rate of only five percent.
</P>
<P>
As opposition parties are considering joint action against the
ANC and its partners, there are growing discord within the ruling
tripartite alliance.
</P>
<P>
The ANC is finalizing a proposal which would require members
of the SACP and Cosatu to commit to the ANC's policies before
being nominated as ANC candidates for the election.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was endorsed last week by ANC's
decision-making body, the National Executive Committee,
stipulated that the ANC would not reserve parliamentary seats
next year for its alliance partners as it did in the 1994
election.
</P>
<P>
The move would ensure that any SACP or Cosatu members who
contest the elections under the ANC banner exactly support ANC
policies, however different those may be from their own party's
policies, an ANC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Cosatu and the SACP have become
increasingly critical of some of the ANC's policy initiatives,
especially economic and labor policies.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Meets with Chinese CPPCC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Wednesday met with Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Li conveyed the cordial regards from Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the development of Sino-French relations had
enjoyed a good momentum over the past several years, as
high-level exchanges were frequent while economic, trade,
scientific and technological, and cultural relations were extended
and increased on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Joint Declaration signed last May in Beijing
by President Jiang and Chirac on building a comprehensive
partnership between France and China marked the beginning of a new
phase of development in Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Li also praised Chirac for paying great attention to developing
relations with China and pushing forward bilateral cooperation on
the basis of mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Li said that the world was
moving toward a multipolar structure, a result of the changing
balance of forces of nations and regions, as well as of a long
struggle for peace and development by all peoples of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world could maintain its multiculturalism and
enjoy a lasting peace only when many countries were playing their
own roles and given their own voices, instead of having only one
country playing a dominating role with one single voice.
</P>
<P>
Li said that all countries, whether big or small, had
contributed to the development of the human community and all had
their raison d'etre and the right to participate in
decision-making on major issues concerning the existence and
development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since General De Gaulle, the leaders of France had
 shown outstanding political insight and courage and played a
major role in pushing forward the integration of Europe and the
forming of a multipolar world.
</P>
<P>
Both China and France, permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, shared an important responsibility for world
peace and development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the two countries held many identical views on
the international situation and major international issues, China
was willing to make joint efforts with France in promoting
bilateral cooperation and Asian-European cooperation, and building
a multipolar world.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Li condemned India for conducting nuclear
tests, which was a blaring denial of and open challenge to the
efforts being made by the international community to prevent
proliferation of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests made by India would bring serious
consequences to the peace and stability in the Indian
sub-continent, Asia and the world as a whole, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China hoped the international community would take a decisive
and clear stand in urging India to stop developing its nuclear
arsenal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac thanked Li for conveying the regards of President
Jiang, and asked Li to deliver his regards to President Jiang,
Chairman of the National People's Congress Li Peng, and Premier
Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction over current French-Chinese relations,
Chirac said that France and China shared many identical views on
major international issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that the consolidation and promotion of friendly and
cooperative ties between France and China were good, not only for
the two peoples, but for world peace.
</P>
<P>
The French president praised China for showing a spirit of
courage and responsibility in the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China was a key element of stability in Asia, and its decision
not to devalue the Chinese currency deeply impressed the world, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear tests by India, Chirac said that France agreed
to China's analysis and was willing to deepen consultations with
China on the issue.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Chirac and Li also exchanged views on
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Defence Minister General Chi
Haotian, in a meeting with Philippine Defense Minister Fortunato
Abat here today, spoke highly of Abat for his contribution to the
development of friendly relations between China and the
Philippines during his term as the Philippine ambassador to China
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission and a state councillor, said that China and the
Philippines are good neighbours and that their people have had
friendly exchanges since ancient times. He quoted a Chinese
proverb that goes: "a near neighbor is better than a relative far
away".
</P>
<P>
He said that although the two countries have different social
systems, both are important in Asia and the Chinese government
values very much its relations with the Philippines. Frequent
high-level visits in recent years have brought their friendly and
cooperative ties to a new stage of development, he said, adding
that he believes that Abat's visit will increase these relations,
between the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Abat said that he first visited China in 1977 as a member of
the first Philippine military delegation to China since the two
countries established diplomatic relations and was honored to
meet Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
And, he said, relations between the two armed forces have grown
rapidly in recent years and exchanges have increased. He said he
appreciated China's sending the destroyer Qingdao to participate
in the Philippine navy's centennial celebration. He expressed the
belief that friendly and cooperative ties between the two armed
forces will grow.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleman Demirel
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto Wednesday rang up
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif separately and discussed
with him the situation arising out of the recent Indian nuclear
tests and their impact on peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sharif apprised both the leaders of the grave threat the Indian
nuclear explosions have caused to the security of Pakistan,
according to a press release issued by the Prime Minister's House
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister said the Indian action had
adversely affected the balance of power in the region besides
exposing the whole of South Asia to the dangers of a new arms
race.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Sharif said, is exercising a great deal of restraint
in the face of the Indian provocations. He, however, made it clear
that "though Pakistan is a peace-loving country, yet it is fully
prepared and capable of giving a befitting response to any
potential aggressor."
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Demirel appreciated Pakistan's legitimate
security concern in the wake of the mounting Indian threat and
reaffirmed his country's support for Pakistan.
</P>

Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto also lauded the mature and
balanced response shown by Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Workers Start Strike Against Mass Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of workers across
South Korea Wednesday held a strike against rising layoffs despite
government warnings of possible damage to the nation's financial
credibility.
</P>
<P>
The strike began at 1 p.m. after the Korean Confederation of
Trade Unions (KCTU), which organized the strike, held negotiations
with the Labor Ministry but they failed to reach common ground.
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice but to go on strike as the government didn't
accept our demands. If the demands are not met, we will hold protest
rallies across the nation Saturday and stage a second general strike
on June 10," KCTU head Lee Kap-yong said.
</P>
<P>
The labor body urged the government to renegotiate with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to abolish mass layoffs, which is
one of stiff conditions tied to the IMF loan of 57 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 120,000 workers at 125 firms are participating in the
strike which will continue till Thursday, said the organization.
</P>
<P>
Among those on strike are workers from Hyundai Motors Co.,
Daewoo Motors Co., auto parts maker Mando Machinery Co., and
shipbuilder Halla Engineering and Heavy Industries Co.
</P>
<P>
An official of Hyundai Motors, the nation's largest auto maker in
the industrial city of Ulsan, said assembly lines came to a halt as
about 32,000 workers joined the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike is expected to deal a blow to the car makers which have
been operating at about 40 percent of capacity because of slumping
demand.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the strike illegal, the government on Wednesday
repeated that heavy punishments would be imposed on the leaders of
the strike.
</P>
<P>
It said that if strikers attempted to interrupt work or occupy
factory buildings, police will be mobilized to break them up.
</P>
<P>
Riot police have tightened security and conducted spot checks
on the streets of Seoul and other industrial cities to block
workers from holding mass rallies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a labor ministry official said the government will
seek to resume negotiations with the KCTU to prevent the strike
from going on.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Auctioning Off Its Industrial Stockpile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest economic
and financial center, is using auctions for the first time to
reduce the mounting stockpiles here.
</P>
<P>
About 2.4 million-yuan worth of stockpiled goods were sold
today, but a relatively small sum still when compared with the
more than 36 million-worth of stockpiled goods that are available.
</P>
<P>
There was brisker business in items for daily use, small
machine plants, and textile products than there was for
instruments and meters, machinery and electronic products, and car
parts.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Yang Zizheng, deputy manager of the Shanghai
Industrial Stockpile Trading Center, the auction's sponsor,
expressed optimism about auctions' ability to get rid of
stockpiled goods and said that the center will continue these
auctions in the future.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has 4.6 billion yuan in industrial goods that have
been sitting in factory warehouses since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since the trading center was established at the beginning of
this year, nearly 1.3 billion yuan worth of goods have been moved.

<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), China's administrative office that controls the
stock market, today said that the public may make use of the
CSRC President's hot-line and letter-box to file their complaints.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the efforts to improve the efficiency and
service of CSRC, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wants to talk to CSRC leaders can reach them at
008610-66210118 and 008610-66210182, or write to: Jinyang
Building, 16 Finance Street, Xicheng District, Beijing 100032. On
the Internet it is at http: //www.csrc.gov.cn.
</P>
<P>
The Commission will also publish all rules and procedures for
issuing stock and its internal disciplinary rules, according to
its vice-president, Chen Yaoxian, who says that they have to be
efficient and clean because their work is directly related to the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises, economic development,
and social stability.
</P>
<P>
In another report, CSRC officials and local government
officials in Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong Province, raided
four companies that were suspected of being involved in illegal

approved any institution or individual for overseas futures or
foreign exchange trading.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
told the first plenary meeting of the State Council
Poverty-Eradication and Development Leading Group that China wants
to solve the food and clothing problems of 10 million of its 50
million poor people in the countryside this year.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that effective steps need to be taken to deal with
this task facing the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The 20 years of reforms and opening-up have meant rapid social
and economic development in China and have been a period during
which the country has helped the largest group of poor people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese statistics show the number of poor going from 250
million in 1978 to 50 million in 1997, while living and work
conditions in rural areas also got better, Wen said, attributing
this success to the priority given to this by the central and
local leadership and the general public.
</P>
<P>
Poverty eradication is one of the major government tasks for
the remaining years of this century, he said, and revealed that
the central government plans to increase poverty-relief funds to a
record high of 18.3 billion yuan this year, up three billion yuan
from the 1997 figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Wednesday praised China for its commitment
not to devalue its Renminbi, saying this was a great support for
financial crisis-hit Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Meeting members of a Chinese delegation headed by Chairman of
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Jing Shuping at his
office here, Badawi also spoke highly of the bilateral relations
between Malaysia and China.
</P>
<P>
He described the bilateral relations between the two countries
as "very good".
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Chinese government would encourage its
entrepreneurs to come to Malaysia and establish joint ventures for
the benefits of both sides.
</P>
<P>
He promised to provide all possible assistance to the Chinese
investors who come to this Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister
Rafidah Aziz met the Chinese delegation on Tuesday and said on the
occasion that at a time when some Southeast Asian countries are
facing economic difficulties, China's announcement that it will
not depreciate its Renminbi is a "very real support" for the
countries in the region including Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
She proposed that apart from the joint committee of economic
cooperation at the governmental level between the two countries, a
mechanism involving members of the chambers of commerce of the two
countries and private entrepreneurs be set up as a supplementary
means to promote economic and trade cooperation between Malaysia
and China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation arrived here on May 24 for a week-long
visit to Malaysia to look for business opportunities and seek to
expand cooperation between the two sides.

can play in maintaining a really good environment for the entire
population," she added.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Talks With Russia, Belarus, Moldova on Property Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Talks are underway between Ukraine,
Russia, Belarus and Moldova on the ownership of hundreds of
properties still in dispute after the break-up of the Soviet
Union, local media reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Vitaly Kryukov, the first vice-chairman of
the Ukrainian State-owned Property Fund, as saying recently that
Russia had asked for the ownership of 300 facilities on Ukrainian
territory while Ukraine has asked for 100 in return.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had different views on the solution to the property
dispute, Kryukov noted.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine held that the facilities should be owned by the country
where they were located, but Russia held that the facilities
should belong to the country which actually owned them.
</P>
<P>
Working groups from the privatization organs of the two
countries will continue their negotiations on the issue until the
end of May, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman also disclosed that Belarus had requested
ownership of 34 facilities in Ukraine, but the two countries
reduced the number of the disputed facilities to 15 through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Belarus have agreed to solve the problem before
June 30, 1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also held discussions with Moldova which had asked for
the ownership of 211 facilities in Ukraine, he said. Both sides
agreed to solve the problem before the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had never sought ownership of any facilities in Belarus
and Moldova, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Debt Relief Vital For Economic Emancipation In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma has
asked the international community to acknowledge efforts made by
African countries to achieve economic emancipation by easing
their debt, Malawi News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet in his honor by Malawian President
Bakili Muluzi, Nujoma noted that African nations are making
tangible strides to achieve sound socio-economic development and
could be more encouraged if they were relieved of their debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
"Lately, more and more voices of world eminent personalities
join us in calling for debt relief. I wish that these calls will
be heeded by the financial decision-makers of the international
community and that the debt burden will be written off soonest,"
said Nujoma, who arrived in Blantyre Tuesday for a three-day
state visit to Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian president, accompanied by his wife and some top
government officials, however noted that such efforts could be
meaningless if peace and stability "does not reign on African
soil."
</P>
<P>
"Conflict and tension tear the fabric of human life and
socio-economic emancipation and integration in Africa until peace
and stability is achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "it's only in the non-violent environment that
people can contribute and invest." Therefore, he called on
African countries to completely eliminate the discouraging image
of violence and conflict through amicable means.
</P>
<P>
"Experiences in Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Central African
Republic are an encouraging proof that disputes can be resolved
peacefully given the existence of political commitment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the warring parties in Sudan, Comoros
Islands, Burundi and Rwanda to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian leader expressed his optimism that the general
agreement of cooperation which was concluded between Malawi and
Namibia in 1997 will promote among other things sound trade and
investment, viable agricultural, transport, aviation,tourism and
educational cooperation.
</P>
<P>
President Muluzi said that Namibia and Malawi are facing a
common challenge of improving the living standards of their
peoples by among other ways reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty can and must be reduced and indeed eradicated. This
is our common dream, vision and challenge, " said Muluzi, noting
that this is a major prerequisite for the socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He called for continued trade between the two countries within
the framework of their concluded general economic agreement which
will shortly culminate into a permanent joint commission of
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Malawi and Namibia are members of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for the
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU to Continue Trade Talks over Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the European
Union (EU) will resume trade talks on June 11, with several key
issues yet to be resolved before an agreement could be signed, a
senior official told parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seven big sticking points revolved around anti-dumping and
countervailing measures, safeguards to protect South African
industry, government procurement policy, competition policy,
intellectual property rights, agricultural policies and maritime
transport, said Willem Smallberger, head of the Trade and
Industry Department's EU desk.
</P>
<P>
The next round of negotiations, the 19th to be held, will aim
at resolving as many of the outstanding issues as possible, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Smallberger said that South Africa wants consultations to be
held prior to any anti-dumping investigation being instigated, a
proposal the EU found difficult to accommodate.
</P>
<P>
Dumping occurs when goods are imported into a country and sold
for less than it costs to produce them.
</P>
<P>
The fact that South Africa still had to finalize its
competition policy made this aspect of the agreement difficult to
finalize.
</P>
<P>
With regard to intellectual property rights, Smallberger said
the EU wants South Africa to accede to certain conventions which
some EU members have not signed themselves.
</P>
<P>
If the trade agreement is to be implemented by January 1 next
year, negotiations will have to be wrapped up by the middle of
this year.
</P>
<P>
EU is committed to allowing 95 percent of South African goods
to be imported duty free, while South Africa says that it will
eventually abolish all duties on 85 percent of EU goods.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 89 percent of the South African exports to EU are
duty free, while 81 percent of EU imports do not attract duty.
</P>
<P>
The EU offer includes a provision of opening up its industrial
markets within three years. In return, it wants South Africa to
speed up the abolishment of duties on a list of goods, including
steel and tyres.

<HEADLINE> Official Count Affirms Estrada's Victory in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada
apparently won the May 11 presidential elections with a wide
margin over his nine rivals, the partial official results released
by the bicameral Congress Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
Sitting as a national board of canvassers, a 14-man joint
committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives finished
late Wednesday afternoon the counting of 99 certificates of
canvass of the May 11 polls.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Neptali Gonzales said they would proclaim the
winning presidential and vice presidential candidates on Friday
since the two remaining certificates from the provinces of
Malabon-Navotas and Lanao de Sur will not affect the results.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee is awaiting for the six remaining
certificates of canvass from the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that Estrada of the opposition LAMMP (Fight
of Patriotic Filipino Masses) Party garnered 10.6 million votes,
leading by six million votes over his nearest rival Speaker of the
House of Representatives Jose de Venecia who got 4.8 million
votes.
</P>
<P>
In the vice presidential race, Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo
of the ruling party received 12.3 million votes, far ahead of her
closest rival Senator Edgardo Angara, Estrada's running mate, with
5.5 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Both Estrada and Arroyo have enjoyed a commanding lead in the
unofficial results released earlier by the National Citizens'
Movement for Free Elections, the sole non-governmental group
accredited by the Commission on Elections for a quick count.
</P>
<P>
Ruling party's candidate De Venecia and his benefactor,
incumbent President Fidel Ramos, had already effectively conceded
defeat, calling Estrada the "president-elect" after a joint
meeting here Tuesday during which they agreed to form a
"government of national unity."
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said the joint committee would complete its tabulation
report and submit it to a joint session of the bicameral congress
on Friday for approval.
</P>
<P>
President and vice president are elected separately in the
Philippines. The candidates gaining the highest number of votes in
the presidential and vice-presidential elections will be
proclaimed winners, and no run-offs need to be held.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Comelec said earlier in the
day that it may proclaim the top 10 winning senatorial candidates
tonight whose massive lead are deemed insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
In the May 11 elections, some 80 percent of the 34 registered
Filipino voters went to the polls to elect 12 of the 24 senators,
all 260 members of the House of Representatives, and more than
17,000 local government officials and councilors.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty eight people were killed
when a Mongolian civil aircraft crashed in the northern province
of Hovsgol, Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Search parties found the wreckage of the 1017 Yun-12 of the
Mongolian civil aviation company in a 2,800-meter mountain in
Hovsgol at around 13:00 local time, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But they were yet unable to get to the scene due to bad weather
and the precipitous mountain.
</P>
<P>
A government-organized committee was sent to the spot Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-built Yun-12, carrying 26 passengers and two crew,
was on a domestic flight from Erdenet, northwest of Ulan Bator, to
the western province of Dzavhan and lost contact with the ground
control 15 minutes after it took off at 9:15 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the crash were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
A Mongolian Yun-12 crashed on landing due to strong winds last

<HEADLINE> HK Launches World's First ITV Banking Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China Group (BOC
Group) and Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) jointly announced on Wednesday
the launch of the world's first Interactive TV banking service --
iT's Banking Service.
</P>
<P>
The latest interactive TV (ITV) technology was harnessed to
offer a variety of banking services, which the bank's customers
could easily access via their home TV sets.
</P>
<P>
While the BOC Group supports all specified banking transactions
and provides the bank host for iT's Banking Service on iTV, HKT
provides a seamless interface with the BOC Group system, as well
as the interactive platform and network for the new service.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launching ceremony, Liu Jinbao, senior deputy
chief executive of the Bank of China Hong Kong-Macao Regional
Office, said: "Banking service should be convenient, flexible and
time-saving as Hong Kong people always lead a hectic life.
Therefore we must closely follow the development of electronic
technology to incessantly upgrade the level of our customer
service."
</P>
<P>
Linus Cheung, chief executive of HKT, noted that the launch of
iT's Banking Service on ITV marks a major milestone in the
development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two firms share the common vision, that is to build up Hong
Kong as a leading information city and reinforce its position as
an international financial center, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The new IT's Banking Service on ITV will enable customers to
transfer money between registered accounts in all 12 member banks
of the BOC Group. Other services include account balance inquiry,
multi-currency trading, precious metal trading, time deposit
management, fund transfer and credit card settlement.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Telecom officially launched ITV in March this year,
which now offers a wide array of interactive services such as home
shopping, video-on-demand, music-on-demand and racing-on-demand.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan, Egyptian Leaders Discuss Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting King Hassan II of Morocco
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday discussed the
flagging Mideast peace process, the Middle East News Agency
reported (MENA).
</P>
<P>
They also witnessed the signing of a host of agreements and
protocols on promoting cultural and trade ties and in judiciary,
oil, tourism, agricultural, electricity and fishery.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the
two leaders talked about "diminishing hopes" in the Mideast peace
process because of Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Hassan also met with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat here Tuesday evening. Hassan arrived here
Tuesday for his first visit to Egypt in two years.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was here for a ceremony at the Arab League marking
the 50th anniversary of the loss of Palestinian homeland with the
creation of Israel, renewed his call for an urgent Arab Summit to
save the collapsing peace process.
</P>
<P>
That Moussa made a brief trip to Jordan Tuesday, and Hassan's
three-day visit here are believed part of the Arab coordination
and preparation for convening a summit to close ranks and work out
a strategy to confront Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted diplomatic sources in Cairo as saying that Arab
states are holding intense diplomatic contacts to convene a
limited Arab summit in Cairo early next month.
</P>
<P>
The possible mini-summit, likely to include Egypt, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, Morocco, Jordan, Palestine, the United Arab Emirates and
Oman, would follow up decisions taken by the last pan-Arab Summit
in Cairo in 1996 to tackle the deterioration of the Mideast peace
process, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the constant Israeli attempts to change the
status quo of Jerusalem would figure high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed 15 months ago when
Israel began work on a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem where
the Palestinians want as their future capital. The ensuing
Palestinian suicide bombings in Jerusalem worsened the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been trying to revive the peace talks with a
reported proposal calling for Israeli yield of 13 percent of the
West Bank in exchange for Palestinian crack-down on violence.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have accepted the idea but Israel rejected it,
saying any withdrawal more than 9 percent would jeopardize its
national security.

<HEADLINE> New Oilfield In Eastern Part Of South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and American petroleum
engineers have discovered a new oilfield in the Pearl River
Estuary Basin in the eastern part of the South China Sea, the
China Offshore Oil Nan Hai East Corp. (Conhe) reports.
</P>
<P>
The Fanyu 4-2 Oilfield is 160 km to the southeast of Hong Kong,
in 90 m. of water. It has estimated reserves of 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Santa Fe China Energy Co. Ltd. participated in the
exploration in its first project in China.
</P>
<P>
Fanyu 4-2 oil-gas-bearing strata at a depth of 169.2
m. Test drilling in five strata produced 1,102 tons of oil
daily.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that it is likely that there are more new
oilfields in the area and it is possible that Fanyu will become
the fifth group of oilfields, after the Huizhou, Lufeng, Xijiang
and Liuhua oilfields, in the eastern part of the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six oilfields and oil-bearing structures have been found
in that part of the South China Sea since those waters were opened
to overseas cooperation in 1983. Nine of them have begun production
and produced 12.97 million tons of oil in 1997, making the eastern
part of the South China Sea China's largest offshore crude oil
producer.
</P>
<P>
Conhe is a subsidiary of the China National Offshore Oil Corp,
and China's major oil company in the South China Sea. It is now
the fourth largest oil producer in China. Daqing, which has an
annual oil output of more than 50 million tons, is China's biggest
oil producer, followed by the Shengli Oilfield in Shandong
Province, and Liaohe in Liaoning Province.

<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
fears the impact of the Japanese yen's devaluation on South
Korea's ailing economy, an official spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president expressed deep concern about the effects of the
weaker yen on (South) Korea's exports and the value of the (South)
Korean currency," Kim's spokesman Park Jie-won said.
</P>
<P>
The yen plunged to 137 against one U.S. dollar in Tokyo on
Monday for the first time since August 1991.
</P>
<P>
Japan, once the world's second largest economy, has been
sliding into economic stagnation since the early 1990s, while
South Korea has suffered from an economic crisis since late last

</P>
<P>
President Kim has instructed Finance and Economy Minister Lee

aftermath of the depreciation, said Park.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for the United States to help Japan
revive its economy, including endeavors to boost domestic
consumption, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Tight Monetary Policy to Cause Adverse Effects: Malaysian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Government Economic
Advisor Tun Daim Zainuddin said Wednesday that an extremely tight
monetary policy will bring about unexpected adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions have become very cautious in giving out
loans to the priority sectors and credit demand had been almost
paralyzed with private sector demand having fallen drastically in
the first quarter of the year, Daim, who is also Executive
Director of the National Economic Action Committee (NEAC), said at
the 33rd annual general meeting of the Malay Chambers of Commerce
here.
</P>
<P>
The advisor said, "if the trend continues, there is great
possibility that the country's economic recovery will be
frustrated."
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the current facts and feedback from the
banks and borrowers, there was a high possibility that the
projected 15 percent in credit growth for the year may not be
realized.
</P>
<P>
Daim said besides the shrinkage in credit, the possibility that
Malaysia would not achieve a satisfactory growth rate this year
would become a reality "if we took the overall effects of the
tight fiscal and monetary policies of the government into
consideration."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy is expected to grow between 2 and 3
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Daim said that if the crisis was not tackled in a positive way,
the negative effects from the regional crisis may affect the
country's quick economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said the best way towards recovery was to take into
consideration stabilizing the foreign currency exchange and the
survival of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said although the real cost of loans had come down to around
16 percent from 16 to 20 percent a few months ago, the present
cost is still high and cannot be borne by many companies and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
On the policy direction to take to stabilize and strengthen the
currency exchange rate, Daim said besides adopting a "balanced
interest rate regime," a flexible exchange rate would be the most
suitable route.

</P>
<P>
Weakness in equity markets and the Japanese yen against the
U.S. dollar impacted on markets, causing the fall in the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session below 62.00
U.S. cents for the first time in more than a week at 61.98 U.S.
cents from 62.16 previously.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America foreign exchange manager Mark Glover said the
Australian dollar was being driven by weakness in the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar rose to a new seven-year high against the yen,
with 1 U.S. dollar buying 137.99 yen.
</P>
<P>
"I think the market is worried that if U.S. dollar/yen
(exchange rate) breaks 138.10, you could see it up to around
140.00," Glover said.
</P>
<P>
"If that is the case, there is really nothing that is going to
support the Aussie at all. It will break through that support
unless the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) heavily intervenes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The RBA intervened a week ago when the Australian dollar hit a
near 12-year low of 61.69 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 85.29 from 85.75 against
Japanese yen and at 1.0948 from 1.1026 against German marks.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parties Issue Open Letter to Indian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- One day before Indian President
K. R. Narayanan begins his visit to Nepal, nine leftist parties of
Nepal on Wednesday issued an open letter to him, touching upon
bilateral relations and the issue of recent nuclear tests by
India.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of copies of the letter, available at a press
conference held here by the nine parties, are scheduled to be
issued to the public on Thursday when Narayanan arrives in Nepal
for a three-day visit at the invitation of Nepali King Birendra.
</P>
<P>
The letter notes that relations between Nepal and India are as
old as the history. But after becoming independent from the
shackles of British colonialism, India's policy toward Nepal is
very much similar to that of the British colonialists before 1947.
</P>
<P>
A host of unequal treaties such as the 1950 Treaty of Peace and
Friendship and those on Koshi and Gandaki Dams, Tanakpur and
Mahakali, can be cited as examples of India's pursuance of the old
British policy toward its neighbor, the letter says.
</P>
<P>
Besides, India has encroached upon the border of Nepal in many
places, the letter says.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Vyas region in Kalapani in far-western Nepal has
been a witness to the illegitimate presence of the Indian army for
more than three decades, it adds.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we have also been standing witnesses to the
frequency of Indian policemen's unauthorized intrusion into the
Nepalese territory, a host of illegal activities along the border
and, time and again, India's interference into our internal
affairs," the letter reads. "The Nepalese people hold all these
activities as reflections of India's hegemonistic attitude
undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Nepal."
</P>
<P>
In this context, the series of nuclear tests conducted by India
"have made us realize India's overt motives of imposing its
monopoly capital not only on the Nepalese people but also on the
masses of the entire region," the letter says.
</P>
<P>
"In political terminology, India's recent tests can be labeled
as a part of the grand design that aims, above all, at expanding
its territorial size," the letter says. "In this light, we, the
Nepalese people, hold the tests as inspired by nothing but India's
regional hegemony and expansion-oriented policy."
</P>
<P>
The nine parties including the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), the third largest in the Lower House,
had handed over a protest letter to the Indian Embassy in
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 have drawn widespread
condemnation in the world.
</P>
<P>
The letter, which expresses the opposition to the Indian
president's visit to Nepal, says that the nine leftist parties
have started a combined struggle against India's expansionist
policy.
</P>
<P>
The letter demands that old unequal treaties between Nepal and
India be replaced with new ones based on equality, mutual
benefits, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and
reciprocal respect for national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
And the Indian armed forces stationed in the Nepalese soil be
withdrawn immediately; the Nepalese territory encroached upon by
India be immediately given back to Nepal; the Nepalese land will
never be
encroached upon in the future, and bilateral relations be
consolidated on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
co-existence, says the letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter warns that any efforts to suppress "our sentiments"
through any threats of nuclear weapons, embargo and military
intervention will definitely lead to a relentless struggle by the
Nepalese people, on behalf of whom the letter is released.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Slowdown Causing Concern in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government officials and
economists are expressing their concern over the continued
slowdown in industrial growth in the first four months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
They say that only an upturn can ensure an 8-percent growth in
the GDP that the government wants this year.
</P>
<P>
China had 608.7 billion yuan (73.3 billion US dollars) in
industrial added-value output in the January-April period, a
year-on-year increase of 7.9 percent. However, it was 3.5
percentage points lower than the growth rate for the same period
of 1997 and the first industrial growth slowdown since the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists say that only a 10-percent or higher
industrial growth rate can sustain the projected 8-percent GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Qiming, director of the State Statistics
Bureau's Department of Industry and Transportation, the slowdown
in industrial growth was caused by a decrease in profits resulting
from shrinking market demand and falling prices.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months, industrial sales were 1.29 trillion
yuan, up 3.1 percent, the lowest growth recorded in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Declining market demand increased competition, forcing more
industrial enterprises to cut prices, leading to a 2.4 percent
drop in the average factory price, a greater drop than that for
raw materials and fuel during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Despite the industrial growth slowdown, investment in fixed
assets climbed 12.3 percent in the first four months and bank
loans have increased dramatically since March, as a result of
government policies to stimulate the domestic demand, an upbeat
sign and something that can help industrial enterprises offset the
bad effect of decreased market demand, Li says.

Market analysts predict that industrial growth will pick up in
the third quarter and increase by an average of 10 percent for the
whole year. Lu Zheng, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
and Zheng Haihang, of Capital Economic and Trade University, also
expressed optimism over the future, but at the same time warned of
the negative effects of the Asian financial crisis on the
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
A multiple foreign trade strategy must be adhered to and
markets outside Asia need to be opened up to minimize the drop in
exports, they say.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured goods exports in April were worth 84.1 billion
yuan, an increase of 7.2 percent from April of 1997. However, the
growth rate was half a percentage point lower than that in the
first three months of this year, and a sharp drop of 12.3
percentage points from the same period of last year, causing
concern among economists.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all this, economists still believe that improved
infrastructure and falling prices will help the government in its
macro economic control and efforts to spur industrial growth and
that China will achieve its projected 8-percent GDP growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Official forecasts are for industrial growth to remain more or
less the same as in the first quarter, and to pick up gradually in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Economists suggest that the government take steps to increase
investment in key infrastructure projects, loans, and housing
reforms to accelerate growth in industry and the GDP.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Set up Special Squad to Tackle Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Home Ministry has
approved the proposal for setting up a special squad in its Crime
Investigation Department to deal with crimes against women and
children, the national news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The approval was made in late April, and was awaiting final
approval of the Finance Ministry and the Establishment Ministry,
the news agency quoted Home Ministry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The squad, with 250 posts and the whole country under its
purview, was expected to go into operation by the first week of
July this year,
</P>
<P>
to investigate cases such as women and children trafficking,
acid throwing, child rape and specific rape cases, a Home Ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
The special team, under the supervision of a special
superintendent of police and an additional superintendent of
police, would have its own network in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 Bangladeshi women and children have been
trafficked to the Middle East and India in the past 20 years, and
about 20,000 Bangladeshi women are involved in prostitution in
Indian brothels alone, according to reports of human organizations
and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"Addressing the offenses against women and children is very
important and is a must, " as women and children constitute more
than two-thirds of the country population of about 127 million,
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said early this year.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Beef Cleared for Export From June 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Exports of deboned beef from
Northern Ireland can recommence from June 1 under certain
conditions, the European Commission decided on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports may only take place for deboned beef and derived
products from Northern Ireland if the cattle had been born, raised
and remained in certified herds for their entire life, the
commission stipulated.
</P>
<P>
However, some parts of cattle such as brains, eyes, intestines
and bone marrows were considered to be at risk of spreading the
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or "mad cow disease."
</P>
<P>
A certified herd is defined as one in which for at least eight
years there has been no confirmed case of BSE nor a suspected case
in which a diagnosis of BSE has not been ruled out in any cattle
when still in the herd or in any cattle moved from the herd.
</P>
<P>
Exports are allowed provided all records of the life and
movements of the herd are kept within an official computerized
tracing system.
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision to recommence exports of deboned
Northern Irish beef lays down a series of stipulations designed to
ensure strict official controls, labelling, certification and
traceability of meat and meat products back to the herd of origin.
</P>
<P>
The entire production process, from slaughtering, cutting,
further processing, storing and final dispatching should take
place in Northern Ireland in establishments reserved for the
handling of eligible products.
</P>
<P>
There are now two such establishments in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The European Union banned British beef exports shortly after
Britain announced a possible link between BSE and a new variant of
the human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD), in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Britain proposed lifting the ban on beef exports in early 1997
while the European Council of Ministers agreed in March this year
to lift the ban on beef and beef products arising from cattle in
certified herds.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, at the peak of the BSE epidemic that was first spotted
in 1986, a total of 37,280 BSE cases were confirmed whereas a
substantially-reduced number of 3,396 BSE cases were confirmed
last year.
</P>
<P>
To date, over three million cattle have been slaughtered and
destroyed under the various programs to eradicate the disease.

SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has seen its bank

<P>
Deposits stood at 428.61 trillion won (4.686 billion

</P>
<P>
The figure includes savings deposits, money in trust, and money
market fund accounts.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the decrease to shrinking household
incomes and the continuing pressure on credit in the business
sector.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the most dynamic economy in the world, was
hit by the Asian economic crisis in late 1997.

PHNOM PENH, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A visiting British Minister
warned relations with the European Union (EU) would be harmed if
Cambodia failed to conduct free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
Leaving here Wednesday for Siem Reap to meet King Norodom
Sihanouk, Foreign and Commonwealth Minister Derek Fatchett said
aid programs would certainly suffer.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Fatchett, a personal emissary of British Prime
Minister, started on Tuesday during voter registration for the

deployed.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett had met with Cambodia's First Prime Minister Hug Huot,
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and deposed First Prime Minister
Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the minister stressed the relationship
between the EU, whose presidency is currently held by Britain, and
Cambodia was closely linked with the free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The body had recognized difficulties and would continue to
push on certain areas it felt weakest, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Strong Winds Hit Merca Port in South Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Six people have died and three
others were injured after strong winds hit Somalia's southern
port town of Merca Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses in the town of Merca, 100 km south
of Mogadishu, the people died after the building of a three-story
old hotel, Banderbeile,in the middle of the town had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The strong winds which hit Somalia once every year also
hindered all of the commercial activities in the natural ports of
the country during the high tide winds. The commercial activities
in southern Somalia have already been affected with considerable
losses of material and time.
</P>
<P>
All the loading and off-loading process inside the port of
Merca has been frozen after strong waves started falling one
after another in the natural port. Three commercial boats and a
large banana exporting vessel has been docked in the port for
more than a week now with little to do, while several others have
moved to other ports to avoid the incurring demurrage.
</P>
<P>
The small business owners as well as the rich companies are
equally suffering the difficulties created by the winds. The
Somali Fruit company, the largest banana exporting firm in the
war-ravaged African country, has brought back to Mogadishu more
than 30,000 boxes of banana after failing to load them to the
Gulf countries and to Europe due to the high waves.
</P>
<P>
The town of Merca controlled by Hussein Aidid has been
flourishing for its business activities since the closure of the
main port of Mogadishu in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The town which is one of the oldest in Somalia has already
suffered from the consequences of the winds. The business
communities have already started moving their vessels to other
ports including El-Ma'an natural port, 30 km north of Mogadishu,
controlled by Ail Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the high waves also affect the tax collectors of
Hussein Aidid's militia who may lose their jobs in the next three
months to come.
</P>
<P>
During the closure of the natural ports, the banditry and
looting activities also increase in Mogadishu and its surrounding
areas, while the daily life also becomes more expensive.

<HEADLINE> China Bank Extends Huge Loan to Top PC Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's leading PC producer, the
Legend Group, will receive one billion yuan in loans
from the Bank of China this year, the biggest sum the high-tech
companies has ever had.
</P>
<P>
Under an cooperative agreement signed today by the
two sides, the Legend Group will receive preferential treatment in
obtaining loans.
</P>
<P>
The bank will provide all-round fund-raising and other
financial services for the company, helping it get syndicated
loans, issue bonds and place stocks overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Legend Group declared that it will use the loans for
computer manufacturing and marketing, and development of new
technologies in computer manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
With a share of 10.7 percent of China's PC market, the
Legend Group also ranked fifth in the Asian PC market in terms
of PC sales in 1997. It had a turnover of 7.6 billion
yuan in 1996, which rose to 12.5 billion yuan last year and is
expected to exceed 18 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
To support the expansion strategy of the company, the Bank of
China has extended a total of more than 1.8 billion yuan in loans
to the group between 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to improve lending efficiency through
supporting large enterprises, the Bank of China also signed
a similar agreement last weekend with the nation's second largest
color TV maker, the Konka Group, promising it 4.2 billion yuan in
loans this year.

<HEADLINE> Over 150 Burnt Buffalo to Be Killed in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 Namibian
buffalo which have been severely burnt by a raging underground
fire on the edge of the Mamili National Park in Caprivi will have
to be killed, the Environment and Tourism Ministry announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire was believed to have been deliberately sparked by the
villagers living in the area.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Tourism Minister Philliemon Malima said that
two severely burnt buffalo have been shot since Friday.
</P>
<P>
Another 70 buffalo will have to be shot as their hooves were
burnt after they became trapped in boiling mud over the past few
days, Malima said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very bad at the Mamili National Park, many
buffalo are stranded in the boiling mud in the wetland of
Mamili," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials suspect that the villagers started the fire to get
free meat because once the buffalo are killed the meat is given
to them.
</P>
<P>
"In order to stop this human error perhaps we have to stop
giving meat to people living in the surrounding areas," Malima
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, at least 150 buffalo died or had to be shot after
their hooves, ears and other parts of their bodies were
completely burnt when they got trapped in reeds and other
vegetation under which the fire blazed.
</P>
<P>
Other game species, which appear to have an ability to detect
the fires, are not affected by the underground fire.

</P>
<P>
Low, medium, and high level housing prices have been worked out
in four categories of cities:
</P>
<P>
One is Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, the four
economic centers where a square meter of housing is 1,500 to 2,500
yuan, above 4,000 yuan, or 8,000 to 10,000 yuan at the three
price levels.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Urges People to Participate in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's deposed First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh called Wednesday on Cambodians
to be involved in the upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Funcinpec members at the royalist party's provincial
headquarters in Kandal, Ranariddh said the elections, scheduled
for July 26, are very important for the country's future.
</P>
<P>
It was the first political gathering he took part outside Phnom
Penh since returning on March 30 from nine months of exile abroad.
</P>
<P>
Saying the Khmer people must go to register as eligible voters
and take part in the elections, Ranariddh delivered the hint that
many non-Cambodians, referring to Vietnamese, were registered.
</P>
<P>
The elections are "the last chance for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked that if the Funcinpec party and its political alliance,
the National United Front (NUF), would boycott the elections,
Ranariddh said the elections must be free, fair and credible.
</P>
<P>
It is far from real fair elections so far, he said, adding that
the demand for equal access to the media was yet to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Without a clear involvement of the international community and
the United Nations, Funcinpec and the NUF could not join the
elections, and he personally would wait and see, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about Funcinpec and his relations
with the NUF, Ranariddh said Funcinpec was still a member of the
NUF and "I still have good relations with everyone in the NUF."
</P>
<P>
"We have already appointed Son Soubert, president of the Son
Sann Party, to replace me as the president of the NUF," he added.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, at his own initiative, Ranariddh resigned as
president of the NUF -- an alliance grouping together Funcinpec,
Son Sann Party, Sam Rainsy Party and the Khmer Neutral Party.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he wanted to spend more time with Funcinpec.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and analysts here saw the prince's move as an
indication pointing to a potential serious split within the NUF as
the elections approach.
</P>
<P>
But Funcinpec officials have denied the existence of a rift in
the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Most Australians Live by Seaside: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A new survey found 83 percent of
Australia's 18.3 million residents lived within 50 km of the
coastline.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Population Growth and
Distribution survey also found in the five years to 1996,
Australia's population grew by one million people, and two-thirds
of that growth, or 656,500 people, was in capital cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the survey, 86 percent of the
population lived in the capital cities with Sydney topping the
list. The population in Sydney numbers 4 million, accounting for
about 22 percent of Australia's total.
</P>
<P>
The capital cities are mainly located on the coasts of the
Australian continent, the south and east coasts in particular,
chiefly because the climate there is more suitable for human
settlement while inland Australia is too hot and arid for
settlement and farming.
</P>
<P>
The other major reason why the capital cities were located on
coasts is that in colonial days Australia relied on shipping for
transportation between its different regions and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The survey recorded the general pattern of movement within
capital cities from inner and middle suburbs to the outer suburbs
as development and property construction continued.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6.6 million Australians (43 percent) moved home
during the survey.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of Australia's population lived in the state of
New South Wales, with the nation's biggest city Sydney as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found almost a quarter of Australia's resident
population was born overseas with close to 40 percent from
English-speaking countries of the United Kingdom, Ireland, New
Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Donations for Poverty Victims Becoming Regular Thing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Xinliang, the vice-governor
of China's Liaoning Province, said here today that donations for
urban poverty relief will become a regular part of social welfare
here and will supplement the basic livelihood system.
</P>
<P>
To help poor people in urban areas, especially those who have
been laid off, or are unemployed or retired, regular donations
will begin in Liaoning in June.
</P>
<P>
The social assistance used to be handled only by the government
but is now getting help more and more from social organizations
and individuals, Zhao says.
</P>
<P>
However, government departments will still run the urban
poverty-relief campaign in the near future, because of the
immaturity of the scheme, Zhao added.
</P>
<P>
Dong Wande, president of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of
Trade Unions, said they will cooperate with the Communist Youth
League, women's federation, and various charity organizations to
improve the system and a poverty-relief donation center is
expected to be established in 14 cities in the province.

<HEADLINE> Japan Loans One Billion U.S Dollars to S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Korea Wednesday
secured a loan worth one billion U.S. dollars from its Japanese
counterpart to finance the import of Japanese capital goods and
industrial materials by South Korean manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the loan was signed by Yang Mahn-ki, chairman and
president of the Export-Import Bank of Korea, and Hidemi Kawai,
executive director of the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The loan, with repayment scheduled over two years, is expected to
become a driving force for South Korea's economic recovery, said
Kawai.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's imports from Japan have plunged since it
conducted macroeconomic adjustment and restructuring, which are
conditions specified in the agreement signed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a rescue package of 57
billion dollars last December.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 million dollars, the first part of the loan, will be
transferred to the Japanese branch of the South Korean bank on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Korean companies have been in desperate need of foreign
currency to import raw materials since the country was gripped by
the Asian financial crisis caused by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Improving Data Bank Using Chinese Characters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A new data bank using Chinese
characters is expected to dramatically improve Chinese computer
software by increasing the speed of Chinese data banks on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The "Super-Size Multi-Tier Structural Chinese Character Data
Bank" developed by Aidi New Hi-tech Industry Company in central
China's Hunan Province was released recently.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the product is likely to become the most
popular data bank for Chinese characters in the next few
years. Its most outstanding feature is that it completely solves
the problem of incompatibility of Chinese-based software and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
And it improves the keyboard input of Chinese characters,
generating Chinese characters at a speed that is ten times that of
traditional Chinese data banks. It contains over 100,000 Chinese
characters, including classical Chinese characters and foreign
words in the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
The new data bank can be used for printing, electronic
publication, Chinese operational platforms and on computer chips,
and will greatly cut the cost of developing electronic printing
systems, multiply the amount of information in electronic
publications, allow Chinese operation platforms to fully enter the
Internet, and facilitate adding chips to a computer mother board,
terminals, and peripherals.

<HEADLINE> Gender Divide Continues at Australian Universities: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The great sexual divide continues
at Australian universities with women signing up for child care
and teaching courses while men dominate computing, engineering and
the sciences, an Australian government report has found.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that most students choose a course on the
basis of their interests, not for prestige or personal gain.
</P>
<P>
The report, co-authored by the Australian Council for
Educational Research and the University of Melbourne for the
Australian federal government, studied students who intended to
apply for a university course in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"There were some strong differences between the numbers of
males and females applying for some of these fields," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, one-third of all females intended to
apply for child care, teaching, health studies or applied social
science, compared with only 14 percent of all males.
</P>
<P>
But 50 percent of men would apply for building and design,
engineering and computing, professional and applied sciences,
compared with 18 percent of females.
</P>
<P>
It also found that people with enterprising interests applied
for courses in the humanities and communications, while people
with social interests were interested in teaching, child care,
community service and health services.
</P>
<P>
Those with conventional interests were attracted to commerce,
law and business. Students with investigative interests headed
into engineering and computing and applied sciences.

<P>
HARBIN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 freighters are
lingering in harbors of the Songhua River, one of the major rivers
in northeast China, since the water level has dropped to its
lowest level ever.
</P>
<P>
Reports on May 25 said that the water level of the
900-kilometer-long river sharply dropped to 110.5 meters above sea
level, 1.5 meters lower than required for water transport.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the substantial drop to El Nino, a weather
phenomenon which broke out last year and caused unusual climate
all over the world. "The region hasn't got enough snow and rain
since last winter," meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
The river level began to fall in early May, bringing local
water transport to a trickle. Three passenger liners of the Harbin
Ferry Company were damaged by running aground, so the company had
to move its port to deeper water.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 cargo vessels were forced to stay in harbors,
waiting for the river to rise.

<HEADLINE> Medicine Donated to Cure Asthma Among Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Xiamen-based Guilong Group, one
of China's largest traditional Chinese medicine manufacturers,
donated to Soong Ching Ling Foundation medicine worth two million
yuan today.
</P>
<P>
The medicine will be provided by doctors free to
children with respiratory diseases in 14 provinces and cities
across the country including Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Worsening air pollution has caused a rise in the incidences of
respiratory diseases and mortality rate in China, especially among
children.
</P>
<P>
A recent national survey of 950,000 children showed
that the asthma rate is between 0.5 to two percent in most cities
and runs as high as five percent in economically developed coastal
cities. Medical experts estimated that there are over ten million
asthma patients across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Yuzhi, director of Clinical and Educational
Center for Asthma with Capital Institute of Pediatrics, 22 Chinese
provinces and cities have been involved in the Global Initiative
for Asthma launched five years ago by the World Health
Organization and the National Institute of Health in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested promoting the use of traditional Chinese
medicine to cure asthma in China, as such medicine is safe and
inexpensive. Currently, over 90 percent of young asthma patients
use anti-biotic, she noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Paper Vigilant Against Japan Official's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's top national newspaper
Wednesday blasted a Japanese official's inclusion of Taiwan in the
scope of the updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the People's Daily called for vigilance
against a recent parliamentary statement by Takanu Norimoto, head
of the Japanese Foregin Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Norimoto, in his remarks at the House of Representatives,
indicated that Japan-U.S. defense cooperation would cover "areas
surrounding Japan," including South Korea and Taiwan, of China.
</P>
<P>
To support his argument, the Japanese official referred to an
article in the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty signed in 1951, which
defines the Far East as the vast span north to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily commentary said Norimoto's assertion
signaled a shift away from the Japanese government's rhetorics in
the past and sounded out its intention to encroach on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Japanese officials had claimed that cooperation
with the United States would cover "areas surrounding Japan that
have an important influence on Japan's peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
By avoiding explicit clarification, the commentary noted, the
Japanese government had also said the scope of the defense
guidelines is not targeted at specific geographical regions.
</P>
<P>
However, Norimoto picked up the Far East article of a treaty
adopted in the Cold War era to make a change, and virtually
included Taiwan in the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are strongly indignant at including Taiwan,
an inalienable part of China, in Japan's defense plan, as it is a
blunt intervention into China's internal affairs, said the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
It's recognized by the entire world community, as well as Japan
in the two historic documents signed with China, that the Taiwan
issue is a sheer internal affair of China, it reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Japan committed itself to such a position in both the Joint
Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and
the Government of Japan in September 1972, and the Treaty of Peace
and Friendship Between the People's Republic of China and Japan in
August 1978.
</P>
<P>
As late as last September, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto expressed his full respect and understanding of China's
stance toward the Taiwan issue during his China tour.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commentary said, the Japanese government had
repeatedly assured China that the scope of the Japan-U.S. defense
guidelines would not be expanded and directed at any third nation.
</P>
<P>
Norimoto's remarks were against the spirit and principle of the
two historic documents signed between the two countries, and those
of the Japanese Constitution, the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Article 9 of the Constitution states that "the Japanese
people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and
the threat or use of force as means of settling international
disputes."
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary said, two bills pending Japanese
parliament's ratification would allow the Japan's Self-Defense
Forces to provide logistics support to U.S. forces and to use
aircraft and warships for the sake of "security" during
emergencies in "areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
Japanese scholars have warned that such bills would lift the
restrictions imposed by the Article 9 of the Constitution, expand
the scope of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation to broader areas of
the Asia-Pacific region, and result in Japan's use of force abroad.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the Chinese government's stance on
issues related to the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty has been consistent and explicit.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt harmful to the sovereignty of China is doomed to
failure, it said, adding that any attempt to meddle into China's
internal affairs will meet strong condemnation and opposition from
the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urged the Japanese government to take the
security of the Asia-Pacific region and the long-term growth of
the Sino-Japanese ties into serious consideration, so as to ride
on the tide of the age and embark on the path of peaceful
development.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Officials Seeking Ways to Solve Collection Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide mobilization has been
carried out this month in China's taxation system in a bid to
reverse the present unfavorable taxation condition and reach this
year's target.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxation (SAT) has called together
local tax officials in three regional meetings during the last two
weeks to find effective ways to solve tax-collection problems and
to promote tax-income growth.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, China had an industrial
and commercial tax income of 241.8 billion yuan, up 9.1 percent
from the same period last year, which was a sharp drop from the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the slow economic growth was the major factor
that affecting tax-income growth. Other reasons include decreased
tax sources caused by the low efficiency of state-owned large- and
medium-sized enterprises, tax losses caused by mergers and
bankruptcies, and the consequences of the Southeast Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqing, director of the SAT, told local officials that
tax-collection efforts must be stepped up to ensure a steady
fiscal income to provide a material base for economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
Jin said taxation is critical to all of the state's ongoing
reform measures.
</P>
<P>
Although the taxation system presently faces many difficulties,
he said, there are also many favorable factors: Tax-income growth
will have reliable sources if the 8 percent economic growth target
is reached; a group of new tax growth areas have been developed
during recent years; local governments will give their strong
support to taxation in accordance with the central government's
guidelines; and successful reforms in the taxation system have
provided a solid foundation for tax collection.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that all local taxation departments collect taxes
strictly according to the law, and he said efforts should be made
to recover defaulted taxes. Nationwide special inspections will be
carried out on major tax species and key tax sources, and
tax-evading practices will be severely punished, he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Man Fined for Illegal Collection of Specimen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese man was fined for
illegally entering the Qinling Mountains in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province to collect butterfly specimens.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a teacher with Northwest University found
the man, sirnamed Ogura, catching butterflies in an area of
Qinling, which is not open to foreigners. The teacher reported the
incident to police in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The man was an employee with an enterprise in north China's
Hebei Province. He arrived in Xi'an on May 1, and hired a taxi to
explore ways to enter the mountain area. In the next two days, he
caught 180 butterflies for specimens.
</P>
<P>
Ogura's behavior violated China's Regulations on Foreigners
Entering or Leaving China and the Law on the Protection of
Wildlife, according to police.
</P>
<P>
The police fined the man 3,000 yuan (361 U.S. dollars) and
confiscated the tools he used to catch butterflies and all
specimen he had collected. Two Chinese who had helped Ogura enter
the area were also punished in accordance with relevant
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Qinling Mountain has abundant resources of wild animals and
plants, thousands of which are species under state-level
protection, said an official with the State Forestry
Administration, adding that similar cases have happened before.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreigners should ask for permission from the
central or local forestry departments before they enter China's
natural areas to collect specimens. And they can only catch
specimens in a restricted number set by relevant departments, and
are not allowed to enter the areas which are not open to
foreigners.

<HEADLINE> North Countries Making South Countries even </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian retired president
Julius Nyerere has accused developed countries of capitalizing on
the Bretton Woods institutions to make the developing countries
even poorer.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said that using institutions like the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the rich countries of the North have been
forcing the poor countries of the South to sign international
treaties on unequal basis, ignoring the latter's inability to
carry out their obligations, The Guardian, a Dar es Salaam-based
newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The practice has made the countries of the South even poorer,
Nyerere said Tuesday, criticizing that rich countries are
interested in preaching democracy while ignoring international
laws.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who is also the chairman of the South Commission,
made the remarks Tuesday while presenting a paper entitled "Are
Universal Social Standards Possible?" to the International
North-South Conference for Sustainable Development being held at
the Federal Parliament building in Bern, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The week-long conference, which started on May 25, is
scheduled to discuss development and sustainability, human
rights, unemployment, child labor, gender and debt issues.
</P>
<P>
Other topics include implementing the aims of the 1992 Rio
Earth Summit and making a closer look at solidarity between the
North and the South.
</P>
<P>
Also to be covered at the conference will be the role of
non-governmental organizations towards closer co-operation
between the North and the South, population issues and women
rights.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation at 30-Year Low in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's consumer
inflation hit a 30-year low last month when it dropped to five
percent year-on-year from the 5.4 percent in March, according to
the statistics released by the Central Statistical Service (CSS).
</P>
<P>
The fall in inflation was largely due to a one percentage
point drop in home loan rates, from 19 percent in February to 18
percent in March, newspapers based here Wednesday quoted the CSS
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Despite expectations that both headline and core inflation
drop in April, the statistics released Tuesday shows that core
inflation - which excludes changes in interest rates and prices
of a few products - rose from 6.9 percent to 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's target was to reduce core inflation to
between one and five percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Factors which had placed upward pressure on inflation in April
included food, medical costs, transport and hikes in excise
duties announced in the government 1998/99 budget in March, the
service said.
</P>
<P>
The headline consumer inflation is expected to hover around
the five percent level for the next two months and to start
rising again in July, economists said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted a year-end inflation rate of just more than six
percent and an average for the year of 5.3 percent, well below
last year's average of 8.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Web Guides To Increase Internet Usage by Chinese Speakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- With powerful new web guides and
search engines providing Chinese speakers around the world with an
easier and more relevant web experience, the use of Chinese on the
Internet is poised to grow fast, according to Yahoo!, a popular
web guide.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo! Inc, said here Wednesday that
high-quality navigational guides such as the company's recently
launched Yahoo! Chinese site would greatly boost the use of
Chinese language services on the Internet by making it much easier
for users to find specific sites and research topics.
</P>
<P>
"Without a solid guide to Chinese web sites, it's often
difficult for Chinese users to find sites related to a specific
interest," said Yang, who co-created the Yahoo! Internet
navigational guide in April 1994 and co-founded Yahoo! Inc. a year
later.
</P>
<P>
"If an individual is searching for a topic in Chinese or if a
source is only available in Chinese, standard English language web
guides and search engines may not provide any or the most relevant
results," said the young entrepreneur who was born in Taiwan and
brought up in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Launched on May 5, Yahoo! Chinese catalogues more than 10,000
Chinese-language web sites into 14 browsable categories allowing
users to conduct comprehensive search in both simplified and
traditional Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Yang said Yahoo! Chinese would be a useful tool for Chinese web
surfers anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Relevant Knowledge, an Internet consultancy,
Yahoo! was the most frequently accessed web site in the United
States last month with around 32 million users, ahead of Netscape
and Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Output Expected to Exceed Last Year's Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have forecast
that the country's grain output this year will total 497-to-500
million tons to slightly exceed last year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China harvested 492.5 million tons of grain for its
second biggest harvest in history.
</P>
<P>
The forecast, released by experts from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences and the State Statistics Bureau here today, says
that China will become a grain importer this year, but the amount
will not be large.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the economists, the output of
main farm products will be stable or slightly
increase. There will be increases in the output of corn, soybeans,
cotton and animal by-products, but the output of wheat and
early rice will decline.
</P>
<P>
Grain prices will continue to rise, the report points out,
especially the price of corn.
</P>
<P>
The economists said China's grain-production capability has
been remarkably improved, and a near balance between market demand and
supply has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, sharp fluctuations in grain prices have become a
thing of the past because of the tightened macro-control imposed
by the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the economists warned the government and related
departments to closely monitor the agricultural situation this
year as the existing production capability is not strong enough
and the supply-demand relationship is still weak.
</P>
<P>
The report adds that the growth of rural and township
industries will continue to slow down. Therefore, effective
measures should be taken to ensure increased incomes for farmers,
the experts suggested.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee that the national economy will increase at an 8
percent rate this year, the government must pay great attention to
the development of rural markets, ease farmers' financial burdens,
increase their purchasing power and step up the development of
rural industries, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report encourages the government to stabilize and improve
the contractual farmland system, develop a rural cooperative
economy, further reform rural enterprises by introducing the
shareholding system and reform the grain distribution system.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Green Paper Book on Chinese Rural Economy,"
had been published by the China Social Sciences Documentation
Publishing House.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Explain Japan-U.S. Defense Pact to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto instructed Wednesday the Foreign Ministry to explain
Tokyo's stance on the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines to
China, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto ordered Vice Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai that the
ministry should explain to Beijing the scope of the guidelines,
indicated as "areas surrounding Japan," is not targeted at any
specific geographical regions, including the Taiwan Strait, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the instruction after China expressed "grave
concern" over a senior Japanese official's remarks that virtually
put China's Taiwan into the Japan-U.S. defense framework.
</P>
<P>
Toshiyuki Takano, director general of the Japanese Foreign
Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau, told a lower house
committee last Friday that the scope of the surrounding areas in
the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines is limited to the
"Far East" and "Far Eastern surrounding areas" as defined in the
Japan-U.S. security treaty, suggesting that China's Taiwan is
included into the pact.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, China denounced Takano's remarks and urged Japan to
"make an explicit clarification and explanation," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States agreed last September on the
revised version of the 1978 bilateral defense cooperation
guidelines, which calls for Tokyo to provide more active support
to U.S. forces in the event of emergencies in "areas surrounding
Japan."

<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund (IMF)
team Wednesday completed its seven-day review of the Philippine
economy, saying the country had done remarkably well in managing
the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was the first review by the IMF since the Philippines exited
from the multi-national institution at the end of March this year
after 35 years of tutelage under the IMF.
</P>
<P>
But simultaneously, the country entered a
2.4-billion-U.S.-dollar precautionary stand-by arrangement with
the IMF in case the regional crisis would worsen suddenly.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission found that the Philippines' macroeconomic
performance in terms of growth, inflation and the balance of
payments was broadly on track.
</P>
<P>
There was even a larger-than-expected improvement in the
external payments position, with reserves above planned targets
and the peso stabilizing despite the renewed deepening of the
crisis in Indonesia, it said.
</P>
<P>
The mission expressed confidence that the program will be kept
on track with close collaboration between the outgoing government
and the new administration and Congress which will be in office on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
It said the country has made substantial progress in managing
the regional crisis, but meanwhile, it pointed out that some risks
remain, and continued successful management of the crisis and the
recovery of the economy require prudent macroeconomic policies and
vigorous structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos was constitutionally barred from seeking
a second term and would step down when his term ends on June 30.
He has recognized that Vice President Joseph Estrada had already
won the May 11 presidential election, although official results
have yet to be announced.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Affecting Antarctic Ice Sheet: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sea levels would rise as the
Antarctic ice sheet melted because of higher temperatures caused
by global warming, Australian geologists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New England University's Barrie McKelvey said a recent
Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition found evidences
that the ice sheet was considerably smaller during the last major
period of global warming 3-8 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery of remnants of river and lake sediment
was a major step in supporting the assertion that global warming
would lead to a rise in world sea levels.
</P>
<P>
"Global warming is happening all the time," McKelvey told the
Australian Associated Press in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"But this definitely challenges the belief that the ice sheet
won't be affected."
</P>
<P>
He said researchers found preserved elements of the landscape
predating the Antarctic ice sheet and strata from fossil valleys
created by lakes and rivers, but the materials still need to be
examined.
</P>
<P>
McKelvey said the team's ultimate aim was to show the likely
effect of future global warming.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is an enormous and expensive task to study a
continental ice sheet that is twice as big as Australia."
</P>
<P>
The ice sheet currently contains 27 million cubic kilometers of
water which, if released, would cause a 65-meter rise in world sea
levels.
</P>
<P>
It would also result in climate change caused by the alteration
in deep sea water currents and temperatures, and a decrease in the
amount of solar heat reflected by ice into the atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Urbanites in Lanzhou City Enjoy Sufficient Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Urbanites in this capital city of
northwest China's Gansu Province have begun to enjoy the
convenience of buying fresh vegetables at low prices because of
the "shopping basket" project.
</P>
<P>
A dry inland city, Lanzhou had few fresh vegetables,
transporting them far away at high prices. In the early
1990s, the city produced 10 million kilograms of vegetables
annually, accounting for only 8 percent of its market demand.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Lanzhou intensified efforts to develop
vegetable production. It offered low-interest loans to farmers to
grow vegetables, helped them build greenhouses and other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The local government also provided technological and scientific
assistance to vegetable growers as well as training programs on
vegetable cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Yuzhong County, which used to be very arid, now has built more
than 250 hectares of greenhouses to become the city's largest
vegetable production base.
</P>
<P>
The city now has more than 13,000 hectares of vegetables, and
produces 670 million kilograms of vegetables annually, with some
200 million kilograms sold elsewhere.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo Wednesday
with the key Nikkei index temporarily tumbling 2.11 percent after a
U.S. credit rating agency downgraded the ratings on major Japanese
banks.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 First Section issues touched a low
of 15,549.90, off 2.11 percent, before recovering by the finish to
15,664.29, down 220.53 points or 1.39 percent from Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 9.88 points or 0.80 percent to 1,222.34.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the First Section rose to an estimated 320 million
shares from Tuesday's 280 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings for Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan,
Sakura Bank and Sumitomo Bank.
</P>
<P>
It also placed on review for possible downgrade the ratings on
Asahi Bank, Long-Term Credit Bank, Fuji Bank and Tokai Bank, the
Japanese unit said.
</P>
<P>
The downgrading fueled selling pressure on the banking sector and
helped dampen the entire market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,331 issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 785 to 314, with 138 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Focus on Improving Farmers' Life in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government's
development plan for 1998/99 fiscal year will focus on improving
the living standard of farmers who constitute the majority of the
national population, the Minister of State in the Prime
Minister's Office Mussa Nkhangaa has said.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goal, the government has set a number of
strategies which include raising revenue collection, minimizing
expenditure, expanding crop markets by improving the
transportation system and making sure farmers are paid promptly
for their crops, state-owned newspaper Daily News quoted Nkhangaa
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nkhangaa said this in Dar es Salaam Wednesday while presenting
an outline speech of the next budget to the Parliamentary Finance
and Economic Affairs Committee, at the Kilimanjaro Hotel in Dar
es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is responsible for regional administration
and local governments, named other measures to carry out the plan
for creating a conductive environment for businessmen wishing to
invest in agriculture, improving education, health and water
services and formulating policies for allocation of mining sites
to small-scale miners.
</P>
<P>
The government will also quicken its pace in providing inputs,
technology and implements to farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The paper further said that during the 1998/99 fiscal year,
regions have requested a total of 27.99 billion shillings (about
42 million US dollars) for development projects. Of the total,
about 27.4 billion shillings will be from the donors while the
rest will be from internal sources.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Egypt Agree on Holding Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani said Wednesday in Amman that Egypt and Jordan have both seen
the need of holding an Arab Summit to save the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian and Jordanian sides agreed on the need for an
Arab action through holding an expanded or mini Arab Summit in a
bid to adopt a unified Arab stance in the face of Israel's
intransigence," Anani said in a telephone interview with
Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came just hours after Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa returned home from his visit to Jordan to seek ways of
reviving the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Moussa held talks with senior Jordanian
officials and delivered a letter from President Hosni Mubarak to
King Hussein on the Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries that have peace
treaties with Israel, have tried to bridge gaps between Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But both countries have become frustrated with Israel's tough
stance toward its peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Tuesday in Amman that "there is always hope to
revive the peace process. But in view of the current situation and
in view of the current Israeli policies, we don't think the peace
process has a chance."
</P>
<P>
Israel's firm refusal to pull back troops from 13 percent more
of the West Bank as proposed by the U.S. has had the yearlong
stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks deeply stranded.
</P>
<P>
Anani said no agreement has been reached so far on the form of
the Arab summit, but consultations are under way in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian diplomatic sources said Tuesday that
intense diplomatic contacts were going on among Arab states for
holding a limited Arab summit scheduled for early next month in
Cairo, the Middle East News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The mini-summit may include Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
Morocco, Jordan, Palestine, the United Arab Emirates and Oman,"
said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the summit would follow decisions taken by the
last pan-Arab summit in Cairo in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Arab summit urged Israel to honor all its obligations
under the signed agreements, warning that the Arab world would
suspend normalization with Israel if it broke its commitments.

<HEADLINE> China's Railway Sector to Cut 1.1 Million Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's railway departments will
cut its number of employees by 1.1 million, or roughly 40 percent
of its workforce, in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
"We are making full preparations for work on system
restructuring," said Fu Zhihuan, minister of railways.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that the five corporations under the ministry covering
industry, engineering, construction, materials, and
telecommunications, will be separated from the Ministry of
Railways to enter market operation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 370,000 people engaged in industry, construction,
material sales, and diversified management will be separated from
local railway bureaus, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country's railway departments employed
3.37 million people at the end of 1997. By 2000, the number of
people dealing with railway transportation will be reduced to 1.4
million from the existing 1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Fu pointed out that the reduction of staff will increase
profits, and it is an effort catering to the demand of railway
development.
</P>
<P>
China's railways suffered severe losses starting in 1994. Last
year, the losses reached 4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fu blamed the losses on surplus employees and a high overhead
for salaries. Staff reductions actually signal a transfer in
railway management system, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Says He Has Forgiven Koromah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah said he has forgiven Major Johnny Paul Koromah, who
overthrew him in a coup last May but was flushed out in February
by the West African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation
Tuesday, Kabbah said he is ready to talk to Koromah as an
individual to show his willing to genuine reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah also said that he would engage in discussion with Foday
Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, who was
arrested by Nigerian authorities upon entrance in March 1997 and
has since been in detention.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to talk to anybody as long as that would bring
about peace to Sierra Leone. What I want is sustainable peace. We
should be concentrating our attention on developing our country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah stressed that he would only talk to Koromah as an
individual, not as a representative of any group.
</P>
<P>
Upon his reinstatement in Freetown in March, President Kabbah
has vowed to bring a new beginning in Sierra Leone through
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Koromah has been in hiding since he was driven out of Freetown
by the ECOMOG. Earlier reports said he had offered to surrender
to the Roman Catholic bishop instead of the government for fear
of losing his life. But that was denied by the church.

<HEADLINE> Manila Asks U.S. to Support ASEAN Efforts in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has asked the United
States to sustain its support for ASEAN's peace efforts in
ensuring peaceful elections on July 26 in Cambodia, Philippine
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Lauro Baja said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Baja, who chaired the ASEAN panel in the just-concluded 14th
ASEAN-U.S. Dialogue meeting in Manila, said the U.S. support of
ASEAN initiatives in Cambodia is crucial to their success.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has taken
the lead in the international community's efforts to restore
political normalcy and stability in Cambodia following the ouster
of Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh by his
co-premier Hun Sen in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has agreed to hold popular and democratic elections in
July under the auspices of the United Nations with ASEAN playing a
key role in it.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN will send some 70 election observers and monitors to
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Baja expressed optimism about the prospects of a free, fair and
credible Cambodian election in July.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN acknowledges the need to address some
election-related issues such as access of the opposition to the
media and the security situation in far-flung communities, but
remains confident of the success of the political exercise.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the recent opening of communications lines
between Ranariddh and Hun Sen could be a "positive sign" that
these issues would be resolved.

<HEADLINE> New Zealander in Record Drug Haul Awaits Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's prosecution has
demanded a 20-year sentence for a New Zealand man who stood to
gain more than 1.8 million U.S. dollars from the operations of
amphetamine factories which together produced the world's largest
drug haul, AAP reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A jury in Brisbane, Australia's third largest city, found Allan
Barrow, 45, a New Zealand citizen, guilty of one count of
producing amphetamines at Dayboro, north of the city, between
September 12 and October 21, 1994, the Australian Associated Press
(AAP) said.
</P>
<P>
Barrow had already pleaded guilty to producing amphetamines
between December 21, 1994, and February 9, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Peter Ridgeway said two factories linked with Barrow
produced a total of 305 kilograms of pure amphetamines worth
hundreds of millions of dollars on the street.
</P>
<P>
"Collectively it is the largest single amphetamine operation
known to police agencies globally," Ridgeway said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Newstead factory based in a warehouse in the city
produced an estimated 201 kilograms of amphetamines, the seizure
of which was the second biggest single haul in the world.
</P>
<P>
A haul at Ramsgate in Britain in July 1995, at 280 kilograms is
on record as the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
Barrow has lived in Australia since 1976, but is still a New
Zealand citizen, and has worked for chemical companies in New
Zealand and Australia for much of his adult life, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has asked for a 20-year sentence for Barrow.
</P>
<P>
Justice John Helman will hand down his decision Thursday.

<HEADLINE> NZ Exports to Asia Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand suffered a 27
percent slump in its exports to Asia in April compared with the
same month last year, Statistics New Zealand said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
It said the fall brought the exports surplus in April to the
lowest level for the month in 12 years. New Zealand's trade
surplus in April fell to 32 million dollars (17 million U.S.
dollars) from 80 million dollars (45 million U.S. dollars) a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
In April, falls were recorded in exports to 17 Asian countries
or regions, while increases were registered in only six.
</P>
<P>
The biggest decline was seen in exports to Japan, due mainly to
falls in exports of raw and processed timber.
</P>
<P>
Exports to South Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan also dropped
significantly, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
In February, New Zealand suffered its first February trade
deficit since 1992. The Asian financial crisis was blamed for the
poor trade results of the month, when exports to Asia dived 25.2
percent.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. finds "stunning" and "quite troubling" a report
that House Speaker Newt Gingrich encouraged Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to defy the U.S. administration over its
redeployment proposal because the support to Netanyahu from the
U.S. Congress is assured.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has told reporters that the U.S. administration was
acting on behalf of Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat when it pressured Israel to accept a proposal to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Broadcasting Authority Director General Uri Porat
Tuesday fired two senior news editors of "Mabat" news program for
doctoring a report to make it appear that the supporters of
Jerusalem Soccer Team chanted "death to Arabs" in the presence of
Netanyahu early this month. He also reprimanded other staffers
involved in the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Knesset (parliament) is expected to conduct a
preliminary vote Wednesday on legislation that would repeal an
election reform law which allowed in 1996 the direct election for
prime minister in Israel for the first time. Netanyahu and
opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak are strongly opposed to
repealing it.

<HEADLINE> NZ Crisis Claim Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The international credit rating
agency Moody's has joined New Zealand government officials in
rejecting an Australian report that New Zealand is facing an
Asia-type economic crisis, a Wellington newspaper reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Moody's...doesn't subscribe to the view that New Zealand is
about to face a major crisis," the Evening Post quoted Moody's
vice president Yves Lemay as saying.
</P>
<P>
His comments followed a report by the Australian National
University that New Zealand had all the ingredients to become the
next victim of Asia's economic crisis, citing the high current
account deficit New Zealand had accumulated in particular.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think one can equate New Zealand's challenges with
the severe problems facing a number of east Asian countries at
this time," Lemay said.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "We do have some concern about the significant
deterioration in the country's external account." That was the
reason for Moody's to change in January its outlook for New
Zealand's sovereign foreign debt rating (AA1) from stable to
negative, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that the self-correcting mechanism of the
market should help rebalance New Zealand's current account.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Reserve Bank estimated on Tuesday that the
current account deficit would peak at 8.2 percent of GDP in the
year ending March 1998, but should fall to 5.5 percent by the year
ending March 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Australian report was also quickly dismissed by Treasurer
Winston Peters and Finance Minister Bill Birch, who described it
as "grossly misleading."

<HEADLINE> East China Province's Exports Rise Slightly in Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
exported more than 3.8 billion U.S. dollars of goods during the
first four months of the year, rising slightly by 0.4 percent
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the coastal province's foreign trade and
economic cooperation commission show that its exports to Hong
Kong, Macao and Southeast Asia decreased, while its exports to the
United States, the European Union, Africa, Latin America and
Australia increased 7-to-50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The commission estimates that the province's year-long export
total will be reduced by 2.5 billion U.S. dollars from that of
last year, because its major export markets are Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Macao, and Southeast Asia, that were
hit by financial crisis last year.
</P>
<P>
It added that Shandong's export commodities will drop in price
by 10-to-15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that, during the four months, the province
approved more than 360 foreign investment projects and attracted
787 million U.S. dollars of contracted foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
More than 29 percent of the contracted foreign funds, or 232
million U.S. dollars, were obtained through its Yanzhou Coal
Industry Joint Stock Co.'s issue of shares in the United States
and Hong Kong.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian retired president
Julius Nyerere has accused developed countries of capitalizing on
the Bretton Woods institutions to make the developing countries
even poorer.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said that using institutions like the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the rich countries of the North have been
forcing the poor countries of the South to sign international
treaties on unequal basis, ignoring the latter's inability to
carry out their obligations, The Guardian, a Dar es Salaam-based
newspaper said Thursday..
</P>
<P>
The practice has made the countries of the South even poorer,
Nyerere said, criticizing that rich countries are interested in
preaching democracy while ignoring international laws.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who is also the chairman of the South Commission,
made the remarks Wednesday while presenting a paper entitled "Are
Universal Social Standards Possible?" to the International
North-South Conference for Sustainable Development being held at
the Federal Parliament building in Bern, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The week-long conference, which started on May 25, is
scheduled to discuss development and sustainability, human
rights, unemployment, child labor, gender and debt issues.
</P>
<P>
Other topics include implementing the aims of the 1992 Rio
Earth Summit and making a closer look at solidarity between the
North and the South.
</P>
<P>
Also to be covered at the conference will be the role of
non-governmental organizations towards closer co-operation
between the North and the South, population issues and women
rights.

<HEADLINE> Lake Victoria Flooding Wreaks Havoc in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- About 8,000 families have been
displaced by floods in Nyando and Busia, western Kenya, due to
the rise of Lake Victoria waters since mid-May and the bursting
of banks of Rivers Nyando and Nzoia.
</P>
<P>
As many as 12,120 acres of crops have also been destroyed,
Gedion Ndambuki, a minister of state in the Office of President,
confirmed Tuesday night after a tour to the affected areas, Daily
Nation published here Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has released 3,000 bags of relief food
for the affected families, he announced.
</P>
<P>
The calamity is a perennial problem dating back to 1960's when
the dikes started showing signs of not lasting long, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The lake which burst its banks in middle May for the first
time in three decades, has affected the entire shoreline in
Busia, Siaya, Bondo, Kisumu, Nyando, Rachuonyo, Homa bay and Suba
districts.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has raised fears of disease. Last year,
water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept
across the region, claiming scores of lives.
</P>
<P>
The lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in
Kenya although it only holds about six percent of the lake water
with Tanzania 49 percent and Uganda 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts have so far still been arguing the causes of the
flooding. Some say it is a result of siltation due to the
blockage of river estuaries by the hyacinth weed.
</P>
<P>
Among other explanations from experts are the shrinking
shoreline which has not been surveyed for more than 50 years and
the heavy El Nino rains.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Town Becomes China's "Capital" of Magnetic Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- In 1980, 35 young villagers left
their birthplace in Hengdian Town in east China's Zhejiang
Province for a remote place in the north to study the manufacture
of magnetic materials.
</P>
<P>
They brought 50,000 yuan with them, a tremendous sum for poor
farmers at that time.
</P>
<P>
As a result, however, Hengdian has become the country's largest
production center for magnetic materials and the world's second
largest.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Hengdian Group generated nearly 4 billion yuan in
sales, with pre-tax profits of 420 million yuan. Eighty percent of
its products were exported.
</P>
<P>
Magnetic products are manufactured by the Dongci Group, one of
Hengdian's 17 sub-groups, with a staff of more than 10,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Since the '90s, when the Dongci Group resolved some key
problems in manufacturing magnetic materials, its products began
to sell well abroad.
</P>
<P>
Other major products of the Hengdian Group include micro-motors
and hard alloys.

<HEADLINE> Deepest Wildcat Oil Well Sunk in Northwest China's Tarim Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A 7,200-meter-deep oil well, the
deepest in China, has been completed recently in the Tarim Basin
of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The well ran through nine sedimentary strata accumulated in
the past 570 million years, six of which contain oil and gas,
petroleum geologists said.
</P>
<P>
The Tacan-1 wildcat well, located on a large oil-bearing
structure in the center of the basin, was designed to find
protogenic oil and gas reserves in systems of the Paleozoic era,
in an attempt to find out the way oil and gas have accumulated in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Three oil and gas fields have been verified in the area over
the past few years, including the Tazhong-4 well, where nearly 100
million tons of oil reserves have been proven.
</P>
<P>
The wildcat was started in late April of 1996. And success with
the well offers hope for oil and gas prospecting in the basin,
geologists said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Accuses Ethiopia of Economic Isolation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government has
accused neighboring Ethiopia of resorting to measures to ensure
its economic isolation in the border conflict between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry Tuesday complained that Ethiopia
has ordered its state shipping lines to cease calling at the
Eritrean ports of Massawa and Assab, according to local press
reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The youngest African state which declared independence from
Ethiopia in May 1993, also accused Ethiopia of terminating all
its Airlines flights in and out of Eritrea, which doesn't have
its own airline.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has also cut its microwave telecommunications links
to Eritrea and reduced "to a bare minimum" channels in the
opposite direction, the Eritrean government claimed in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reply to the charges from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The latest conflict sparked when Eritrea sent troops earlier
this month into Tigray, a region Ethiopia considers part of its
northwest territory.
</P>
<P>
In the first public acknowledgement of the border dispute,
Ethiopia on May 13 threatened Eritrea that it would take "all
necessary measures" if Eritrea did not withdraw from contested
territory it had occupied.
</P>
<P>
The Eritreans, in turn accusing Ethiopians of frequent
incursions into Tigray over the last year, proposed a five-point
framework for negotiating a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which borders the Red Sea and lies between Ethiopia
and Sudan, achieved independence only in 1993 after a 30-year
secessionist war against Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
This leaves Ethiopia landlocked, losing the Red Sea ports of
Massawa and Assab. Ethiopia now uses the prot of Djibouti on the
Gulf of Aden.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parliament Approves '98 Budget Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bucharest, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian parliament approved
the draft budget plan for 1998 on Tuesday by an overwhelming
majority.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, the revenues and expenditures this year will
stand at 75.044 Trillion lei (about 7.817 billion
U.S. dollars) and 87.902 trillion lei (about 9.156 billion
U.S. dollars), with a deficit of 12.858 trillion lei (about 1.339
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The projected inflation rate will be noticeably cut to 45 per
cent, a sharp drop from last year's 151 per cent.
</P>
<P>
At the parliamentary congress, 129 lawmakers from the major
opposition parties cast "no" ballots regarding the budget.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 83 congressmen appealed to the constitutional court
about the legitimacy of the budget plan which earmarks 3.37 per
cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for education, short of
the 4 percent lower limit set by the Education Law.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional court will reportedly vote to decide the
fate of the budget.

<HEADLINE> US-China Economic Committee Issues Joint Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
share the same desire, which is to continue deepening their
cooperative relationship, a joint statement issued by the
U.S.-China joint Economic Committee (JEC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries believe President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit will help advance the purpose, said the joint statement,
issued at the end of a single-day meeting of the JEC.
</P>
<P>
It said a team from the Treasury Department would also visit
China to discuss the possibilities for increased cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-chaired by Chinese Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng and American counterpart Robert Rubin, focused on
economic and finance policies of the two countries. The Asian
financial crisis dominated the exchange on international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side said it would continue a prudent fiscal and
monetary policy, while maintaining a growth rate of 8 percent and
deepening economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on the importance of competition in the
financial sector, and on the sector's key role in promoting
economic growth through lending on commercial terms, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of increased technical assistance by the U.S.
in areas that support China's reform objectives were also explored
at the meeting, the 11th of its kind since its founding in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side also reiterated the policy commitment to
maintaining the stability of the exchange rate of the Chinese
yuan, a move encouraged by the United States. Both sides agreed
to continue bilateral and multilateral cooperation in dealing with
the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two nations also agreed to make significant progress on the
financial services negotiations before President Clinton's visit
in late June in an effort to accelerate China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the intention of successfully completing
the negotiations on a Customs Mutual Assistance agreement in the
coming months, while affirming their determination to combat
international organized crime, narcotics trafficking,
counterfeiting and money laundering through the JEC and other
means.
</P>
<P>
Both mentioned the successful visit by President Jiang Zemin to
the United States and looked forward to a successful China visit
by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held amid controversial reports regarding
President Clinton's China trip. Republicans have urged him to put
it off until investigations of an alleged technology transfer to
China are concluded.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton stressed Tuesday that postponement of the trip
would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
The Next JEC meeting will be held in Beijing in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Fernandes Supports Inducting N-weapons Into Indian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes openly came out Tuesday in support of the idea of
inducting nuclear weapons into Indian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local TV Star News, the minister said
nuclear weaponization had become "necessary" and "inevitable"
following the nuclear tests earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"Without weaponization this whole question of being a nuclear
weapons state does not make any sense," said Fernandes.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's decision earlier this month to declare
a unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests will not affect the
nuclear weaponization process in the country.
</P>
<P>
No time frame has been set as of now to complete the
weaponization program, he said, adding that "the timing will
depend on our defense and threat perceptions which keep changing."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister did not agree that the strategic balance
in the Indian sub-continent had changed after the nuclear tests.
"Our defense priorities and the situation on the ground is the
same," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Wants to Try U.S. Crew for Cable Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian prosecutors on Tuesday asked
for seven airmen of United States Marines to be tried in Italy
over the February 3 cable car accident in which 20 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in the northern Italian town of Trento handed a
120-page document asking the U.S. military group investigating the
accident for the trial to be held in Trento now.
</P>
<P>
The document calls for the trial of three U.S. officials from
Aviano U.S. airbase, and the four-man Marine Corps crew of the
EA-6B Prowler aircraft which allegedly flew too low and too fast,
slicing a gondola line of the Mt. Cermis ski-lift cable car with
its tail fin.
</P>
<P>
The charges are complicity in manslaughter, violation of
transport safety and involuntary damage, Italian legal authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Four airmen, since called back to the U.S., are facing trials
by U.S. courts. The United States has refused to hand over the
four men to Italian justice, arguing the warplane was flying under
the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) when
the accident happened. It is claimed the 1951 NATO accord gives
it sole jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Italian prosecutors retorted that the plane violated the
treaty's mandated flight patterns and the flight should be
considered a single U.S. mission. They say Italy must apply its
law.
</P>
<P>
The accident brought about a crisis between the U.S. and Italy,
and some Italian parties have demanded the closing of U.S.
military bases in Italy.

<HEADLINE> Congress Leader Says No Credible Reasons For Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Congress President Sonia Gandhi
made a frontal attack on the government's decision to conduct the
nuclear tests with "no evidence" to show that India's security
environment was endangered to do so, The Hindustan Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general body of the Congress Parliament Party
and later in a rare interaction with the press, Sonia said Tuesday
her party was worried "at the way an issue that has far-reaching
political, economic and social implications is being hijacked to
inflame passions and derive partisan advantage."
</P>
<P>
In what appeared to be hitherto a strongly critical approach,
she questioned the motive of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) to go in for the tests and feared that India's relations
with neighboring China and Pakistan would deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
The Congress chief expressed serious concern over the
"aggressive language" used by some ministers against India's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the nuclear issue a national issue. This enjoins
all of us to display maturity and restraint and not indulge in
aggressive and Chauvinistic posturing," Sonia said.
</P>
<P>
Stating categorically that the Congress was with the government
in the protection of national security and national interests, she
asked in what way the change of nuclear policy enhanced India's
national security and had the government thought through the
consequences of its actions?

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Promote Industrial Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop on Myanmar's
industrial production is being held here to seek ways and means to
promote the country's industries.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the workshop, which began Tuesday,
Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council, stressed the need to make greater
efforts to double the domestic production capacity in all
economic sectors including agriculture and industries, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is sponsored by the Myanmar Industrial Development
Committee, which was formed in July 1995 to give greater impetus
to the country's industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
In its industrialization endeavors, Myanmar has also been
attracting foreign investment in this respect since late 1988 when
the country opened to the outside world, adopting a
market-oriented economic system.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, foreign investment in the manufacturing
sector rose to the second position after oil and gas at the end of
March 1998 from the sixth in the same period in 1996 with 1.43
billion U.S. dollars in 113 permitted projects out of a total
foreign investment of 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, investment of Myanmar local citizens in the sector
also ranked the second after real estate development up to the
same period, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Tha paper also called for increased efforts in inducing foreign
and local investment in agricultural sector which employs over 60
percent of the nation's manpower.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's industrial growth
reached 5.2 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year and the target for
1997-98 is 10.7 percent. The sector accounts for 9.2 percent of
the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The sector has 49,201 industrial enterprises in fiscal 1996-97,
of which 3.3 percent were state-owned, 95.4 percent private-run
and 1.3 percent cooperative-operated.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Checks on Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) has asked the nation's major
airlines to do spot checks on the fuel tank wiring in Lockheed and
McDonnell Douglas aircraft to determine if they need the mandatory
wiring inspections recently ordered for Boeing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The planes asked to be checked include the McDonnell Douglas
DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 wide-bodied aircraft, each with an
engine on each wing and one in the tail.
</P>
<P>
The short-haul DC-9 and its derivative, the MD-80, popular
McDonnell Douglas planes with an engine on each side of the tail
will also be checked.
</P>
<P>
The request came from the FAA aircraft certification office in
a letter last Thursday to the Air Transport Association, the trade
organization representing the nation's largest air carriers.
</P>
<P>
The FAA asked for a report within 90 days. Association
officials were meeting to discuss the letter Tuesday and had no
immediate response.
</P>
<P>
The FAA ordered inspections for some models of Boeing 737s
earlier this month after mechanics found exposed wiring, signs of
chafing and pin-sized holes in the fuel pump wiring apparatus of
some 737s. It also ordered less urgent checks on Boeing 747s and
767s.
</P>
<P>
To date, airlines have inspected 341 Boeing 737s. In 236
aircraft, or 69 percent of the total, the wiring bundles had
"noticeable chafing," or wear through the protective Teflon
wrapped over the wires' insulation. Nine of the oldest planes
which had accumulated more than 50,000 flight hours, had exposed
wires.

PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- World number two Petr Korda of the

</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Korda, champion at the Australian Open, fell

<HEADLINE> UN Launches Campaign Against Abuse of Women in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CITY OF PANAMA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- United Nations (UN) agencies
in Panama jointly launched a campaign Tuesday to try and prevent
the violent abuse of women in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the
Pan-American Association of Health, as well as five other entities
of the U.N. registered in this country, are holding a journalism
course called: "A life without Violence; Rights of Girls and
Women."
</P>
<P>
Teenage pregnancies are increasing in Latin-America and the
Caribbean, a problem due mainly to poverty and the lack of
information and knowledge, said Aida Oliver-Vigil, a
representative of UNICEF in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Lilian Reneau, of the Pan-American Association of Health, also
declared in a speech that the Caribbean region has the highest
rate of single-women parents.
</P>
<P>
One of every four homes in the urban areas is headed by a
woman, she said.
</P>
<P>
The main point of the campaign is to try to prevent violence
against women, as well as to motivate and fulfill the agreements
and international conventions that have been created to protect
the rights of women.
</P>
<P>
A 1993 survey of that region indicated that 45 to 60 percent of
the women murdered were killed inside their homes, and that a high
percentage of these crimes were committed by the women's husbands
or the men with whom they were cohabiting.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Based on China's first national
survey on the Internet, the country had 820,000 Internet
subscribers by the end of March with 78.5 percent of them at the
ages between 21 and 35.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that computer technicians and educational and
scientific research workers account for more than half of the
Internet users in China. "The connection of the number of users
with their professions is a unique phenomena in the preliminary
stage of Internet development," said Mao Wei, director of the
China Internet Information Center, sponsor of the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 65 percent of the users have a monthly
salary below 1,000 yuan (120.48 U.S. dollars), while those making
1,000-to-2,000 yuan make up 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Geographically speaking, Beijing has the largest group of
Internet subscribers, accounting for 36 percent; Guangdong
province comes in second with 8.3 percent; and Shanghai, third
with 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 46.7 percent of the users are at
public expense, while 25.3 percent pay for the Net out of their
own pocket.
</P>
<P>
As many as 80.4 percent of the respondents said they use the
Internet primarily to obtain information about science and
technology; 42 percent seek social news; 39.6 percent want
commercial information; and 24.8 percent look for entertainment
and daily-life knowledge.
</P>
<P>
As for problems concerning the Internet, 49.1 percent of those
surveyed complained that it is too slow; 36.2 percent said the
price is too high; and 7.3 percent said the information in Chinese
is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 6,459 Chinese departments and
enterprises have opened their own Web sites on the Internet, with
64 percent of those being commercial units.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai-Based Banks Issue 1.7 Billion Yuan of Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Banks based in Shanghai have
issued 1.71 billion yuan in housing loans since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, 945 million yuan of the loans have
been granted in association with the public cumulative fund for
housing, while 765 million yuan was received as commercial loans
by individuals for purchasing apartments.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai-based banks have issued 9.028 billion yuan in
loans for housing, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
To spur housing consumption, the People's Bank of China
Shanghai Branch has treated credit used for supporting individual
urbanites to purchase apartments as an important priority since
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
It has encouraged different commercial banks to shift housing
loans from focusing on supporting development of open-market
housing in the past to concentrating on housing consumption and
related services, and published a wide range of measures to
increase the number of loans for housing consumption.
</P>
<P>
The measures include allowing bank business outlets with proper
conditions to issue composite loans to individual apartment
buyers, lower interest rates for commercial loans taken by
individual housing buyers in accordance with interest rate
policies of the bank, and prolong the repayment term of loans
taken by individuals for housing consumption.
</P>
<P>
Banks in the city plan to issue 7 billion yuan in loans for
individual housing consumption this year, three times last year's
level, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Favorite For Venture Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Venture capital investment
going to the San Francisco Bay Area accounted for 31 percent of
the United States total in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 773 million U.S. dollars was invested in 119 Bay
Area companies, according to VentureOne, a San Francisco research
firm.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, venture firms invested 2.5 billion dollars of
pension funds and other institutional money in 372 companies,
compared to nearly 2.9 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter is traditionally the weakest of the year,
VentureOne said.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech industries of electronics and biotechnology are
well represented throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
In the past quarter, the huge and growing base of Bay Area
information technology companies snared most of the capital.
Eighty-seven software, communications and other high-tech
companies received 587 million dollars, or 76 percent of the San
Francisco venture capital.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen health care companies received 137 billion dollars, or
18 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Initial public offerings (IPO), the favorite way venture
capital firms cash out their investments in promising startups,
are getting off to a slow start this year.
</P>
<P>
According to IPO Monitor, 97 companies in the area raised 5.5
billion dollars through IPOs in the first three months of 1998. In
the same period last year, 132 firms raised nearly 5.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mergers and acquisitions remained "hot" in the past quarter.
Total U.S. mergers and acquisition deals increased to 1,884 from
1,852 in the same quarter of last year, and the value of deals
soared 25 percent to 181 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Italy Seeks Ways to Bring Black Economy Into Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government is considering
new legislation to enable Italy's vast underground economy to
emerge into legality, Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need rapid legislative action to confront the phenomenon of
undeclared labor," Bersani said. "The government is considering
this possibility."
</P>
<P>
He outlined his idea for a system in which taxes and social
security contributions could be worked out initially for companies
surfacing from the black economy. Gradually the special rates
would be brought up to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he has envisaged a better system for checking
up on undeclared labor and businesses, which would be brought into
play as soon as companies have made themselves fully legal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, undeclared labor in black economy accounts for 16
percent of the European Union's total gross domestic product (GDP)
and needs to be brought into the open, according to a recent
report by the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
On the increase in the underground economy, the commission
suggests the European governments reduce tax and welfare burden on
employers and cut the mass of red-tape surrounding part-time and
occasional work.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission statistics, illegal economic
activity is also a major problem for Italy, where it makes for
20-26 percent of its annual GDP.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Aid China's Agricultural Resources Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will soon provide
130 million U.S. dollars in loans to China for a project to
develop the rich agricultural resources along the Anning River, a
branch of the Yangtze River, according to officials with the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The Anning River flows through the southwestern part of Sichuan
province in southwest China. The mountainous region is the world's
only subtropical region that is not threatened by typhoons. It has
abundant sunlight and rainfall, highly developed vertical
agriculture and a wide forest coverage.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China listed the development of the rich
agricultural resources of the Anning River Valley as a state-level
experimental zone for comprehensive agricultural development,
hoping to find a way for sustainable and highly efficient
development of the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's technical experts have just given the go-ahead
to the project, meaning that funds from the loan would soon
arrive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The region will produce food, soft drinks and fruit wine, and
engage in aquatic farming as a short-term goal.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province to Start Airport Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei province will
start a joint venture this year on an airport based in the
provincial capital of Wuhan in cooperation with Hong Kong's New
World Group.
</P>
<P>
As a major preparatory step for the establishment of the
projected joint venture, Wuhan Tianhe Airport Co. Ltd. announced
it was opening for business this month. The company is jointly
financed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and
the city of Wuhan. The CAAC has 51 percent of the venture and
Wuhan, 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations for the new joint venture will be held between
Wuhan and its Hong Kong partner, according to Zhou Yizhou, general
manager of the new company.
</P>
<P>
Tianhe Airport is based in Huangpi, a suburban county of Wuhan
city. It is the first airport given approval by the CAAC to
introduce overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said they hope to bring in more funds and advanced
management expertise through starting a joint venture with Hong
Kong New World Group.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will be responsible for the airport's safe
operations, quality service, efficiency and repayment of
loans. The CAAC and local branches will only exercise industry
management over the airport joint venture, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The general manager added that they will consider building a
new terminal with a combined floor space of 50,000 square meters
after the joint venture is established.
</P>
<P>
Tianhe Airport, which started operations on April 15, 1995,
currently has a terminal with a floor space of 28,000 square
meters, which is considered inadequate to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
It operates air routes to 44 domestic cities as well as Hong
Kong and Macao, and handled 2.33 million passenger trips last
year. The airport plans to inaugurate air service to Fukuoka,
Japan, on July 17. The airport expects to handle 2.5 million
passenger trips this year.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Seeks Lewinsky's Fingerprint, Writing, Voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr has asked Monica Lewinsky to be fingerprinted and to give
voice and handwriting samples in the next few days, news reports
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Starr, who is investigating allegations that President Bill
Clinton had sex with the former White House intern and induced her
to help cover it up, acted under a court order that has existed
since January, the reports quoted legal sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied the allegation under oath.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said Starr's action could lay the groundwork for
Lewinsky to be called before the grand jury investigating the sex
scandal or set the stage for her indictment on perjury or
obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, 24, is currently in Los Angeles with her father, Dr.
Bernard Lewinsky, but her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said Lewinsky
would comply with Starr's order. How and when this will occur is
still being worked out, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Lewinsky has cooperated fully with Starr's investigation
and will appear pursuant to the court order. As we have said since
January 16, she is very anxious to tell her side of the story,"
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Starr's probe of Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton was
triggered by former Lewinsky co-worker Linda Tripp, who secretly
recorded 20 hours of conversation in which Lewinsky reportedly
told of the White House affair.

<HEADLINE> Violence Poses Challenge for Colombian Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Eradication of violence
has become a main challenge for Colombian presidential candidates
in the Sunday elections as 30,000 people die in violence in the
country every year.
</P>
<P>
As Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN), a national radio broadcasting
agency, reported on Tuesday, all the three presidential
front-runners -- conservative Andres Pastrana, liberal Horacio
Serpa and independent Noemi Sanin -- agreed that violence should
be halted and negotiations with guerilla groups should start
immediately after taking office.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 candidates are running the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
RCN said that around 31,000 Colombians, including 6,000
soldiers, policemen, rebels and paramilitary personnel, were
killed by violence in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that violence has claimed more than 250,000
lives in the recent 10 years, and the same number of Colombians
have been displaced by political violence between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
This year, seven well-known human rights defenders and 150
union leaders, government officials and journalists have been
assassinated in this country.
</P>
<P>
Liberal candidate Horacio Serpa declared that he may subscribe
a "social and democratic contract" to achieve peace. His program
includes the "reduction of military expenditure."
</P>
<P>
The conservative candidate Andres Pastrana, meanwhile, promises
to bring back peace and security to the Colombian citizens.
</P>
<P>
If elected, the former Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said, she
will eventually "recover the monopoly of weapons" and, in a month,
will draft laws to obtain peace.

<TEXT>

XINING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Vast green pastures where yaks
roam. Snow-capped mountains whose slopes are dotted with yellow
and purple flowers under a blue sky. Colorful Buddhist culture and
ethnic folklore.
</P>
<P>
These are all things tourists can see in Qinghai province,
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the impressively rich tourism resources, this
remote province on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau still lags behind
most regions in tourism industry. Last year, only 13,000 overseas
tourists visited the province, a figure that many tourists who
have been to the province say they cannot believe.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is working out preferential and
flexible measures to beef up construction of scenic spots and
tourist facilities.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policies, domestic or overseas investors either
can operate with a scenic spot under contract, or lease or buy the
management rights of a scenic spot.
</P>
<P>
The approval procedure will be simple for a hotel or a
supporting project in a scenic area or a holiday resort that is
open to overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
The investors will be exempted from land-use fees in the
project construction period.

<HEADLINE> Whole Building to Be Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A six-story building with a
one-floor basement will be hauled 16 meters backward rather than
demolished in an urban planning program in Benxi, a city in
northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
Whether to move or demolish a building is dependent on its
value and geographic conditions, according to the project
contractor, the Huaxia Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. under the
Benxi Urban Construction Group.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the cost for moving the 15-year-old building is
estimated at one million yuan, compared with a net cost of no less
than 2 million yuan to build such a structure, said Jia Chengda,
general manager of the company.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second try for the city to move a building. A
seven-story structure was successfully pulled 13 meters in
1994. Similar moves have also been accomplished twice in other
cities.
</P>
<P>
So far, two dozens steel posts have been fixed to subordinate
the pillars and 34 hoisting jacks installed to prop up the
building. Meanwhile, a building foundation and a steel rail were
laid at the new site. The official move has been slated for next
month.
</P>
<P>
Jia said his team is capable and confident of contracting such
a project. Many of his crew members took part in the 1994
move.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Robert Bosch, the world's second
largest automobile parts supplier, recently opened its first trade
company in China.
</P>
<P>
H.P. Bauer, chairman of the board of the newly established
firm, Robert Bosch International Trading (Shanghai) Co., said that
the British company is glad to make direct contact with the
growing Chinese automobile component market, which is important to
Bosch.
</P>
<P>
Uwe Thomas, Bosch's overseas sales manager, confirmed that
China has become the second largest market for Bosch-labeled
products, second only to its sales in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The trade company is due to take charge of Bosch's after-sales
service in China and is responsible for more than 50 of its
maintenance stations as well as all independent sales agents doing
business in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bosch's business relations with China date back to 1909; and
its first maintenance station opened here in 1923. So far, it has
set up six joint ventures in China and three representative
offices in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It is a major automotive parts supplier for such well-known
brands as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes Benz. Its business includes
automotive parts and components, electrical tools, home
appliances, telecommunications and automatic equipment. Its global
sales amounted to 25.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The new administration plans to sell
the government's remaining 45.9 percent equity stake in Philippine
National Bank, the country's second biggest bank, the Manila Times

</P>
<P>
The report quoted incoming Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net international
reserves have increased by 58.5 million U.S. dollars, according to
a statement published by Bank Indonesia (BI) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that BI's net international reserves as of
May 22 totaled 14.6916 billion U.S. dollars, compared to the
previous week's level of 14.6331 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase resulted mainly from investments in foreign notes
and a larger amount of export claims, it said.
</P>
<P>
With the increase, the statement said, the country's net
international reserves position was higher than the minimum level
allowed by the international monetary fund (IMF).

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Delaying China Visit is Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Tuesday he would not delay his visit to China next month,
stressing that there was "enough evidence" to justify pursuing a
policy of closer ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a mistake to postpone the trip," Clinton
told reporters following a White House event in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a broad range of issues to deal with and I
think we have enough evidence now to justify the partnership that
we've had," Clinton said, "so I believe that we ought to go
forward."
</P>
<P>
The president planned to pay a visit, the first by a U.S. head
of state in almost 10 years, to China in late June. His trip will
be a return visit to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the
U.S. last October.
</P>
<P>
However, some legislators in Congress, suspicious of U.S.
missile technology transfer to China, have pressured Clinton to
call it off until relevant inquiries end.

<HEADLINE> Canada Criticizes India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada lashed out Tuesday at India
for its five recent nuclear tests, saying the tests threaten the
international security regime and deliberately flouted the
overriding consensus of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a policy committee here Tuesday, Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said "India's recent nuclear tests
constitute a clear and fundamental threat to the international
security regime and thus, to Canada's security."
</P>
<P>
Because of the tests, and the danger that Pakistan will give in
to political pressure and do likewise, the clock has been turned
back to where the world was 40 years ago, facing a world in which
proliferation is an immediate threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
The tests also undermined 30 years of successful management of
the nuclear proliferation threat, and the consensus view of the
186 nations who have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT) has been deliberately flouted, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the world's nuclear and non-nuclear
countries to make efforts to preserve the integrity of the
non-proliferation regime so critical to international security.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, the Canadian minister also refuted India's
claims that its nuclear tests was based primarily on regional
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"It is not evident that any significant change in regional
security took place in the period leading up to the tests, and,
until recently, India's relationships with both China and Pakistan
were improving."
</P>
<P>
"Nationalist ambition is perhaps the most important source of
India's action. Unfortunately, it is accompanied by a total
disregard by the Indian government of the implications of its
actions," Axworthy noted.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the nuclear tests will have far-reaching
implications. "India may have launched what would be an
economically destructive arms race on the Indian subcontinent;
risked greater instability in and around southern Asia."

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Invest Billion Dollars in Natural Gas Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- More than one billion U.S. dollars
will be invested in the development of natural gas in Venezuela,
the state-owned oil company "Petroleos de Venezuela" said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A document released by the company said the money will be used
for modernizing infrastructure, developing new geographic areas
and improving the delivery of natural gas to the country's major
cities.
</P>
<P>
The company estimates that growing demand for natural gas will
promote the development of new areas in some states and the
expansion of the current infrastructure, where nearly 730 million
dollars will be invested.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 million dollars will be allocated primarily for gas
delivery and service to the cities.
</P>
<P>
About 220,000 barrels of liquefied natural gas are produced per
day in Venezuela. It is expected that production will amount to
320,000 barrels daily in the year of 2006.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Mergers, Acquisitions Grow 135 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The mergers and acquisitions of
companies in Chile grew to a total 1.375 billion U.S. dollars
between January and April 1998, an increase of 135 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Santiago's Chamber of Commerce published
Tuesday said this represented 24 percent of the total operations
of its kind in Latin-America in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The origins of the resources came mainly from local and United
States companies.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the industrial sector monopolized 47
percent of the operations, followed by insurance companies with 26
percent and the financial sector with 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The chamber predicted that the coming months might register new
operations in the forecasting and financial sectors, and an
increase was expected in the services sector operations if the
privatization plan of health companies is fulfilled.

<HEADLINE> Spain Wins Opener over Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROTENBURG, Germany, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Spain won its
preliminary opener easily after beating Argentina 64-45 on the
first day of 13th World Women's Basetball Championship on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spain controlled the group A game after 10 minutes into the
play when forward Nieves Anula, who led the team scorers with 13
points in 20 minutes, made a jumper to help her team lead with
13-11.
</P>
<P>
After building a 28-14 edge with six minutes left in the first
half, Spain, eighth placer four years ago, benched all starters
and the substitutes proved to be strong enough to beat the
opponent and walked into the locker room 37-18.
</P>
<P>
Coach Manuel Coloma also rested its starters for most of the
second half but his players failed to enlarge the margin.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, returning to the tournamant for the first time since
1975 when the South-American squad finished 11th in the 7th world
championship, narrowed the gap to 12 points at 42-54 with four
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
No other Spanish player scored double-figure except Anula.
</P>
<P>
Center Laura Palabella led the Argentines with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
Spain faces defending runner-up China on Wednesday while
Argentina meets Russia.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day championship divided 16 teams into four groups for
the preliminaries, with the first three of each group sailing into
the 12-team second round competitions in Bremen and Berlin.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Protests to EU over Barley Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Tuesday sent a letter to the European
Commission in protest against a sale of 30,000-ton subsidized
Finnish barley to the United States.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that Albright sent
the "strong letter of protest" to Jacques Santer, president of the
European Commission, expressing "her strong disappointment" at the
European action.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the letter also reflected her "particular dismay"
that the barley was headed to America just after President Clinton
announced a new trans-Atlantic trading partnership.
</P>
<P>
The barley sale is legal under international trade rules, but
it has become a flashpoint for overall U.S. complaints about
Europe's heavy farm subsidies and fears that cheaper grain will be
dumped on U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
"Such subsidies distort international markets and undercut
American farmers, who are the most productive in the world," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Later this week, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is expected
to announce trade retaliation for the barley shipment, due to
arrive soon in Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said in a statement that Agriculture Department
officials are examining options.
</P>
<P>
The barley was purchased by a California milling company,
Penny-Newman Grain Co., that sells feed for dairy cows. Company
officials say they encountered difficulty getting timely domestic
rail shipments of barley.
</P>
<P>
However, grain producers protest that it is only the first of a
wave of subsidized farm products that will further depress
already-low prices.

<HEADLINE> Romania Gets Economic Aid From Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania has received economic
assistance amounting to about 9 billion ECU (10 billion U.S.
dollars) from countries belonging to G-24 in 1990-1998, Rompres
reported Monday, citing a governmental document as saying.
</P>
<P>
According the document issued recently by the Department for
European Integration, non-repayable credits amount to 1.26 billion
ECU, namely 14 percent of the total assistance. Romania has
received non-repayable credits beginning 1991, mainly through the
Phare Program.
</P>
<P>
As far as the way in which money had been used, the paper said
that 1.1 million ECU were for private sector development, 1
million for public administration reform, 8.5 million for the back
up of small and middle-size enterprises, 2 million for technical
assistance in the field of mail and telecommunications, 1.7
million for transports, 2 million for non-conventional power
development projects, 2.5 million for agriculture, and 4 million
for social assistance.
</P>
<P>
Most of foreign credits had been given by international
financial institutions. The credits received from the World Bank
amounted to about 1.4 billion dollars, out of which about 650
million dollars were used to complete projects. The European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development provided 282 million dollars.
Romania also received money from the European Investment Bank and
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that a huge portion of money received was
devoted to fill the gaps of Romania's balance of foreign payment.
Money was also devoted to the population's survival, the
organization of symposia and round tables, as well as the working
out of studies.

<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, the chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese Peopls's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), Tuesday met here with the president of the
French National Assembly Laurent Fabius.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li conveyed the regards from the president
of the National People's Congress of China, Li Peng, to Fabius.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperations based on mutual benefit between China
and France in all fields have developed smoothly and expanded over
the past several years.
</P>
<P>
He said that since he began his official visit in France on
Sunday, he has witnessed that Sino-French friendship has a deep
and solid social basis here.
</P>
<P>
As both the CPPCC and the French National Assembly play an
important role in the political life of their own countries, the
CPPCC wishes to continue and increase exchanges with the French
National Assembly to help push forward a lasting and stable
development of relations between China and France.
</P>
<P>
Li also gave Fabius a brief introduction about the system and
situation of political consultations in China.

warmly welcomes Li to visit France.

growth over the past several years and that China's stand in the

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Increase Funding for Microfinance Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) is expected to double its funding for a
special poverty-eradication program called microfinance to 40
million U.S. dollars in 1999, it was announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program was initiated last year at the Microcredit Summit
in Washington which called for a nine-year campaign to reach 100
million of the world's poorest families with credit for
self-employment.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10 million people are now benefiting from
small-scale credit service but only a small portion of the total
market for microfinance is now being reached with millions of them
still have no access to credit.
</P>
<P>
The major constraint to access to small loans is believed to be
the lack of institutional and human capacity to effectively manage
and deliver the services.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here Tuesday, representatives of UNDP and
other sponsors said a meeting to review the scheme will be held in
New York from June 25-27.
</P>
<P>
Goals of the meeting include the building up of local finance
institutions, service staff training and the development of
simple, cost-effective measurements for determining the
poverty-level of microfinance clients, conference sources said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution last December in
support of the microfinance plan due to its contribution to
poverty eradication, empowerment of women and social upliftment.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.3 billion people living on under one U.S. dollar per
day, 900 million are women. Experience shows that women-run
businesses tend to benefit family members more directly than those
run by men.
