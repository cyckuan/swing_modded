WEST NILE SURVIVORS COPING A YEAR AFTER AN INSECT DEVASTATED THEIR
LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took many months, but Bob Benson says that he is
fully recovered now, except for the rustiness hampering his golf
game.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing the stairs is no longer a draining chore. Gardening is
now a joy, not a hazard. And traveling means more than just
shuttling between his home in Bronxville, N.Y., and the hospital:
he flew to Denmark this summer for a one-month exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' said Benson, 66. ``I don't think about it at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   For Danuta Trojanowska, though, the world remains a lonely one,
limited to the interior of the New York United Hospital in Port
Chester. Unable to walk, she has yet, almost a year after being
admitted, to venture beyond the hospital's fifth floor. Her
emotional state is still fragile, and she was recently given
another room because a piece of the ceiling fell to the floor after
a thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is coming again,'' said Trojanowska, 56, from her
hospital bed Friday, ``I prefer to die.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, these Westchester residents shared a desperate and
frightening plight: they were among the 62 people in the New York
metropolitan region who were hospitalized after being sickened by
the West Nile virus. Their roller-coaster rides to recovery mark
the extremes of what the 55 survivors have endured after months of
rehabilitation and mental anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Most survivors have told health officials that they have not
recovered their strength, and have been forced to give up
activities like tennis and ballroom dancing. Others say they are
still so demoralized that they are afraid to venture outdoors, and
they are unwilling to talk about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, with the mosquitoes now entering their most active
phase of the year and New York City bracing for the season's most
intensive spraying campaign to combat the virus, the survivors'
stories are all the more resonant and relevant, offering clues to
the virus' long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there have been three confirmed cases of people
sickened by the virus; no one has died. But the number of dead
birds infected with West Nile and the number of mosquito pools
testing positive is growing almost daily _ as is the list of places
and times to spray pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who were hospitalized last year because of
the virus were treated in late summer. Some health officials have
tried to keep tabs since then on how the victims have fared,
interviewing them at six-month intervals. The next round is
scheduled within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 44 people in New York City who were hospitalized, 32 were
over 60 years old. Roughly half of those over 60 reported serious
difficulties with fatigue and muscle weakness and have been unable
to perform basic tasks like driving, riding the subway or doing
household chores, said Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the city's
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding,'' Mullin said, ``is that for the people
who have developed encephalitis and had to be hospitalized, while
they have certainly recovered from the severity of their illness,
it has had some fairly devastating long-term effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors are now loath to talk to health officials or
reporters interested in charting their progress. Two exceptions are
Benson, a former salesman for IBM, now retired, and Trojanowska, a
housekeeper who emigrated from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who was hospitalized in July 1999, spent about a month
at the Sound Shore Medical Center in New Rochelle. What helped him
pull through, he says, was that he survived quadruple-bypass heart
surgery several years ago, and had been keeping to a vigorous
rehabilitation program. When he returned home, therefore, though he
was extremely weak, he was ready to apply the same discipline he
used for strengthening his heart muscle for the rehabilitation of
his entire body.
</P>
<P>
   This confirms what health experts have said: those who stay in
good shape have a better chance of warding off the effects of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   By early this summer, Benson said he felt that he was fully
recovered, and has since been able to resume all of his activities,
indoors and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should respond to this as a serious thing,'' he
said, ``but I also think that they shouldn't overreact.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the 92nd Street Y's decision this summer
to schedule a children's camp indoors in Manhattan rather than at a
campground in Rockland County, was ``a little off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   For Trojanowska, though, the recuperation has been much more
difficult. Even now, after months of therapy, she can walk only a
short distance wearing a leg brace, and relies on friends or
relatives to clip her toenails. Her troubles are also complicated
by her lack of a green card, meaning she is eligible only for
emergency Medicaid, which does not cover rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
   She says she is quite lonely, but has stopped the incessant
sobbing that once filled most evenings. To stay busy, she fiddles
with crossword puzzles in her native Polish, flips through Polish
magazines and watches television. Meanwhile, her sister, Barbara
Glowacki, with whom she shares a house in Port Chester, has been
trying to raise money to buy leg braces for her.
</P>
<P>
   Trojanowska said she misses the cherry tomatoes and tulips in
her garden, she says. But she knows that whenever she leaves the
hospital, life will not be the same.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Glowacki and Trojanowska welcomed numerous Polish
immigrants to their house to sit on the back porch and chat. But
then came the mosquito carrying the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, nobody comes,'' said Alicja Baldyga, a longtime friend.
``If they come, they come to the house for a few minutes. All our
friends, we never sit on the porch.''

   McNair, Jones want Cowboys in Houston for 2002 opener
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Jerry Jones will join Bob McNair in an attempt
to convince the NFL to have Houston's expansion team play the first
game in franchise history against the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and McNair are going to lobby the NFL to schedule the 2002
regular-season opener in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our first game, I'd like to play the Cowboys in our new
stadium on Monday Night Football and reintroduce to the nation a
great Texas rivalry _ Dallas vs. Houston,'' McNair said this week
from Saratoga Springs, N.Y. ``I really believe that would be
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones strongly believes the more the Dallas vs. Houston rivalry
is promoted around the country, the better it will be for football
in the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to join Bob whenever he wants me to,'' Jones said at
the Cowboys' training camp. ``I'd love to play the first game in
Houston's new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will be realigned into eight divisions of four teams
each when Houston makes its debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Houston in their first game would be great for the
state, but it would be bigger than the state,'' Jones said. ``Not
only would it create a lot of interest in our natural rivalry, but
it would heighten awareness around the country of Houston's return
to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good for the NFL. It would be an attractive game
for television. It would get high ratings. The more I think about
it, the more sense it makes. It would accentuate the competition
and the rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Because McNair paid $700 million for his franchise, a record for
any professional sports team in the United States, the NFL is
expected to let him select his first opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the new Cleveland Browns played their first game
as an expansion team, owner Al Lerner wanted to host the Pittsburgh
Steelers in their regular-season opener. Before the old Browns
moved to Baltimore, Pittsburgh was Cleveland's most bitter rival.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and McNair are hoping the new scheduling format, which
will be determined after realignment is settled, will allow their
teams to play a home-and-home series each season. They have already
scheduled a home-and-home series in preseason, and they plan to
scrimmage and practice against each other during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   After the Oilers moved to Tennessee, Jones played a significant
role in helping Houston beat out Los Angeles for the 32nd
franchise. He lobbied behind the scenes for Houston because he
thought the league would be better off if the Oakland Raiders
return to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas Cowboys and the state of Texas haven't been better
off without a team in Houston,'' Jones said. ``I believe the more
competition you have, the more interest you create. That's good for
both teams and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest in the Cowboys in Houston. Playing
the first game in their new stadium would set a tone by generating
right off the bat a very competitive atmosphere. Houston could make
a statement: The Cowboys are popular, but we've got our own team
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also is hoping the NFL will allow Dallas and Houston to
play another preseason game in Mexico City in an attempt to break
the league's all-time attendance record. In August 1994, the
Cowboys and Oilers played a preseason game before 112,376 at Azteca
Stadium. It is still the largest crowd to witness an NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go back there for the very same reasons _ the
matchup, proximity and Hispanic interest in the two franchises,''
Jones said. ``Houston and Dallas have huge Hispanic populations.
Houston's going to be like Dallas in that Hispanics will be a major
part of their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Houston in Mexico City again would be an opportunity
to generate more interest. When you go south of the border, you
also generate interest among Hispanic fans who aren't south of the
border. It's a double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Oilers set preseason attendance records at
Mexico City, Tokyo and El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd consider playing in any of the American Bowls, but
playing the Cowboys in Mexico City makes all the sense in the
world,'' McNair said. ``It would benefit fans in two countries,
including the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's been very aggressive in marketing the Cowboys and the
NFL. I respect what he's doing. We're very receptive to his ideas
because we believe as he does _ that we have to do everything
possible to keep the NFL on top.''

TESTAVERDE WATCHES LUCAS GIVE JETS A LIFT
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Vinny Testaverde and his banged-up toe
stayed on the soggy sideline Friday night, but Curtis Martin and
Ray Lucas looked as if they were in midseason form.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had 107 yards on 18 rushes and Lucas completed 19 of 26
passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns to propel the Jets to a
27-24 victory over the Giants in the Jets' final preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   But this game did little to help the Jets (2-2) find a third
receiver or to quell the lingering concerns about their defense,
which gave up 17 points to a Giants offense that sometimes seemed
to have trouble getting out of its own way.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense has been suspect _ it was picked apart in
Green Bay and played only slightly better against the Ravens _ and
its troubling pattern of missing tackles and allowing receivers to
get open continued at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, on the drive in which the Giants tied the
score at 17-17, Kerry Collins found Amani Toomer over defensive
backs Victor Green and Otis Smith for a 36-yard gain. Later, Tiki
Barber, on third-and-1 from the 15-yard line, ran for 7 yards along
the right sideline, aided by at least three missed tackles. Ike
Hilliard's 10-yard touchdown reception came at Omar Stoutmire's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Giants' first-team offense looked frighteningly
error prone, Collins was superb. He left early in the fourth
quarter after completing 16 of 28 passes for 275 yards and two
touchdowns, with one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by the running of Martin and the passing of Lucas (12 of
16 for 190 yards in the first half), the Jets were able to exploit
the Giants in a sloppy first half. Their first drive went eight
plays and 66 yards for a touchdown. Richie Anderson caught a 5-yard
pass from Lucas to give the Jets a 7-0 lead before five minutes had
elapsed. The Jets were moving well again on their second drive when
Martin fumbled a handoff to end the drive, one of two fumbles the
Jets lost in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Michael Strahan recovered Martin's fumble on the
Jets' 41, the Giants could eke out only a field goal, after their
drive stalled at the 17-yard line when the rookie running back Ron
Dayne was stripped of the ball. The Giants recovered the ball, but
not their momentum and they settled for a 33-yard field goal by
Brad Daluiso.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets struck quickly again. The Jets had hoped to use this
game to assess their receivers, most notably their newest
acquisition, Vincent Brisby. He caught one pass early in the game.
But, even with his soulmate Testaverde on the bench, it was Wayne
Chrebet who shined. On the fourth play of the drive, Lucas handed
off to Martin, who pitched back to Lucas for a flea-flicker.
Chrebet streaked down the center of the field, getting past
cornerback Dave Thomas and safety Sam Garnes. Chrebet caught Lucas'
pass on the run for a 52-yard touchdown that gave the Jets a 14-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the third play of the Giants' ensuing drive, Toomer blew by
Marcus Coleman and evaded the late-arriving Stoutmire, for a
73-yard touchdown catch from Collins. The Giants were back to
14-10. And that's when they started playing like an out-of-sync
high school team.

KICKER PUTS FUTURE IN AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The powerful feet of freshman Chris Kluwe and
sophomore Nate Fikse notwithstanding, Chris Griffith has a leg up
on the Bruins' place-kicking job. Now if he can only get his kicks
up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, a red-shirt sophomore, earned a scholarship last
season after making 13 of 18 field-goal attempts and all 25 of his
extra-point attempts. The only problem was the misses: all five
were blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fifth or sixth kick last year was low,'' Griffith said.
``I went home (Reno, Nev.) and worked with my kicking coaches and
we got it taken care of. I was turning my shoulders too far toward
the ball. I think I'm getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   If Griffith can improve his trajectory and maintain his
accuracy, the Bruins could have a kicker who is just about
automatic from 40 yards in. When the Bruins have had one in the
past - John Lee, Bjorn Merten and Chris Sailer - it's allowed the
offense to be more conservative, something the Bruins would like
with a sophomore quarterback, Cory Paus or Ryan McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense is not going to score a touchdown every time down
the field,'' said Bob Field, the defensive coordinator and kicking
coach. ``If a drive stalls and you miss a field goal, it can be
really disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your kicking game is inconsistent, it can change the
philosophy of the offense once you get the ball to the 25-yard
line. When you can pretty much count on getting three points, it's
a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Special-teams lowdown: Long snapper Jeff Grau returns, but there
will be a new holder this season: either receiver Drew Bennett or
quarterback Cory Paus. Fikse, who averaged 42.0 yards per punt last
year, will handle kickoffs but he could lose the punting battle to
Kluwe. Coach Bob Toledo said that decision won't be made until the
week before the season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity rules: Field considers it an advantage to have a
different player handling field goals, kickoffs and punts. In 1997
and 1998, Sailer handled all three. The first season he was a
first-team All-American. The second he was plagued by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do all three,'' Field said. ``His leg broke down
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Defensive tackle Ken Kocher (knee) and guard
Micah Webb (shoulder) did not practice Friday. Webb's injury is
more serious and more significant.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, a fifth-year senior, could provide valuable experience on
a young line by filling in for injured right guard Oscar Cabrera
against Alabama. If Webb is out, the Bruins could start redshirt
freshman Shane Lehman with true freshman Eyoseph Efsaeff behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bye gone: As early as next week, UCLA expects to fill next
year's open date (Sept. 8) with a game at Kansas. The Bruins were
stuck earlier this summer when Missouri - and former USC coach
Larry Smith - backed out of a home-and-home series with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA considered suing Missouri for the $500,000 it believes the
game would have brought in TV and ticket revenue, but the contract
doesn't state how much one school must pay to escape the contract.
The schools are still negotiating a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   However, UCLA may make Missouri pay another way. The Wooden
Classic was considering matching the two schools in 2001, but it's
a matchup the Bruins won't play now.
</P>
<P>
   Practice schedule: The Bruins' afternoon practice today at Drake
Stadium is open to donors by invitation only and Sunday evening's
special- teams practice is closed.

TOP PREP QUARTERBACK CLOSE TO DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It's not unusual that a big, tall quarterback
is drawing attention at a USC practice, but usually it's starter
Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer had a little competition, at least from an attention
standpoint, when Mater Dei High quarterback Matt Leinart decided to
attend Friday's practice at UC Irvine. Leinart is considered a
preseason All-American by most of the recruiting services, and has
narrowed his school choices to USC and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both right there. I just don't know. It's 50-50,''
Leinart said, but added, ``It does help (USC) a little because then
my family can come to the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Leinart said he expects to make his decision in early September,
probably the week of Mater Dei's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say I would wait until the end of the season, but
now I want to get it over with,'' Leinart said.
</P>
<P>
   Leinart said he was not concerned that USC has already received
a commitment from quarterback Billy Hart of Mission Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere I go, there's going to be competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Depth chart: Although a depth chart will probably not come until
Monday, several positions already seem decided, based on practice.
Ife Ohalete is the starter at free safety, Faasea Mailo has claimed
the right tackle spot, David Newbury should be the kicker and
Darrell Rideaux appears to have edged out Chris Cash at right
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sultan McCullough seems ahead at the tailback position,
USC coach Paul Hackett said Friday he will probably name McCullough
and Malaefou MacKenzie as co-starters. MacKenzie returned to
practice, wearing a bandage on his left hand, which he cut in
Wednesday's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Another legitimate battle is at No. 2 tight end, where sophomore
Doyal Butler and freshman Alex Holmes of Harvard-Westlake are the
candidates. Freshman Gregg Guenther of Taft will also play, but has
been out most of the week with a sore back. He will return Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About face: Kansas State coach Bill Snyder has reversed himself,
and agreed to play USC in a home-and-home series that begins with a
game at the Coliseum on Sept. 8, 2001. The second game will be
played in either 2002 or 2003 in either Manhattan, Kan., or
Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   USC tried to make the deal in February, but Snyder killed it.
USC officials believe a public backlash by Kansas State fans
rekindled the deal, and Hackett and Snyder also spoke about the
series before the contract was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris vows to play: Although Hackett is worried that a pulled
calf muscle might limit tight end Antoine Harris to 20-25 plays,
Harris said he expects to play the entire Penn State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My calf muscle felt a little tweaked, but I'll be all right,''
Harris said. ``If game day comes and I have to play hurt, I'll play
hurt. But I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   And at left guard ...: With Trevor Roberts out with a strained
foot, freshman Lenny Vandermade has worked all week with the first
unit. Hackett said it depends how Roberts recovers this weekend
before he makes a decision on a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Change of heart: Hackett was upset with Friday's morning
practice, which also happened to be the first one in which he began
to prepare for Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sloppy,'' he said. ``We've got to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But following the afternoon session, he had changed his tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``As upset as I was this morning, I couldn't be happier,''
Hackett said. ``We have set a standard at this camp that is higher
than ever before. And this afternoon, they were excellent.''

   During the hourlong memorial service, friends of Nicholas spoke
haltingly through their tears to the mourners crowded inside the
Eden Memorial Park chapel in Mission Hills and those listening
outside to an intercom.
</P>
<P>
   His friends said they loved him and he would always be in their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow peer counselor of Nick's cried as she explained how
good he was to her and how they became friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the light of the dark side of me,'' she said, weeping.
``He was always there when I needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zach Winters, 16, said his friend Nick always helped his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were always a call away when I needed you,'' Zach said.
``Things aren't going to be the same without you. All I can say is,
I love you, man. We'll always be friends for life.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial was followed by a graveside service where friends
and relatives gathered around a makeshift tent.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and Jeffrey Markowitz watched somberly as Nick's casket
was lowered into the ground. Meanwhile, seven of Nick's closest
friends stood along the side weeping for their friend.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Santa Barbara County Sheriff's officials said Nick
was an innocent victim kidnapped because his half-brother,
22-year-old Benjamin Markowitz, owed money for a past drug deal.
</P>
<P>
   Four suspects in the case have been arrested. They are William
Skidmore, 20, of Simi Valley; Jesse Taylor Rugge, 20, of Santa
Barbara; Graham Pressley, 17, of Santa Barbara County; and Ryan
James Hoyt, 21, of West Hills. They were arrested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of kidnapping, criminal conspiracy and murder were filed
against each of the suspects by the Santa Barbara County District
Attorney's Office on Friday. Pressley was charged as an adult, said
sheriff's Lt. Mike Burridge.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth suspect, 20-year-old Jesse James Hollywood, remains at
large. He was last known to be in the West Valley area, Burridge
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Hollywood was looking for Benjamin - and kidnapped
Nick - because the older Markowitz owed him $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Benjamin said the debt was old and considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   ``For $1,200, it's just sickening to me that these kids that I
grew up with, that I played baseball with, that I went to high
school with, could take my little brother, take him to a hotel and
murder him and shoot him multiple times in the head and in the
stomach,'' said Benjamin, who admitted that he at one time sold
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for his stepmother Susan Markowitz, Benjamin said
he did not attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any peace of mind I can give to her, I want to give to her,''
he said. ``I want to stay out of her face. She does not deserve me
being in her face.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Susan Markowitz said the family would seek
counseling to help them through this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benjamin knew that (the funeral) is as important to me as
giving birth to Nicholas,'' Susan Markowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick was last seen walking in his neighborhood Aug. 6 by his
cousin and uncle. On that day, according to police, Hollywood,
Rugge and Skidmore, driving in a rented van, kidnapped Nick when
they couldn't find Benjamin. They took him to Rugge's home in the
700 block of Casiano Drive in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, Nick remained at the home. His kidnappers provided
him with Valium and marijuana, probably to keep him passive while
he was at the home, police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, the same day Susan and Jeffrey Markowitz filed a
missing persons report at the LAPD's West Valley Division, Rugge
and Pressley took Nick to the Lemon Tree Inn in Santa Barbara,
where they were joined by Hoyt, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rugge and Graham left the hotel and drove to an area in the Los
Padres National Forest known as Lizard's Mouth, a popular hiking
site, officials said. There, they dug a grave, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to the hotel, the threesome took Nick to
Lizard's Mouth, where Rugge and Hoyt placed duct tape over his
mouth and taped his hands behind his back, officials said. Nick was
then placed in the grave and shot by Hoyt with a semiautomatic
handgun nine times, authorities said. Four days later, hikers found
the grave with pieces of Nick's clothing sticking out and contacted
the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives pieced together what apparently happened with the
help of Benjamin, who said Friday that he was never contacted by
Hollywood for the money owed. Instead, he received a call from
Skidmore, who said, ``Don't make me and my boys come down there,''
Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a neighbor of Hoyt's said the 21-year-old lived at
the West Hills home with his grandparents. Sometimes his mother,
who was divorced, would stay there as well, said Danny Goodman, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said he has known Hoyt for 10 years and played baseball
with his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as Goodman returned from a trip to Yosemite, he saw
Hoyt in front of his grandparents' home speaking with a girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said, `What's up Danny? I haven't seen you in a
while.'''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said he was stunned to learn that Hoyt could be involved
in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like something out of a movie almost,'' he said.
``Ryan was a good person to me. He'd give me rides to places.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Markowitz also expressed disbelief about what happened,
adding that he holds himself responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to kill myself for what's going on,'' he said. ``I wish
it was me. I wish that I was the one that was gone.''

approach. Declaring that ``the presidency is more than a popularity

NEW CALL-UPS TASTE BIG APPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just a little before 6 p.m. Friday when
pitcher Brian Cooper and catcher Shawn Wooten, both looking a
little tired, strolled into the visiting clubhouse at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Both were in Edmonton on Thursday night when they were told they
were to catch an early flight Friday morning to New York to join
the Anaheim Angels. For Wooten, a graduate of South Hills High, it
was his first day in a major-league uniform.
</P>
<P>
   For Cooper, a graduate of Glendora High, it was a return to the
big leagues. However, he is not exactly feeling comfortable these
days. He was sent back to the minors last week to correct some
problems and was called up to start today's game because the Angels
don't have anyone else for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him to command the fastball,'' pitching coach Buddy
Black said. ``That sets everything else up.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing his problem is one thing, but correcting it has been
another matter. In Cooper's start for Triple-A Edmonton last
Monday, he gave up six runs and seven hits in five innings. Today,
he's facing the defending champion Yankees, not the Sacramento
Rivercats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process, it doesn't happen overnight for a young
pitcher,'' Black said. ``There are adjustments that have to be made
when transgressing from the minor leagues to the major leagues, and
Brian is in the process of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooten, called up because reserve catcher Matt Walbeck was
placed on the disabled list with tendinitis in his right knee, was
all smiles upon entering the clubhouse. He was hitting a
team-leading .353 for Edmonton with 11 homers and 42 RBI since
being called up from Double-A Erie. Entering Yankee Stadium for the
first time was quite an experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out last night, I was thinking, `Couldn't I have
started in Milwaukee?' '' Wooten joked. ``If you can play here, you
can play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooten, 28, was a teammate of Jason Giambi's at South Hills and
also attended Mt. SAC. He was drafted by the Tigers, but rarely
caught until joining the Angels organization.
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck update: Walbeck hurt his knee last Friday in Anaheim
when he backed up a play at first base, then retreated to cover
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bothering me to do everything - catch, run, throw,''
Walbeck said. ``It gets to the point where it affects my calling a
game because my mind is here (knee). It's better to sit out two
weeks now and come back in September than play the rest of the year
at 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Bench coach Joe Maddon has returned to Southern
California, where is he undergoing tests to determine the cause of
his light-headedness and shortness of breath. Maddon had similar
symptoms in April, but tests revealed no problems with his heart.
... In order to make room on the roster for Cooper and reliever Al
Levine (activated from the DL), the Angels sent reliever Eric
Weaver and infielder back to Edmonton.

CATHOLIC CHURCH FIGHTS LAW ON BIRTH-CONTROL COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Catholic Church leaders in California have started a major
legal battle against a new state law that requires health insurance
companies to offer birth-control pills in employee health plans
that include coverage for other prescription drugs.
<P>
   What really upsets the state's Roman Catholic bishops is that
the new law, called the Women's Contraceptive Equity Act, requires
them to offer the pill to employees of Catholic Charities and other
church agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that a majority of Catholics, let alone the
general public, do not adhere to our teachings on birth control.
But that's not the point,'' said Rick Mockler, executive director
of Catholic Charities of California. ``What's at stake is our
ability to control our doctrine.'`
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders quietly filed their lawsuit last month in
Sacramento County Superior Court, on behalf of Catholic Charities
of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, prepared by the California Catholic Conference, the
lobbying arm of the state's bishops, charges that the law, which
went into effect in January of this year, does not allow adequate
exemptions for church agencies that oppose contraception on moral
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities, like many other welfare agencies affiliated
with religious organizations, is composed of semi-independent
nonprofit corporations, allowing the individual charities easier
access to government funds.
</P>
<P>
   But this structure, designed to create a buffer between the
worshipping community and the social service provider, has now
backfired on the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The new law on contraception, co-sponsored by state Sen. Jackie
Speier, D-Hillsborough, and Assemblyman Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman
Oaks, does contain a ``conscience clause'' for ``religious
employers'' seeking an exemption.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify as ``religious,'' however, the employer must hire
only people who share its beliefs and primarily serve like-minded
clients. It must also exist primarily to promote its religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities employs many non-Catholics, does not
emphasize proselytizing and serves a general population. Thus, it
is considered as a ``secular'' employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fig-leaf conscience clause. It doesn't cover enough,''
said Carol Hogan, spokeswoman for the California Catholic
Conference. ``It's gerrymandered to exclude a large portion of the
Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Kneer, the chief executive officer of Planned
Parenthood in California, said the issue is ``equal rights and
equal protection'' in the workplace. ``They want to take this
religious exemption and apply it to entities whose primary purpose
is not to inculcate religious beliefs,'' she said. ``Our concern is
for their employees who may not share those beliefs. They have a
right to contraception. Their rights should not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Unpopular Teaching
</P>
<P>
   Since 1968, when Pope Paul VI issued ``Humanae Vitae,'' his
controversial condemnation of the birth control pill, public
opinion polls have shown that teaching to be one of the most
unpopular _ and widely ignored _ statements in the history of the
papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the archdiocesan weekly Catholic San Francisco, the
Rev. Gerald Coleman, president of St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo
Park, concedes that ``the public nature of this lawsuit by Catholic
Charities will likely raise conflicts and moral questions in the
conscience of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But he argues the church should not be required to ``offer
benefits or insurance coverage to their employees when the object
of that benefit or coverage is in direct contradiction to Catholic
moral teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the two state agencies named as defendants in the
lawsuit, the Department of Managed Health Care and Department of
Insurance, referred calls to the state Attorney General's office,
which is handling the case. A spokesman there declined to comment
on the merits of the case until the state had prepared its formal
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will defend this law, which has been enacted by the
Legislature and signed by the governor,'' said spokeswoman Sandra
Michioku.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the contraceptive equity law argued that only 19
percent of heath care plans covered oral contraceptives. Three
earlier bills were vetoed by California's former governor, Pete
Wilson, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the church filed 4,000 pages of court
documents to support its argument that the new law violates the
``liberty of conscience'' protections of the California
Constitution and the U.S. Constitution's guarantee for the free
exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Hearing Set for Sept. 25
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the church's motion for a preliminary injunction
against the new law has been set for September 25 before Sacramento
Superior Court Judge Joe Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities spends about $80 million a year on social
service programs in California, about 60 percent of it from
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit could presage future church/state battles. Both of
the nation's major political parties favor private, tax-supported
``faith-based organizations'' to offer welfare services once
provided by government agencies.

 DAVIS DECLARES HOLIDAY TO HONOR CESAR CHAVEZ  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a stifling hot plaza decked with the black
eagle flags of the United Farm Workers, Gov. Gray Davis officially
established a state holiday Friday to honor Cesar Chavez, the late
Latino labor leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cesar Chavez brought hope and inspiration to tens of thousands
of farmworkers, some of the hardest-working people on the face of
the Earth,'' Davis said. ``He taught us that injustice anywhere
affects all of us everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The new holiday will be on March 31, the day Chavez was born in
1927. State Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, has been working
on the bill for three years, but former Gov. Pete Wilson was
unwilling to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a governor makes,'' Polanco said Friday.
``Cesar was a symbol of hope to workers. He provided a voice for
the voiceless and leadership for those who had the will but were
unsure of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people crowded into the Paseo de la Plaza, near
where the city of Los Angeles was established in 1781. The crowd,
which included children from schools named after Chavez in the
area, held up signs, waved flags and shouted ``Viva Cesar!'' and
``Si se puedes,'' the slogan of the United Farm Workers Union,
which he helped found.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was working in the apricot orchards outside San Jose in
1952 when he became involved in community organizing. Ten years
later, he founded a union with a goal of improving the lot of
California farm workers. He was still doing that work when he died
in 1993. More than 40,000 people marched behind his coffin at his
funeral service in the Central Valley farm town of Delano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come here today,'' said Anna Castro of Fresno. ``Both
my parents were farmworkers, and Cesar Chavez was their hero. He
did so much for them and all Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chavez's work as a union organizer was controversial
during his life, the stage behind Davis Friday was crammed with
politicians and labor leaders from across the state, each anxious
to join in singing the praises of a man who never earned more than
$6,000 a year and who never owned a house.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is the first union leader in U.S. history to be
celebrated with a paid holiday, said John Sweeney, national
president of the 14 million-member AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a powerful message that every worker is valued and
each can fight for his dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the signing ceremony was held, just a day after the
Democratic convention, there were plenty of Gore buttons and
delegate passes in the audience. Sweeney also took time to remind
the crowd that Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, vetoed an attempt to honor Chavez in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   While state workers will receive a paid holiday, California
schoolchildren will have some work to do. The bill calls for
students to take an hour on the morning of the holiday learning
about Chavez and his legacy of nonviolence and social justice and
then spend the afternoon in some form of social service.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco's bill also provides $5 million for the federal
AmeriCorps and the California Conservation Corps to work with
school districts to plan public service projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic day,'' said Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. ``We
honor a man who dedicated his life to improving the lives of the
people who pick the food that we eat.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WARD HOPES TO STEP PAST `THE TRADE'
</HEADLINE>
 (ADDS grafs 10,11; EDITS 12th graf to conform)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was a day last week at New York
Jets camp when Dedric Ward, the Jets' fourth-year wide receiver,
was in a quiet, but upbeat, mood. Al Groh, the Jets' first-year
head coach, had officially named Ward as the Jets' starting wide
receiver alongside Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   This was big news. Anything about the Jets' wide receivers is
big news ever since the organization sent Keyshawn Johnson to Tampa
Bay in the most controversial trade in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of names had been floated around as candidates to fill
the void created by the Johnson trade. First, Carl Pickens was
coming from Cincinnati, then Sean Dawkins from Seattle. Then talk
turned to the armada of Jets rookie receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets stuck with Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading Keyshawn, then not bringing in another receiver,
showed a lot of faith in me,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets maintained that they were satisfied. Yes, the
5-foot-10-inch Chrebet and the 5-9 Ward were the shortest receiving
tandem in the league. But height was just a number.
</P>
<P>
   ``With receivers and running backs, they're not big or little;
they're effective,'' Groh said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, lo and behold, with the season bearing down on them, the
Jets acquired wide receiver Vincent Brisby after he was cut by New
England. Brisby's key selling point was _ guess what? _ his size.
While nobody mentioned the K-word, as in Keyshawn, Brisby, at 6-3,
gave the Jets the big target they were looking for, at least on
paper. That, anyway, is what the front office is selling to fans as
they attempt to justify the fact that they may have cut off their
noses to spite their face.
</P>
<P>
   With each practice, with each game, the Jets seem to be more
fully realizing that trading Johnson may well be one of those moves
that haunts the franchise for decades to come. It is Boston trading
Babe Ruth, the Nets trading Dr. J.
</P>
<P>
   But for one night, everything was all right for the Jets, who
defeated the Giants, 27-24, in their final exhibition game. Chrebet
caught three passes for 79 yards, scoring on a 52 yard
flea-flicker. Ward had a quiet game, with four receptions for 49
yards, while Brisby caught two passes for 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant statistics belonged to quarterback Ray
Lucas, who was 19-of-26 passing for 286 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Ward could make everything right for himself and the Jets with a
breakthrough season. And if he does, the Jets' front office will no
doubt take credit for having the foresight and faith to have a
soft-spoken third-round draft pick replace the outspoken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Ward got a vote of confidence from the man whose shoes
the Jets are desperately trying to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty I've always liked Dedric Ward,'' Johnson said
from Tampa. ``To me, I've always thought he was a much better
player than the other guy,'' he added in a reference to Chrebet,
the receiver Johnson has often criticized as overrated and once
even described as a mascot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought he should have been the opposite receiver
from me, for a lot of different reasons,'' Johnson said of Ward.
``He fits the role of a vertical guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chrebet broke a bone in his foot in the 1999 preseason,
Ward became the No. 2 receiver for the first five games of the
regular season. He ended up with 15 receptions for 143 yards and
two touchdowns. And this was with an overwhelmed Rick Mirer at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Ward caught 22 passes for 325 yards. Johnson had
89 receptions, and Chrebet 48. It wasn't Ward's best season; that
came in 1998, his second year, when he averaged 19.1 yards a catch
and established himself as a legitimate deep threat. Still, Ward
said he viewed his five starts a year ago as a ``steppingstone for
bigger and better things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jets fans, for Bucs fans, this 2000 season has become an
intriguing drama: eyes on Groh, eyes on Johnson, eyes on Chrebet,
eyes on Ward. Perhaps, Chrebet in particular. Is he overrated, as
Johnson suggests? Can he carry the Jets' offense the way Johnson
did at times or the way Curtis Martin has done? Can he shut
Johnson's mouth?
</P>
<P>
   The defining scene of last season was a tough, but catchable,
pass bouncing off Chrebet's hands in the end zone against
Indianapolis, a pass that would have tied the score in the final
seconds of the game. This season, Chrebet will face the best
corners week in and week out. At the same time, the 25-year-old
Ward will be trying to break through to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do a good job,'' Johnson said of Ward. ``But the
other guy _ I don't think he's good enough to take the heat off of
Dedric. I took the heat off of him; I don't think he's good enough
to take the heat off of Ward.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will catch those 9-to-14-yard passes in heavy traffic in
clutch situations for the Jets? Chrebet? Ward? Brisby?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, naturally, has his opinion: ``I don't know if they have
a receiver who can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we had last year, we really only had one guy who
could do that,'' Johnson said. ``And he's in Tampa now.'' &QL;

 CANDIDATES PLUNGE INTO CENTRAL U.S.  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore was gone before the sun rose.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that no presidential candidate who trailed in the polls
on Labor Day has ever won the election, the vice president and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, rushed from California Friday
to board a riverboat that will float them down the Mississippi
River through several battleground states that could decide the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're for you. We need you to help us,'' a raspy-voiced Gore
said to supporters in La Crosse, Wis., barely 12 hours after
accepting his party's nomination for president 2,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, was in Gore's
home state trying to portray the vice president's support as weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the conventions are over, the battle lines are
clearly drawn. The voters have a clear choice,'' Bush told an
enthusiastic crowd in a suburb of Memphis, Tenn. Polls show that
Bush has a good chance of winning Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' 81-day sprint toward election day took on a new
focus as crews tore apart the Staples Center podium and party-weary
Democrats began to leave this convention city.
</P>
<P>
   Although delegates were thrilled by their candidate's speech and
almost surprised by the orderliness of their convention, they were
anything but certain about their prospects of victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a close election,'' said former President Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he does not accept Bush's claim to be a ``benevolent
conservative, or whatever it is,'' but he expressed concern that
Republicans might convince independent swing voters that they are
the party of the political center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do, they will win. If they don't, they won't,'' Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the electoral map shows why both candidates will be
spending a great deal of time in the so-called Big 10 states, where
blue-collar union workers who voted for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s
and President Clinton in the 1990s may hold the key to the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket is most solid in California and the
Northeast. Bush's strengths are come from  &LR; Texas, the South and the
Mountain West.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a string of central states _ Wisconsin, Illinois,
Michigan, Missouri, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey _ with
128 electoral votes that are in play.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing is for certain, and each side is only now
beginning to map out the strategy that will take them to the
November election. Polls have swung wildly in recent weeks,
suggesting that voters have not yet decided.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a lead for the past several months that swelled to
double digits after his party's convention two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys taken immediately after the Democratic convention showed
that Gore is enjoying the traditional ``bounce.'' A
Voter.com-Battleground poll of 1,000 likely voters found that
Bush's 11 point lead at the beginning of the week had been cut to
just 5 points immediately after Gore's speech Thursday night.
Another poll showed the race a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists agree that it is too early for such fluid  &LR; polls to
be taken too seriously. It is the patterns that emerge over the
next several weeks that will be critical.
</P>
<P>
   But a state-by-state look at who is ahead shows Bush with the
electoral advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lead in at least 16 states where they have won in
each of the past three presidential elections. Together, those
states hold 135 of the 270 electoral votes Bush needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush is ahead in Georgia, Colorado and Montana _
states Bush's father won in 1988 and Bob Dole won in 1996 _ which
have a total of 24 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have
voted for the Democratic ticket in each of the past three
elections. They total 107 electoral votes. But some of those
states, including Oregon and Washington, are not so solidly for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made much noise about competing in California. He has
spent a considerable amount of time in the state, and his aides
note that he is popular with some leaders of the high-tech
community, and does quite well, for a Republican, among Latino
voters. A poll released between the conventions showed Bush and
Gore neck-and-neck in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has some enormous advantages in California, including
the help of Gov. Gray Davis, who has shown how a centrist Democrat
can use issues like gun control, abortion and the environment to
defeat Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's forays into California may have more to do with trying to
lure Gore into spending more time and money in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend money in California, it's money you can't spend
nationwide,'' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who said she
is confident Gore would win California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will run an aggressive operation,'' said Gore's California
campaign director, Jay Ziegler, ``to make sure that Bush
understands this is a state he will have difficult time being
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics are flipped in Florida, a Republican-leaning state,
where polls show a Bush victory is likely but not certain.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists believe Gore will pay enough attention to Florida
and Bush to California to make them look competitive but will spend
the bulk of their time in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates start with $67.6 million in federal money for
their campaign, but that is only a part of the money that will be
spent. Each party will raise millions _ Republicans are trying for
$100 million _ to spend on television commercials and
get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will have to pierce the public's indifference to the
campaign. Before the conventions, the overwhelming majority of
voters said they were paying little attention to the candidates.
Next month, the summer Olympics may further drown out Bush and
Gore's efforts to get out their messages.

   Tiger's paw firmly on PGA
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ One of the players still within radar range of
Tiger Woods knows a good way to keep the PGA Championship relevant
on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the rain we had, the water's real high in that creek
on No. 6,'' Fred Funk said Friday evening. ``If Tiger slips on that
little bridge and the current gets him, maybe we'll have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the good Lord's willing and the creek doesn't rise, the
PGA Championship could look awfully familiar by the time today's
play is over.
</P>
<P>
   While Funk, Davis Love III, Scott Dunlap and a few others are
trying their darnedest to stay in touch with Woods, he's making it
tough to do so. Woods fired a mechanical 5-under-par 67 on Friday
to get to 11-under 133 at the midpoint of the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   He owns just a 1-shot lead over Dunlap, who had a second-round
68. Love, Funk and J.P. Hayes are tied for third at 7-under 137.
But with Valhalla Golf Club softened by more than three inches of
rain early Friday morning, the likelihood of Woods going in reverse
seems remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's better than I thought he was,'' said Jack
Nicklaus after playing alongside Woods in the first two rounds.
``If this was a passing of the baton _ and I think it was passed a
long time ago _ I couldn't pass it to a nicer young man, who
obviously is the cream of the crop by a mile. At this point, he's a
little better player than I was at his age.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 37, Dunlap has been around long enough to remember
Nicklaus when he was in his prime. And Dunlap recalls what he
thought as a youngster any time the Golden Bear was on the prowl at
a major _ that the rest of the field was toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Done and dusted, for sure,'' Dunlap said. ``And it usually
was, wasn't it? The thing with majors is they are so much more
important, and the better players relish those moments. It's not
that their games are that much better. It's that they are so much
better in that situation. And that's why Tiger is so extremely
difficult to beat, because this is what he lives for. He actually
gets better at that time and that moment, much like Jack did.''
</P>
<P>
   That Dunlap will have to play with Woods today in the third
round won't make it any easier for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won more majors than I have made cuts (in majors),''
Dunlap said. ``It'll be old hat for him and a new experience for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   After what happened Friday, it doesn't seem like one theory _
that because of Valhalla's birdie-friendly atmosphere, Woods is
unlikely to run away from the field _ holds much water.
</P>
<P>
   With only one player within three shots of him _ and just six
within six strokes _ the stage is set for another dominating
performance if Woods continues his sizzling play.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain in the wee hours Friday morning pushed play back one
hour. The course was primped after all the precipitation had
rearranged sand in the bunkers and caused standing water in
low-lying areas.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was going to keep Woods from his appointed round.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied four of the first eight holes and didn't have to make
any putts outside of 12 feet to do so. He tacked on another birdie
at No. 15, then suffered his only bogey on a three-putt at the
17th, botching the three-footer for par.
</P>
<P>
   But he came back to hole a 15-footer at the end after blasting
out of a buried lie in the greenside bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was perturbed to the 10th power,'' he said of his demeanor
after the three-putt. ``Then, to see my ball buried in the bunker,
I wasn't too happy. I thought I had hit a perfect 3-wood, and it
buried. But I hit the sand shot, and Steve (Williams, his caddie)
told me I was going to make the putt and get out with birdie. I
did, and I told him he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   So once again there's a field of chasers who have to prove they
can handle Woods and aren't running with their tails between their
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's soft like this, any guy can get it going,'' said
Ernie Els, who had a second-round 68 and is 2-under for the
tournament. ``The guys who have the hot putter are going to score.
A guy like Tiger, this is right up his alley. He can really pull
away from the field and play his normal game. I have to go really
low over the weekend (to have a chance).''
</P>
<P>
   Woods mentioned he hasn't had a huge halfway lead at either of
the majors he's won this year. He was 6-up midway through the U.S.
Open, which he won by 15, and three ahead at the British Open,
winning by eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you go,'' he said. ``I'm going downhill _ six, three,
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are playing a major championship, you're going to
have to play well, and I've been able to do that so far this week.
And Scott has done the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said his shot-making has ruled over his putting. But
pretty much all facets are clicking. And everybody else knows it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's playing that well, he can go as low as he wants,''
said Thomas Bjorn, who is 4-under. ``He can shoot 60 on a golf
course like this if everything goes his way. But you never know. He
can shoot 74, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, perhaps. If he has to play 20 holes instead of
18.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Woods seems to be on cruise control and is going 20
mph faster than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, everybody could have used some of that extra
speed on Friday. Play again was slow, and 11 players were left on
the course when darkness set in. One of them who finished in the
gathering gloom was Love, who could have been a lot closer than he
was but finished with back-to-back bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the 18th was playing as one of the easiest
holes on the course, Love knew he let an opportunity slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a very good way to finish,'' he said. ``I had a
pretty good round going up until then.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the late slip-ups, Love's challenge today will be
much harder.
</P>
<P>
   As it will be for everybody trying to run down Woods.

   Miller, Astros on a roll
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With every out that passed, Wade Miller tried not to
think about the one word no pitcher wants to hear: No-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crossed my mind,'' the rookie righthander said after his
no-hit bid lasted six innings Friday night as the Astros extended
their winning streak to five games with a 5-4 victory over the
Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros matched their season-high winning streak and won for
the seventh time in 10 games. They are three games over .500
(19-16) since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in five days, an Astros starting pitcher
took a no-hitter into the seventh inning. The Astros built a 5-0
lead before Miller had his no-hit bid snapped on Geoff Jenkins'
leadoff home run to right field in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt pitched six no-hit innings Monday in a 16-2 rout of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the fifth inning, that's when I began to think I had
four innings to go,'' said Miller, who allowed three hits in
six-plus innings. ``I felt good as the game went on. I wasn't
trying to blow anybody away.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who began the season at Class AAA New Orleans, retired
11 straight batters between the second and fifth innings. He
allowed only three Brewers to reach base _ two via walks and
another on a first-inning error by Julio Lugo _ and one ball to
leave the infield through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a no-hitter going, but he didn't really look like a
pitcher pitching a no-hitter in the sense he was scattering the
ball around a little and wasn't ahead in the count as you might
expect,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``But he had good
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with the Enron Field slogan ``Come early, stay late,''
the Brewers made things interesting by scoring four runs over the
seventh and eighth innings. But Astros closer Octavio Dotel retired
all six batters he faced for his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   After relying on home runs during most of their winning streak,
the Astros generated runs the old-fashion way Friday: one by one,
hit by hit.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno had three hits, scored three runs and stole two
bases in his first game back since suffering a fractured left hand
May 25. Jeff Bagwell drove in a pair of runs. Richard Hidalgo,
Moises Alou and Bill Spiers each added two hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros broke a scoreless tie in the third when Cedeno
singled off Brewers righthander Jimmy Haynes (10-11), stole second
base and scored on a single up the middle by Bagwell, who extended
his hitting streak to 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Cedeno led off with a single to center field,
advanced to second on a single by Lugo and moved to third on an
error by Jenkins. Bagwell followed with a sacrifice fly for his
97th RBI of the season. Mitch Meluskey, playing in his first game
since being activated off the disabled list, added a run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added two more runs in the sixth inning. Spiers
doubled over the head of center fielder Marquis Grissom and scored
on Cedeno's single up the middle off reliever Everett Stull. After
an intentional walk to Bagwell, Hidalgo hit an RBI double down the
left-field line to put the Astros ahead 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miller worked out of two minor predicaments to keep
the Brewers hitless _ and scoreless. In the second, he issued a
one-out walk
</P>
<P>
   before retiring the final two batters. In the sixth, pinch
hitter James Mouton led off with a walk, but Ron Belliard hit a
line drive to Bagwell, who touched first for the double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big play there,'' Miller said of the sixth-inning
twin killing. ``I thought that could be the play that gets me the
win, the no-hitter or the shutout.''
</P>
<P>
   One out of three isn't bad. Miller allowed two runs and three
hits over six-plus innings for his first victory since July 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers rallied for two runs off Miller in the seventh.
Jenkins sent a 2-2 slider off the right-field foul pole to open the
inning. Richie Sexson followed with a single to left field, Jeromy
Burnitz walked, and Charlie Hayes singled up the middle to pull the
Brewers within 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller walked off the field while being replaced by Marc
Valdes, he was greeted to a standing ovation from the Enron Field
crowd of 36,781.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said it was evident Miller had reached his limit after
115 pitches. Or maybe it was the extra 15 to 20 minutes of throwing
in the bullpen before his start that cost the 23-year-old
righthander the chance to work deeper into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (pitching coach Burt Hooton) before the game,
and he said Miller threw more pitches warming up for a game than
any pitcher he's ever seen,'' Dierker said.

<P>
   Paul O'Neill, the New York Yankees' right fielder, sharply
criticized the home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom after Friday
night's game against Anaheim, saying that Cederstrom had retaliated
to some of O'Neill's actions by calling him out on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most intentional thing I've ever seen in my
life,'' said O'Neill, who griped about a strike call in the fourth
inning, and was called out on a pitch that appeared to be outside
the strike zone. O'Neill turned and confronted Cederstrom, before
being pushed away by Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. Cederstrom
did not eject O'Neill, but the rest of the game, he and O'Neill
traded words and glares, even as the umpire left the field after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Torre called the situation disturbing. ``I didn't hear any of
the conversations,'' Torre said. ``It certainly looked like Gary
was bothered by something and pranced around a little bit.''
Cederstrom declined to comment.

WHITE SITS WITH SORE SHOULDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The shoulder that caused Devon White to miss
nearly three months flared up again and forced the center fielder
out of the starting lineup Friday against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   White said his left shoulder was sore, but he said he thought
the injury was only going to keep him out day-to-day. White missed
much of the season after suffering a partially torn left rotator
cuff diving for a ball May 2 against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't swing right-handed,'' Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``All I know is he can swing left, but he can't
swing right. I had him in the lineup when he came in and said he
couldn't swing right-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mets lefty Al Leiter starting, that became a huge issue.
Dodgers trainer Matt Wilson said the soreness White is experiencing
is likely related to the previous injury. White was available to
pinch hit from the left side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just sore, a little sore,'' said White, hitting .315 against
left-handers and .235 against right-handers. ``Most definitely
(day-to-day). It's not from the rotator cuff. It's in the back of
the shoulder. I'm available. I'm always available.''
</P>
<P>
   Proving it's an all-out platoon in center field, Johnson opted
to start switch-hitting F.P. Santangelo in center field and bat him
leadoff rather than go with lefty-hitting Tom Goodwin, acquired in
a trading deadline deal from Colorado for Todd Hollandsworth and a
pair of minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the deal, Dodgers officials said the acquisition
of Goodwin solved the leadoff problem. General manager Kevin Malone
and Johnson each said Goodwin also brought speed
</P>
<P>
   which was sorely lacking to the top of the Dodgers' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwin has stolen just three bases in five attempts for the
Dodgers. He's batting .274 with a .373 on-base percentage, but
Goodwin has had just six at-bats (two hits) against left-handed
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Power outage in middle: The Dodgers entered the series against
the Mets with a 6-9 mark in August, during which they've produced
few runs. And the middle of the lineup, which produced a bundle of
runs through July, hasn't done much lately.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield is batting .218 with three homers and five RBI,
Eric Karros is batting .200 with four RBI and Shawn Green is
batting .220 with five homers and 12 RBI. The No. 3, 4 and 5
hitters are batting a combined .213.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very rarely are all three of us hitting .200 for an extended
period,'' said Karros, whose last homer came July 25 at Colorado.
``At least Green is driving in some runs. There's not a good time,
but right now, with the way things are going, this is not the most
opportune time of the year. There's no explanation for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers averaged 4.64 runs in their first 15 games of
August, but they've scored three runs or less eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Right-hander Antonio Osuna had his ailing right
shoulder checked out and was fine. He was available to pitch. ...
Catcher Todd Hundley started for the first time in three games. He
was bothered by a sore right knee and will get today off because
Park is starting. ... With Leiter pitching, right-handed hitting
Kevin Elster started at shortstop over lefty-hitting Alex Cora. It
hurt defensively in the second inning when Elster committed his
13th error, which allowed the game's first run to score. Also,
Elster is hitting .247 (19 for 77) against left-handers and Cora is
batting .304 (7 for 23).

ERSTAD PROVIDES LATE-NIGHT THRILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget Al Gore. Forget George W. Bush. In Anaheim,
it's Darin Erstad for president.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad made one of the best catches of the year to save the game
in the bottom of the 10th, then homered in the top of the 11th to
propel the Anaheim Angels to an improbable 9-8 victory over the New
York Yankees before 37,503 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's feats were made possible by a five-run ninth inning,
when the Angels rallied from an 8-3 deficit to tie the game at 8.
The final three runs of the inning came home on Mo Vaughn's
two-out, three-run homer off Yankees closer Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But the big rally would have been meaningless if not for
Erstad's incredible catch.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on second and third and two outs in the 10th, Jorge
Posada hit a liner toward the gap in left field that appeared
headed to the wall. But Erstad made a spectacular diving catch with
his back to homeplate, keeping the game tied and the Angels' hopes
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved in and over with two strikes, because the last thing I
wanted was for him to fight off a tough pitch and drop in a blooper
to beat us,'' Erstad said. ``If he was going to beat us, he was
going to have to hit it over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada nearly did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell yourself before the pitch to react and trust your
ability,'' Erstad said. ``As I was running I wasn't 100 percent
sure I could get to it, but when I started to jump I had a good
bead on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Roger Clemens, who stifled the Angels for eight
innings before tiring in the ninth, called it one of the best
catches he has ever seen. Yankees manager Joe Torre wasn't sure at
first if Erstad made the catch, but ``we knew when the crowd went
silent it was bad for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then with one out in the top of the 11th, Erstad hit a 1-0 pitch
from Mike Stanton (2-2) into the right-field seats for his 21st
homer of the year and a 9-8 lead. Erstad, though, had to fight off
pitcher Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-2) to get to the on-deck circle at
the start of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa, who threw three scoreless innings to get the victory,
gave up the liner by Posada and tried to give Erstad a hug in the
dugout after the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Stop it! I've got to hit,''' Erstad said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Erstad's homer gave the Angels a lead, the Yankees
were due to send up Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams and David Justice
in the bottom of the 11th. Had the game been tied, Angels manager
Mike Scioscia would have brought in lefty Mike Holtz to face the
three left-handed hitters. But with a chance to close it out, he
left Hasegawa in for a third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa retired the side in order for the Angels' second
victory in four games on the current trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels appeared listless through eight innings against
Clemens, who finally tired in the ninth. Torre watched Clemens give
up back-to-back singles to Troy Glaus and Bengie Molina to start
the ninth, and went to his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson entered the game and got the first out on a fly ball
by Adam Kennedy, but walked Kevin Stocker to load the bases. Torre
went to his bullpen again, summoning Rivera, who has 26 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad hit a sharp grounder to third, where Luis Sojo fielded
the ball and stepped on third for the force out. But his throw to
first was too late to get Erstad, allowing the first run of the
inning to score.
</P>
<P>
   With two out, Rivera got ahead of Orlando Palmeiro in the count,
0-2, but Palmeiro hit one down the right-field line for an RBI
double, cutting the Yankees lead to 8-5. That brought up Vaughn,
who launched a 0-1 pitch into the right-field seats for a
game-tying three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the fifth blown save of the season for Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I haven't been around that long, but to me, that was
the biggest comeback we've ever had,'' Erstad said. ``Until the
game is over, you keep battling. How many times do you get to go
against one of the best pitchers in the history of baseball, and
the best closer? Opportunities like that are few and far between.
That's why you go to the last out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia reiterated his vote for MVP of the American League is
Erstad, even if he's a little biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who see him play every day see the intensity he plays
with, and the different ways he can beat a ballclub,'' Scioscia
said. ``All I can say is incredible. Incredible.''

WINSTON WEST SERIES OLDIES STILL GOODIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Take a close look at the NASCAR Winston West
cars when they take to Irwindale Speedway for the Home Depot 250
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Do they look exactly like Winston Cup cars? They should.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch off the paint on Steve Portegna's car and Derrick Cope's
paint scheme would appear. The cars driven by John Borneman and
Eric Norris once were raced by Ricky Rudd. Austin Cameron's car was
driven by Darrell Waltrip and the car of Brandon Ash was raced by
Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Winston West team has purchased an old Winston Cup
car. The two division's weight, wheelbase and engine displacement
are the same. The only difference is in the 350 cubic V-8s'
compression ratio. Winston Cup cars are allowed a 12-to-1 ratio and
Winston West cars have a 9.5-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that all the research and development has been
put into that race car,'' said Food4Less/Glendora Autotech team
owner Joe Nava, a Glendora resident. ``We don't have the time and
money to do that. You know you are getting great quality, and you
know what you've got going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Nava said there is an additional benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we need a part, we can call (the former car owner, Jack)
Roush, tell them it came off Johnny's car, give them the part
serial number and they'll mail it,'' he said. ``We don't have to
try to make the part ourselves. That saves a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   This, and the fact the cars are so similar, is the reason many
teams purchase year-old or two-year-old Winston Cup models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take as long to break down cars,'' said Norris,
whose team bought the superspeedway car of Rudd. ``You know the car
has a good background, and you can get an excellent car a little
cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   One team that was able to get into the Winston West Series
quickly and effectively was Ramona's Borneman, who raced in
Irwindale's Super Late Model class last year. Borneman bought the
car, parts and various equipment from Rudd, who disbanded his team
after the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get everything for 10 cents on the dollar,''
he said. ``We really got the whole shop. It's a real good car ...
it won a race at Michigan (Speedway). It was too good of an offer
to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   But some drivers do not think having the cars is an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has helped us win,'' said Bobby Dotter, who
won on 2-year-old Sterling Marlin equipment in the first Home Depot
250 at Irwindale on June 24. ``You can win if you have confidence
in your equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Brendan Gaughan does not use any recycled Winston
Cup equipment. His car is built in a state-of-the-art facility
recently constructed just outside of Las Vegas, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Small's team builds its own equipment, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think the Winston Cup cars help, but I don't think
so,'' he said. ``Technical equipment doesn't make you go fast.
That's why we like to work on our own equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not the old Winston Cup cars help Winston West
drivers win, they're a big part of the series. And it looks like it
will stay that way for the foreseeable future.

SOX KILL SUSPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a Red Sox team growing dangerously reliant on last-gasp
heroics, there was something sweet Friday night about dousing the
Texas Rangers, 6-4, in musty old Fenway in a contest almost free of
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   And something even sweeter about the triumph coming on the eve
of Pedro Martinez's start Saturday, which puts the Sox in good
position to win five of the first six games of their 10-game
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   The win lifted the Sox to within one game of Oakland in the
wild-card race and within three of the East-leading Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, the hero was a latecomer to the team, Tomo Ohka,
the pride of Siesio High School in Kyoto, Japan. His sturdy,
seven-inning outing helped give the Sox a 6-1 lead and allowed most
of the rain-soaked 33,009 in the ballyard to head for the exits
without the fear of missing any walk-off dramatics.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-modest Ohka, 24, fresh from the best performance of his
major league career, deemed his effort ``so-so.'' After all, only
80 days have passed since he threw a perfect game for Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   But the significance of the outcome was not lost on the
promising righthander. ``I am very happy,'' he said through a
translator, ``to contribute to my team's win more than anything,
especially (being) one game behind Oakland (in the wild-card
race.)''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, to their relief and Ohka's benefit, reversed their
recent trend of waiting until beer sales have been cut off before
they stage their biggest rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have come from behind to win three games this week,
including two spectacular rallies with two outs in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third inning, Ohka was protecting the 6-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big for us to score early,'' said catcher Jason
Varitek. ``On top of that, it was important to have somebody hold
the lead, which is not easy to do. But Tomo did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka (2-2) retired the side in order in five of his seven
innings. In the second, he pitched out of his most perilous jam.
Singles by Gabe Kapler and Ricky Ledee and a walk to Bill Haselman
loaded the bases with two outs. But Ohka escaped by inducing Royce
Clayton to ground into a force play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot more confidence,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
said. ``He gets a couple of runners on and he doesn't waver. He
didn't much before, but I think this year he knows he can stay away
from the big inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka's teammates said they have seen his confidence soar since
he posted his first major league win as a starter last Sunday in
Texas. And the early run support enhanced his comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I saw him in Triple A, he was dominating, but he was
a completely different pitcher up here,'' said third baseman Lou
Merloni, who had two hits, extending his hitting streak to five
games since he rejoined the team Monday. ``Tonight, you could see
he had that confidence again. We just gave some runs and he took
the ball and held them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka scattered four hits and one walk over seven innings, and
mowed down the final 14 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the reeling Rangers, mired in last place in the AL
West, showed every sign of spinning deeper into baseball's
netherworld. With one episode of ineptitude after another, the
Rangers helped the Sox turn five singles and a triple into six runs
by the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lefthander Kenny Rogers (11-11) was sliced apart mostly by
tweaky hits and a porous defense. One of the few solid Sox hits was
Troy O'Leary's two-run triple in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers officially committed three errors, but they
misplayed a number of other balls into hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly day for us,'' said Rogers. ``I think I reached
the end of my rope after about the ninth crappy hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Sox manager Jimy Williams saw it, the game was a matter
of Boston making a lot out of a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had pretty good aim tonight,'' Williams said. ``Maybe we
didn't hit some balls real hard, but we hit them in the right
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett found more holes than anyone, knocking out four
hits on a couple of bloopers to right, a grounder up the middle,
and an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston's offense, other than O'Leary's triple and the
Rangers' miscues, was largely a patchwork effort. Designated hitter
Bernard Gilkey had a key hit during a three-run spurt in the third,
keeping alive a two-out rally by singling home Nomar Garciaparra.
It was Gilkey's first RBI since July 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made a run in the ninth, with Boston leading, 6-1.
Back-to-back, one-out singles by Rafael Palmeiro and Kapler off
reliever Rheal Cormier, who started the ninth after Rod Beck held
Texas scoreless in the eighth, put them in position to reverse
Thursday's finale. Ledee followed with a double to right, scoring
Palmeiro, and moving Kapler to third.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Derek Lowe came in, only to have Mike Lamb double off the
center-field wall, cutting Boston's lead to 6-4. But Lowe struck
out Haselman and Clayton to end the game and earn his 28th save.

CLASS OF '96 DETAINED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end grows closer, but the results no clearer.
</P>
<P>
   America's top female gymnasts hit the FleetCenter floor Friday
night for the preliminary round of the Olympic trials, but little
changed in the pyramid of power.
</P>
<P>
   With just Sunday night's final round to go, Elise Ray and
Kristen Maloney rank 1-2 on the scoresheet, but no one truly knows
who ranks higher in the eyes of Bela Karolyi and officials of USA
Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   However, just less than an hour after the end of Friday night's
competition, held before a crowd of 15,035, Karolyi revealed it is
highly unlikely _ his word: unlikeable _ that all three veterans
remaining from the '96 Games (Amy Chow, Dominique Dawes, and
Shannon Miller) will be asked to board the bus again for Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have my ultimate dream,'' said Karolyi, whose
personal wish list had three veterans and three of the new kids
making it to Sydney. ``But I don't think it's (likely). The new
generation is extremely strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the three remaining Golden Girls turned up the heat
Friday night on the likes of Jamie Dantzscher, Vanessa Atler, and
Alyssa Beckerman, who were ranked 3-5, respectively, when the
nationals ended last month in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the floor was cleared, Chow had rocketed from sixth
to third, Dantzscher was in fourth, and Morgan White had moved from
seventh to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes, ninth overall in St. Louis, finished the night ranked
seventh, just behind Atler, who had the night's worst breakdown,
crashing on her back as she botched her dismount from the balance
beam. Beckerman, with three of her scores under 9.0, plummeted to
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the continuing story of Miller, the most
decorated gymnast in US history, who only last December decided to
come out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   It was her first time competing in four events and she opened
with a sparkling 9.712 on the uneven bars. Her low point was her
fall on her opening vault, leading to an 8.893 and a seventh-place
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I do that?'' said Miller, explaining her frame of
mind when she went derriere-down on her opening vault. ``That's not
a vault that I ever miss. I've done it so many times, maybe I just
wasn't thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, just out of high school and headed to the University of
Michigan, ranked No. 1 on the night, maintained her slim hold on
first overall over Maloney (54.081-53.376). It is almost impossible
to imagine a USA team without either of these talented tumblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident (about making the team),'' said Maloney.
``Nothing is for sure, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the men's squad, which guarantees the top four finishers
trips Down Under, the women's team is chosen strictly by the
subjective slide rule of Karolyi and Co. But the scores have to
count, simply because scores, as well as style, drive the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Karolyi's ruminations regarding the '96 holdovers, it's
likely four new faces will be seen in Sydney, probably Ray,
Maloney, Dantzscher, and White. Then it would come down to Chow
(second overall Friday night) and Karolyi's pick: Dawes or Miller.
</P>
<P>
   If Miller can improve on her numbers Sunday night, and convince
Karolyi that four more weeks of hard work will make her a valuable
contributor, she likely would go ahead of Dawes. With so many
youngsters on the team, it's a squad that could use Miller's
guiding hand.
</P>
<P>
   White's performance, fourth best, was encouraging. Her game
didn't fall apart in St. Louis, but it didn't meet expectations. In
the days leading up to the event in the Hub, Karolyi consistently
mentioned her as a potential key ingredient. For four events under
pressure, she lived up to the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two big mistakes on beam tonight, and I can definitely
clean those up,'' said White, who finished with a 9.312 on the
beam. ``But I moved up two spots, and I'm thrilled about that. It
was extremely important to move up, after being seventh in the
nationals, and I'm absolutely thrilled.''

PIAZZA AND ALFONZO SHARE   TOP BILLING IN METS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sports Illustrated christened Mike Piazza as ``The
Man'' on its cover this week, but the Mets catcher does not feel
pressure to carry his team. He is thrilled with his supporting
cast, and he needs it to produce if he is going to reach the World
Series for the first time in his career. ``You're only as good as
the guys around you,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and the Mets began a three-game series Friday night at
Dodger Stadium, where Piazza began his career eight years ago and
where he seemed destined to end it. But Piazza never led the
Dodgers to a playoff victory, and they traded him to the the
Florida Marlins in May 1998. Now Piazza looks poised to lead the
Mets deep into the postseason. Games like Friday night's make that
seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza slugged a two-run homer off Dodgers ace Kevin Brown in
the third inning, but the Dodgers tied the score. It was Edgardo
Alfonzo, Piazza's co-star, who drove in the winning run in a 5-3
Mets victory.
</P>
<P>
   After Joe McEwing singled and advanced to third on a wild
pickoff throw by reliever Terry Adams, Alfonzo stroked his third
single of the night to break a tie in the eighth inning. John
Franco and Armando Benitez preserved the lead, ensuring the victory
for Rick White, who worked 1 2/3 overpowering innings in relief of
Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo added his fourth hit, a double, in the ninth inning, and
Piazza singled him home for his 100th run batted in. This is the
fifth season in a row that Piazza has reached that RBI plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter fell apart in a three-run Dodgers sixth that erased the
3-0 lead the Mets built on Piazza's homer. Gary Sheffield, the best
player of the five the Dodgers received from the Marlins in the
Piazza trade, homered for the Dodgers' first run. Sheffield's
popularity in Los Angeles will grow the more he produces, but he
has said he does not feel embraced by the fans, many of whom still
revere Piazza. Their statistics since the trade are similar, with
Piazza holding an edge in batting average and runs batted in,
Sheffield in on-base percentage and runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is in the fortunes of the teams. The Mets
are 65 games above .500 since they acquired Piazza from the
Marlins. The Dodgers are only one game above .500 since they sent
Piazza away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans haven't gotten over it because of what Mike Piazza
meant to the Dodgers, and I understand that,'' Dodgers chairman Bob
Daly said recently. ``That thing got messed up, and everyone knows
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is the only player from the trade who is still with
the Dodgers. Seven months after trading Piazza, they signed Brown
to a seven-year, $105 million contract. Last winter, they signed
outfielder Shawn Green to a six-year, $84 million deal. Both
players have a higher average annual salary than the Dodgers
offered Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger Stadium crowd, so relaxed so often, has a strong
reaction whenever Piazza comes to bat; he is booed or cheered with
passion. He lined out in his first at-bat, then came up in the
third with one out, after Edgardo Alfonzo lashed a single off the
second baseman's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 1-1 fastball tailed inside on Piazza, but it did not
sink. Piazza hit it squarely, and the ball carried into the
left-center-field bleachers to give the Mets a 3-0 lead and Piazza
his 32nd home run. He also drove in a run for the first time in a
week. Piazza has not exactly slumped, but the two-run homer
followed his only five-start stretch this year in which he did not
drive in a run.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was an emphatic way to score off Brown, whose
pitches, some hitters think, have more movement than any other
pitcher's. Darren Dreifort, the right-hander who faces the Mets on
Sunday, challenges Brown for that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, the Mets got their first run on two infield hits
and an error by shortstop Kevin Elster, who could not glove
Leiter's grounder. Piazza's homer brought in the only earned runs
Brown allowed in an abbreviated outing. He was removed for a
pinch-hitter in the sixth, an inning that started with a home run
by Sheffield, his 38th.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros then singled and Green doubled to the warning track
in center. A single by Adrian Beltre cut the Mets' lead to 3-2, and
Green scored the game-tying run on a sacrifice fly, with Jay
Payton's throw bouncing off his leg before it reached the plate.
Leiter would get no more outs, walking the next two hitters _
including Jim Leyritz, batting for Brown _ and yielding to White.
</P>
<P>
   White fanned F.P. Santangelo with a hard splitter, but Mark
Grudzielanek grounded sharply down the right-field line. First
baseman Todd Zeile, the other player the Dodgers traded when they
dealt Piazza, dove to his left and speared it, flipping to White
for the inning-ending out. &QL;

HBO DOCUMENTARY HITS HOME, HITS HARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you lived through the late '60s and early '70s, as so many of
us did, then I must warn you: HBO's brilliant new sports
documentary, ``Ali-Frazier I: One Country ... Divisible'', may
smack you in the solar plexus with the devastating power of Smokin'
Joe's famed left hook.
</P>
<P>
   It packs one powerful punch.
</P>
<P>
   It floored me when I watched _ and taped _ its debut Thursday
night. It'll be back again several times this month, including
tomorrow (11:30 a.m.) and again Tuesday, Thursday, Aug. 26 and Aug.
30.
</P>
<P>
   In today's over-hyped, over-marketed, over-sold sports world,
every fight is the next Fight of the Century. None of them remotely
compare to Ali-Frazier I on March 8, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Set against the backdrop of the turbulent times and at the
height of the Vietnam War, the fight became a symbol of the great
chasm that threatened to split our country down the middle. It
featured two undefeated fighters, one the reigning heavyweight
champion of the world, the other the champion who had been deposed
and in the process lost 31/2 years in his prime because he refused
to be inducted into the military for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they stood for so much more than just two ring warriors
with spotless records. We saddled them with all our own conflicting
emotions, burdened them with responsibilities they neither sought,
nor deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight, five years in the making, clearly positioned Ali
as the symbol of the civil rights struggle and anti-Vietnam
movement, while Frazier was unfairly viewed as the symbol of the
pro-war, conservative segment of American society,'' Ross
Greenburg, senior vice president and executive producer of HBO
Sports, says in a promotion for the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   What hurts, 30 years later, is to realize that I was on the
wrong side.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not politically correct to admit even now, but at
the time, I despised Muhammad Ali. So did most of white,
conservative America. I didn't hate him _ and hate is too strong a
word, really _ because he was black, but because, I think,
somewhere inside, he made me feel ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many conflicting emotions going on in those days.
I had grown up believing in the might and power and righteousness
of my country. We were the good guys. We were John Wayne and Jimmy
Stewart. We helped weaker people overcome oppression. We didn't
kill them in their hutches. We didn't napalm their villages. Did
we?
</P>
<P>
   So when Ali refused to be inducted and to serve in Vietnam, I
hid behind my own student deferment and ridiculed him as so many
others did. How could he claim to be a pacifist, we reasoned, and
still want to fight in the ring for money? It was so easy then to
forget the not-so-subtle difference between the sport of boxing and
killing people in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   While Ali, who had embraced the Nation of Islam and dropped the
name Cassius Clay, under which he'd won an Olympic gold medal for
this country, was fighting his conviction as a draft dodger all the
way to the Supreme Court, another gold medalist (Tokyo, 1964) was
emerging as the new heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, when the court overturned Ali's conviction and
Ali-Frazier I was finally set, was that Joe Frazier, the son of a
South Carolina sharecropper, a man, as he himself would point out,
``blacker than Ali,'' became white America's champion.
</P>
<P>
   He would finally, we believed, shut Ali up once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   How wrong we were. And in so many ways. It was a terrible
disease that ultimately closed Ali's mouth, just as we were
beginning to realize how much he had to say.
</P>
<P>
   There was a subplot to that first Ali-Frazier meeting, too.
Frazier had personally gone out of his way to help Ali get his
boxing license back. He'd stuffed several thousand dollars into
Ali's pocket in the back of a limousine when Ali was broke, only to
watch in stunned disbelief when Ali jumped out of the limo in front
of a New York hotel and began screaming, ``I want Joe Frashuh! I
want Joe Frashuh!''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier couldn't understand it when Ali painted him as the
``Uncle Tom'' white man's champion, or when he made fun of his
slow, Southern speech pattern, or called him ``dumb.'' Perhaps Ali,
always the showman, was simply marketing the fight. But both
fighters were already guaranteed $2.5 million each, and the fight
at Madison Square Garden had sold out in two hours. Nobody needed
to sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swallowed a lot of razor blades,'' a gray-haired,
husky-voiced Frazier says in the film, ``and sometimes they cut ...
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The unfairness of that era has followed Frazier most of his
life, even leading him to cruelly make fun of the halting,
stumbling, mute Ali, stricken with Parkinson's disease, on a radio
show after Ali lit the torch on opening night of the Olympic Games
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fight, Frazier's son Marvis saw his father praying in
the dressing room and asked , ``Pop, what did you pray for?''
</P>
<P>
   Answered Frazier, ``I prayed, `Lord, help me kill this guy,
'cause he's not righteous.'''
</P>
<P>
   The fight itself was a classic, ebbing and flowing back and
forth as Frank Sinatra snapped photos for ``Life'' magazine and
Burt Lancaster sat in on the broadcast team. First it was Ali, then
Frazier, then Ali, then Frazier, then Ali again.
</P>
<P>
   It was Frazier's thunderous left hook that finally made the
difference. He staggered Ali with a tremendous shot in the 11th
round, turning him jelly-legged and seemingly out on his feet. But
Frazier didn't finish him, and Ali rallied yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia Daily News'' columnist Stan Hochman remembers
thinking, ``This is the best fight I've ever seen, perhaps the best
fight I'll ever see. I'd better cherish this.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 15th and final round, Frazier led on every judge's card,
but that wasn't good enough. He had to put Ali down. He did,
landing yet another devastating left hook to Ali's jaw, sending him
crashing to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Ali's loss stunned those who were struggling for advancements in
civil rights, for peace in Vietnam and for an end to the violence
on the streets of our country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he lost, it was like, `It can't be. I can't be on the
wrong side of all these things,''' Bryant Gumbel tells the HBO
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us were, though. Some of us were.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision defined his career, but it didn't win the
war for Joe Frazier either, any more than Ali's stunning loss won
it for those of us who rooted against him. Ali would take the
rematch at the Garden and ``The Thrillah in Manila'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   It would be Ali who would indeed, become ``The Greatest,'' and
it was Frazier who would eventually be remembered as just another
steppingstone along his path.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, perhaps the documentary will help heal old
wounds. For Frazier, who said after its New York premiere that he's
ready to forgive and forget; and for the country, which somehow
righted itself and survived that tumultuous. confusing time.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe even for those of us who picked the wrong side.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, we can only hope so. nn

DODGERS CONTINUE TO FLOUNDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like Kevin Brown has said for the past five days,
his side appeared fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers' season, however, is not even close to
that. It's in dire, desperate despair, and that may be an
optimistic account.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are a season-high eight games out of first place
after a 5-3 loss to the Mets on Friday at Dodger Stadium, and at a
time when teams are tightening their play the Dodgers have come
apart.
</P>
<P>
   They committed three errors, failed miserably to score runs from
third base with less than two outs, and no longer is talk about
making the playoffs the topic in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even look at the standings anymore,'' Dodgers left
fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``All it will do is depress me, and
depress people. We just have to go out there and play with some
pride. We have to play for respect.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how far the Dodgers have tumbled. Less than two weeks ago
they were 2 games out of first place. But they've lost nine of 12,
and while the future of manager Davey Johnson remains solid for the
remainder of the season, it's looking more and more bleak his
tenure will last much longer than October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always talk about this being a big month, August, and we're
eight games out,'' said shortstop Alex Cora, who had a pinch-hit
single in the eighth. ``We need to start making a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza continued to torture his old team with
a two-run homer in the third inning and three RBI. Piazza's
ninth-inning single extended the Mets' lead to 5-3 and gave him 100
RBI. It's the fifth straight season Piazza's reached that mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always great to come back here,'' Piazza said. ``I still
have a lot of friends. The weather is great, and it's great to get
out of the humidity in New York. But I don't look at it as
vindication. My thing is to always keep it simple, and to just try
and stay relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who went 4 for 25 during the recently completed
six-game road trip, had three hits, including his 38th homer. His
home run to lead off the sixth inning leaves him one shy of
Chicago's Sammy Sosa, who leads the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers continue to make mistakes, and squander chances.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who allowed three runs (two earned) in six innings, fell
victim to Kevin Elster booting a ball with two outs in the second
inning that allowed a run to score and give the Mets a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And before Piazza, one of the leading MVP candidates, crushed
Brown's 1-1 pitch into the left-field bleachers in the third
inning, Edgardo Alfonzo singled to right on a line drive that
appeared second baseman Mark Grudzielanek could have caught.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Dodgers scored three times in the sixth inning to
tie it, they wasted a chance to break the game open. With the bases
loaded and one out, Mets reliever Rick White struck out F.P.
Santangelo and got Mark Grudzielanek to ground to first baseman
Todd Zeile, who made a diving stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also had first and third with one out and trailed
4-3 in the eighth inning, but again Santangelo struck out. It was
the fourth time in five plate appearances Santangelo whiffed, and
the third time looking. Grudzielanek ended the inning by grounding
out to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series that stick out in my mind are the ones against the
Brewers, the Phillies, the Cubs and Milwaukee,'' said Dodgers
catcher Todd Hundley, who was ejected in the eighth inning for
arguing a strike. ``Those are the series that have to be won, and
we're paying the consequences of those now.''

TIGER CAN'T THRIVE WITHOUT SOME COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Combine the end of the week with the end of your rope and,
voila, welcome to Whitt's End.''
</P>
<P>
   'Twas the beginning of The End ... when golf's bewildered
hunters needed new tricks to catch a Tiger by the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Ali had Frazier. Seinfeld had Newman. Bird had Magic. And
without The Joker, Batman would've been just another middle-aged
guy with love handles and a cool car.
</P>
<P>
   Without a foil, Tiger Woods is lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to have challengers,'' former two-time PGA champ Nick
Price told cable-television's TNT, ``or the story eventually stops
being so compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of competitions, Tiger is turning the majors into his
personal monthly Golf Party Conventions. Sure, other players are
invited to fill TV time and appearances from past greats are warm
and fuzzy, but Woods is clearly the chosen one-and-only reason fans
stop, gawk and squawk.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, while Tiger's presence is good for golf, his
dominance is bad for golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Thursday's opening-round 66 and yesterday's
5-under-par 67 at the PGA at Valhalla, he'd won 11 of 20 starts,
earned over $9 million the past 12 months and produced record
scores and winning margins at the recent U.S. and British Opens. He
recently played 28 consecutive rounds under par (take that Gabe
Kapler), made the cover of ``Time'' magazine and helped prod Jack
Nicklaus to play in Thursday's first round despite the death of his
mother the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Gates, Evel Knievel and Jack Kevorkian, Tiger has a
monopoly on his industry. He's so good that his caddie, Steve
Williams, has earned more than $600,000 this year, which would rank
him 55th on the players' money list. Tiger has bludgeoned the
world's second-best player into Ernie L's, and Par-5ed the PGA into
a disheartened field of Pouters, Gripers and Also-rans waving the
white flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   Since his peers can't vote him off the island green, here's a
look at nine (the average margin of victory in his four majors)
suggestions the PGA might consider in order to tailor golf toward
the tailers and away from Tiger:
</P>
<P>
   9. Instead of girlfriend Joanna Jagoda, make him spend weekends
shacking-up with Jaromir Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   8. Give Earl and Tida one weekend off a month and bring in
Richard Williams, who would require Tiger to wear his hair in
beads, replace his trademark fist pump with a grunt, and read aloud
ridiculous grease-board gallery messages like ``Tiger is the man
who's got the goods ... I told you this century would belong to Mr.
Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Every time he hitches up his sleeve before a 400-yard bomb,
make him recite the career stats of the original sleeve-scruncher _
'70s Pittsburgh Pirate Richie Hebner.
</P>
<P>
   6. Make him change his name to Tiger Irons, and an institute a
two-stroke penalty every time he uses anything stronger than a
60-degree wedge.
</P>
<P>
   5. Force him to trade coach Butch Harmon for new swing coach
Butch Huskey, and exchange agent Mark Steinberg for Mark Wahlberg,
who would immediately cancel the Nike partnership for more
aggressive endorsements of movies about boppin' booties (''Boogie
Nights''), broken boats (''The Perfect Storm'') and bossy baboons
(''Planet of the Apes'').
</P>
<P>
   4. Reverse his LASIK eye surgery and make him play wearing Harry
Caray's glasses .
</P>
<P>
   3. On Saturdays force him to ditch the snazzy Nike garb and play
third rounds wearing the John 3:16 sign guy's rainbow wig and
Bozo's big red shoes. And rather than his traditional red power
shirt on Sundays, make him wear a pink paisley Fatskin number
accented by one of Dennis Rodman's fuchsia feather boas.
</P>
<P>
   2. Since he is a rare golfer with no discernible pre-swing
quirks or waggles, make him hit every other drive with a running
start, a la Happy Gilmore. Using a blue Putt-Putt ball. After
bouncing it on his club 24 times like in the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   1. Substitute caddie Steve Williams with comedian Steven Wright,
who would usurp yardage booklets for monotone memos like ``In just
two days, tomorrow will be yesterday,'' ``Amateurs built the ark,
professionals built the Titanic. Go figure,'' and ``If marriage
were illegal, only outlaws would have in-laws.''
</P>
<P>
   If those don't produce parity, send over Michael Jordan to
discuss chasing Tiger's unrealized baseball dream. \Nsubheds:CARNAC
THE CRAZY Answer: Tim Seder, Reggie White and Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Name a teacher kicker, a preacher tricker and a
feature Knicker? \Nsubheds:BEST AND WORST Best call: The NBA
reducing fourth-quarter timeouts from four to three and eliminating
back-to-back stoppages. Now maybe the final 49.2 seconds won't take
longer than Shawn Bradley's learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   Worst call: Rangers broadcaster Tom Grieve often refers to
rookie Scarborough Green as ``The Human Highlight Film.'' Besides
the fact that Dominique Wilkins generated that moniker 15 years
ago, Green was hitting .183 with 0 homers, 4 runs batted in and
very few highlights late last week. \Nsubheds:NUMERICAL NON-SENSE
17: Players on the Mavericks roster.
</P>
<P>
   0: Legitimate centers on the Mavericks roster. \Nsubheds:WHY DID
THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD? To find out why it's foul to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Little League of America lost a lawsuit which resulted
in all its sports leagues becoming non-gender specific, paving the
way in 1984 for a girl to play in the Little League Baseball World
Series. Fast-forward 16 years and the ``equal rights'' message has
become muddled. Little League Softball World Series teams are
threatening to boycott this year's tournament because _ of all the
nerve _ 16-year-old boys are playing for the team from Arizona. The
ridiculous claim of the protesting teams: ``It's not fair.'' Rule
that one a whine drive for a double (standard). \Nsubheds:END OF
THE END Snow White couldn't have been far from The North Dallas
Athletic Club last week, because two of her dwarfs (Michael
``Dopey'' Irvin and Sam ``Sleepy'' Perkins ) were working out
together. ... Second-most impressive local streak behind Gabe
Kapler's is the fact that Fort Worth property taxes decreased for
the sixth consecutive year. ... Got this friend who's always asking
to be Frank (Layden) with me, and he says the Russian Kursk is the
worst sub since Pete Myers' sinking performance for an injured
Michael Jordan.

   CAIRO, Egypt _ In the classic Iranian children's tale, the
fictional Mullah Nasreddin rode his donkey facing backwards but
arrived at his destination all the same. He delighted in taking
advantage of the villagers who, in their turn, poked fun at him. He
ate a lot. He paid for nothing. The world, through his myopic and
literal eyes, was a puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I survive this life without dying,'' the wise fool of a
clergyman once sighed, ``I'd be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   In these days of bitter confrontation between hard-line clerics
and liberal writers in Iran, even a figure as beloved as the Mullah
Nasreddin might feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Each week brings the imprisonment or trial of another group of
writers, journalists and editors, and the conservative courts have
closed 24 reformist publications since late April. A magazine
called Tavana was banned after publishing a caricature of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is himself a reformer. But it showed him
without his clerical turban and robe. That, the court said,
amounted to defamation.
</P>
<P>
   Just this past week, another well-known writer, Ibrahim Nabavi,
was sent to prison without a trial after critics filed 75
complaints against him in Press Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nabavi was recently honored by his peers as the country's best
political satirist, but he had another credit to his name. Four
months ago, he published a new edition of the stories of Mullah
Nasreddin, the first time anyone dared to revive the old jokes in
print since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The book was a hit, in
Iranian terms, selling more than 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Like other jailed writers, Nabavi is accused by his critics of
ridiculing and tarnishing the image of Islamic clerics in his
newspaper columns. But, as the enduring popularity of Mullah
Nasreddin jokes demonstrates, Iranians have been doing the same for
generations. And the mullah himself, sometimes a miserly bumbler
and sometimes a clever rascal, satirizes Muslim clerics better than
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Nasreddin stories are sometimes said to have originated
in Turkey and spread from there, along with the mystical and joyful
Islamic sect of Sufism, to neighboring Muslim lands. But he is a
universal figure. Jokes about country priests, for example, have
long been a staple in Catholic countries like France or Spain,
where men of religion involved themselves in politics or exercised
daily authority over ordinary people. Tales of foolish, even venal,
village sheiks or mullahs are also staple fare in Egyptian and
Iraqi humor.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Nasreddin _ mullah means a learned man _ is their Iranian
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Often the jokes ridicule the mullah's pretensions to cleverness.
In one, he takes off his shoes and falls asleep under a tree, only
to find upon waking that someone has made off with the shoes. He
decides to trick the thief into coming back so he removes his
clothes and puts them where his shoes had been. Unfortunately, he
falls asleep again. When he awakes, his clothes are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Another shows the mullah as a sneak. He goes on a trip with
three men. At lunchtime, each brings out the piece of bread he has
brought with him. Mullah Nasreddin says he is not hungry and will
show his generosity by giving his bread to his friends. ``In
return,'' he tells them, ``each of you can give me half of your
bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the mullah takes advantage of his neighbors. He borrows a
pot from one and returns two pots. Explaining his beneficence, he
says that the first pot gave birth to the second. Later, he borrows
another pot. This time he never returns it. When his neighbor
complains, the mullah says the pot died.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor is incensed. ``How can a pot die?'' he demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You believed it when a pot gave birth,'' Mullah Nasreddin
replies. ``Why should you not believe that a pot died?''
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction to his retelling of the folk tales, Nabavi
wrote that he regarded Mullah Nasreddin as a somewhat noble figure.
The stories emanated from countries that were under foreign
occupation, he wrote, and the mullah was an example of someone who
decided to confront an oppressive system by being ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to be optimistic,'' Nabavi said, ``but I see him
as the rational reaction of people against tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   When the book came out earlier this year, Nabavi and his
publishers tried to take precautions. The title mullah was excised
from all the stories: Mullah Nasreddin, as he was called in older
editions of the jokes, became simply Nasreddin. Ahmad Beheshti, an
executive of the Rezaneh publishing house, said the honorific was
removed to head off any problems with the government, which
licenses each book in Iran before it is published.
</P>
<P>
   But Nabavi also took a bit of license with the old stories. In
the traditional tales, these days found only in the homes of older
Iranians who kept their childhood books, the cleric complained that
one neighbor never invited him for a meal. The neighbor told him it
was because the mullah never stopped eating when he went to
someone's house. ``I promise to tell you a story between each
bite,'' the mullah promised him.
</P>
<P>
   In Nabavi's modern version, the mullah slyly played on his
neighbor's religious feelings. ``I promise,'' he said, ``to pray
for you between each bite.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hostile atmosphere of Iranian political life these days,
when Muslim clerics seem to be striking out at anyone who questions
their authority, such a revision might well cause offense.
</P>
<P>
   Nabavi may have anticipated as much. In his book, he noted,
``Mullah Nasreddin has different faces: he can be a wise man or a
stupid man. Both images can be educational.''

COMMENTARY: STOP THE CANOODLING! 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once upon a Cold War, presidential candidates
competed to see who could be trusted not to blink, sitting across
the table from a determined Soviet leader.
</P>
<P>
   Post Clinton, presidential candidates compete to see who can be
trusted not to blink, standing across the desk from a determined
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Watching both conventions, it is obvious that the threat is not
missiles. The threat is missies. The man we elect to occupy the
Oval Office must have steady nerves and steely resolve in case he
faces a ``Fail Safe'' moment _ not a thermonuclear crisis but a
thong crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That is why convention stages have turned into lovers' lanes. In
Philadelphia and L.A., the nominees were determined to prove their
uxoriousness.
</P>
<P>
   So the candidates and their wives cooed, cuddled and smooched.
Yuck!
</P>
<P>
   They showed videos of themselves canoodling and getting
connubial. Ick! And they had a lot of lovey-dovey talk in the
speeches. Gross!
</P>
<P>
   The weighty platform sessions of yore have been superseded by
prime-time podium make-out sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days of Mamie and Jackie and Nancy, wives waved
and smiled silently. Now wives have major convention roles,
delivering gooey paeans to their husbands, about how lovable and
trustworthy they are.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, W. was the anti-Clinton, missing no chance to
convey his faithfulness as a husband and father. Laura Bush, aka
the Best Decision He Ever Made, opened the convention with a speech
stuffed with allusions to her happy marriage and W.'s homebody
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC showed a gauzy video of W. and Laura. Its emotional
apogee was a fetching photo of W., reformed scamp, cradling his
infant daughters with a radiant smile.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush signaled he'd restore ``dignity and honor'' to the
White House, the closed captioning could have read: ``You won't
catch me messin' with a filly in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   After Philadelphia's ``Scenes From a Marriage,'' Al Gore felt
compelled to one-up his rival with ``Love Story, the Convention.''
The vice president, who once claimed he and Tipper were the models
for the Erich Segal novel, even brought in Tommy Lee Jones, his old
Harvard roommate who appeared in the 1970 movie of ``Love Story,''
to reprise his role as a pal who hangs out with the besotted
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The craggy actor offered this testimonial about Al and Tipper:
``To this day, when they come to our house, they sit in each
other's lap, hold hands, and even smooch occasionally, like the
kids they've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Introducing her husband, Tipper called him ``the man I love''
and gurgled: '`And listen, did I mention I have loved him for more
than 30 years? And from first sight?''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper's family photo album included many of her own intime
shots of Al lathered up and shaving and bare-chested. There was
picture after picture of the handsome young couple, one in bikini
and bathing trunks. The montage had an important political message:
Al and I have always been hot for each other and we still are, so
don't worry about any Monicas.
</P>
<P>
   When Al joined Tipper on stage, he grabbed her for a long,
intense kiss more suited to a third date than the fourth night of a
convention, which caused a chain reaction with Joe and Hadassah
starting to lip-lock.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's acceptance speech began with an ode to marital devotion.
</P>
<P>
   He then rhapsodized about his parents' close marriage, offering
marital fidelity as part of his genetic coding.
</P>
<P>
   When he promised ``I will never let you down,'' the close
captioning should have read: ``No pizza gals in MY Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   We knew the Republicans would make the leitmotif of the election
a promise to remove the stain of tawdry sex from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   We knew the Democrats were worried that the election would be a
referendum on Bill Clinton's revelry. Their worst fears seemed to
come true Thursday, when word spread through the hall that Robert
Ray, the independent counsel who replaced Kenneth Starr, was
inanely reconvening the Starr chamber on whether Clinton had lied
about his dalliance.
</P>
<P>
   But we did not know how profoundly this would shape the race,
from Gore's choice of Joe Lieberman, who had excoriated Clinton as
``immoral,'' to the kissy-face conventions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of how exhibitionist the race had become when
the tabloid TV show ``Extra'' did a segment on The Kiss, calling it
``Al's Big Mouth Move,'' and advising the Gores to ``Get a Room!''

COMMENTARY: MOST UNKINDEST CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a word missing from Al Gore's acceptance speech on
Thursday. Not once did he describe his opponent's plans as
``risky.'' He still warned about the size of George W. Bush's
proposed tax cuts _ about $1 trillion larger than his own over the
next 10 years. But Gore has apparently decided to emphasize his
populism more than his prudence, accusing the Republicans of
offering tax cuts that benefit only the rich. Is he telling the
truth?
</P>
<P>
   In a word: yes. Bush's proposed tax cuts aren't just tilted
toward high-income families; they target them with awesome
precision. Gore's own proposals are characteristically complex _
frankly, too complex for my tastes _ but their benefits would be
much more widely spread.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Tax Justice, a watchdog group, has produced some
numbers that illustrate just how much Bush's plan would give unto
those who already have. Around half the benefits would go to
families with incomes of more than $250,000 per year; the average
tax break for families in the top 1 percent of the income
distribution would be 100 times that for families in the middle.
Even a family making $80,000 a year would get less than $20 per
week off its taxes once the plan was fully phased in; a family
making $1 million would get $1,000 per week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan is much harder to figure out because it consists
mainly of tax credits that depend on what you do, not on how much
you make. Some of the tax credits, like those for college
education, would still be related to income. But the dollar
benefits would in general be no more for families making a million
dollars than for those making a tenth as much, and the biggest
proportional benefits would probably go to families at or below the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   So whatever you think about the details of Gore's plan (and boy,
are there a lot of details!), his characterization of the
difference between the plans seems fair. How, then, can the
Republicans _ who do, after all, need at least a few votes from the
bottom 95 percent of the income distribution to win this election _
answer the charge that they only care about the rich?
</P>
<P>
   Their traditional answer has been to emphasize the supply-side
incentives _ to insist that reducing taxes on the rich will give
people more reason to become rich, and that these increased efforts
will benefit everyone. But we haven't been hearing that argument
much lately, probably because the economy is doing so well that
it's hard to convince people that current tax levels are strangling
the spirit of enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   So now they are starting to play up another traditional argument
_  &QC; the claim that you, too, could be a winner, that Americans move
up and down the income distribution so frequently that it doesn't
matter whose taxes are cut. Last week The Wall Street Journal cited
_ not for the first time _ two old studies purporting to show that
people who are currently in the bottom 20 percent of the income
distribution are not only unlikely to stay there; after 10 or 15
years they are more likely to be in the top 20 percent than in the
bottom. Never mind that both studies were ridiculed by serious
experts for their obvious (and obviously intentional) procedural
errors as soon as they came out. As Kevin Murphy of the University
of Chicago put it, those people who supposedly went from the bottom
to the top were basically guys who worked part time in the college
bookstore, then had real jobs by the time they were 30.
</P>
<P>
   The reality _ documented by a number of other studies that The
Journal for some reason chose not to mention _ is that while most
Americans will move up or down the income distribution over the
course of a decade, most won't move very far. In fact, even in
America your parents' social class, though it doesn't determine
your own, affects it strongly. (Is this news to Bush?) If a tax
plan won't help you much today, it probably won't help you much 10
years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances, then, are not deceiving. This really is a choice
between one tax plan that, whatever else you may say about it,
would go mainly to the middle class and one that focuses like a
laser on the very, very well off.
</P>

<P>
   This baseball season has witnessed a record number of hit
batters and bench-clearing brawls, but so far nothing to match the
most horrifying clash in the sport's history. The racial tensions
and tumultuous politics of the 1960s intruded on baseball 35 years
ago Tuesday with a shock that many fans recall vividly today.
</P>
<P>
   What people remember is the violence. They do not recall, if
they ever knew, the politics that fueled it. On Aug. 22, 1965, the
Los Angeles Dodgers were playing the San Francisco Giants in a
crucial game at Candlestick Park during perhaps the most bitterly
contested pennant race in National League history. No other
incentive would have been needed to pack the ballpark in a game
between the two oldest rivals in the National League, but this one
had the added allure of a marquee matchup between the league's best
pitchers: the Giants' Juan Marichal and the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ace was at his best that day, and by the third inning
the score was 2-1, Los Angeles _ a typical score for a nine-inning
Marichal-Koufax match. Marichal, who was not averse to throwing
inside, knocked down Ron Fairly and Maury Wills. Koufax, who
disliked brush-back pitches he was afraid might kill someone, was
pressured by his catcher, John Roseboro, to retaliate with a
high-and-inside fastball when Marichal came to bat. On the next
pitch, low and inside, Roseboro dropped the ball and picked it up
behind Marichal. He then threw it back to Koufax, barely missing
Marichal's head. Marichal thought it was closer than that; he would
forever claim that the ball nicked his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roseboro was sending him a message,'' says Charles Einstein, a
biographer of Willie Mays and a collaborator on Marichal's
biography. Whatever message Roseboro sent, Marichal didn't like it.
He spun around, bat in hand, and began screaming: ``Why you do
that? Why you do that?'' (Einstein said some choice Spanish terms
were sprinkled in as well.)
</P>
<P>
   What has been excised from our collective memory of the incident
is that it was Roseboro who charged Marichal, not the other way
around. For most of the 42,000-plus crowd, the first indication
that something was wrong came when they saw Marichal smashing
Roseboro's head with his bat. Blood immediately began to flow from
a deep scalp wound; to many stunned onlookers it appeared as if
Roseboro's eye had been knocked out. Players and coaches on both
teams rushed toward home plate. Willie Mays, a close friend of
Roseboro's, got there first. He immediately grabbed the Dodger
catcher, partly to protect him and partly, as he later revealed, to
keep him from attacking Marichal. As Mays led Roseboro off the
field he cradled his bleeding head and moaned, ``Johnny, Johnny,
I'm so sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   When order was finally restored, a shaken Koufax walked the next
two hitters and then gave up a three-run homer to Mays, giving the
Giants a 4-2 victory. They may not have realized it that night, but
the Giants season was over. Marichal, 19-9 before the incident,
lost three of his last four decisions after coming back from an
eight-day suspension, which was seen as remarkably light. (Marichal
was also fined $1,750 by the league.)
</P>
<P>
   Brawls in the 1960s were nearly as common as today. Back then,
many fights were caused by batters retaliating against pitchers,
who were permitted a great deal of leeway in moving hitters off the
plate. But no one could recall a fight in which a player attacked
another player with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Marichal-Roseboro clash was all the more shocking because
the men's behavior was entirely uncharacteristic. Roseboro, 32, was
a solid, levelheaded player, and Marichal, 27, whose nickname was
the Dominican Dandy, had a reputation as an amiable practical joker
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The sports media characterized the incident as racial, but in
fact no racial antagonism survived it. What happened was the result
of off-the-field pressures catching two ordinary men in an
extraordinary situation. Roseboro, who later admitted to provoking
the incident, was distraught, as were many other black players,
over the mass disturbances that had been sweeping through Watts in
his home city, Los Angeles. ``It was really the year I came of
age,'' he said later. ``It was the first time I began to pick up a
paper and skip the sports section altogether. Much of the time I
was on the field I had to keep reminding myself that baseball was
important. I'd wake up in the morning and say to myself, `Why are
they playing games? Why can't we do something about Watts and the
people who live there?'''
</P>
<P>
   Marichal had even more to think about. His native country, the
Dominican Republic, was locked in a bloody civil war, and Marichal
found himself rushing to the phone every day to check the fortunes
of friends and family, particularly those of another Juan Marichal,
his cousin, a politician who would become vice president the
following year. ``Thinking back on it,'' Willie Mays said a few
years ago, ``I really don't think Juan should have been playing at
all. He was pretty strung out, full of fear and anger, and holding
it inside. How can you tell a city and a team that they have to
lose a pennant because of problems they don't know about happening
thousands of miles away?''
</P>
<P>
   Summing it up years later, Roseboro said: ``For millions of
Americans, the pennant race was a diversion from the problems that
were sweeping over the country. For some of us, it was just one
more huge burden.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marichal, it was a burden that continued long after his
playing days. Though he won more games than any other pitcher in
the 1960s, he was snubbed for the Hall of Fame in 1981, his first
year of eligibility, then again in 1982. He might not have made it
in 1983 if not for a public campaign by Roseboro. A grateful
Marichal thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills may have hit on the moral of the story several years
ago when he said, ``Next time you see a ballplayer go a little nuts
on the field, consider that he just might have as many
off-the-field problems as you have.''

   Blame the British. The simple game show they started in
September 1998 has replicated like bacteria in warm agar. ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has turned into a global subculture,
with 27 licensed versions being broadcast in 29 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more countries have already bought franchise rights from
the show's British creator, Celador Productions, and there are, of
course, at least a few unlicensed knockoffs. So far, the format
remains the same, with contestants facing questions worth
escalating amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least half the fun for the show's American fans is kvetching
about how easy the questions are, and how, if they were on the
show, they'd win that million dollars, easy. That scornful
pleasure, too, is spreading around the globe. But just how common
is common knowledge? Here's your chance to see whether you, too,
could be a crorepati, a multi-miljonair, a miljonaariksi, a

   Blame the British. The simple game show they started in
September 1998 has replicated like bacteria in warm agar. ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has turned into a global subculture,
with 27 licensed versions being broadcast in 29 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more countries have already bought franchise rights from
the show's British creator, Celador Productions, and there are, of
course, at least a few unlicensed knockoffs. So far, the format
remains the same, with contestants facing questions worth
escalating amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least half the fun for the show's American fans is kvetching
about how easy the questions are, and how, if they were on the
show, they'd win that million dollars, easy. That scornful
pleasure, too, is spreading around the globe. But just how common
is common knowledge? Here's your chance to see whether you, too,
could be a crorepati, a multi-miljonair, a miljonaariksi, a
milliardario . . .

</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-OBASANJO (Abuja, Nigeria) _ Special Report: When
President Clinton crisscrossed Africa in 1998, his plane overflew
Nigeria in a pointed snub at the generals leading it. On his second
trip to Africa next weekend, Clinton's main destination will be
Nigeria, a country that under the elected civilian government of
Olusegun Obasanjo has undergone one of Africa's most stunning and
convulsive political transformations. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ The Russian navy said Saturday that
all 118 members of the crew of the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk
are now likely dead, or will be before a British rescue submarine
arrives with a team of Norwegian divers to make a final desperate
effort to open a rear hatch and look for survivors. By Patrick E.
Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-POLITICS (Warsaw, Poland) _ A special Polish court last
week cleared the popular president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, and a
former president, Lech Walesa, of charges that they spied for the
Communist secret police. But behind that bizarre and embarrassing
drama, Poles believe, are the desperate straits of Solidarity's
current leader, the ambitious Marian Krzaklewski, whose own
candidacy for the presidency is floundering badly. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-GAS (Caracas, Venezuela) _ Like motorists everywhere,
Venezuelans love to complain about the price of gasoline, and they
have been doing a lot of that lately. But one thing sets them apart
from almost everyone else in the world: At less than 40 cents a
gallon, gas is cheaper than bottled water here. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CIA-LATIN-AMERICA (Washington) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and CIA Director George Tenet are at odds over the extent
to which the United States should release documentation of its
involvement with repressive Latin American regimes in decades past.
By Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-ARMY-SHOOTING (Bogota, Colombia) _ In a test of its
commitment to improving its human rights record, the Colombian
government has promised a full-scale investigation into the
killings by army troops of six elementary school children last
week. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPINES-ESTRADA (Manila, Philippines) _ Halfway into
President Joseph Estrada's six-year term, the economy is faltering,
corruption and cronyism seem to be ascendant and Muslim separatists
and kidnappers are getting out of hand in the southern Philippines.
The public is desperate for him to start getting things done. By
Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-IMMIGRATION (Rome) _ With national elections looming next
year, immigration is emerging as the issue that may define the
battle between the ruling center-left coalition and its
center-right opposition. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-REFORM (United Nations) _ Vice President Al Gore would give
more unqualified support to the United Nations and be more willing

W. Bush, says an independent U.N. watchdog organization that

<P>
   OLY-WOMEN (Undated) _ When the modern Olympics began in 1896,
women were not allowed to participate. Times have changed,
grudgingly but significantly, in the past century. At the 2000
Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, more women will compete in more
sports, and in more events, than ever. And for the first time,
women will compete in the same number of team sports as men. By
Jere Longman.

   BILINGUAL-EDUC (Oceanside, Calif.) _ Two years after
Californians voted to end bilingual education and force a million
Spanish-speaking students to immerse themselves in English as if it
were a cold bath, those students are improving in reading and other
subjects at often striking rates, according to standardized test
scores released last week. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO-RIVER (Chicago) _ Long reviled as a virtual open sewer
that flowed through the heart of the city, the Chicago River has
been reborn. Now, city planners, especially Mayor Richard Daley,
are hoping to capitalize on the river _ the city's economic
lifeline for more than 100 years _ only this time with tourism
rather than heavy industry. By Ellen Almer.

<P>
   (Will move in ``w'' news file)

   MEDICAL-PRIVACY (Washington) _ After nine months of blistering

Bush will emphasize education and Vice President Al Gore will
trumpet himself as a champion of working families. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-CVN-LOCAL (Los Angeles) _ Just as the Republican convention
was really all about George W. Bush _ to the point that congressmen
and governors were consigned to tertiary roles _ the Democrats made
their convention all about ``providing content'' to local stations
so that LOCAL candidates could get their moment in the sun. By
Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH (Dallas) _ At rallies here and across the border in New
Mexico, Gov. George W. Bush planned to unveil a new campaign pledge

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ There is no such thing as a political
movement based on jokes, President Abdurrahman Wahid once wrote.
But Wahid himself may be the evidence to the contrary. He jokes to
relieve tension, to instruct, to make a point. In fact, his address
to Parliament last week sounded a bit like a nightclub act.
</P>
<P>
   One joke, suggesting the need for cross-cultural understanding,
involved a non-Muslim bus driver who was knocked unconscious in an
accident. As he lay dying, a Muslim urged him to save his soul by
calling out the name of Allah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the name! Say the name!'' the man insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The bus driver opened his eyes briefly and murmured, ``Grogol,''
the name of the next stop on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Why in the tough times of former President Suharto did so many
Indonesians go to Singapore for dental work? Were dentists in
Indonesia so inferior?
</P>
<P>
   No, it was not that. It was just that nobody in Indonesia was
allowed to open his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   _ One day Suharto was caught in a flood and rescued by a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know who I am?'' he said. ``I'm the president of
Indonesia. As thanks, I'll give you anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want one thing,'' said the farmer. ``Please don't tell
anybody I rescued you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When Wahid, who is virtually blind, was elected last October
he named his taciturn rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ideal team,'' he said. ``The president can't see
and the vice president can't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An undertaker was unable to fold the hands of a corpse. The
body was stiff and one arm remained outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' he asked the local religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the man's profession?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case,'' said the religious leader, ``just put 10,000
rupiah in his other hand and he'll bring his arm down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wahid was reported to have told this anecdote to President
Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill was taking a walk with Clement Atlee,
Britain's Labor prime minister at the end of World War II.
Churchill said he needed to relieve himself and asked for some
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' Atlee asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' said Churchill, ``whenever you see something big
you want to nationalize it.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ At the United Nations, where one person's joke
can strike 100 other people from 100 other cultures as
incomprehensible, if not offensive, diplomats, ever cautious and
circumspect, take refuge in the universal language of the political
cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomats relish the irony of so many political situations,''
said Kamalesh Sharma, India's ambassador to the United Nations.
``In most diplomatic missions in New York, you'll find that a
particularly appealing cartoon is pinned up so that the delectation
can continue for days and days.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, a panel of diplomats _ Sharma among
them _ and American celebrities will choose the winner of a $10,000
prize for the best political cartoon on a United Nations theme.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months hundreds of entries have poured in from around
the world, from Iran to Ethiopia to Cuba, said Ranan Lurie, the
cartoonist and caricaturist who put up the prize money for the
competition, which is sponsored by the United Nations
Correspondents' Association. Shashi Tharoor, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's communications director, piloted the project through the
organization, telling skeptical U.N. bureaucrats that it was a new
way to ``propagate the message of the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury assembled by Lurie could lend itself to a cartoon. It
is headed by Elie Wiesel and will include seven ambassadors, from
North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; an actor, Jeff Bridges; an
athlete, David Cone; an author, Norman Mailer; Floyd Abrams, the
First Amendment lawyer; James Hoge, editor of Foreign Affairs, and
William J. Rowe, publisher of Times-Mirror Newspapers in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie, who is best known as a caricaturist, says good political
cartoonists need five things: the training to practice ``pure good
journalism,'' professional artistic standards, the ability to
capture personality through caricature, humor and the gift of
condensing all that into a quick message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the good political cartoon is really the smart bomb of
the media,'' said Lurie, who publishes a magazine, Cartoon News
International, for young people. ``The advantage of the political
cartoon versus the written article is that it will deliver in seven
seconds what an article will not deliver in 17 minutes. Once you've
invested your very important and precious seven seconds you become
wiser. You know what is happening in Chechnya. You know what is
happening in East Timor. Besides, a cartoon is good for you, like
ice cream with vitamins. Better than broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharma said his all-time favorite cartoon dealt with the botched
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran during the Carter
administration. In the cartoon, tragedy was touched by the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a helicopter whirring away and this GI is throwing
on the ground dozens and dozens of rabbits,'' Sharma said of the
drawing. ``They're all sitting there on the ground cross-eyed,
wondering what they're doing. And a GI on the ground is yelling
through the noise of the rotor: `I said, a  &UR; rapid &LR;  deployment
force!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows what a complex business any item of global
politics is, so a cartoon humanizes it,'' Sharma said. ``After all
the jargon you read in the paper and positions taken and all the
heat which is generated, in the end it says: Look, human beings are
fractious, but if human beings can laugh, there's hope.''

WHY FORESTERS PREFER TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE

   SEATTLE _ Exactly ninety years ago, on Aug. 20, 1910, in the
choking heat of a summer without rain in the northern Rockies, the
sun disappeared from the sky and a sound not unlike cannon fire
began rattling throughout Montana and Idaho. The Big Burn, as the
3-million-acre firestorm of 1910 was called, eventually consumed
entire towns, killed 87 people and burned a lesson into the
fledgling U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the service vowed, it would snuff out every fire, at
one point swearing to do so by 10 a.m. on the day after the fire
started. The best-known forester of that time, Gifford Pinchot,
equated wildfire with slavery as a historic scourge of the nation.
Another, Bernhard Fernow, blamed ``bad habits and loose morals''
for the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the midst of the worst wildfire year in nearly half a
century, a new round of finger-pointing is under way. Touring
Montana last week, House Speaker Dennis Hastert blamed the Clinton
administration for not logging the tinder-dry forests.
Environmentalists pointed at the timber industry and development
for altering forest ecology and creating an artificial landscape
ripe for catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forest Service remains focused on its own primary
culprit: the symbol of fire eradication, Smokey the Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The era of prevention and suppression represented by Smokey and
his shovel may have been good for safety, but it was not the best
thing for forests. The agency had reached that conclusion even
before receiving the additional evidence that foresters drew from
the fires that tore through almost half of Yellowstone National
Park in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is as much a part of nature as creeks and wildflowers. Most
forests have a natural cycle, in which a purging burn comes through
every 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. The cycle may be suppressed,
foresters say, but only at the cost of more powerful fires when it
re-emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem when people say these fires are destroying
all these areas,'' said Wiebe, the former Smokejumper. ``It's just
not correct to say a forest is destroyed by fire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when fires were routinely suppressed, forests
choked themselves with excess growth, creating better habitats for
tree-killing insects. The dying trees became tinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forests are long overdue,'' said Mick Harrington, a
research fire ecologist with the Forest Service in Montana, a state
that has just been declared a disaster area. ``They were just ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires that have already run through 5 million acres this
year are hotter, faster-burning, more ferocious than any burns of
modern times, say the people battling them. And a number of reports
say future fire seasons may be worse, identifying about 40 million
acres of public land as being at risk of catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fire suppression is only part of the problem. In some forests,
experts say, logging has removed the biggest and most
fire-resistant trees. Their replacements _ some planted, some
natural _ are crowded stands of young and disease-prone trees, with
500 or more to the acre, where there used to be 50. Foresters also
point to other elements _ excessive grazing by cattle and sheep,
diversion of rivers to newly developing areas _ that have
contributed to what some call ghost forests, spectral stands of
diseased and dying timber now baking, if not yet burning, in the
August sun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are many new areas demanding fire protection.
Homes and vacation cottages that have sprung up at the edge of
national forest boundaries have become firefighters' front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so good at putting out fires because that's what
the public wants,'' said Lindon Wiebe, a fire ecology specialist
with the Forest Service in Washington, and a former Smokejumper, as
the service's firefighters are called. ``But what we can do is
pretty small compared to what Mother Nature wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as people have gradually learned not to build homes in
areas prone to flooding, they need to understand the danger of
erecting structures in fire zones, says Dr. Phil Omi, a professor
of forest fire science at Colorado State University and director of
the Western Forest Fire Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to get the message to these people that they
are putting themselves at risk, whether it's the insurance industry
or the government,'' Omi said. But he said he could not blame the
Forest Service, or homeowners, for being slow to understand the
nature of wild fire in the West. ``Our understanding of forest fire
ecology is relatively new,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those trying to address the future fire threat are focusing on
two solutions: taking out more trees by logging or thinning, and
deliberately setting fires.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, logging in national forests has declined by
nearly 75 percent, and some critics blame this decline for the
explosive fires. A number of Western senators back the idea of
allowing the timber industry to remove more trees.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmental groups point out that the biggest fires
in Montana and Idaho are burning not in wilderness areas, but in
land that has been developed or logged. Such areas also account for
90 percent of the acreage identified as most vulnerable to
wildfire, the Forest Service says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial logging is not a prescription for forest health _
it is one of the major causes of unhealthy forest conditions,''
said Thomas Powers, chairman of the economics department at the
University of Montana, whose specialty is natural resource issues.
</P>
<P>
   The other solution _ planned fire _ has become a public
relations debacle. Last year, a record 1.4 million acres of Forest
Service land was deliberately burned. Most prescribed burns go off
without trouble. But it only takes one to stir public ire. And this
year, the one that got away, a 43,000-acre blaze set by the
National Park Service near Los Alamos, N.M., destroyed more than
200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how convinced the experts are that Los Alamos was
an exception, the fires now raging in every state of the West look
horrific on television, blackening national treasures like Mesa
Verde National Park and raining embers on popular campgrounds.

   But the Forest Service remains focused on its own primary
culprit: the symbol of fire eradication, Smokey the Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The era of prevention and suppression represented by Smokey and
his shovel may have been good for safety, but it was not the best
thing for forests. The agency had reached that conclusion even
before receiving the additional evidence that foresters drew from
the fires that tore through almost half of Yellowstone National
Park in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is as much a part of nature as creeks and wildflowers. Most
forests have a natural cycle, in which a purging burn comes through
every 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. The cycle may be suppressed,
foresters say, but only at the cost of more powerful fires when it
re-emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem when people say these fires are destroying
all these areas,'' said Wiebe, the former Smokejumper. ``It's just
not correct to say a forest is destroyed by fire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when fires were routinely suppressed, forests
choked themselves with excess growth, creating better habitats for
tree-killing insects. The dying trees became tinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forests are long overdue,'' said Mick Harrington, a
research fire ecologist with the Forest Service in Montana, a state
that has just been declared a disaster area. ``They were just ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires that have already run through 5 million acres this
year are hotter, faster-burning, more ferocious than any burns of
modern times, say the people battling them. And a number of reports
say future fire seasons may be worse, identifying about 40 million
acres of public land as being at risk of catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fire suppression is only part of the problem. In some forests,
experts say, logging has removed the biggest and most
fire-resistant trees. Their replacements _ some planted, some
natural _ are crowded stands of young and disease-prone trees, with
500 or more to the acre, where there used to be 50. Foresters also
point to other elements _ excessive grazing by cattle and sheep,
diversion of rivers to newly developing areas _ that have
contributed to what some call ghost forests, spectral stands of
diseased and dying timber now baking, if not yet burning, in the
August sun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are many new areas demanding fire protection.
Homes and vacation cottages that have sprung up at the edge of
national forest boundaries have become firefighters' front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so good at putting out fires because that's what
the public wants,'' said Lindon Wiebe, a fire ecology specialist
with the Forest Service in Washington, and a former Smokejumper, as
the service's firefighters are called. ``But what we can do is
pretty small compared to what Mother Nature wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as people have gradually learned not to build homes in
areas prone to flooding, they need to understand the danger of
erecting structures in fire zones, says Dr. Phil Omi, a professor
of forest fire science at Colorado State University and director of
the Western Forest Fire Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to get the message to these people that they
are putting themselves at risk, whether it's the insurance industry
or the government,'' Omi said. But he said he could not blame the
Forest Service, or homeowners, for being slow to understand the
nature of wild fire in the West. ``Our understanding of forest fire
ecology is relatively new,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those trying to address the future fire threat are focusing on
two solutions: taking out more trees by logging or thinning, and
deliberately setting fires.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, logging in national forests has declined by
nearly 75 percent, and some critics blame this decline for the
explosive fires. A number of Western senators back the idea of
allowing the timber industry to remove more trees.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmental groups point out that the biggest fires
in Montana and Idaho are burning not in wilderness areas, but in
land that has been developed or logged. Such areas also account for
90 percent of the acreage identified as most vulnerable to
wildfire, the Forest Service says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial logging is not a prescription for forest health _
it is one of the major causes of unhealthy forest conditions,''
said Thomas Powers, chairman of the economics department at the
University of Montana, whose specialty is natural resource issues.
</P>
<P>
   The other solution _ planned fire _ has become a public
relations debacle. Last year, a record 1.4 million acres of Forest
Service land was deliberately burned. Most prescribed burns go off
without trouble. But it only takes one to stir public ire. And this
year, the one that got away, a 43,000-acre blaze set by the
National Park Service near Los Alamos, N.M., destroyed more than
200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how convinced the experts are that Los Alamos was
an exception, the fires now raging in every state of the West look
horrific on television, blackening national treasures like Mesa
Verde National Park and raining embers on popular campgrounds.

   NEW YORK _ Commercial enterprise springs from almost every
tragedy, and the West Nile virus is no exception. Some of these
ventures, however, seem a bit more dubious than others.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which killed seven people last year and has sickened
scores of others in the New York metropolitan region, is
transmitted by mosquitoes, so it stands to reason that those who
make a living killing them have benefited somewhat from the
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer New Yorkers, scrambling to ward off the illness,
cornered the market on insect repellent. The city also made a hefty
purchase of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. The mosquitoes must be eliminated, thus someone
must make a killing on the killing. But what can be said about Tire
Conversion Technologies Inc.? Recently its public relations
spokeswoman promoted the company as a possible West Nile eliminator
because it converts old tires for use in a variety of products. The
city and state have urged residents to get rid of discarded tires,
which are a breeding ground for mosquitoes. With the help of Tire
Conversion, its press release said, ``the mosquito that causes the
West Nile virus will have one less place to call home.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, small nit. The company cannot actually use the tires lying
about on residents' lawns and elsewhere, harboring mosquito larvae.
In the near future, the tires would be collected first, said Nicole
Stein, who wrote the release. The company's response ``is not a
solution now,'' she said. ``I see it as a West Nile tangent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to help in the future,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But why the press release now? ``We saw that tires are in the
media a lot,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along. Dirad Technologies operates the West Nile
Information Line for New York City from its base in Albany. The
line provides information about West Nile symptoms and
transmission; the insecticides used; and the spraying schedule. New
Yorkers can also call to report dead birds on their property.
</P>
<P>
   Dirad produces its own press release, with the apparent goal of
drumming up more business around the state, and even the country. A
sample: ``This exotic contagion has spread as far as Boston and
will likely continue to grow . . .'' Edward Tierney, Dirad's
general manager, said: ``I am hoping to get more municipalities
using this. In Albany they use a live operator, and you call the
guy and he is, like, `Can you hold on a second?' This gives
constituents answers in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are simply flacking themselves. Dr. James Rahal, head of
infectious diseases at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens,
sent out letters last spring saying he was available to chat with
reporters about the virus. More recently, one public relations firm
promoted Fordham University researchers who were saying that
another mosquito, Aedes japonicus, might, just might, transmit West
Nile, too.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting stuff, for sure, but maybe, just maybe, not for the
front page. Not yet.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice presidential candidates, like the Perseid
meteor shower, briefly light up midsummer skies. Usually, that's as
long as they matter because people vote for presidents, not vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   With the election only some 11 weeks away, Dick Cheney, a former
congressman and defense secretary, and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut have already done just about everything running mates
can do for their tickets, from reflecting well on the presidential
candidates who chose them to providing a lift for their national
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But those contributions have been significant. Cheney and
Lieberman were serious choices, men voters can imagine as
president, and displayed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice
President Al Gore in a ``presidential'' manner, making a critical
big decision in a serious way.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man was a crassly political choice, someone selected
simply to carry a big state, as Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
would have been for Bush, or Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois for Gore.
Wyoming's three electoral votes were safe for Bush before he picked
its former congressman; Connecticut's eight were almost as solidly
secure for Gore before he chose its junior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's choice of his father's defense secretary for a running
mate was ``safe and responsible,'' said professor Stephen Wayne, a
Georgetown University political scientist. ``It basically gave us
an indication that if George W. Bush is elected, he will be a
president who uses advisers in making decisions.'' Or, as a more
caustic academic student of presidential elections, professor
Nelson W. Polsby of the University of California at Berkeley, put
it, ``Cheney was picked to indemnify Bush against the charge that
he was ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman, the first Jew on a national ticket,
was more dramatic. As Wayne put it, ``the choice was unexpected and
courageous'' _ words not usually associated with Gore. Bob Shrum, a
key Gore strategist, said, ``People began taking a fresh look at Al
Gore through his choice of Joe Lieberman.'' And he brought
something else through his aura of incorruptibility and moral
outrage against President Clinton's dalliance with a White House
intern. As Polsby observed, ``Lieberman was picked to indemnify
Gore against the charge that he was sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   And each fulfilled the other main duty of a vice presidential
choice. Each dominated public attention for several days, keeping
the other side out of the news and presumably out of voter's minds.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially important for Gore, whose staff leaked the
Lieberman choice on the Monday after the Republican convention _
stopping Bush's momentum cold. ``The Gore campaign had been in the
doldrums,'' Wayne said. ``If Gore wins the election, we'll say this
was the beginning, the jump start.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity for Cheney was overwhelmingly positive, but
included some negative recollections of his voting record,
including his votes against banning ``cop killer'' bullets that
penetrate policemen's Kevlar vests. Cheney also voted against a
resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela, who was then
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The attention focused on Lieberman was even more upbeat. No one
attacked him _ perhaps for fear of sounding anti-Semitic _ except
for a few blacks who were largely silenced by reminders from Rep.
John Lewis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson that Lieberman had marched
with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Some of his more conservative
votes, like experiments with school vouchers, were instantly and
publicly forgiven on the assurance that Gore, not Lieberman, would
make policy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not a certainty that Cheney or Lieberman will
have no continuing influence on this election. But take the most
obvious possibility _ Lieberman's religion. Jews already vote
heavily, and heavily Democratic. So Lieberman is not likely to
change their direct impact on the vote the way John F. Kennedy
brought Catholics back to their Democratic roots. He might cost his
ticket votes because of his religion or gain votes from people who
concluded that opposition to him was unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   But neither effect is likely to be large.
</P>
<P>
   That was not always true. Geographic balance meant more when the
country's regions were more distinct, and plainly Lyndon B. Johnson
carried Texas for Kennedy in 1960. Shrum thinks Bill Clinton's
choice of Gore in 1992 had a lasting effect, helping eke out some
narrow victories in Southern states and reinforcing a message of
youth and change.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes vice presidential nominations were necessary
investments just to get a nomination. Franklin D. Roosevelt won
over Texas delegates in 1932 with a promise to make John Nance
Garner his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Dewey's aides promised Rep. Charles E. Halleck of
Indiana the No. 2 spot in 1948 in exchange for Indiana's delegates.
(Dewey reneged and picked Gov. Earl Warren of California. He lost
California anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes vice presidential candidates hurt a ticket by
creating a distraction or embarrassment. It is hard to imagine this
year's buttoned-down, dare-to-be-cautious vice presidential duo
committing a gaffe like Henry Cabot Lodge's 1960 promise that as
president, Richard M. Nixon would appoint a black to the Cabinet,
an offer that could have cost votes in the South.
</P>
<P>
   More often the distractions have developed from a disclosure of
hitherto unexamined parts of the candidate's past, like the secret
sources of Nixon's finances in 1952, Thomas Eagleton's electroshock
therapy in 1972, Geraldine Ferraro's husband's murky business ties
in 1984 and Dan Quayle's avoidance of the draft in 1988. And none
of those embarrassments were decisive in those elections.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in most elections, vice presidential nominees embody the
enduring truth of the following observation by Thomas Marshall,
Woodrow Wilson's vice president: ``Once there were two brothers:
One ran away to sea, the other was elected vice president _ and
nothing was ever heard from either of them again.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ To its proponents, it is the next unsung
academic frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't an aspect of social policy or experience that
isn't deeply caught up in disability issues,'' said Susan Schweik,
an associate professor of English at the University of California
at Berkeley, who teaches a course on disability and literature.
``It's one of the great issues, like race, class and gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Disability has spread from the more familiar precincts of the
law, medicine and public policy into the humanities _ from Richard
III to labor history to discussions on whether the tippy-toed
Barbie doll is technically disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In Berkeley, which is the birthplace of activism among disabled
people, an oral history archive of the Independent Living Movement
is scheduled to open this fall at the university. Schweik is
developing an undergraduate liberal arts degree in disability
studies (the University of Illinois at Chicago and Syracuse
University offer doctorates). At San Francisco State University, a
diverse group including philosophers, literature professors,
theater scholars, historians and others, fewer than half with
disabilities themselves, recently completed a summer institute
financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities aimed at
creating disability studies in the humanities. And this fall the
first international conference on disability studies will be held
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberal arts are supposed to pose fundamental questions
like, what makes a person human, and what is justice?'' said
Catherine J. Kudlick, a historian at the University of California
at Davis, who studies the blind historical experience and who is
legally blind. ``Disability studies provide new ways of approaching
these questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The field is potentially vast. A literature course might, for
example, examine Captain Ahab of Herman Melville's ``Moby-Dick'' or
Benjy, William Faulkner's cognitively disabled (as he would now be
called) character in ``The Sound and the Fury.'' ``Disability has
always been used as a literary metaphor,'' said Rosemarie
Garland-Thomson, an English professor at Howard University and
co-director of Berkeley's institute. ``It's a highly culturally
charged situation that lends itself to deep and complicated
meanings.''
</P>
<P>
   The blossoming culture of disability might be seen as the second
wave. The academic aspect emerged in the 1980s in political science
and sociology, which focused mainly on research for reforming
public policies. Its scholarly emergence paralleled the political
activity that culminated in the Americans With Disabilities Act of
1990, which made equal access for the disabled a civil rights
issue.
</P>
<P>
   This new culture encompasses the arts, from performance art to
life writing (as expressed by insiders); sporting events; and the
influence policies have had on the dominant culture, whether
reflected in the Washington subway system or the extra-wide toilet
stalls beloved by luggage toters and nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally seeing a breakdown of the tragic but brave
model,'' said professor Paul K. Longmore, the San Francisco State
historian who organized the institute and who gets about in a
wheelchair. Longmore, co-editor of ``The New Disability History:
American Perspectives,'' to be published later this year by New
York University Press, says research is becoming increasingly
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   History has been an especially rich vein. ``Disability is
everywhere in history, once you begin looking for it, but
conspicuously absent in the histories we write,'' said Douglas
Baynton, a University of Iowa historian.
</P>
<P>
   New scholarship is rapidly changing that, unearthing attitudes
behind laws like 19th-century Chicago's ``unsightly beggar
ordinances,'' which barred from public view any person ``who is
diseased, maimed, mutilated or in any way deformed so as to be an
unsightly or disgusting object.''
</P>
<P>
   The historians in this field are using these newly uncovered
primary sources, studying 19th-century periodicals like the
Locomotive Engineers Monthly Journal, which ran passionate
philosophical debates on how to deal with frequent accidents among
railroad engineers, including how disability might affect their
manhood and whether they should be given alternative jobs in
railway stations.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the trend see it as yet another example of the
political correctness and identity politics ravaging academia.
``The past 20 years has seen the humanities getting narrower and
narrower,'' said John M. Ellis, a retired professor of German
literature at the University of California Santa Cruz and author of
``Literature Lost: Social Agendas and the Corruption of the
Humanities'' (Yale University Press, 1999). ``Like the focus on
race, class and gender, this sounds to be like the usual
victimology of the humanities spinning out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   But Longmore and his colleagues argue that disability studies
enrich many disciplines. ``We're doing critical analysis, not
political advocacy,'' Longmore said.
</P>
<P>
   He does acknowledge, however, that there is an unavoidable
aspect of heritage hunting from past to the present. It has caused
some to reexamine figures like Milton, Beethoven and Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable that any previously marginalized group
would want to find models in history,'' Longmore said. ``But we
need to dig deeper to analyze group experiences, public policies
and cultural values. Heroes are not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems specialized, disability studies _ the corporal
dimension of the human experience and its consequences _ could wind
up being one of the most inclusive academic fields of all. As
Longmore points out, ``It's a social group that all people will
join if they live long enough.''

   A Run on Meat, and Not by Humans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From hemisphere to hemisphere and around the globe comes news
about meat, and it's enough to put you off your feed.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the report from Britain, where thousands of
pigs have been slaughtered because of an outbreak of swine fever.
``People are at their wits' end,'' lamented James Black, vice
chairman of the National Pig Association.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the United States joined several European countries
in banning imports of live pigs, pig semen and related products
from Britain, which is still struggling with huge economic losses
from an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly
known as mad cow disease, that began several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Swine fever, like mad cow disease, is usually controlled only by
the destruction of infected animals. Outbreaks decimated herds in
the Netherlands and Germany in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike mad cow disease, swine fever is not thought to be a
threat to humans. About 50 people in Britain have died from
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which has been linked to mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered two flocks of sheep
belonging to a Vermont couple to be destroyed out of concern that
they had a version of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia, about 100 people died last year and a million pigs
were slaughtered because of the spread of the newly discovered
Nipah virus, which is in the same class of viruses as ebola and
AIDS. Researchers recently confirmed a chain of infection from
fruit bats to pigs and then to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in Argentina
prompted the announcement last week of a temporary halt in beef
exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bon appetit.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hut Was There &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service drew some derision last year when it
told the Appalachian Mountain Club to make sure a hut the group was
rebuilding in New Hampshire's White Mountains was wheelchair
accessible according to federal rules. The Galehead hut is perched
2,000 feet up a boulder-strewn trail, doubters pointed out; a
wheelchair would never make it.
</P>
<P>
   Never say never.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three hikers in wheelchairs engineered for rough
terrain and two hikers on crutches made it up the 4.6-mile trail in
about 12 hours, under their own steam but with plenty of help from
friends, family members and volunteers. They conquered the
mountain, they said, to show that their determination should not be
underestimated _ and for a fun hike in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Their Galehead trek and the hubbub over the hut highlight a
tricky question: Just how accessible must the naturally
not-very-accessible wilderness become?
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave trails,
but when it comes to new buildings, however remote, the answer is:
very accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Trial for Kennedy Nephew In 1975 Killing in Connecticut
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut juvenile court judge ruled that Michael Skakel, a
nephew of Ethel Kennedy, should stand trial for the 1975 killing of
Martha Moxley, who was his 15-year-old next-door neighbor in
Greenwich's gated Belle Haven enclave. The judge has yet to decide
whether Skakel, who is now 39, should be tried as a juvenile or as
an adult. Conviction by a judge in juvenile court could mean a
sentence of less than four years; conviction by a jury in Superior
Court could bring a life term.
</P>
<P>
   Rising Tire-Related Toll
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has figured out yet why Firestone tires have been failing
on Ford Explorers, but the government has raised to 62 its tally of
deaths attributed to the tires in consumer complaints filed with
regulators. Most occurred when the tires failed at high speed and
the Explorers rolled over. State Farm, the nation's largest auto
insurer, said that it began billing Firestone for tire incidents in
1997, and mentioned the problem to regulators in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Threat to California's Oaks
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the California coast, thousands of oak trees are
dying of a fast-spreading new disease called sudden oak death
syndrome. In just five years, it has spread from one to three
species of oak and across 350 miles of coastline. Scientists fear
it may move outside the state and afflict other species of trees,
and the Agriculture Department says it will discuss its options in
fighting the disease next week. It appears to be caused by a
species of funguslike organism closely related to the pest that
caused Irish potato blight.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde Is Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Following last month's fatal crash near Paris, Britain and
France formally grounded the Concorde after investigators
determined that a problem with its tires made the world's only
commercial supersonic airliner unsafe. Investigators found that the
crash, which killed 113, originated in a tire blowout that caused
chunks of rubber to rupture a fuel tank. The Concorde will fly
again only when its manufacturers devise safeguards against a
repetition, aviation authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nominee Knew
</P>
<P>
   More than two and a half years after an independent counsel
began investigating President Clinton's relationship with a White
House intern, a new grand jury has been impaneled to review the
case again, government officials said. The independent counsel,
Robert Ray, convened the panel last month after saying he would
consider whether Clinton could be charged with wrongdoing in the
Monica Lewinsky matter once he leaves office. Democrats and
Republicans piled criticism on the anonymous leak about the grand
jury, disclosed just hours before Vice President Al Gore accepted
the Democratic Presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It's Melting
</P>
<P>
   An ice-free patch of ocean about a mile wide has opened at the
very top of the world, a sight that has presumably never before
been seen by human beings and is more evidence that global warming
may be real. The last time that scientists can be certain the pole
was awash in water was more than 50 million years ago. ``It was
totally unexpected,'' Dr. James J. McCarthy, an oceanographer and
director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard
University, said after lecturing aboard a tourist cruise on a
Russian icebreaker earlier this month. He said that six years ago,
the ice near the North Pole was 6 to 9 feet thick.

   Because the Hut Was There &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service drew some derision last year when it
told the Appalachian Mountain Club to make sure a hut the group was
rebuilding in New Hampshire's White Mountains was wheelchair
accessible according to federal rules. The Galehead hut is perched
2,000 feet up a boulder-strewn trail, doubters pointed out; a
wheelchair would never make it.
</P>
<P>
   Never say never.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three hikers in wheelchairs engineered for rough
terrain and two hikers on crutches made it up the 4.6-mile trail in
about 12 hours, under their own steam but with plenty of help from
friends, family members and volunteers. They conquered the
mountain, they said, to show that their determination should not be
underestimated _ and for a fun hike in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Their Galehead trek and the hubbub over the hut highlight a
tricky question: Just how accessible must the naturally
not-very-accessible wilderness become?
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave trails,
but when it comes to new buildings, however remote, the answer is:
very accessible.

   Trial for Kennedy Nephew In 1975 Killing in Connecticut
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut juvenile court judge ruled that Michael Skakel, a
nephew of Ethel Kennedy, should stand trial for the 1975 killing of
Martha Moxley, who was his 15-year-old next-door neighbor in
Greenwich's gated Belle Haven enclave. The judge has yet to decide
whether Skakel, who is now 39, should be tried as a juvenile or as
an adult. Conviction by a judge in juvenile court could mean a
sentence of less than four years; conviction by a jury in Superior
Court could bring a life term.

   Rising Tire-Related Toll
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has figured out yet why Firestone tires have been failing
on Ford Explorers, but the government has raised to 62 its tally of
deaths attributed to the tires in consumer complaints filed with
regulators. Most occurred when the tires failed at high speed and
the Explorers rolled over. State Farm, the nation's largest auto
insurer, said that it began billing Firestone for tire incidents in
1997, and mentioned the problem to regulators in 1998.

   A Threat to California's Oaks
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the California coast, thousands of oak trees are
dying of a fast-spreading new disease called sudden oak death
syndrome. In just five years, it has spread from one to three
species of oak and across 350 miles of coastline. Scientists fear
it may move outside the state and afflict other species of trees,
and the Agriculture Department says it will discuss its options in
fighting the disease next week. It appears to be caused by a
species of funguslike organism closely related to the pest that
caused Irish potato blight.

   The Concorde Is Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Following last month's fatal crash near Paris, Britain and
France formally grounded the Concorde after investigators
determined that a problem with its tires made the world's only
commercial supersonic airliner unsafe. Investigators found that the
crash, which killed 113, originated in a tire blowout that caused
chunks of rubber to rupture a fuel tank. The Concorde will fly
again only when its manufacturers devise safeguards against a
repetition, aviation authorities said.

<P>
   When the Nominee Knew
</P>
<P>
   More than two and a half years after an independent counsel
began investigating President Clinton's relationship with a White
House intern, a new grand jury has been impaneled to review the
case again, government officials said. The independent counsel,
Robert Ray, convened the panel last month after saying he would
consider whether Clinton could be charged with wrongdoing in the
Monica Lewinsky matter once he leaves office. Democrats and
Republicans piled criticism on the anonymous leak about the grand
jury, disclosed just hours before Vice President Al Gore accepted
the Democratic Presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It's Melting
</P>
<P>
   An ice-free patch of ocean about a mile wide has opened at the
very top of the world, a sight that has presumably never before
been seen by human beings and is more evidence that global warming
may be real. The last time that scientists can be certain the pole
was awash in water was more than 50 million years ago. ``It was
totally unexpected,'' Dr. James J. McCarthy, an oceanographer and
director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard
University, said after lecturing aboard a tourist cruise on a
Russian icebreaker earlier this month. He said that six years ago,
the ice near the North Pole was 6 to 9 feet thick.

stages, researchers say it may eventually offer a new source of
nerve cells to treat spinal cord injuries or diseases like
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

TEST SCORES RISE, SURPRISING CRITICS OF LAW PROHIBITING BILINGUAL
EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANSIDE, Calif. _ Two years after Californians voted to end
bilingual education and force a million Spanish-speaking students
to immerse themselves in English as if it were a cold bath, those
students are improving in reading and other subjects at often
striking rates, according to standardized test scores released this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators had predicted catastrophe if bilingual classes
were dismantled in this state, which is home to one of every 10 of
the nation's public school children, many of them native Spanish
speakers. But the prophecies have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In second grade, for example, the average score in reading of a
student classified as limited in English increased 9 percentage
points over the last two years, to the 28th percentile from the
19th percentile in national rankings, according to the state. In
mathematics, the increase in the average score for the same
students was 14 points, to the 41st percentile from the 27th.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which represent the first attempt to measure the
new law's effects, are expected to have an impact beyond
California's borders, most immediately in Arizona, where voters
will be presented with a ballot initiative in November asking them
to outlaw bilingual education in much the same way that California
has. The California test scores are also expected to influence
Colorado, where a similar measure narrowly missed getting on the
ballot this fall, and in Massachusetts and New York, where
anti-bilingual forces are marshaling.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know precisely how much the erasure of
bilingual education contributed to the rising scores _ class sizes
in the second grade have also been reduced over the same period,
for example _ but the results are remarkable given predictions that
scores of Spanish-speaking students would plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of Ken Noonan, who likened the change in
his position on bilingual education over the last two years to a
religious conversion. Noonan, who founded the California
Association of Bilingual Educators 30 years ago and who is now the
school superintendent in this city 35 miles north of San Diego, was
among those who warned in 1998 that children newly arrived from
Mexico and Central America would stop coming to school if they were
not gradually weaned off Spanish in traditional bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would hurt kids,'' Noonan said of the ballot
initiative, which was called Proposition 227. ``The exact reverse
occurred, totally unexpected by me. The kids began to learn _ not
pick up, but learn _ formal English, oral and written, far more
quickly than I ever thought they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read the research and they tell you it takes seven
years,'' added Noonan, a Californian whose Mexican mother never
learned English. ``Here are kids, within nine months in the first
year, and they literally learned to read.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Noonan need not look further than his own district,
where, in a mirror of the state, one of every four students, or
more than 5,000, is classified as limited English proficient.
Oceanside was among the most diligent school districts in the state
in adhering to the new law, and recorded some of the biggest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In the second grade in Oceanside, for example, the average
reading score of students initially classified as limited English
jumped 19 percentage points over the last two years _ to the 32nd
percentile from the 13th, according to preliminary state figures.
Only in the 10th and 11th grades, in a reflection of the entrenched
language problems of teen-age Spanish speakers statewide, were the
increases below 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanside's performance was all the more striking when measured
against the nearby district of Vista, where half the limited
English speakers _ about 2,500 students _ were granted waivers by
the superintendent to continue in bilingual classes. In nearly
every grade, the increases in Oceanside were at least double those
in Vista, which is similar in size and economic background to
Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the results so far in California represent a
tentative affirmation of the vision of Ron Unz. Unz is the Silicon
Valley entrepreneur who almost single-handedly financed and
organized the initiative that has all but eliminated bilingual
education in California, in which students were taught math, social
studies and science in their native language until they gradually
picked up English. (Students who now wish to be taught in such
classes must seek a waiver from their districts, on the grounds
that they would otherwise be educationally or psychologically
harmed by the pace of the English immersion class.)
</P>
<P>
   Unz, who has played an active role in the Arizona effort, said
he had been dismayed to read several years ago that students across
California were languishing in bilingual classes for six years or
more, routinely failing to graduate. He also found that there was
little research that supported bilingual education, which had been
developed in Congress in the 1960s, at least in part, as a means to
send federal aid to poor Southwestern school districts. Even
supporters concede it soon became entrenched as a way to pay the
salaries of thousands of bilingual teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test scores these last two years have risen, and risen
dramatically,'' Unz said in a telephone interview. ``Something has
gone tremendously right for immigrants being educated in
California.''

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Oceanside, as in many districts in the state, the
elimination of bilingual education has been accompanied by other
changes, making its impact hard to gauge with precision. Class
sizes in the lower elementary grades have been pared to 20, from
more than of 30 two years ago, with an infusion of state aid. For
the most intransigent readers, Spanish speakers chief among them,
an old-fashioned, sound-it-out, phonics approach to teaching
reading has replaced whole language, a more progressive approach
that encourages students to use context clues to extract meaning,
sometimes at the expense of pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   With so many variables introduced at once, along with a renewed
emphasis statewide on the importance of standardized testing, Kenji
Hakuta, a professor of education at Stanford University, argued
that few conclusions about bilingual education could be drawn from
the results, other than that ``the numbers didn't turn negative,''
as many had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Hakuta said that districts like Oceanside were posting such
sizable gains, in part, because their previous scores had been so
abysmally low _ and remained so.
</P>
<P>
   While the school districts are required to implement the new
law, it is difficult to ascertain to what degree they have been
teaching their Spanish-speaking students in English. The law
requires only that teachers instruct ``overwhelmingly'' in English.
But that is often easier to do in third grade, when the subject is
multiplication, than in 11th grade, where it might be trigonometry.
The state has mounted little effort to measure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his initial, personal opposition to the new law, Noonan
of Oceanside said that he was insistent that his district, in a
city of 152,000 whose residents range from migrant farmers to naval
officers to dot-com millionaires, would strictly follow the will of
the voters and teach Spanish-speaking students exclusively in
English.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, Noonan's district makes an interesting case study.
</P>
<P>
   Though the state permitted districts the discretion to grant
waivers, Noonan took a hard line. Of 5,000 students in the district
who, according to a basic skills test, were found to have limited
English proficiency, 150, or 3 percent, sought waivers; only 12
were granted.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in the nearby district of Vista, where parents
supporting bilingual education have created a powerful advocacy
group, about one of every two students sought a waiver from the new
law, and all such requests were granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy,'' said Dave Cowles, the Vista superintendent,
``is that we give the parent the information about the benefits and
the downside of the bilingual program, and then let them decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, for the first time in recent memory, Oceanside is
outpacing its archrival Vista.
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, the average score of third-graders who primarily
speak Spanish improved by 11 percentage points in reading over the
last two years, to the 22nd percentile; in Vista, the gain was a
more modest 5 percentage points, to the 18th percentile. In fifth
grade in Oceanside, limited English speakers gained 10 percentage
points in reading, with the average score in the 19th percentile;
in Vista, there was no increase, the average score of limited
English speakers staying flat, in the 12th percentile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to comment on which ultimately works better,''
said Cowles, the Vista superintendent. Yet he added, ``If these
results are indicative of how students learn best, then we have to
take them into account when we talk to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, virtually all vestiges of bilingual education have
been disassembled, including at Garrison Elementary, a
stucco-coated building surrounded by eucalyptus trees, where nearly
one of every two students is a native Spanish speaker. There,
Leticia Cortez, a certified bilingual teacher, now teaches
mathematics in English to her Spanish-speaking first graders. She
resorts to speaking Spanish to a student only if he appears to be
in emotional distress, and then only to counsel him, not to
instruct.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Christian Dominguez, 7, whose broad grin
is usually flanked by deep dimples, but who cried for the first two
weeks he spent in Cortez's class, which he entered only days after
arriving from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I could talk in English,'' he recalled, ``was
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But nine months later, Christian is able to read short books
about dinosaurs and the cartoon character Arthur, while
understanding what he hears on his favorite television show,
``X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Says his mother, Rocio, 28, a baby sitter, ``I'm happy, oh,
wow!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is so much English being spoken by parents and
children and teachers in Oceanside that Gabriela Diaz, 8, who will
soon enter the third grade, has experienced an unforeseen
consequence of Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friends from Mexico come here,'' she said, ``I don't
understand what they're saying.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a famous bit of publishing lore about how Tom Clancy's
first novel, ``The Hunt for Red October,'' caught on in the
mid-1980s. President Reagan read the tale of submarine disaster and
derring-do and mentioned publicly that it was mesmerizing. The
novel, published by the tiny Naval Institute Press, quickly became
a runaway best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's instincts for pure and simple drama catapulted Clancy
to fame. But they also help explain why the world has been so
transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in the
Barents Sea and the desperate attempts to reach the 118 men either
trapped or dead inside. At week's end, rescue attempts were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that tales of sea adventure and calamity have
always held deep appeal, and best sellers like ``The Perfect
Storm'' and movies like ``Titanic,'' ``Das Boot'' and ``U-571''
have tapped into that fascination. But what is it about the sea _
and especially submarines _ that often makes the drama of those
trapped below the waves resonate more than similar disasters on
land, like mine cave-ins?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that for all the advances in science, the
sea remains a mysterious _ and mystical _ force. Since the 1960s,
every achievement in the space program has been covered so minutely
by the news media that outer space has a familiar feel. But once
you slip below the ocean's waves, you enter a dark, unpredictable
and often claustrophobic world that, in some ways, rivals space as
the final frontier.
</P>
<P>
   A frontier, but one so hauntingly close as to still feel a part
of daily life. At just 350 feet down, the men stuck on the Kursk
were tantalizingly near to safety last week, even as storms and
rough seas frustrated rescue efforts. If the Washington monument
were standing at that depth, only two-thirds of it would be under
water.
</P>
<P>
   What also sticks so hard in many people's hearts is a sense of
the courage and ingenuity of the men who volunteer to serve on
what, as some like to point out in happier times, are the only
ships that are actually designed to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Through frantic depth-charge scenes in World War II movies, many
people are attracted to the strong, and enviable, bond that unites
so many of these men when danger strikes. When the alarm bells ring
on a submarine, ``You have to be able to rely on the first man who
comes to the scene to do what needs to be done,'' said Carlisle
A.H. Trost, a retired admiral and a former chief of naval
operations.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a young submarine officer during the Cold War, Trost
and several of his mates were briefly overcome by gases while
disengaging a torpedo that had suddenly begun to ignite. Partly as
a result of the common risk of such accidents, he said, there also
is ``a bond of camaraderie'' between American and Russian
submariners, a sense of brotherhood, that always transcended the
antagonisms between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the allure has been deepened by new revelations about
this formerly secret world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the Cold War, the use of submarines for
spying has been cloaked under the tightest secrecy. And it is only
in the last few years that some of those exploits have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines, for instance, have spent lots of time off
Russian naval ports, waiting to intercept radio communications and
check out the capabilities of each new class of Russian missile
boats. The stakes were high. The goal of these submarines was
nothing less than to avoid another Pearl Harbor, a surprise attack
in the much deadlier age of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the United States also sent a few specially
equipped submarines into Soviet seas to dispatch divers, who tapped
into underwater communications cables and retrieved pieces of
Soviet test missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this heroism, it has only been at the time of
accidents like the Kursk sinking that the public has had a chance
to peer inside this hidden world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy lost two nuclear-powered submarines, the USS
Thresher and the USS Scorpion, in the 1960s. The Scorpion sank in
an accident on the way home from the Mediterranean, and no one
realized it in time to stop family members from waiting for her on
a rainy dock in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have suffered far greater calamity, losing more
than 500 men in submarine accidents over the last 40 years,
according to the newspaper Izvestia. The loss of the Kursk is
particularly poignant because many of the men were in their 20s and
the submarine was not on a risky military adventure, but simply
taking part in a training cruise. And the exercise, the largest in
recent years, seems to have been held as much for political reasons
as for tactical ones, in a forlorn bid to recapture some of the
Russian navy's former power and glory.

<P>
   There is a famous bit of publishing lore about how Tom Clancy's
first novel, ``The Hunt for Red October,'' caught on in the
mid-1980s. President Reagan read the tale of submarine disaster and
derring-do and mentioned publicly that it was mesmerizing. The
novel, published by the tiny Naval Institute Press, quickly became
a runaway best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's instincts for pure and simple drama catapulted Clancy
to fame. But they also help explain why the world has been so
transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in the
Barents Sea and the desperate attempts to reach the 118 men either
trapped or dead inside. At week's end, rescue attempts were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that tales of sea adventure and calamity have
always held deep appeal, and best sellers like ``The Perfect
Storm'' and movies like ``Titanic,'' ``Das Boot'' and ``U-571''
have tapped into that fascination. But what is it about the sea _
and especially submarines _ that often makes the drama of those
trapped below the waves resonate more than similar disasters on
land, like mine cave-ins?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that for all the advances in science, the
sea remains a mysterious _ and mystical _ force. Since the 1960s,
every achievement in the space program has been covered so minutely
by the news media that outer space has a familiar feel. But once
you slip below the ocean's waves, you enter a dark, unpredictable
and often claustrophobic world that, in some ways, rivals space as
the final frontier.
</P>
<P>
   A frontier, but one so hauntingly close as to still feel a part
of daily life. At just 350 feet down, the men stuck on the Kursk
were tantalizingly near to safety last week, even as storms and
rough seas frustrated rescue efforts. If the Washington monument
were standing at that depth, only two-thirds of it would be under
water.
</P>
<P>
   What also sticks so hard in many people's hearts is a sense of
the courage and ingenuity of the men who volunteer to serve on
what, as some like to point out in happier times, are the only
ships that are actually designed to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Through frantic depth-charge scenes in World War II movies, many
people are attracted to the strong, and enviable, bond that unites
so many of these men when danger strikes. When the alarm bells ring
on a submarine, ``You have to be able to rely on the first man who
comes to the scene to do what needs to be done,'' said Carlisle
A.H. Trost, a retired admiral and a former chief of naval
operations.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a young submarine officer during the Cold War, Trost
and several of his mates were briefly overcome by gases while
disengaging a torpedo that had suddenly begun to ignite. Partly as
a result of the common risk of such accidents, he said, there also
is ``a bond of camaraderie'' between American and Russian
submariners, a sense of brotherhood, that always transcended the
antagonisms between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the allure has been deepened by new revelations about
this formerly secret world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the Cold War, the use of submarines for
spying has been cloaked under the tightest secrecy. And it is only
in the last few years that some of those exploits have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines, for instance, have spent lots of time off
Russian naval ports, waiting to intercept radio communications and
check out the capabilities of each new class of Russian missile
boats. The stakes were high. The goal of these submarines was
nothing less than to avoid another Pearl Harbor, a surprise attack
in the much deadlier age of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the United States also sent a few specially
equipped submarines into Soviet seas to dispatch divers, who tapped
into underwater communications cables and retrieved pieces of
Soviet test missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this heroism, it has only been at the time of
accidents like the Kursk sinking that the public has had a chance
to peer inside this hidden world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy lost two nuclear-powered submarines, the USS
Thresher and the USS Scorpion, in the 1960s. The Scorpion sank in
an accident on the way home from the Mediterranean, and no one
realized it in time to stop family members from waiting for her on
a rainy dock in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have suffered far greater calamity, losing more
than 500 men in submarine accidents over the last 40 years,
according to the newspaper Izvestia. The loss of the Kursk is
particularly poignant because many of the men were in their 20s and
the submarine was not on a risky military adventure, but simply
taking part in a training cruise. And the exercise, the largest in
recent years, seems to have been held as much for political reasons
as for tactical ones, in a forlorn bid to recapture some of the
Russian navy's former power and glory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the image of men possibly huddled in the hull,
banging for attention as the air turned foul and the sea churned
through their sub, that will linger most.

NEW HAMPSHIRE TOWN CREATES A LITTLE LEAGUE POWERHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ When the all-star team from this town on the
outskirts of Manchester won the Eastern Regional Championship on
Thursday night in Bristol, Conn., and a ticket to the Little League
World Series, it was hard to tell who was more excited _ the 11-
and 12-year-olds who mobbed their pitcher on the mound or the
parents in the grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Mark Collins, the vice president of the league
and the father of the pitcher, Ben Collins, said over and over.
``This was David and Goliath and we won. Unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stunned reactions of the parents and coaches from
Goffstown, the team's 1-0 victory over a team from the Bronx was no
fluke. It had as much to do with the efforts of adults in the
stands as with their children on the field. Coaches and league
officials say it capped a five-year campaign to make their team a
national contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go out there and teach them the game,'' the
manager of the team, Frank Szumiesz, said. ``But fun is not only
playing the sport. It's striving to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on a mission for the last five years to get to where
we are,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Szumiesz said a core group of league officials decided in 1995
that they wanted their league to become a contender for the state
championship. They were spurred on by their rivalry with
neighboring Bedford, which won the state title in 1993 and went to
the Little League World Series. The Goffstown coaches went to
school on more successful programs in New Hampshire, borrowing
drills and coaching tips and adopting voluntary indoor practices in
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at some of the other towns that had quality programs
and we weren't afraid to ask questions,'' one of the Goffstown
coaches, Phil Bradley, said.
</P>
<P>
   The league also expanded and improved its five fields, which had
been built years before. Three years ago, the organizers drummed up
about $20,000 in donations from local businesses to put lights on
one field to allow for later practices and night games.
</P>
<P>
   They also set up a Web site for coaches, referring them to the
latest information on coaching baseball and sent some coaches to
Little League seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely has been a concerted effort,'' said Collins,
40, a physical therapist who has coached his son Ben's teams for
eight years. ``We have a great group of talented kids, but for us
to get to this point a lot of other factors went into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important change was to begin pushing the best
players to work on fundamentals outside the baseball season. ``You
have to be concerned with baseball all year round,'' said Bradley,
a 53-year-old Federal Aviation Administration employee.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, many of the boys on the championship
team have spent every Sunday morning from January until April at an
indoor practice facility, built in an old Manchester mill, called
Good Rips. (It helped that one of its owners was Tom French, a
coach whose son, Tom, is on the all-star team.) On snow-covered
mornings, the core of the team arrived at 7:30 a.m. to practice
their swings in eight batting cages and hone their pitching
techniques on two indoor dirt mounds. They also performed fielding
drills, snapping up ground balls and throwing into socklike targets
representing first base. Those weeks of extra work, while
voluntary, proved invaluable, the coaches said.
</P>
<P>
   The league has also used school gyms in the winter for fielding
and pitching seminars. League officials even tried a fall program
two years ago, but found the players were getting burned out and
dropped the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Little League baseball has been helped by the absence of other
strong sports programs in Goffstown, a community of 15,600. The
youth hockey program started only a year ago, and soccer has not
caught on here as it has in other towns.
</P>
<P>
   The local high school lacks a football team, but it won state
championships this year in basketball and baseball. The girls' high
school softball program has also chalked up several state titles.
One Goffstown resident, Morris Allard, built a private stadium for
the state Babe Ruth baseball championships.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is so ingrained in the local fabric that the town holds
a parade, complete with marching bands and a barbecue, for the
opening day of the Little League and Babe Ruth League seasons. On
Friday nights, the Little League games are often well attended by
people who do not have children on the teams, but come out for an
evening of baseball and the simple pleasure of a hot dog from the
concession stand. The league has more than 100 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring, the whole town turns to baseball,'' Bradley
said. ``It's hard to emphasize how special baseball is in
Goffstown.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident Friday along the main street where business
owners were putting up banners congratulating the team. ``People
are so excited,'' said Robbie Grady, who oversees a program helping
to refurbish the town center. ``I've had several phone calls Friday
saying we need to do a parade. How are we going to do this? It was
the talk of the local coffee shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady said support for the Little League program was part of a
larger trend of civic-minded efforts in Goffstown. For example,
residents recently raised $200,000 to pay for the treatment of a
13-year-old boy, Evan Kavenell, who had a rare form of brain
cancer. .
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is a bedroom community for Manchester, Goffstown
is not a run-of-the-mill suburb of tract housing and strip malls.
The residents include bricklayers and stonemasons and
high-technology executives. The town is carved out of the hilly
forested country east of Manchester and includes the Uncanoonuc
Mountains. The Piscatoquog River runs through the heart of town,
green, deep and cold.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of Goffstown is the quaint row of Colonial buildings
and churches around the commons. Although some of the buildings
need painting, Goffstown's center brings to mind an idyllic New
England hamlet where baseball would surely be played on grass in
the golden dusk as it was meant to be, with the whack of horsehide
on wood and cleats stirring up the dust.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of town is Pinardville, a nondescript
commercial strip of shopping malls and supermarkets just across the
river from the old textile mills of Manchester. In between lies the
New Hampshire State Prison for Women.
</P>
<P>
   The Goffstown Junior Baseball fields are just down the road from
the prison, sandwiched between the main road and a gash of forest,
opposite a power substation. On the outfield fences are signs of
local sponsors: True Value Hardware, Blue Ribbon Fencing, J&AMP;G
Roofing, Goffstown Auto Parts.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the effort that parents have made, Goffstown has not
poured money into its baseball program like some Little League
powerhouses. Toms River, N.J., spent more than $308,000 on a new
field and an indoor practice facility. That team won the world
series in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the baseball program here has become a powerhouse, in
part by people working together. The Goffstown group going to
Williamsport, Pa., for the Little League World Series, which begins
Sunday, has been playing together for five years. As 10-year-olds,
they were champions of the New Hampshire Little League Division I
and were runners-up for the state championship.

WOMEN RAISE THE BAR TO HIGHEST LEVEL FOR SYDNEY OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila was always a bit of a daredevil. She competed on
the high school rodeo circuit in Northern California and, entering
junior college in 1992, became intrigued by the risk and the
airborne gymnastics of the pole vault. It was a relatively new
event for women, however, and the first male pole-vaulter she
consulted suggested she could not clear the gender bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if I could try it one day at practice,'' Dragila
said. ``He just looked at me and said: `Women can't do that. They
just don't have the upper-body strength. They are not made to do
it.' I took it to heart that, OK, this is one of those things that
women just don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the urging of her coach, Dragila reconsidered in 1993 at
Idaho State University. Seven years later, the women's pole vault
is among track and field's most engaging events, and Dragila is the
world record-holder at 15 feet 2 and a quarter inches. She is a
gold-medal favorite at the 2000 Summer Games, which begin Sept. 15
in Sydney, Australia, where her event will make its Olympic debut
for women.
</P>
<P>
   When the modern Olympics began in 1896, women were not allowed
to participate. Times have changed, grudgingly but significantly,
in the 20th century. In Sydney, more women will compete in more
sports, and in more events, than ever. About 4,400 women, or 42
percent of the 10,500 competing athletes, will participate, up from
3,626 at the 1996 Atlanta Games. And for the first time, women will
compete in the same number of team sports as men.
</P>
<P>
   The gains go beyond numbers, however, as women continue to
penetrate the boundaries of previously male-only events that
require great strength and endurance. The sports added for women
this year are weight lifting, triathlon, tae kwon do and modern
pentathlon, and new competitions in multidiscipline sports include
water polo in the aquatics category and the hammer throw and pole
vault in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Sydney will offer a grand stage for a generation of
women who have reaped the benefits of Title IX, followed the lead
of individual stars and team champions and carved out an even
larger presence for women in the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're worthy of being a medal event at the Olympics,''
Dragila said. ``We've shown we can take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Girls are starting to come up to me. They are
encouraged because they know I came to this so late in my career.
They know anything is possible if they put their heart to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will athletes like Dragila increase the profile of
women in the Sydney Games, but the overriding athletic story there
will also be a woman's story _ the attempt by Marion Jones of the
United States to become the first female track-and-field athlete to
win five gold medals in one Olympics. Jones has been heavily
marketed and promoted over the last year, and both Jones and
Dragila have been featured in television commercials leading up to
Sydney. A 17-year-old from the United States, Cheryl Haworth, who
is 5 foot 9 and 308 pounds, is a gold-medal favorite in weight
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Olympic officials and sponsors are paying more
attention to female athletes, especially after last summer's
Women's World Cup of soccer _ the largest sporting event ever for
women _ filled up large stadiums in the United States and ended any
doubt that people in large numbers would pay to watch women play
team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soccer team showed that, a generation after Title IX,
women's sports are here to stay,'' said Maureen O'Toole, who is
considered the greatest female water-polo player ever and who will
make her initial Olympic appearance in Sydney at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by criticism that the gold-medal success of American women
in softball and soccer was reduced to highlight footage at the
Atlanta Olympics, NBC, which will pay $3.5 billion to broadcast the
next five Olympic Games, will show every minute of the women's
soccer and softball matches on network or cable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been battered recently by scandals involving
corruption and performance-enhancing drugs, the president of the
International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, can
include as one of his greatest successes the increased
participation of women as athletes and officials in the Olympic
movement.
</P>
<P>
   He named the first female member of the IOC in 1981; today 13 of
the 113 delegates are women. Four years ago, Samaranch proposed
that women should hold at least 10 percent of the decision-making
positions in the IOC, every national Olympic committee and
international sports federations by 2000, with the number rising to
20 percent by 2005. These goals may seem meager by American
standards, but they represent significant progress in many
countries where women's roles are diminished or dismissed for
cultural and religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appointed women IOC members for the first time and we
solved a very important problem, the participation of women in the
Games,'' Samaranch said in a recent interview. ``But we still have
a problem; that is, the presence of women in leading positions
running sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, women have hardly reached a level of parity with men in
the Olympic movement. Forty-eight names were proposed recently for
14 new positions as IOC members, and none of them were women.

<P>
   Opportunities are coming more quickly on the playing fields, on
the track and in the pool. O'Toole will finally have a chance to
display before a worldwide audience her seminal skills in women's
water polo. After playing internationally since 1978, she retired
in 1994 to teach physical education and coach in Northern
California, believing her career would never have the validation of
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   She would apparently have to be satisfied with decades of
success achieved in anonymity, when the American team slept on pool
tables in a bar in the Netherlands and traveled from Italy to Malta
on a fishing trawler because there was no money for more
extravagant travel. The entire team bunked at her house during
summer training in the early days, and pool time was limited for
female players to 6 to 9 in the morning and 8 to 11 at night.
</P>
<P>
   When women's water polo was added to the Sydney schedule in
1997, O'Toole quickly came out of retirement. Still, there is no
big money in the sport. Even with a training stipend from the U.S.
Olympic Committee and a pair of sponsors, she has struggled to make
ends meet. For a year, O'Toole has lived with her mother in
Huntington Beach, Calif., to train with the American team and has
traveled home to the Bay Area to see her 8-year-old daughter,
Kelly, and her boyfriend on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first world championship was in '78 in Berlin, but it was
only a demonstration sport, not official,'' O'Toole said. ``They
had no hotel rooms for us. We had to sit around the lobby for three
or four hours. It was almost embarrassing. We worked as hard as
other athletes and put the same amount of time in, but we weren't
an Olympic sport, so no one cared about us. Being an Olympic sport
makes a difference. It really validates us.''
</P>
<P>
   As she watched American women achieve thorough success at the
Atlanta Games, Jennifer Gutierrez of Denver said she never dreamed
she would compete in Sydney in the inaugural Olympic triathlon,
which will include a one-mile swim, a 24-mile bike ride and a
6.2-mile run. A former champion swimmer at Pepperdine University,
Gutierrez took up the triathlon for fitness training in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Early success, and the realization that the sport would be
included in the Sydney Olympics, encouraged Gutierrez to increase
her training from 15 to 25 hours a week, which she has fit in
around her job teaching physical education to handicapped children.
She swims from 5:30 to 7:30 each morning, runs 6 miles on her lunch
break and bikes in the evening. She postponed her honeymoon for two
years until the completion of the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having your sport in the Olympics raises the whole level of
competition,'' said Gutierrez, who is 33. ``You make sacrifices you
wouldn't make in everyday life to get to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't taken my honeymoon. But now I know what it
takes to be an athlete at a high level. I can appreciate the effort
of these athletes, whether they are in first place or last.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Ellerbe, a native of Brooklyn who has been over 6 feet tall
since the eighth grade, threw the shot-put and discus in high
school , then reluctantly attempted the hammer throw at the
University of South Carolina. The first time she grabbed the
9-pound ball by its 3-foot-long wire, spun several times and
launched the hammer, she fell down. She has ruined more than a few
suitcases, traveling with four or five of the hammers to each meet,
and has had to shovel snow off the hammer-throwing ring to train at
the University of Wyoming, where she received her master's degree
in communications and is now an assistant coach. But her
perseverance has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, the 6-foot-2, 240-pound Ellerbe has won five national
championships in the hammer throw, has set the American record of
231 feet 2 inches and has established herself as a medal candidate
in Sydney. Her event and others will provide girls with a chance to
see mature women competing, Ellerbe noted, in contrast to the
prepubescent images of gymnasts and figure skaters frequently
broadcast at the Summer and Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When younger girls see a gymnast or an ice skater, they think
it's a fantasy: `I can't do that after I'm 22.''' she said. ``I
think this will show them that you can be a scholar too, and get an
education while competing in athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of the new Olympic events for women is the pole
vault. It is an evolving sport, and thus a world record is possible
at every major competition. The pole vault also evokes danger,
strength and acrobatic grace as women plant a 14-foot pole and
invert themselves in midair to clear a bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a little bit sexist, you've got good-looking girls and
an X-Games mentality,'' said Dave Nielsen, who coaches Dragila in
Pocatello, Idaho. A former vaulter, he began trying to get women
interested in the pole vault in hopes that gender equity could stem
the erosion of the event because of the expense, the threat of
injury, rising insurance costs and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having women involved would be leverage to keep the event,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila, 29, grew up in Auburn, Calif., and competed in
goat-tying competitions in high school rodeos, dismounting from her
horse, flipping the goat and binding its legs with rope. She was
recruited to college as a heptathlete, the female version of the
decathlon, which requires skill in running, throwing and jumping.
The pole vault was something that few women had ever tried, and
Dragila started gingerly at a height of 6 feet, a full 10 inches
below the women's world record in the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it pole-vaulting, just holding on for dear
life and getting over the bar,'' Dragila said. ``Getting on the
runway in '93 was very awkward. Trying to hold the pole, run with
it and plant it in this stupid little box, then trying to jump off
the ground and turn yourself over was very frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in the air was disorienting, she said, and she was never
sure if she was going to land on her back, her feet or her neck. So
she began training at a gymnastics school to gain awareness of her
body in the air. A year later, she improved to 10 feet. Last
summer, the 5-7, 140-pound Dragila won the inaugural world
championship for women, clearing 15-1. She believes a 17-foot jump
for women is possible, and would be the equivalent of a 20-foot
jump for men, who possess more speed and upper-body strength.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila has also generated attention by posing nude with other
American women for a track-and-field calendar, saying it is a sign
of progress that women are confident enough in their bodies to
expose them as figures of strength and power instead of
titillation. Other athletes, officials and feminists disagree,
saying women are still conforming to societal pressure to prove
that they are feminine when they sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of the event, female vaulters are still
attempting to clear the bar of equality. When Dragila won the 1999
world championship last August in Seville, Spain, tying what was
then the world record, she received only half the $60,000 prize
money available to male vaulters. Looking ahead to Sydney, she

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BATTLES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Different spellings of Rivellino and Rivelino in last
graf are correct.) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rivellino Jones of the misspelled name was refereeing
a soccer game in Manhattan last week, a moral victory for coach
Marty Jacobson. Perhaps those other embattled friends of
thelipsite(at)aol.com, Linda Bensel-Meyers and Billy Bean, could
take heart from Jake, although hang in there is almost always the
hardest advice to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers, the whistle-blower at the University of
Tennessee, is facing the start of a football season in which she
has been portrayed as the Volunteers' most dangerous opponent. The
team has just started practicing and Bensel-Meyers has already
informed the NCAA of three freshman players who turned in
remarkably similar compositions. She calls it institutional
plagiarism and blames it on the mores of the university rather than
on the athletes or tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Knoxville call it harassing the program. The NCAA
might not even find it in violation of whatever it is that concerns
that trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers has been decrying, for some time now, what she
sees as the exploitation of athletes and the subversion of the
humanistic values of the academy. A professor of Renaissance
literature and drama, she is also in charge of the first-year
composition program. She is only recently being heard beyond the
world of the Orange.
</P>
<P>
   In what I found the most cynical and clear-eyed approach to the
issue, Frank Cagle, the managing editor of The Knoxville
News-Sentinel, simply brushed it off. He wrote that the ``fate of
the football team has a deep impact on the morale, the business and
the general economy of East Tennessee'' and that what might be
construed as corruption in college sports was a ``national scandal,
not a local one. And it requires a national solution.'' In other
words, keeping our boys eligible by any means necessary is a
priority not to be tampered with unless every other school goes
honest, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers is idealistic and fuzzy-minded; she sees
universities using a bottom-line corporate model in which athletes
are resources. Even the coaches and athletic administrators end up
being victimized, especially if they don't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate problem is how do I avoid being cast as a
harridan because I harp on the issue,'' she said last week. ``The
administration's problem is that you can't put the peel back on the
orange once you see what's underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean, an outfielder whose six major league seasons on three
teams were haunted by the secret of his homosexuality, has decided
he wants to be back in baseball, the binding thread of his life
since childhood. Since he used his sports background to build
functioning teams in two restaurants, he thinks he can use his
business background in a front office. He would offer a rare
combination of experience and skills, as well as a test of sports'
institutional homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   His open, often moving description of life in a major league
closet last year in a front-page story in The New York Times led to
a number of speaking engagements and television appearances. In
talking about baseball, he realized he had not resolved that
critical part of his life; he had left before his career was over.
Even now, at 35, he tries to stay in playing shape and appear
regularly on talk radio; he is still gripping the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bean is in the process of selling his current Miami Beach
restaurant, Mayya, and writing to baseball club executives. He said
last week that he understands that a team would have to be
``courageous'' to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jake's message has always been simple: Don't quit. A
recovering drug abuser long clean, a soccer coach in a basketball
culture, an advocate for kids among clock-watching bureaucrats,
Jacobson's saga has been struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when his Martin Luther King Jr. High School team won
the first of its three straight city championships, mostly with
recent immigrants from the West Indies and West Africa, Jake has
been controversial in and out of his school. He was suspended from
coaching for 11 months last year when rival coaches accused several
of his players of being ineligible. He was reinstated and
vindicated, although his team lost in last year's championship
final.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bensel-Meyers, he is self-righteous and insistent on
putting the needs of the individual student ahead of the
institution. Like Bean, his charm masks a willingness to work
harder than most. And like them both, he has a larger vision. Jake
thinks the future of American soccer will rise from the cities.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the New York City Parks Department's inspired
partnership with the Parmalat milk company finished its six-week
Summer of Soccer 2000 Saturday. On weekday nights in Riverside Park
in Manhattan and Flushing Meadow-Corona Park in Queens, youngsters
played six-on-six games under the supervision of parkies and soccer
coaches and college players like Rivellino Jones. Jacobson ran the
Manhattan program, which included washing the mesh scrimmage vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that passion,'' he crowed last week as teen-agers from
Senegal and Brazil and Trinidad stormed up and down the turf with
bursts of heart-stopping athleticism. ``This is going to be the
urban game. These kids are going to be our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivellino Jones, 22, named for Roberto Rivelino, the Brazilian
star, is a symbol of that future. As a 16-year-old Trinidadian
overwhelmed by homesickness and a huge, chaotic high school, Jones
found his new roots at midfield on the King varsity. He was on
Jake's first title team and expects to graduate from Medgar Evers
College this year. He says he wants to be a public school guidance
counselor and coach. Like Jake.

   NEW YORK _ In her 1965 review of ``The Sound of Music'' for The
New York Herald Tribune, Judith Crist wrote, ``The movie is for the
5-to-7 set and their mommies who think their kids aren't up to the
stinging sophistication and biting wit of `Mary Poppins.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the highest grossing film musical of all time
approaches its 35th anniversary, it is about to begin yet another
life _ this time as official, rather than accidental, kitsch. .
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 6, ``Sing-a-Long Sound of Music,'' the audience
participation version of the movie that has been playing to
delirious crowds at the Prince Charles Cinema in London, will make
its debut in New York at the Ziegfeld Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The basic premise is simple: During such deathless Rodgers and
Hammerstein standards as ``Sixteen Going On Seventeen,'' ``So Long,
Farewell'' and ``Climb Ev'ry Mountain,'' moviegoers sing along to
the lyrics, which appear on the screen as subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Singing along, however, is just one of the evening's many
opportunities for self-expression. In London, when Julie Andrews'
fellow nuns ask, ``How do you solve a problem like Maria?'' the
crowd holds up postcards printed with question marks. When Captain
von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) first kisses Maria, they let loose
a hail of party poppers.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees wear nuns' habits and lederhosen; others dress as
Nazis, the Alps (covered in shaving cream) and as representations
of song lyrics _ like wild geese, with cutouts of the moon mounted
on their wings, as described in ``My Favorite Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Fink, a spokesman for the Rodgers and Hammerstein
Organization, which controls the copyright on the composers' music
and lyrics, thinks such strenuous glee is, for the English, the
adult equivalent of the breathless outbursts at traditional English
Punch and Judy shows. Example: when Julie Andrews cannot find
material to make play clothes for the von Trapp tykes, the audience
yells, ``The curtains, Maria!''
</P>
<P>
   In July, home-grown performances were mounted in Boston and
Austin, Texas. Charmian Carr, who portrayed the eldest von Trapp
daughter, Liesl, was the guest of honor in Austin. Carr, the author
of ``Forever Liesl: A Memoir of the Sound of Music'' (Viking,
2000), recalled that during one scene in which Plummer tenderly
touched Andrews' nose, a chant of ``Get the booger, captain!''
arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hysterical,'' she said. ``There were 1,300 people and
they were sitting in the aisles. It was sacrilegious, but great
fun. It could just be that there are so many people who really do
love the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more cynical. Crist, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's so popular because the world has come to realize
what a really godawful thing the film is,'' she said. ``In 35 years
it's become even sappier. There's a point where it's so bad that it
becomes funny.''
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Mommie Dearest'' and ``Valley of the Dolls,'' this
camp aspect of ``Sing-a-Long Sound of Music'' has made it a hit
with gay viewers. The production began as an entry in the London
Lesbian and Gay Film Festival; the Austin Gay and Lesbian
International Film Festival co-produced the Texas event to benefit
Project Transitions, a nonprofit group that provides hospice care
and housing for AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought it would be fun,'' said Charlotte Hale, the
executive director of Project Transitions. ``Certainly the gay
community liked it, but a lot of mainstream people were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the show is being dizzily promoted as all-family
entertainment. ``Wave your edelweiss!'' reads a press release.
``Cheer the von Trapp kids! Bark at Rolf (the telegram boy)! Boo
the Nazis! Hiss the baroness!''
</P>
<P>
   Camp aside, the movie also seems to have a powerful emotional
effect on a lot of apparently normal people. Even ushers at the
singalongs have been seen to choke up during the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the countless renderings of ``Do-Re-Mi'' and ``My
Favorite Things'' in grade school and in Muzak-filled elevators
have left permanent musical saccharine deposits in the collective
consciousness. Perhaps, like the Kevin Bacon Game, ``Sing-a-Long
Sound of Music'' was a form of cinemania just waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenneth Tynan said that movies are the most dominant
repository of memory we have,'' said the film critic Andrew Sarris.
``I suppose this is just a manifestation of that. Everyone
remembers `The Sound of Music.' You can blast it but you can't
obliterate it, I guess.''

   In Vice President Al Gore's campaign to change his robotic
image, nothing may have helped more than the big smooch. Gore
stepped on stage at the Democratic Convention on Thursday and
greeted his wife, Tipper, with a quick embrace and a kiss on the
lips. But instead of letting go, as nice politicians are supposed
to, he wrapped her tighter in his arms, closed his eyes and gave
her a full-mouthed kiss that lasted a exceptionally long time.
(Actually three seconds; we have tapes; we've counted.)
</P>
<P>
   When he remembered where he was _ on national television about
to accept his party's nomination for president _ he backed away and
went on with his business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he could not really have forgotten the cameras for a
second, and soon commentators were speculating about how calculated
the kiss was. Mrs. Gore had spent days on the talk show circuit
trying to humanize her husband's image, after all. And here was the
living proof of his humanity, and a photograph the papers couldn't
resist.
</P>
<P>
   The next day MSNBC had two people on the case. Chip Reid
reported that he had interviewed the Gores' daughter, Karenna Gore
Schiff, who told him that kind of kissing goes on around the house
all the time. He did not report whether the Gore children had spent
much of their youth saying, ``Yuck! Mom! Dad!''
</P>
<P>
   More substantively, Claire Shipman of NBC speculated to Don Imus
that the kiss sent a message. It signaled that Al Gore (unlike some
presidents we know) is a faithful husband. Excellent point; imagine
what would have happened if the Clintons had dared such a scene.
Though some viewers were charmed by the Gore kiss and others
squirmed, no one doubted that it was based on reality. There you
have what really makes it seem odd. The kiss struck everyone as a
political gesture based on truth, and nothing is rarer than that.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the kiss had an old-fashioned, romantic innocence. It
resembled the moment at a wedding when the groom is asked to kiss
the bride and the guests can only wonder: Will he give her a chaste
little peck or go for it? In an earlier era, the full-mouthed
bridal kiss said, ``We can have sex now, we're married.'' Among the
list of promises Gore made in his speech, the ultimate promise may
have been the one he sent with body language: to restore
All-American marital sex to the White House.

   This baseball season has witnessed a record number of hit
batters and bench-clearing brawls, but so far nothing to match the
most horrifying clash in the sport's history. The racial tensions
and tumultuous politics of the 1960s intruded on baseball 35 years
ago Tuesday with a shock that many fans recall vividly today.
</P>
<P>
   What people remember is the violence. They do not recall, if
they ever knew, the politics that fueled it. On Aug. 22, 1965, the
Los Angeles Dodgers were playing the San Francisco Giants in a
crucial game at Candlestick Park during perhaps the most bitterly
contested pennant race in National League history. No other
incentive would have been needed to pack the ballpark in a game
between the two oldest rivals in the National League, but this one
had the added allure of a marquee matchup between the league's best
pitchers: the Giants' Juan Marichal and the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ace was at his best that day, and by the third inning
the score was 2-1, Los Angeles _ a typical score for a nine-inning
Marichal-Koufax match. Marichal, who was not averse to throwing
inside, knocked down Ron Fairly and Maury Wills. Koufax, who
disliked brush-back pitches he was afraid might kill someone, was
pressured by his catcher, John Roseboro, to retaliate with a
high-and-inside fastball when Marichal came to bat. On the next
pitch, low and inside, Roseboro dropped the ball and picked it up
behind Marichal. He then threw it back to Koufax, barely missing
Marichal's head. Marichal thought it was closer than that; he would
forever claim that the ball nicked his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roseboro was sending him a message,'' says Charles Einstein, a
biographer of Willie Mays and a collaborator on Marichal's
biography. Whatever message Roseboro sent, Marichal didn't like it.
He spun around, bat in hand, and began screaming: ``Why you do
that? Why you do that?'' (Einstein said some choice Spanish terms
were sprinkled in as well.)
</P>
<P>
   What has been excised from our collective memory of the incident
is that it was Roseboro who charged Marichal, not the other way
around. For most of the 42,000-plus crowd, the first indication
that something was wrong came when they saw Marichal smashing
Roseboro's head with his bat. Blood immediately began to flow from
a deep scalp wound; to many stunned onlookers it appeared as if
Roseboro's eye had been knocked out. Players and coaches on both
teams rushed toward home plate. Willie Mays, a close friend of
Roseboro's, got there first. He immediately grabbed the Dodger
catcher, partly to protect him and partly, as he later revealed, to
keep him from attacking Marichal. As Mays led Roseboro off the
field he cradled his bleeding head and moaned, ``Johnny, Johnny,
I'm so sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   When order was finally restored, a shaken Koufax walked the next
two hitters and then gave up a three-run homer to Mays, giving the
Giants a 4-2 victory. They may not have realized it that night, but
the Giants season was over. Marichal, 19-9 before the incident,
lost three of his last four decisions after coming back from an
eight-day suspension, which was seen as remarkably light. (Marichal
was also fined $1,750 by the league.)
</P>
<P>
   Brawls in the 1960s were nearly as common as today. Back then,
many fights were caused by batters retaliating against pitchers,
who were permitted a great deal of leeway in moving hitters off the
plate. But no one could recall a fight in which a player attacked
another player with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Marichal-Roseboro clash was all the more shocking because
the men's behavior was entirely uncharacteristic. Roseboro, 32, was
a solid, levelheaded player, and Marichal, 27, whose nickname was
the Dominican Dandy, had a reputation as an amiable practical joker
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The sports media characterized the incident as racial, but in
fact no racial antagonism survived it. What happened was the result
of off-the-field pressures catching two ordinary men in an
extraordinary situation. Roseboro, who later admitted to provoking
the incident, was distraught, as were many other black players,
over the mass disturbances that had been sweeping through Watts in
his home city, Los Angeles. ``It was really the year I came of
age,'' he said later. ``It was the first time I began to pick up a
paper and skip the sports section altogether. Much of the time I
was on the field I had to keep reminding myself that baseball was
important. I'd wake up in the morning and say to myself, `Why are
they playing games? Why can't we do something about Watts and the
people who live there?'''
</P>
<P>
   Marichal had even more to think about. His native country, the
Dominican Republic, was locked in a bloody civil war, and Marichal
found himself rushing to the phone every day to check the fortunes
of friends and family, particularly those of another Juan Marichal,
his cousin, a politician who would become vice president the
following year. ``Thinking back on it,'' Willie Mays said a few
years ago, ``I really don't think Juan should have been playing at
all. He was pretty strung out, full of fear and anger, and holding
it inside. How can you tell a city and a team that they have to
lose a pennant because of problems they don't know about happening
thousands of miles away?''
</P>
<P>
   Summing it up years later, Roseboro said: ``For millions of
Americans, the pennant race was a diversion from the problems that
were sweeping over the country. For some of us, it was just one
more huge burden.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marichal, it was a burden that continued long after his
playing days. Though he won more games than any other pitcher in
the 1960s, he was snubbed for the Hall of Fame in 1981, his first
year of eligibility, then again in 1982. He might not have made it
in 1983 if not for a public campaign by Roseboro. A grateful
Marichal thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills may have hit on the moral of the story several years
ago when he said, ``Next time you see a ballplayer go a little nuts
on the field, consider that he just might have as many
off-the-field problems as you have.''

<P>
   This baseball season has witnessed a record number of hit
batters and bench-clearing brawls, but so far nothing to match the
most horrifying clash in the sport's history. The racial tensions
and tumultuous politics of the 1960s intruded on baseball 35 years
ago Tuesday with a shock that many fans recall vividly today.
</P>
<P>
   What people remember is the violence. They do not recall, if
they ever knew, the politics that fueled it. On Aug. 22, 1965, the
Los Angeles Dodgers were playing the San Francisco Giants in a
crucial game at Candlestick Park during perhaps the most bitterly
contested pennant race in National League history. No other
incentive would have been needed to pack the ballpark in a game
between the two oldest rivals in the National League, but this one
had the added allure of a marquee matchup between the league's best
pitchers: the Giants' Juan Marichal and the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ace was at his best that day, and by the third inning
the score was 2-1, Los Angeles _ a typical score for a nine-inning
Marichal-Koufax match. Marichal, who was not averse to throwing
inside, knocked down Ron Fairly and Maury Wills. Koufax, who
disliked brush-back pitches he was afraid might kill someone, was
pressured by his catcher, John Roseboro, to retaliate with a
high-and-inside fastball when Marichal came to bat. On the next
pitch, low and inside, Roseboro dropped the ball and picked it up
behind Marichal. He then threw it back to Koufax, barely missing
Marichal's head. Marichal thought it was closer than that; he would
forever claim that the ball nicked his ear.

He spun around, bat in hand, and began screaming: ``Why you do

CLINTON, CEDING SPOTLIGHT TO THE CANDIDATES, VACATIONS IN THE
ADIRONDACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ CNN has a correspondent and crew in place,
just in case news breaks out in the woods. The other networks are
following along as well, betting on the proposition that President
Clinton, even while on vacation, will not be able to resist a
camera and boom mike in his face.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's public schedule Saturday was as clear as the
summer skies here, and the reporters who follow him everywhere were
advised by presidential aides, who meant no disrespect, to go take
a hike. As if to prove that he is fully capable of ceding the
spotlight to his vice president, Clinton has literally headed for
the hills for a few days of vacation in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   He has been horse riding, golfing and celebrating his 54th
birthday with his wife and daughter _ all outside the view of the
media. The plan is to lie low and allow Vice President Al Gore and
his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman to take center stage for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   But the president has not exactly disappeared. Saturday, he
signed the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act, which finances
the administration's worldwide response to those diseases, and the
White House broadcast his radio address on the subject that he had
taped in Washington before arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   Also, clad in the brown suede jacket he wears whenever he is
roughing it, Clinton stood at the side of Hillary Rodham Clinton at
a Friday night rally for her Senate bid and spoke, albeit briefly,
on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that even though five months remain in his
presidency, things have changed now that Gore has been officially
been tapped as the next Democratic presidential nominee. Clinton
said he no longer holds the rank of party leader _ as of Thursday
night, when Gore delivered what the president praised as an
``extraordinary speech and a great road map for the country's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at the crowded rally in Saranac Lake, said he was
already beginning the transition to private life. ``In this
election, though I will be president and I have a lot I'm going to
try to get done for you in the next five months, I am moving back
to where I spent the first 20 years of my active life in
politics,'' he said. That is, the president said, as an envelope
stuffer, not a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton is not quite yet an ordinary citizen, as his
schedule over the coming weeks makes clear. He hops aboard Air
Force One next week for a trip to Nigeria that is designed to
follow up on his 1998 tour of Africa and lend support to Nigeria's
fledgling democracy. At the invitation of Nelson Mandela, South
Africa's former president, Clinton will also stop in Tanzania for a
day to support the Burundi peace talks that Mandela is brokering.
</P>
<P>
   After several days in Africa, Clinton returns to Washington,
spends a night in his own bed, and is off again to Colombia to
speak on behalf of President Carlos Pastrana's fight against drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the president's schedule in the coming weeks is a trip
to the United Nations in New York for a gathering of scores of
world leaders that will be one of Clinton's final opportunities
before he leaves office to say farewell to some of his far-flung
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Not all his attention, of course, will be focused off shore.
Clinton already has four fund-raising speeches planned next week in
Michigan and New Jersey for House and Senate candidates. The White
House carefully arranged those trips with William Daley, the
campaign chairman for Gore, and has clearly turned over the
political arena to the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to tell us what to do,'' said John Podesta, the
president's chief of staff. ``We're playing second fiddle. Maybe
third fiddle. How many fiddles are there in the orchestra?''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is still running the show when it comes to the final
budget battle with the Republicans, an end-of-the-year face-off he
has shown himself adept at maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to putting our elbows on the table and
arm-wrestling with Congress,'' Podesta told reporters aboard Air
Force One as the president returned from the Democratic National
Convention last week. ``That should take us through early
October.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fall, the election will be so dominating the news that
White House aides acknowledge that they will have a tough time
grabbing headlines even if they wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, presidential aides say a bit of obscurity is
fine with them. Clinton spoke for a mere nine minutes on his wife's
behalf on Friday, a flash as far as presidential addresses go. And
even more notable perhaps is what happened after the speech. The
first lady delved into the crowd to shake hands. The president, who
relishes such hands-on contact with admirers, retreated early.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, temperatures fell into the 30s in portions of
the northern Great Lakes as an exceptionally cool high pressure
system built over the region. Sunday, the high will continue to
settle southeastward, providing another chilly start to the day
across the Northeast. Sunshine will be plentiful, but afternoon
readings will stay about 5 to 10 degrees below normal. An exception
to the bright conditions will be found over the high ground of New
England, where a weak disturbance brings clouds and a few
sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful storms will erupt in the northern Plains on Sunday as a
jet stream disturbance intercepts a northward flow of humid air.
Scattered thunderstorms will also surround a front from near
Missouri to the Southeast Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will reach the Northwest behind a departing front
while the Southwest and southern Plains remain mainly dry and hot.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HURRICANE CONTROLLER
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A group of tiny islands 700 miles east of the Carolinas lends
its name to a prominent summer weather system, the Bermuda high.
The clockwise winds around this high pressure system can play an
important role in steering hurricanes. A typical hurricane moves
west along the southern part of the Bermuda high before veering to
the north along its western flank. The two-week long journey of
Hurricane Alberto from the Cape Verde Islands to its current
position in the central Atlantic has been a path controlled by the
position of the Bermuda high. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE CADDIE ONLY TIGER KNOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: To be subbed after the day's play is completed) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ In Tiger Woods' quest to add a second
consecutive Professional Golfers' Association title to his U.S.
Open and British Open championships, his caddie, 36-year-old Steve
Williams, is always out there with him. When Williams is not
lugging that big black golf bag on his sturdy shoulders here at
Valhalla, he's conferring with Woods on the distance to the
flagstick and which club to hit, or he's helping to read the line
of a putt.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is the caddie whom only Tiger Woods knows. He
doesn't give interviews or sign autographs. In many ways, he is
virtually invisible. But not unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevie has been a big part of my success,'' said Woods, who
was the clubhouse leader in the PGA by one stroke, at 11 under par,
after the second round of play was suspended by darkness on Friday
with 11 players still on the course. ``He's there not only to
motivate me when things are going bad, but he has the gall to tell
me what he thinks when I'm feeling uneasy about a club. He's not
afraid to get in my face about it, and that is nice. He's got a lot
of confidence in his ability as a caddie, and that is very
reassuring as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods remembered getting ready to hit his second shot on the
15th hole at Pebble Beach in the U.S. Open in June when Williams
noticed a man in the gallery pulling a disposable camera out of his
pocket. Nothing disrupts a golfer more than an unexpected click of
a camera, especially during a swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevie called me off the shot,'' Woods said. ``He said:
`Tiger, get off the shot. There's a guy with a camera.' He went
after the guy with the camera. Not too many caddies would actually
do that in the U.S. Open and to say `get off the shot' when I'm
over the ball, that takes a lot of guts, but he did it. Then I put
it up there on the green, made par and walked on.''
</P>
<P>
   During the British Open at the Old Course at St. Andrews,
Scotland last month, Woods mentioned how he and Williams had formed
a strong friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten to know me really well, how I like to play, what
my thought process is,'' Woods said. ``He can read me, to the point
where he knows when to say something, when not to say something.
And we genuinely like being around each other. I think that makes
for a wonderful partnership, especially one that lasts a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Every so often here at Valhalla Golf Club, Woods and Williams
have shared a laugh or a smile, as they do at every tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevie's so positive out there, he keeps me upbeat; I get on
him, he gets on me,'' Woods said. ``We have a good time out there.
If I'm playing good or bad, it doesn't matter, we're going to enjoy
each other's company.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods also likes the way Williams will remind him that there
might be another way to play a particular shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On a couple of tee shots at St. Andrews,'' Woods said, ``he
got in my head a little bit and said: `Look at this option.
Consider this.' I think that's what he's so good at. And he doesn't
force it on you. If I want to go with my thinking, I go with it.
I'm holding the club. But he has the guts to tell me what he's
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many tour caddies play golf at every opportunity, but Williams
does not. He occasionally drives racing cars in his native New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I race cars, mate; golf's not my game,'' he has said. ``I've
probably played only about 10 18-hole rounds of golf in the last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't talk to the news media about his life as Woods'
caddie, a life that reportedly earned him at least $600,000 last
year and might earn him even more this year.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those in Woods' inner circle, like his girlfriend,
Joanna Jagoda, don't give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their life and their choice,'' Woods said. ``If they want
to do interviews, fine, but it's up to them. I can say, `I don't
think it's good for you to do that because if you do it once,
you're going to have to do it twice, then a third time, a fourth
time, then so forth and so on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had caddied for Raymond Floyd and Greg Norman, has
been on Woods' bag since early last year after Woods lost
confidence in Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan, his first tour caddie. Woods'
swing guru, Butch Harmon, had asked Floyd's permission to hire
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Steve a long time,'' said Harmon, who was once
Norman's guru. ``The mix with Tiger is perfect. I didn't think he'd
get caught up in the hoopla that surrounds Tiger, and he hasn't.
He's good under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he feels the wind change, he'll stop and tell Tiger. He
knows when to say the right thing and when not to say anything. He
knows when to be aggressive and when not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had caddied for 11 years for Floyd, the winner of the
1986 U.S. Open, the 1976 Masters and two PGA Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's very quiet, he's not looking for publicity,'' Floyd
said. ``He's a good companion out there. He knows when to pat you
on the back and he knows when to bark at you. He was like another
son to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Steve Williams is almost like a big brother to Tiger
Woods, who walks with him, laughs with him and listens to him. &QL;

   MVP Candidates Helped and Hindered by Team's Position in
Standings
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever displayed a clearer definition of most valuable
player than Chipper Jones did last September when the Mets, a mere
game behind the Braves, played a three-game series in Atlanta.
Hitting four home runs and driving in seven runs, Jones dominated
the series, which the Braves swept to take a commanding four-game
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had already had an MVP-type season, clinched the
National League award with that performance. Players should always
make it that easy for voters.
</P>
<P>
   With six weeks left in this season, the MVP races have a
collection of legitimate candidates, including one from each of the
New York teams who could give the city a matched set of most
valuable players for the first time since Sandy Koufax and Elston
Howard in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Mike Piazza of the Mets probably has fewer rivals
for the award than does Bernie Williams of the Yankees, but too
much of the season remains to attach the letters MVP to either
one's name.
</P>
<P>
   The National League has a group who would be serious candidates
if their teams were in a better location in the standing. Todd
Helton of Colorado heads the group, which includes Vladimir
Guerrero of Montreal, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and Jeff
Bagwell of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As the NL leader in batting average, on-base and slugging
percentages, hits, extra-base hits, multihit games, total bases,
doubles and runs scored (he is only second in runs batted in),
Helton is clearly the league's player of the year. But that doesn't
make him MVP, too. The beauty of the MVP award is that it measures
a player's value to his team, not simply a set of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Helton unquestionably has been most valuable to the Rockies, but
they were in the NL West race only briefly _ they were in first
place June 18 and July 3 _ and not even Helton's torrid hitting the
past couple of weeks has helped improve their standing.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Los Angeles Dodgers are not much better off than
the Rockies, Gary Sheffield's position among MVP contenders could
be questioned. He has clearly been invaluable to the Dodgers, but
their play has undermined his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Voting for the award is done by a panel of members of the
Baseball Writers Association, and the voters generally opt for
players on contenders over players on noncontenders and for
everyday players over pitchers. Everything else being equal _ not
that everything ever is _ shortstops and catchers receive extra
consideration for the difficulty of their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza might have detractors for his catching ability, but he
plays the position and has not allowed its rigors to prevent him
from producing one critical hit after another or one series of hits
after another.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Piazza missed three games with a sprained
left knee, then in his first three games back (1) broke open a game
with a three-run home run, (2) accounted for the first three runs
by driving in two and scoring the other and later knocked in
another run and scored another as the Mets won, and (3) ignited a
third consecutive victory by slugging a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Piazza cracked a grand slam that obliterated a 3-3
tie with Toronto four days after he hit two home runs in Boston,
one that tied the game and one that won it. Piazza posted that
performance less than a week after Roger Clemens hit him on the
head with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Piazza had faced Clemens, June 9, he hit a
third-inning grand slam that started the Mets toward a 12-2
victory. A week before the beanball he hit a three-run home run
that climaxed a 10-run eighth-inning rally that beat Atlanta, 11-8.
</P>
<P>
   That shot came a couple of weeks after Piazza ripped a two-run
home run against Trevor Hoffman in the 10th for a 5-3 victory over
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's name doesn't appear among the leaders in as many
offensive categories as Helton's, but he does lead Helton in one
phase. Piazza entered the weekend with the NL's best road average,
.410, or 50 points better than Helton.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheffield loses votes because of the Dodgers' failure to
seriously contend, Piazza's prime challenge could come from Jeff
Kent of San Francisco. One of the league's leader in runs batted
in, Kent has been the Giants' most consistently productive hitter,
even better than Barry Bonds, though Bonds could dilute Kent's
chances in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds of St. Louis appeared to be a major contender
earlier in the season, but without Mark McGwire in the lineup, he
has not served as critical a role.
</P>
<P>
   Some AL MVP Hopefuls May Be Hurt By DH Status
</P>
<P>
   The American League balloting will be a test of the voters' view
of designated hitters as MVP. Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox
and Edgar Martinez of Seattle have been extremely valuable
offensively to their division-leading teams, but Martinez has been
strictly a DH and Thomas has been a DH most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas won the award in 1993 and '94, but he was a first baseman
then. Rafael Palmeiro of Texas finished fifth in last year's voting
after serving primarily as a DH, but he received four first-place
votes, including two from the Texas writers, who selected him over
Ivan Rodriguez, his teammate, who won the award.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado of Toronto has compiled the most impressive
statistics, leading the league in on-base, slugging percentage and
total bases and holding top-three spots in batting average, home
runs, runs batted in and runs scored. Toronto, however, may have to
win the wild card for him to have a chance for the award.
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't compare with Delgado's statistics, except for
RBIs. But he has been more responsible than any other member of the
team for the Yankees' continued presence at the top of the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   From the second game of the season, which he won in Anaheim with
a two-run homer in the ninth inning, Williams has staged a frequent
one-man victory party. The Yankees were losing their home opener,
2-1, when he hit a three-run homer in an 8-6 conquest of Texas. The
next week in Texas, he tied the game with a two-run homer in the
seventh, and the Yankees won in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   After losing two games to the Tigers late in June for a
five-game losing streak in Detroit, the Yankees were in a scoreless
game when Williams tripled home a run that ignited an eight-run
outburst.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of the second series against the Mets,
Williams drove in the first run of what became a 2-1 victory.
Against Philadelphia he hit an early home run, singled home the
third run of a game-tying five-run rally and scored the tying run,
then singled home the tying run in the 10th before the Yankees won.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month he wiped out a 3-0 Seattle lead with a
three-run homer, sending the Yankees to a 13-6 victory. Just four
days later he hit the first home run of the remarkable two-pitch,
two-homer blitz against Jason Isringhausen of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett of Boston is a candidate but lost ground when his
temper tantrum gained him a 10-game suspension. Alex Rodriguez of
Seattle and Jason Giambi of Oakland are candidates as well. If
voters consider Martinez despite his DH status, he could hurt
Rodriguez's chances.
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable players, however, may not yet have been
determined. The candidates have six weeks in which to do a Chipper
Jones imitation.
</P>
<P>
   An Ivy-Covered Name
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Los Angeles and lives in New York, but
17-year-old Elizabeth thinks Chicago. She has good reason to; she
and the city have something in common _ a famous name.
</P>
<P>
   She is Elizabeth Wrigley-Field and she is proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone else with the name,'' she said. ``I
don't believe there are any other Wrigley-Fields. I've made a few
attempts to find someone else, but I never have.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents are not crazy Cubs fans who adopted the park's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom is Wrigley and my dad is Field,'' she said. ``They
named me Elizabeth Field. They thought if I was named Wrigley-Field
I'd be teased a lot. When I was in first grade, I decided that
would be a mistake. I wanted to have both my parents' names because
I thought that would be fair, but I also thought it would be cool
to have the name Wrigley-Field.''
</P>
<P>
   So cool, in fact, that she is taking steps to make that her name
legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been Wrigley-Field in the school system as long as I've
been in New York,'' said the Hunter High School senior, whose
family moved to New York when she was 9. ``But we're getting my
name changed now because I'm about to go to college and I don't
want there to be any question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wrigley-Field, who has no brothers or sisters to share the
name with, recalled peoples' reaction upon being introduced to her
or hearing her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hearing my name for the first time, especially
substitute teachers, would have big reactions,'' she said. ``In
ninth grade I was on the debate team and that's when I was first
introduced to masses of people at tournaments. People would laugh
when I went up to get my awards. I thought it was kind of funny,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But she has also found that her name creates an easy way to
begin a conversation with someone whom she doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wrigley-Field has never been inside Wrigley Field. ``I've
been outside it, for about 10 minutes when I was very young,'' she
said. But she may make a visit during the coming school year. She
hopes to attend Harvard or the University of Chicago, and if she
goes to Chicago to visit that school, she said, she hopes to go to
the park and meet Cubs people.
</P>
<P>
   Now one would think that Ms. Wrigley-Field is a big baseball
fan. ``Not really,'' she said, speaking from Kassel, Germany, where
she has been studying this summer. ``I am a Cubs fan, but I don't
believe I would be were it not for this unusual circumstance. I
don't really follow baseball, but when I'm near a baseball
paraphernalia store, I go in and look for Cubs things.''
</P>
<P>
   From her collection of Cubs things, she said she especially
likes her Wrigley Field playing cards. What teen-ager wouldn't like
a deck of cards with such a personal label?

   FOREST-FIRES-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid the worst wildfire year in
nearly half a century, much political finger-pointing is under way.
But the Forest Service, for its part, blames Smokey the Bear and
fire suppression efforts. ``Most of these areas that used to burn
every 10 years or so haven't had a fire in a half-century,'' said a

   SUBMARINE-STORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The world has been
transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk and the
desperate attempts to reach the 118 men inside. Tales of sea
adventure and calamity, both in fact and fiction, have always held
deep appeal. But what is it about the sea _ and especially
submarines _ that makes being trapped below the waves often
resonate even more than similar disasters on land, like mine
cave-ins? Part of the answer is that for all the advances in
science, the sea remains a mysterious _ and mystical _ force. By
Christopher Drew.
</P>
<P>
   DISABILITY-STUDIES-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Pressing the
frontier of disability: it has expanded beyond law, medicine and
public policy into academia, in which it provides another point of
view for Richard III or discusses whether the tippy-toed Barbie
doll is technically disabled. Major universities are developing
disability studies programs. This fall the first international
conference on disability studies will be held in Washington. By

   BASEBALL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ There have been some ugly
incidents on the baseball field this season but so far nothing has
approached the horrifying moment 35 years ago when politics
intruded on baseball with a shock that many recall vividly today.
What people remember is the violence that exploded on Aug. 22,
1965, during a game at Candlestick Park in the bitterly contested
National League pennant race between the Los Angeles Dodgers and
the San Francisco Giants. But few recall the politics that fueled
it. By Allen Barra.

   VEEPS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the election 79 days away,
Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman have already done just about
everything running mates can do for their tickets, from reflecting
well on the presidential nominees who chose them to providing a
lift for their national conventions. But those contributions have
been significant. A look at Cheney, Lieberman and other vice
presidential nominees of campaigns past. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-KISS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In Al Gore's campaign to change his
robotic image, nothing may have helped more than the big smooch. It
also may have signaled that Gore (unlikes some presidents we know)
would be faithful to his wife. By Caryn James.

   SOUNDOFMUSIC-SINGALONG-REVIEW (New York) _ ``The Sing-a-Long
Sound of Music,'' the audience participation of the 1965 film
classic, will open here. During standards such as ``Sixteen Going

   IRAN-MEDIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iran's crackdown on
reform-oriented writers, editors and media spreads to cartoons. The
conservative courts have closed 24 reformist publications since
late April. A magazine called Tavana was banned after publishing a
caricature of President Mohammad Khatami, who is himself a
reformer. But it showed him without his clerical turban and robe.
That, the court said, amounted to defamation. By Susan Sachs.

   U.N.-CARTOONISTS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ At the United
Nations, where one person's joke can strike other people from other
cultures as incomprehensible or offensive, diplomats favor the

   WASHINGTON _ For all the talk about the great race to the center
this year, nobody who watched the two conventions, skimmed the
parties' platforms or scrutinized the candidates' stands would
mistake the Democrat for the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, much of the time a certain rhetorical sameness wafted from
the main stages of the convention halls, and there was little of
the partisan bite of yesteryear. But political passions kept
bubbling up, just offstage. And even among the voters at large, at
a time of peace and prosperity, with few great burning issues
pushing people in one direction or another, two-thirds of Americans
still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Party, in other words, still matters.
</P>
<P>
   Party attachment is still considered one of the best predictors
of how people will vote _ if they vote. But appealing to those
loyalties, while still wooing the Independents who decide
elections, is a complicated challenge these days. Particularly for
Vice President Al Gore, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that the Democrats have a
slight edge when it comes to party affiliation: Asked in four
national polls this year how they identify themselves, an average
of 35 percent of Americans said they were Democrats, 30 percent
Republicans, 28 percent Independents and 7 percent (probably the
least likely to vote) said they had no opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In a Times/CBS poll conducted last month, the Democratic Party
was still considered the party that would do a better job on health
care, education and ``making the right decisions'' on Social
Security _ all issues high on the voters' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party was given the edge on upholding traditional
family values, making sure the military stays strong and ensuring a
healthy economy. Each party, in other words, brings its nominee
certain strengths this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But until last week, Democratic voters have not embraced Gore's
candidacy with the enthusiasm Republicans have brought to Gov.
George W. Bush; the last pre-convention Times/CBS poll showed Gore
drawing 75 percent of the Democrats, while Bush got 86 percent of
the Republicans. ``I think they wasted half their convention just
trying to get strong Democrats and soft Democrats home,'' said Bill
McInturff, a Republican pollster. (Post-convention polls will tell
how successful they were.)
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious reasons why Gore has had to work harder for
voters who should be rightfully his: The Democratic Party has held
the presidency for eight years. The strains are showing between
liberals and ``New Democrats'' who want to keep the party in the
center. And the Gore candidacy has had its fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   This was the landscape for Gore's acceptance speech Thursday
night: He needed to energize his base, but he was also keenly aware
of the swing voters turned off by partisan appeals. On one level,
his speech was profoundly Democratic. He offered himself as a
populist crusader willing to fight ``powerful forces'' _ like big
HMOs and profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies _ on behalf of
``working families.''
</P>
<P>
   But in sharp contrast to convention speeches of yesteryear,
Gore's never mentioned the words Democrat or Republican, noted
Martin Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of
California-Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's populist, but it's a broad populism,'' said Stan
Greenberg, Gore's pollster. ``It's saying, let's make sure the
whole society is able to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   To galvanize his party, and to pull back many of the
Independents who lean their way, Gore needs to draw sharp contrasts
with the Republicans, many Democratic strategists agree,
particularly on basic issues like tax cuts and health care.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have not made it easy.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Democrats say Bush is preaching a message _ that he
is a different kind of Republican, more sensitive and moderate _
that is distinctly at odds with his basic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the task that Gore and the Democrats face in the fall
is to tell voters that George W. Bush really is an old-style
Republican,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. In other
words, to block Bush's move to the center, now that he has
consolidated his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats are eager to make that case and highlight the
stakes: What kind of Supreme Court justices would a Bush
administration, operating with a Republican Senate, appoint?
</P>
<P>
   Who would most profit from his tax cuts?
</P>
<P>
   What would his budget proposals mean for Medicare?
</P>
<P>
   How does Bush's health care record in Texas, which ranks high
among states in the percentage of uninsured, gibe with his promise
to provide health coverage nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign is in something of a strategic box, one
Republican strategist argued, speaking on condition that he not be
identified. While the Democrats need to highlight the differences
between the parties, overt partisanship gives the Bush campaign the
higher moral ground.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the Bush campaign chastised the Democrats for any
hint of partisan attacks at their convention. In fact, party
strategists say, Bush is convinced that the voters are weary of
such fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has seriously studied what has happened since Republicans
gained control of Congress in 1994,'' said Linda DiVall, a
Republican poll taker. ``Frankly, Republicans don't do well when we
get into a fight with Clinton or a fight among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, has the luxury of denouncing partisanship and
muting the differences. Eight years in the wilderness, and a
profound disdain for the Clinton administration, go a long way
toward keeping Republican voters unified and motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush has ably capitalized on his party's traditional
strengths _ most notably, in the aftermath of the Clinton scandals,
the notion that Republicans have stronger moral values. And he has
dealt with his party's vulnerabilities, presenting a multi-ethnic,
family-friendly convention program.
</P>
<P>
   With all his ``rhetorical convergence,'' as the political
scientist Thomas Mann puts it, some voters might well ask just
whether there's much difference between the parties _ an argument
at the heart of Ralph Nader's third-party campaign.

   WASHINGTON _ For all the talk about the great race to the center
this year, nobody who watched the two conventions, skimmed the
parties' platforms or scrutinized the candidates' stands would
mistake the Democrat for the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, much of the time a certain rhetorical sameness wafted from
the main stages of the convention halls, and there was little of
the partisan bite of yesteryear. But political passions kept
bubbling up, just offstage. And even among the voters at large, at
a time of peace and prosperity, with few great burning issues
pushing people in one direction or another, two-thirds of Americans
still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Party, in other words, still matters.
</P>
<P>
   Party attachment is still considered one of the best predictors
of how people will vote _ if they vote. But appealing to those
loyalties, while still wooing the Independents who decide
elections, is a complicated challenge these days. Particularly for

</P>
<P>
   But, of course, in their attitudes toward government, their
approach to social issues like abortion and gay rights, their
economic philosophy and their approach to restructuring Medicare
and Social Security, the differences are large and enduring.
</P>
<P>
   And each party's reliable supporters are quite distinctive, too.
</P>
<P>
   Party affiliation is still, quite often, passed down from parent
to child, some political scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Economic status is still strongly linked with party attachment,
although Republicans have attracted more lower-income members
through the party's embrace of social conservatives, while
Democrats have drawn more white-collar voters.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bartels, a professor of politics at Princeton University,
maintains that party loyalty was a greater factor in presidential
voting in the 1990s than at any time since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   And McInturff notes that, if anything, partisan voters have
become even more so thanks to the polarizing figures of President
Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich _ but for the same
reason people in the middle may have become even more turned off by
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Another twist is the unpredictable but undeniable role of third
parties. Wattenberg noted that since the Civil War, third party
voting has not totaled more than 5 percent of the overall vote in
two consecutive elections _ until 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests the complicated politics that awaits the
voters this fall: a fierce, nonpartisan partisan struggle. For
Gore, the campaign will be about ``fighting for working families,''
and for Bush, ``compassionate conservatism.'' In other words, the
parties are dead, long live the parties.

   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ When the all-star team from this town on the
outskirts of Manchester won the Eastern Regional Championship on
Thursday night in Bristol, Conn., and a ticket to the Little League
World Series, it was hard to tell who was more excited _ the 11-
and 12-year-olds who mobbed their pitcher on the mound or the
parents in the grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Mark Collins, the vice president of the league
and the father of the pitcher, Ben Collins, said over and over.
``This was David and Goliath and we won. Unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stunned reactions of the parents and coaches from
Goffstown, the team's 1-0 victory over a team from the Bronx was no
fluke. It had as much to do with the efforts of adults in the
stands as with their children on the field. Coaches and league
officials say it capped a five-year campaign to make their team a
national contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go out there and teach them the game,'' the
manager of the team, Frank Szumiesz, said. ``But fun is not only
playing the sport. It's striving to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on a mission for the last five years to get to where
we are,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Szumiesz said a core group of league officials decided in 1995
that they wanted their league to become a contender for the state
championship. They were spurred on by their rivalry with
neighboring Bedford, which won the state title in 1993 and went to
the Little League World Series. The Goffstown coaches went to
school on more successful programs in New Hampshire, borrowing
drills and coaching tips and adopting voluntary indoor practices in
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at some of the other towns that had quality programs
and we weren't afraid to ask questions,'' one of the Goffstown
coaches, Phil Bradley, said.
</P>
<P>
   The league also expanded and improved its five fields, which had
been built years before. Three years ago, the organizers drummed up
about $20,000 in donations from local businesses to put lights on
one field to allow for later practices and night games.
</P>
<P>
   They also set up a Web site for coaches, referring them to the
latest information on coaching baseball and sent some coaches to
Little League seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely has been a concerted effort,'' said Collins,
40, a physical therapist who has coached his son Ben's teams for
eight years. ``We have a great group of talented kids, but for us
to get to this point a lot of other factors went into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important change was to begin pushing the best
players to work on fundamentals outside the baseball season. ``You
have to be concerned with baseball all year round,'' said Bradley,
a 53-year-old Federal Aviation Administration employee.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, many of the boys on the championship
team have spent every Sunday morning from January until April at an
indoor practice facility, built in an old Manchester mill, called
Good Rips. (It helped that one of its owners was Tom French, a
coach whose son, Tom, is on the all-star team.) On snow-covered
mornings, the core of the team arrived at 7:30 a.m. to practice
their swings in eight batting cages and hone their pitching
techniques on two indoor dirt mounds. They also performed fielding
drills, snapping up ground balls and throwing into socklike targets
representing first base. Those weeks of extra work, while
voluntary, proved invaluable, the coaches said.
</P>
<P>
   The league has also used school gyms in the winter for fielding
and pitching seminars. League officials even tried a fall program
two years ago, but found the players were getting burned out and
dropped the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Little League baseball has been helped by the absence of other
strong sports programs in Goffstown, a community of 15,600. The
youth hockey program started only a year ago, and soccer has not
caught on here as it has in other towns.
</P>
<P>
   The local high school lacks a football team, but it won state
championships this year in basketball and baseball. The girls' high
school softball program has also chalked up several state titles.
One Goffstown resident, Morris Allard, built a private stadium for
the state Babe Ruth baseball championships.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is so ingrained in the local fabric that the town holds
a parade, complete with marching bands and a barbecue, for the
opening day of the Little League and Babe Ruth League seasons. On
Friday nights, the Little League games are often well attended by
people who do not have children on the teams, but come out for an
evening of baseball and the simple pleasure of a hot dog from the
concession stand. The league has more than 100 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring, the whole town turns to baseball,'' Bradley
said. ``It's hard to emphasize how special baseball is in
Goffstown.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident Friday along the main street where business
owners were putting up banners congratulating the team. ``People
are so excited,'' said Robbie Grady, who oversees a program helping
to refurbish the town center. ``I've had several phone calls Friday
saying we need to do a parade. How are we going to do this? It was
the talk of the local coffee shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady said support for the Little League program was part of a
larger trend of civic-minded efforts in Goffstown. For example,
residents recently raised $200,000 to pay for the treatment of a
13-year-old boy, Evan Kavenell, who had a rare form of brain
cancer. .
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is a bedroom community for Manchester, Goffstown
is not a run-of-the-mill suburb of tract housing and strip malls.
The residents include bricklayers and stonemasons and
high-technology executives. The town is carved out of the hilly
forested country east of Manchester and includes the Uncanoonuc
Mountains. The Piscatoquog River runs through the heart of town,
green, deep and cold.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of Goffstown is the quaint row of Colonial buildings
and churches around the commons. Although some of the buildings
need painting, Goffstown's center brings to mind an idyllic New
England hamlet where baseball would surely be played on grass in
the golden dusk as it was meant to be, with the whack of horsehide
on wood and cleats stirring up the dust.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of town is Pinardville, a nondescript
commercial strip of shopping malls and supermarkets just across the
river from the old textile mills of Manchester. In between lies the
New Hampshire State Prison for Women.
</P>
<P>
   The Goffstown Junior Baseball fields are just down the road from
the prison, sandwiched between the main road and a gash of forest,
opposite a power substation. On the outfield fences are signs of
local sponsors: True Value Hardware, Blue Ribbon Fencing, J&AMP;G
Roofing, Goffstown Auto Parts.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the effort that parents have made, Goffstown has not
poured money into its baseball program like some Little League
powerhouses. Toms River, N.J., spent more than $308,000 on a new
field and an indoor practice facility. That team won the world
series in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the baseball program here has become a powerhouse, in
part by people working together. The Goffstown group going to
Williamsport, Pa., for the Little League World Series, which begins
Sunday, has been playing together for five years. As 10-year-olds,
they were champions of the New Hampshire Little League Division I
and were runners-up for the state championship.

<P>
   Stacy Dragila was always a bit of a daredevil. She competed on
the high school rodeo circuit in Northern California and, entering
junior college in 1992, became intrigued by the risk and the
airborne gymnastics of the pole vault. It was a relatively new
event for women, however, and the first male pole-vaulter she
consulted suggested she could not clear the gender bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if I could try it one day at practice,'' Dragila
said. ``He just looked at me and said: `Women can't do that. They
just don't have the upper-body strength. They are not made to do
it.' I took it to heart that, OK, this is one of those things that
women just don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the urging of her coach, Dragila reconsidered in 1993 at
Idaho State University. Seven years later, the women's pole vault
is among track and field's most engaging events, and Dragila is the
world record-holder at 15 feet 2 and a quarter inches. She is a
gold-medal favorite at the 2000 Summer Games, which begin Sept. 15
in Sydney, Australia, where her event will make its Olympic debut
for women.
</P>
<P>
   When the modern Olympics began in 1896, women were not allowed
to participate. Times have changed, grudgingly but significantly,
in the 20th century. In Sydney, more women will compete in more
sports, and in more events, than ever. About 4,400 women, or 42
percent of the 10,500 competing athletes, will participate, up from
3,626 at the 1996 Atlanta Games. And for the first time, women will
compete in the same number of team sports as men.
</P>
<P>
   The gains go beyond numbers, however, as women continue to
penetrate the boundaries of previously male-only events that
require great strength and endurance. The sports added for women
this year are weight lifting, triathlon, tae kwon do and modern
pentathlon, and new competitions in multidiscipline sports include
water polo in the aquatics category and the hammer throw and pole
vault in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Sydney will offer a grand stage for a generationof
women who have reaped the benefits of Title IX, followed the lead
of individual stars and team champions and carved out an even
larger presence for women in the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're worthy of being a medal event at the Olympics,''
Dragila said. ``We've shown we can take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Girls are starting to come up to me. They are
encouraged because they know I came to this so late in my career.
They know anything is possible if they put their heart to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will athletes like Dragila increase the profile of
women in the Sydney Games, but the overriding athletic story there
will also be a woman's story _ the attempt by Marion Jones of the
United States to become the first female track-and-field athlete to
win five gold medals in one Olympics. Jones has been heavily
marketed and promoted over the last year, and both Jones and
Dragila have been featured in television commercials leading up to
Sydney. A 17-year-old from the United States, Cheryl Haworth, who
is 5 foot 9 and 308 pounds, is a gold-medal favorite in weight
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Olympic officials and sponsors are paying more
attention to female athletes, especially after last summer's
Women's World Cup of soccer _ the largest sporting event ever for
women _ filled up large stadiums in the United States and ended any
doubt that people in large numbers would pay to watch women play
team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soccer team showed that, a generation after Title IX,
women's sports are here to stay,'' said Maureen O'Toole, who is
considered the greatest female water-polo player ever and who will
make her initial Olympic appearance in Sydney at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by criticism that the gold-medal success of American women
in softball and soccer was reduced to highlight footage at the
Atlanta Olympics, NBC, which will pay $3.5 billion to broadcast the
next five Olympic Games, will show every minute of the women's
soccer and softball matches on network or cable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been battered recently by scandals involving
corruption and performance-enhancing drugs, the president of the
International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, can
include as one of his greatest successes the increased
participation of women as athletes and officials in the Olympic
movement.
</P>
<P>
   He named the first female member of the IOC in 1981; today 13 of
the 113 delegates are women. Four years ago, Samaranch proposed
that women should hold at least 10 percent of the decision-making
positions in the IOC, every national Olympic committee and
international sports federations by 2000, with the number rising to
20 percent by 2005. These goals may seem meager by American
standards, but they represent significant progress in many
countries where women's roles are diminished or dismissed for
cultural and religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appointed women IOC members for the first time and we
solved a very important problem, the participation of women in the
Games,'' Samaranch said in a recent interview. ``But we still have
a problem; that is, the presence of women in leading positions
running sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, women have hardly reached a level of parity with men in
the Olympic movement. Forty-eight names were proposed recently for
14 new positions as IOC members, and none of them were women.

<P>
   Opportunities are coming more quickly on the playing fields, on
the track and in the pool. O'Toole will finally have a chance to
display before a worldwide audience her seminal skills in women's
water polo. After playing internationally since 1978, she retired
in 1994 to teach physical education and coach in Northern
California, believing her career would never have the validation of
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   She would apparently have to be satisfied with decades of
success achieved in anonymity, when the American team slept on pool
tables in a bar in the Netherlands and traveled from Italy to Malta
on a fishing trawler because there was no money for more
extravagant travel. The entire team bunked at her house during
summer training in the early days, and pool time was limited for
female players to 6 to 9 in the morning and 8 to 11 at night.
</P>
<P>
   When women's water polo was added to the Sydney schedule in
1997, O'Toole quickly came out of retirement. Still, there is no
big money in the sport. Even with a training stipend from the U.S.
Olympic Committee and a pair of sponsors, she has struggled to make
ends meet. For a year, O'Toole has lived with her mother in
Huntington Beach, Calif., to train with the American team and has
traveled home to the Bay Area to see her 8-year-old daughter,
Kelly, and her boyfriend on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first world championship was in '78 in Berlin, but it was
only a demonstration sport, not official,'' O'Toole said. ``They
had no hotel rooms for us. We had to sit around the lobby for three
or four hours. It was almost embarrassing. We worked as hard as
other athletes and put the same amount of time in, but we weren't
an Olympic sport, so no one cared about us. Being an Olympic sport
makes a difference. It really validates us.''
</P>
<P>
   As she watched American women achieve thorough success at the
Atlanta Games, Jennifer Gutierrez of Denver said she never dreamed
she would compete in Sydney in the inaugural Olympic triathlon,
which will include a one-mile swim, a 24-mile bike ride and a
6.2-mile run. A former champion swimmer at Pepperdine University,
Gutierrez took up the triathlon for fitness training in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Early success, and the realization that the sport would be
included in the Sydney Olympics, encouraged Gutierrez to increase
her training from 15 to 25 hours a week, which she has fit in
around her job teaching physical education to handicapped children.
She swims from 5:30 to 7:30 each morning, runs 6 miles on her lunch
break and bikes in the evening. She postponed her honeymoon for two
years until the completion of the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having your sport in the Olympics raises the whole level of
competition,'' said Gutierrez, who is 33. ``You make sacrifices you
wouldn't make in everyday life to get to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't taken my honeymoon. But now I know what it
takes to be an athlete at a high level. I can appreciate the effort
of these athletes, whether they are in first place or last.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Ellerbe, a native of Brooklyn who has been over 6 feet tall
since the eighth grade, threw the shot-put and discus in high
school , then reluctantly attempted the hammer throw at the
University of South Carolina. The first time she grabbed the
9-pound ball by its 3-foot-long wire, spun several times and
launched the hammer, she fell down. She has ruined more than a few
suitcases, traveling with four or five of the hammers to each meet,
and has had to shovel snow off the hammer-throwing ring to train at
the University of Wyoming, where she received her master's degree
in communications and is now an assistant coach. But her
perseverance has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, the 6-foot-2, 240-pound Ellerbe has won five national
championships in the hammer throw, has set the American record of
231 feet 2 inches and has established herself as a medal candidate
in Sydney. Her event and others will provide girls with a chance to
see mature women competing, Ellerbe noted, in contrast to the
prepubescent images of gymnasts and figure skaters frequently
broadcast at the Summer and Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When younger girls see a gymnast or an ice skater, they think
it's a fantasy: `I can't do that after I'm 22.''' she said. ``I
think this will show them that you can be a scholar too, and get an
education while competing in athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of the new Olympic events for women is the pole
vault. It is an evolving sport, and thus a world record is possible
at every major competition. The pole vault also evokes danger,
strength and acrobatic grace as women plant a 14-foot pole and
invert themselves in midair to clear a bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a little bit sexist, you've got good-looking girls and
an X-Games mentality,'' said Dave Nielsen, who coaches Dragila in
Pocatello, Idaho. A former vaulter, he began trying to get women
interested in the pole vault in hopes that gender equity could stem
the erosion of the event because of the expense, the threat of
injury, rising insurance costs and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having women involved would be leverage to keep the event,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila, 29, grew up in Auburn, Calif., and competed in
goat-tying competitions in high school rodeos, dismounting from her
horse, flipping the goat and binding its legs with rope. She was
recruited to college as a heptathlete, the female version of the
decathlon, which requires skill in running, throwing and jumping.
The pole vault was something that few women had ever tried, and
Dragila started gingerly at a height of 6 feet, a full 10 inches
below the women's world record in the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it pole-vaulting, just holding on for dear
life and getting over the bar,'' Dragila said. ``Getting on the
runway in '93 was very awkward. Trying to hold the pole, run with
it and plant it in this stupid little box, then trying to jump off
the ground and turn yourself over was very frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in the air was disorienting, she said, and she was never
sure if she was going to land on her back, her feet or her neck. So
she began training at a gymnastics school to gain awareness of her
body in the air. A year later, she improved to 10 feet. Last
summer, the 5-7, 140-pound Dragila won the inaugural world
championship for women, clearing 15-1. She believes a 17-foot jump
for women is possible, and would be the equivalent of a 20-foot
jump for men, who possess more speed and upper-body strength.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila has also generated attention by posing nude with other
American women for a track-and-field calendar, saying it is a sign
of progress that women are confident enough in their bodies to
expose them as figures of strength and power instead of
titillation. Other athletes, officials and feminists disagree,
saying women are still conforming to societal pressure to prove
that they are feminine when they sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of the event, female vaulters are still
attempting to clear the bar of equality. When Dragila won the 1999
world championship last August in Seville, Spain, tying what was
then the world record, she received only half the $60,000 prize
money available to male vaulters. Looking ahead to Sydney, she
said, ``I hope we don't get half a medal.''

CONVENTION CONTROL RESTORES POLICE PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAPD Detective Robert Holcomb's step had the
bounce of a winner as he strode across Staples Center's security
apron in midweek of the Democratic National Convention, holding a
couple of black riot helmets and draped with an arsenal of gear.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 marchers protesting police abuse were a few minutes
to the north on Figueroa Street, but the detective had time to
chat.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, a police surveillance helicopter beamed photos of
protesters' location, marchers were flanked by ground troops, 200
riot-gear-clad officers awaited them, and nearby 30 LAPD cars and
some 20 horses were on alert.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department was ready and Holcomb, like
other police and city officials, was certain the situation was
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been very good for morale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a department that's been unable to shake the international
shame of African-American motorist Rodney King's televised 1991
beating by white LAPD officers, the 1992 riots that followed those
officers' acquittal in state court, and more recently the Rampart
corruption scandal, the DNC was a high-stakes venture for the
department and its chief, Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   And it turns out a much-needed win that puts some shine back on
the badge. Civil liberties lawyers and some protesters complain
bitterly about the LAPD's tactics, but nearly all local officials,
convention officials and visiting press reports gave the LAPD
credit for keeping the peace effectively.
</P>
<P>
   That the city did not burn, that no one was seriously injured,
that property damage was minimal, and that there were only 194
arrests compared with 390 during the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia two weeks ago caused Parks to claim complete
vindication for his department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was textbook,'' Parks said in an interview with the Los
Angeles Daily News. ``We had an outstanding operational plan that
took over a year to put together, we had trained 5,000-plus
officers, and the people we had in critical places made the right
critical decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, and other city and county elected leaders
who were hosting thousands of out-of-towners, lavished praise on
the LAPD for checking disturbances with an overwhelming show of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed they are a world-class department and one we all
should respect,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was even bringing up the $7.5 million in overtime the
city expects to pay for the 750 officers per shift.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates overwhelmingly seemed grateful to the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we checked into the Holiday Inn (near Staples), everyone
said, You're at ground zero,'' said Indiana delegate Ray Scheele,
who watched the demonstrations from his window. ``The police did an
incredible job. It improved my view of the LAPD, after all these
incidents in the past few years. We're familiar with Rodney King,
even in Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hicks, executive director of the Los Angeles City Human
Relations Commission, said he weighed the success of the police
response day by day as he walked with demonstrators and made notes
of the confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measure is that not many people were arrested, there were
no serious injuries, no serious property damage,'' Hicks said.
``The other measure is whether civil liberties were violated, and I
think in the main protesters were able to get their message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said that while LAPD officers may have appeared more
menacing in their dark blue or black riot gear than did
Philadelphia officers, who wore shorts and kibitzed with
demonstrators, he was more concerned with their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't care what they looked like; I cared about conduct,''
he said. ``Generally, I saw LAPD reacting to what was being done to
them; I saw nothing provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California lawyers -
some of their members still recovering from being struck with
rubber projectiles - and protesters said the LAPD tactics raised
tensions and violated civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles looked like Eastern Europe,'' said civil rights
attorney Carol Sobel, who took one of the LAPD's flat rubber
``stinger'' rounds - which are supposed to strike below the waist -
between the eyes Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing missing were the tanks from Tiananmen Square.
The message that went out is that L.A. is a police state.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were in the streets, added D2KLA organizer Lisa Fithian,
the LAPD machine was harassing, menacing and intimidating; a dark,
forbidding shadow over what should have been a showcase for
enlightened debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Constitution was the big loser,'' said Fithian,
who worked with LAPD commanders to ease tensions and to gain
concessions. ``The police are supposed to protect and serve, but
they constantly chilled people's First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the police caused the Monday night concert melee by
unnecessary displays of force at minor disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prevented it from becoming a police state,'' said ACLU
attorney Dan Tokaji, who won major concessions to get protests
closer to delegates and stop police from interfering with a staging
area near MacArthur Park. ``LAPD did their best to declare martial
law, but we didn't let it happen.''

LOS ANGELES: it happen.''.

<P>
   _ Parks said the new LAPD bears little resemblance to the
under-staffed, ill-equipped force that was pummeled by unruly
crowds and looters at the outset of the 1992 riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still talk like Rodney King happened yesterday,'' Parks
said. ``But 70 percent of the officers then are no longer on the
force. To still criticize us because of that is an unfair
assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy said the force since 1992 has grown
from about 7,000 to 9,500 officers. New and better communications
gear has been purchased, and more sophisticated training has been
instituted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a different department,'' Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights attorneys and others who have monitored the LAPD
for years are skeptical, and say the department has made no more
than superficial changes. They say the DNC only cemented LAPD's
reputation for harshness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   It's still, Tokaji said, ``Us vs. them.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD started planning for the Democratic convention over a
year ago, visiting Seattle in particular, where police were overrun
by protesters during the World Trade Organization conference and
the city's downtown suffered millions of dollars in damage, Parks
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, it was clear a massive, deterrent force would
be part of Los Angeles' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A show of force has a very calming effect on a crowd,'' Parks
said. ``Our goal was not to get out of control and have to catch
up. When you put officers in place in advance, you set the tone for
the entire event.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the LAPD's confidential ``playbook'' ended up being some
six inches thick, the crucial page was that detailing how the
police would move one step ahead of the protesters wherever they
went - either beating them to intersections or shadowing them on
the sides of marches - to ensure they did not break out of
established routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outflanked the demonstrators,'' Pomeroy said. ``We thwarted
and frustrated those intent on criminal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the flanking actions was advance intelligence, primarily
provided by an overhead helicopter that shot ``real time'' video of
the marchers for commanders in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see where they were moving in great detail,'' Pomeroy
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the video pictures of Monday's concert, featuring the
band Rage Against the Machine, that convinced command officers to
declare an unlawful assembly, Pomeroy said. The video feeds showed
a handful of protesters at the rear of the crowd tossing bottles,
chunks of concrete and signs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights lawyers and protest organizers said police
arbitrarily ended the demonstration without giving people a chance
to exit peacefully, firing rubber pellets as they tried to get out
and trampling them with horses.
</P>
<P>
   Police said new radios with more frequencies - some of them
encrypted to prevent jamming by anarchists - worked nearly
perfectly on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Without the disintegration in communications that occurred
during the 1992 riots, commanders were able to choreograph quick
response with mobile field forces, or specially trained platoons of
about 50 officers each, Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were used for rapid response, leap-frogging parades to
get to intersections while other officers walked alongside,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was that constant presence that also infuriated demonstrators
and led to widespread allegations of police infringement on their
constitutional right to free assembly. On Wednesday, demonstrators
protesting police brutality declined to enter the demonstration
area when they were met by more than 200 officers, many in riot
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the protesters' criticism, the LAPD made an effort to
be less conspicuous. Patrol cars and motorcycles were stockpiled in
alleys and back lots, their drivers waiting in reserve. The horse
detail was stabled on the nearby Los Angeles Trade-Technical
College athletic field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to lower our presence, so we kept some units out (of
sight),'' Pomeroy said. ``There was no intent to have an
overwhelming show of force like a police state.''
</P>
<P>
   While police were fully armed, they used only nonlethal weapons
to deal with unruly crowds, primarily the rubber pellets that are
supposed to skip off the ground, but which demonstrators said hit
several people in the torso. Pepper spray also was used Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stinger skips off the ground indiscriminately, striking
people in the front row,'' Parks said. ``The psychological effect
is to make them want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights lawyers said they intend to file at least one
lawsuit, and perhaps more over the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he felt the pride of officers during the week when he
visited command posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were excited about the end results,'' Parks said. ``There
had been doubts as to whether we could do this; whether we had the
will. There had been a lot of speculation about this department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC has shown the world what the LAPD is.''

   OCEANSIDE, Calif. _ Two years after Californians voted to end
bilingual education and force a million Spanish-speaking students
to immerse themselves in English as if it were a cold bath, those
students are improving in reading and other subjects at often
striking rates, according to standardized test scores released this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators had predicted catastrophe if bilingual classes
were dismantled in this state, which is home to one of every 10 of
the nation's public school children, many of them native Spanish
speakers. But the prophecies have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In second grade, for example, the average score in reading of a
student classified as limited in English increased 9 percentage
points over the last two years, to the 28th percentile from the
19th percentile in national rankings, according to the state. In
mathematics, the increase in the average score for the same
students was 14 points, to the 41st percentile from the 27th.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which represent the first attempt to measure the
new law's effects, are expected to have an impact beyond
California's borders, most immediately in Arizona, where voters
will be presented with a ballot initiative in November asking them
to outlaw bilingual education in much the same way that California
has. The California test scores are also expected to influence
Colorado, where a similar measure narrowly missed getting on the
ballot this fall, and in Massachusetts and New York, where
anti-bilingual forces are marshaling.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know precisely how much the erasure of
bilingual education contributed to the rising scores _ class sizes
in the second grade have also been reduced over the same period,
for example _ but the results are remarkable given predictions that
scores of Spanish-speaking students would plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of Ken Noonan, who likened the change in
his position on bilingual education over the last two years to a
religious conversion. Noonan, who founded the California
Association of Bilingual Educators 30 years ago and who is now the
school superintendent in this city 35 miles north of San Diego, was
among those who warned in 1998 that children newly arrived from
Mexico and Central America would stop coming to school if they were
not gradually weaned off Spanish in traditional bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would hurt kids,'' Noonan said of the ballot
initiative, which was called Proposition 227. ``The exact reverse
occurred, totally unexpected by me. The kids began to learn _ not
pick up, but learn _ formal English, oral and written, far more
quickly than I ever thought they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read the research and they tell you it takes seven
years,'' added Noonan, a Californian whose Mexican mother never
learned English. ``Here are kids, within nine months in the first
year, and they literally learned to read.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Noonan need not look further than his own district,
where, in a mirror of the state, one of every four students, or
more than 5,000, is classified as limited English proficient.
Oceanside was among the most diligent school districts in the state
in adhering to the new law, and recorded some of the biggest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In the second grade in Oceanside, for example, the average
reading score of students initially classified as limited English
jumped 19 percentage points over the last two years _ to the 32nd
percentile from the 13th, according to preliminary state figures.
Only in the 10th and 11th grades, in a reflection of the entrenched
language problems of teen-age Spanish speakers statewide, were the
increases below 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanside's performance was all the more striking when measured
against the nearby district of Vista, where half the limited
English speakers _ about 2,500 students _ were granted waivers by
the superintendent to continue in bilingual classes. In nearly
every grade, the increases in Oceanside were at least double those
in Vista, which is similar in size and economic background to
Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the results so far in California represent a
tentative affirmation of the vision of Ron Unz. Unz is the Silicon
Valley entrepreneur who almost single-handedly financed and
organized the initiative that has all but eliminated bilingual
education in California, in which students were taught math, social
studies and science in their native language until they gradually
picked up English. (Students who now wish to be taught in such
classes must seek a waiver from their districts, on the grounds
that they would otherwise be educationally or psychologically
harmed by the pace of the English immersion class.)
</P>
<P>
   Unz, who has played an active role in the Arizona effort, said
he had been dismayed to read several years ago that students across
California were languishing in bilingual classes for six years or
more, routinely failing to graduate. He also found that there was
little research that supported bilingual education, which had been
developed in Congress in the 1960s, at least in part, as a means to
send federal aid to poor Southwestern school districts. Even
supporters concede it soon became entrenched as a way to pay the
salaries of thousands of bilingual teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test scores these last two years have risen, and risen
dramatically,'' Unz said in a telephone interview. ``Something has
gone tremendously right for immigrants being educated in
California.''

</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Oceanside, as in many districts in the state, the
elimination of bilingual education has been accompanied by other
changes, making its impact hard to gauge with precision. Class
sizes in the lower elementary grades have been pared to 20, from
more than of 30 two years ago, with an infusion of state aid. For
the most intransigent readers, Spanish speakers chief among them,
an old-fashioned, sound-it-out, phonics approach to teaching
reading has replaced whole language, a more progressive approach
that encourages students to use context clues to extract meaning,
sometimes at the expense of pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   With so many variables introduced at once, along with a renewed
emphasis statewide on the importance of standardized testing, Kenji
Hakuta, a professor of education at Stanford University, argued
that few conclusions about bilingual education could be drawn from
the results, other than that ``the numbers didn't turn negative,''
as many had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Hakuta said that districts like Oceanside were posting such
sizable gains, in part, because their previous scores had been so
abysmally low _ and remained so.
</P>
<P>
   While the school districts are required to implement the new
law, it is difficult to ascertain to what degree they have been
teaching their Spanish-speaking students in English. The law
requires only that teachers instruct ``overwhelmingly'' in English.
But that is often easier to do in third grade, when the subject is
multiplication, than in 11th grade, where it might be trigonometry.
The state has mounted little effort to measure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his initial, personal opposition to the new law, Noonan
of Oceanside said that he was insistent that his district, in a
city of 152,000 whose residents range from migrant farmers to naval
officers to dot-com millionaires, would strictly follow the will of
the voters and teach Spanish-speaking students exclusively in
English.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, Noonan's district makes an interesting case study.
</P>
<P>
   Though the state permitted districts the discretion to grant
waivers, Noonan took a hard line. Of 5,000 students in the district
who, according to a basic skills test, were found to have limited
English proficiency, 150, or 3 percent, sought waivers; only 12
were granted.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in the nearby district of Vista, where parents
supporting bilingual education have created a powerful advocacy
group, about one of every two students sought a waiver from the new
law, and all such requests were granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy,'' said Dave Cowles, the Vista superintendent,
``is that we give the parent the information about the benefits and
the downside of the bilingual program, and then let them decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, for the first time in recent memory, Oceanside is
outpacing its archrival Vista.
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, the average score of third-graders who primarily
speak Spanish improved by 11 percentage points in reading over the
last two years, to the 22nd percentile; in Vista, the gain was a
more modest 5 percentage points, to the 18th percentile. In fifth
grade in Oceanside, limited English speakers gained 10 percentage
points in reading, with the average score in the 19th percentile;
in Vista, there was no increase, the average score of limited
English speakers staying flat, in the 12th percentile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to comment on which ultimately works better,''
said Cowles, the Vista superintendent. Yet he added, ``If these
results are indicative of how students learn best, then we have to
take them into account when we talk to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, virtually all vestiges of bilingual education have
been disassembled, including at Garrison Elementary, a
stucco-coated building surrounded by eucalyptus trees, where nearly
one of every two students is a native Spanish speaker. There,
Leticia Cortez, a certified bilingual teacher, now teaches
mathematics in English to her Spanish-speaking first graders. She
resorts to speaking Spanish to a student only if he appears to be
in emotional distress, and then only to counsel him, not to
instruct.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Christian Dominguez, 7, whose broad grin
is usually flanked by deep dimples, but who cried for the first two
weeks he spent in Cortez's class, which he entered only days after
arriving from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I could talk in English,'' he recalled, ``was
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But nine months later, Christian is able to read short books
about dinosaurs and the cartoon character Arthur, while
understanding what he hears on his favorite television show,
``X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Says his mother, Rocio, 28, a baby sitter, ``I'm happy, oh,
wow!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is so much English being spoken by parents and
children and teachers in Oceanside that Gabriela Diaz, 8, who will
soon enter the third grade, has experienced an unforeseen
consequence of Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friends from Mexico come here,'' she said, ``I don't
understand what they're saying.''

20-SOMETHING GYMNASTS FEND FOR THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the malapropisms of Bela Karolyi there is great
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the remake of the classic movie ``The
Magnificent Seven,'' now in ad hoc production at the Olympic
gymnastics trials.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, there would be great sentimental value in the
last three of the aforementioned Magnificents riding off into the
sunset, or at very least flying around the world together to
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Why not have Shannon Miller, Dominique Dawes and Amy Chow avenge
the attrition that has claimed four of their fabled mates from the
gold-medal class of 1996?
</P>
<P>
   College and normal life got Kerri Strug and Amanda Borden.
Athletic old age brought down Jaycee Phelps this past week.
Grinding bone against bone in her rapidly aging knee took out
Dominique Moceanu. Why not let the survivors carry the banner into
the new century?
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the quadrennial new age of women's
gymnastics. The most attractive televised sport for women at the
Summer Games is constantly reinventing itself. This is the year of
the mature woman, with the minimum age now an advanced 16, by
international mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Bela hates the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is stupidest thing,'' he bellowed Friday night. ``Is
crazy discrimination. This has nothing to do with '96ers. They
would have been here anyway. Is good. They make a living on tours.
Good reason to come back. But what about all the little guys who
are good enough to compete?''
</P>
<P>
   The old libertarian sees this as a discrimination issue. So what
if some past gymnasts looked like the semifinals of the Miss
Anorexia contest. Those little pixies could stay on that beam.
</P>
<P>
   Now the rules have changed. At the preliminary round for women
held Friday night, there were ample signs of adulthood _ fuller
physiques, even signs of 20-something maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these grown-up-looking people are still agile after all
these years. Dawes, 23, is a college student and an actress.
Miller, 23, is a married college student. Chow, 22, is a biology
major at Stanford with an eye toward becoming a pediatrician. And
there they were, still vaulting and balancing and cartwheeling and
swinging from the bars.
</P>
<P>
   What a lovely concept. The last three Magnificents. Chow
finished the prelims in a solid third place, including the results
of the nationals. Dawes remains seventh over all. And Miller, with
no previous score because of an injury at the nationals, had the
seventh best score Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Bela comes in. The coach, the old carrier of
wounded athletes, was believed to have a soft spot in his heart for
the warriors who won the gold in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bela did not survive in Romania without keeping his
pragmatic eye on the prize. With his Carpathian I-am-the-walrus
mustache now turning white, he prowled the sidelines Friday
inspecting the new women and the old women, the relatively young
and the relatively old.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary order is: Elise Ray, 18; Kristen Maloney, 19;
Chow, 22; Jamie Dantscher, 18; Morgan White, 17; and Vanessa Atler,
18.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the committee will go into a room and choose six
gymnasts, not bound to pick the six top finishers in these trials.
Why then, you ask, call them trials? Look, Bela was not raised in a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bela was asked if he could imagine a scenario in which all three
of the Magnificents would make this team.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't he justify Chow as one of his four all-around
competitors, and hope for some specialty work from Miller and
Dawes? The old boy totally annihilated the concept of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I say, the first six places are in very good
shape,'' Bela said. ``If competition was today, I would be happy
with order tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That would leave two of his golden oldies out in the cold.
Didn't it seem cold, putting two of his stars on notice that they
had 48 hours to leapfrog over a bunch of people?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you,'' Bela told everybody, ``48 hours can be
great difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But could he _ Bela was asked again _ see any way that all three
Magnificents would make this team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very unlikable,'' Bela pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely? Somebody asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah, unlikable,'' Bela replied.
</P>
<P>
   He meant unlikely, but unlikable worked, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is split,'' he announced. ``A new generation. As
tonight's performance showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bela does have a sentimental side. However, it is usually
expressed at medal ceremonies. And first he must get to the medal
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the movie. In his loose and highly flexible plot,
only the strong survive. The script says nothing good about age.  &QL;

CONVENTION CONTROL RESTORES POLICE PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAPD Detective Robert Holcomb's step had the
bounce of a winner as he strode across Staples Center's security
apron in midweek of the Democratic National Convention, holding a
couple of black riot helmets and draped with an arsenal of gear.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 marchers protesting police abuse were a few minutes
to the north on Figueroa Street, but the detective had time to
chat.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, a police surveillance helicopter beamed photos of
protesters' location, marchers were flanked by ground troops, 200
riot-gear-clad officers awaited them, and nearby 30 LAPD cars and
some 20 horses were on alert.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department was ready and Holcomb, like
other police and city officials, was certain the situation was
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been very good for morale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a department that's been unable to shake the international
shame of African-American motorist Rodney King's televised 1991
beating by white LAPD officers, the 1992 riots that followed those
officers' acquittal in state court, and more recently the Rampart
corruption scandal, the DNC was a high-stakes venture for the
department and its chief, Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   And it turns out a much-needed win that puts some shine back on
the badge. Civil liberties lawyers and some protesters complain
bitterly about the LAPD's tactics, but nearly all local officials,
convention officials and visiting press reports gave the LAPD
credit for keeping the peace effectively.
</P>
<P>
   That the city did not burn, that no one was seriously injured,
that property damage was minimal, and that there were only 194
arrests compared with 390 during the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia two weeks ago caused Parks to claim complete
vindication for his department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was textbook,'' Parks said in an interview with the Los
Angeles Daily News. ``We had an outstanding operational plan that
took over a year to put together, we had trained 5,000-plus
officers, and the people we had in critical places made the right
critical decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, and other city and county elected leaders
who were hosting thousands of out-of-towners, lavished praise on
the LAPD for checking disturbances with an overwhelming show of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed they are a world-class department and one we all
should respect,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was even bringing up the $7.5 million in overtime the
city expects to pay for the 750 officers per shift.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates overwhelmingly seemed grateful to the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we checked into the Holiday Inn (near Staples), everyone
said, You're at ground zero,'' said Indiana delegate Ray Scheele,
who watched the demonstrations from his window. ``The police did an
incredible job. It improved my view of the LAPD, after all these
incidents in the past few years. We're familiar with Rodney King,
even in Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hicks, executive director of the Los Angeles City Human
Relations Commission, said he weighed the success of the police
response day by day as he walked with demonstrators and made notes
of the confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measure is that not many people were arrested, there were
no serious injuries, no serious property damage,'' Hicks said.
``The other measure is whether civil liberties were violated, and I
think in the main protesters were able to get their message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said that while LAPD officers may have appeared more
menacing in their dark blue or black riot gear than did
Philadelphia officers, who wore shorts and kibitzed with
demonstrators, he was more concerned with their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't care what they looked like; I cared about conduct,''
he said. ``Generally, I saw LAPD reacting to what was being done to
them; I saw nothing provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California lawyers -
some of their members still recovering from being struck with
rubber projectiles - and protesters said the LAPD tactics raised
tensions and violated civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles looked like Eastern Europe,'' said civil rights
attorney Carol Sobel, who took one of the LAPD's flat rubber
``stinger'' rounds - which are supposed to strike below the waist -
between the eyes Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing missing were the tanks from Tiananmen Square.
The message that went out is that L.A. is a police state.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were in the streets, added D2KLA organizer Lisa Fithian,
the LAPD machine was harassing, menacing and intimidating; a dark,
forbidding shadow over what should have been a showcase for
enlightened debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Constitution was the big loser,'' said Fithian,
who worked with LAPD commanders to ease tensions and to gain
concessions. ``The police are supposed to protect and serve, but
they constantly chilled people's First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the police caused the Monday night concert melee by
unnecessary displays of force at minor disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prevented it from becoming a police state,'' said ACLU
attorney Dan Tokaji, who won major concessions to get protests
closer to delegates and stop police from interfering with a staging
area near MacArthur Park. ``LAPD did their best to declare martial
law, but we didn't let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   _ Parks said the new LAPD bears little resemblance to the
under-staffed, ill-equipped force that was pummeled by unruly
crowds and looters at the outset of the 1992 riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still talk like Rodney King happened yesterday,'' Parks
said. ``But 70 percent of the officers then are no longer on the
force. To still criticize us because of that is an unfair
assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy said the force since 1992 has grown
from about 7,000 to 9,500 officers. New and better communications
gear has been purchased, and more sophisticated training has been
instituted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a different department,'' Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights attorneys and others who have monitored the LAPD
for years are skeptical, and say the department has made no more
than superficial changes. They say the DNC only cemented LAPD's
reputation for harshness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   It's still, Tokaji said, ``Us vs. them.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD started planning for the Democratic convention over a
year ago, visiting Seattle in particular, where police were overrun
by protesters during the World Trade Organization conference and
the city's downtown suffered millions of dollars in damage, Parks
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, it was clear a massive, deterrent force would
be part of Los Angeles' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A show of force has a very calming effect on a crowd,'' Parks
said. ``Our goal was not to get out of control and have to catch
up. When you put officers in place in advance, you set the tone for
the entire event.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the LAPD's confidential ``playbook'' ended up being some
six inches thick, the crucial page was that detailing how the
police would move one step ahead of the protesters wherever they
went - either beating them to intersections or shadowing them on
the sides of marches - to ensure they did not break out of
established routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outflanked the demonstrators,'' Pomeroy said. ``We thwarted
and frustrated those intent on criminal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the flanking actions was advance intelligence, primarily
provided by an overhead helicopter that shot ``real time'' video of
the marchers for commanders in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see where they were moving in great detail,'' Pomeroy
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the video pictures of Monday's concert, featuring the
band Rage Against the Machine, that convinced command officers to
declare an unlawful assembly, Pomeroy said. The video feeds showed
a handful of protesters at the rear of the crowd tossing bottles,
chunks of concrete and signs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights lawyers and protest organizers said police
arbitrarily ended the demonstration without giving people a chance
to exit peacefully, firing rubber pellets as they tried to get out
and trampling them with horses.
</P>
<P>
   Police said new radios with more frequencies - some of them
encrypted to prevent jamming by anarchists - worked nearly
perfectly on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Without the disintegration in communications that occurred
during the 1992 riots, commanders were able to choreograph quick
response with mobile field forces, or specially trained platoons of
about 50 officers each, Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were used for rapid response, leap-frogging parades to
get to intersections while other officers walked alongside,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was that constant presence that also infuriated demonstrators
and led to widespread allegations of police infringement on their
constitutional right to free assembly. On Wednesday, demonstrators
protesting police brutality declined to enter the demonstration
area when they were met by more than 200 officers, many in riot
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the protesters' criticism, the LAPD made an effort to
be less conspicuous. Patrol cars and motorcycles were stockpiled in
alleys and back lots, their drivers waiting in reserve. The horse
detail was stabled on the nearby Los Angeles Trade-Technical
College athletic field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to lower our presence, so we kept some units out (of
sight),'' Pomeroy said. ``There was no intent to have an
overwhelming show of force like a police state.''
</P>
<P>
   While police were fully armed, they used only nonlethal weapons
to deal with unruly crowds, primarily the rubber pellets that are
supposed to skip off the ground, but which demonstrators said hit
several people in the torso. Pepper spray also was used Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stinger skips off the ground indiscriminately, striking
people in the front row,'' Parks said. ``The psychological effect
is to make them want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights lawyers said they intend to file at least one
lawsuit, and perhaps more over the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he felt the pride of officers during the week when he
visited command posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were excited about the end results,'' Parks said. ``There
had been doubts as to whether we could do this; whether we had the
will. There had been a lot of speculation about this department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC has shown the world what the LAPD is.''

   SEATTLE _ Exactly ninety years ago, on Aug. 20, 1910, in the
choking heat of a summer without rain in the northern Rockies, the
sun disappeared from the sky and a sound not unlike cannon fire
began rattling throughout Montana and Idaho. The Big Burn, as the
3-million-acre firestorm of 1910 was called, eventually consumed
entire towns, killed 87 people and burned a lesson into the
fledgling U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the service vowed, it would snuff out every fire, at
one point swearing to do so by 10 a.m. on the day after the fire
started. The best-known forester of that time, Gifford Pinchot,
equated wildfire with slavery as a historic scourge of the nation.
Another, Bernhard Fernow, blamed ``bad habits and loose morals''
for the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the midst of the worst wildfire year in nearly half a
century, a new round of finger-pointing is under way. Touring
Montana last week, House Speaker Dennis Hastert blamed the Clinton
administration for not logging the tinder-dry forests.
Environmentalists pointed at the timber industry and development
for altering forest ecology and creating an artificial landscape
ripe for catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forest Service remains focused on its own primary
culprit: the symbol of fire eradication, Smokey the Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The era of prevention and suppression represented by Smokey and
his shovel may have been good for safety, but it was not the best
thing for forests. The agency had reached that conclusion even
before receiving the additional evidence that foresters drew from
the fires that tore through almost half of Yellowstone National
Park in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is as much a part of nature as creeks and wildflowers. Most
forests have a natural cycle, in which a purging burn comes through
every 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. The cycle may be suppressed,
foresters say, but only at the cost of more powerful fires when it
re-emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem when people say these fires are destroying
all these areas,'' said Wiebe, the former Smokejumper. ``It's just
not correct to say a forest is destroyed by fire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when fires were routinely suppressed, forests
choked themselves with excess growth, creating better habitats for
tree-killing insects. The dying trees became tinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forests are long overdue,'' said Mick Harrington, a
research fire ecologist with the Forest Service in Montana, a state
that has just been declared a disaster area. ``They were just ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires that have already run through 5 million acres this
year are hotter, faster-burning, more ferocious than any burns of
modern times, say the people battling them. And a number of reports
say future fire seasons may be worse, identifying about 40 million
acres of public land as being at risk of catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fire suppression is only part of the problem. In some forests,
experts say, logging has removed the biggest and most
fire-resistant trees. Their replacements _ some planted, some
natural _ are crowded stands of young and disease-prone trees, with
500 or more to the acre, where there used to be 50. Foresters also
point to other elements _ excessive grazing by cattle and sheep,
diversion of rivers to newly developing areas _ that have
contributed to what some call ghost forests, spectral stands of
diseased and dying timber now baking, if not yet burning, in the
August sun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are many new areas demanding fire protection.
Homes and vacation cottages that have sprung up at the edge of
national forest boundaries have become firefighters' front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so good at putting out fires because that's what
the public wants,'' said Lindon Wiebe, a fire ecology specialist
with the Forest Service in Washington, and a former Smokejumper, as
the service's firefighters are called. ``But what we can do is
pretty small compared to what Mother Nature wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as people have gradually learned not to build homes in
areas prone to flooding, they need to understand the danger of
erecting structures in fire zones, says Dr. Phil Omi, a professor
of forest fire science at Colorado State University and director of
the Western Forest Fire Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to get the message to these people that they
are putting themselves at risk, whether it's the insurance industry
or the government,'' Omi said. But he said he could not blame the
Forest Service, or homeowners, for being slow to understand the
nature of wild fire in the West. ``Our understanding of forest fire
ecology is relatively new,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those trying to address the future fire threat are focusing on
two solutions: taking out more trees by logging or thinning, and
deliberately setting fires.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, logging in national forests has declined by
nearly 75 percent, and some critics blame this decline for the
explosive fires. A number of Western senators back the idea of
allowing the timber industry to remove more trees.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmental groups point out that the biggest fires
in Montana and Idaho are burning not in wilderness areas, but in
land that has been developed or logged. Such areas also account for
90 percent of the acreage identified as most vulnerable to
wildfire, the Forest Service says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial logging is not a prescription for forest health _
it is one of the major causes of unhealthy forest conditions,''
said Thomas Powers, chairman of the economics department at the
University of Montana, whose specialty is natural resource issues.
</P>
<P>
   The other solution _ planned fire _ has become a public
relations debacle. Last year, a record 1.4 million acres of Forest
Service land was deliberately burned. Most prescribed burns go off
without trouble. But it only takes one to stir public ire. And this
year, the one that got away, a 43,000-acre blaze set by the
National Park Service near Los Alamos, N.M., destroyed more than
200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how convinced the experts are that Los Alamos was
an exception, the fires now raging in every state of the West look
horrific on television, blackening national treasures like Mesa
Verde National Park and raining embers on popular campgrounds.

FIVE DAYS THAT SHOOK LOS ANGELES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For one week, Los Angeles became the center of
presidential politics, the focal point of political dissent, the
party capital of the world and a testing ground for police
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in chronological order, are some of the week's memorable
events surrounding the Democratic National Convention:
</P>
<P>
   - It started with a weekend of parties punctuated by sightings
of President Clinton and his U.S. Senate candidate wife, Hillary.
The first couple so captivated the Tinseltown party circuit they
threatened to put Vice President Al Gore, the convention headliner,
on the B list.
</P>
<P>
   - On Sunday afternoon, 4,000 protesters converged on Pershing
Square to demand freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted and
sentenced to death in the murder of a police officer in
Philadelphia. As the city's much-prepared police in riot gear
watched closely, the march to Staples Center started and ended
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   - Trouble was in the air in Santa Monica on Sunday night, as
protesters linked arms to block Democrats from entering a party
thrown by corporate sponsors such as tobacco company Philip Morris
and defense contractor Raytheon for centrist members of the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Monica police horse nuzzled the human chain apart, and
the party, and protest, went on.
</P>
<P>
   - Clinton owned the town on Monday, winning the loudest cheers
from the 4,339 convention delegates - louder even than those for
Gore during a video clip of former, present and would-be Democratic
presidents. Clinton took credit for the nation's economic recovery
and continued prosperity, for lower taxes, crime and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   - Just outside Staples Center during Clinton's speech, the
protest rock band Rage Against the Machine, known for its CD ``The
Battle of Los Angeles,'' drew a crowd of 10,000. At dusk, a few
concert-goers began climbing the convention's 12-foot security
fence and others began hurling things at the police, like parking
signs with concrete bases and whatever else they could detach from
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Police ordered the crowd to leave, and 20 minutes later they
moved in with overwhelming force, firing rubber bullets, bean-bag
shot and pepper spray at concertgoers, demonstrators and news
photographers alike.
</P>
<P>
   - The commander in chief took charge of the Monday night party
circuit, winning the Oscar for Best President (unsanctioned by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, they pointed out
later) from Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening wore down, however, the president who had beaten
his enemies and survived scandal and impeachment, retreated from
the Democratic Party's Los Angeles sound stage with a nod to his
would-be successor.
</P>
<P>
   - With Clinton out of town, it was time to bring order to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Garden Grove, had moved her fund-raising
party out of the Playboy Mansion, as dictated by party leaders. But
on Monday she also declined to speak at the convention, saying she
didn't want people to think she changed the party venue to
Universal CityWalk just to save her slot at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   - Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, said she wasn't sure she
could support Gore because of running-mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut. The No. 2 man on the ticket may not share her views on
key issues, especially considering that he expressed support for
Proposition 209, which outlawed affirmative action in California.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman leaped into the breach on Tuesday, however, telling
Waters and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that he
supported affirmative action - just not racial quotas - and leading
the group in singing ``Happy Birthday'' to Waters.
</P>
<P>
   - Tuesday night was Camelot 2000, with Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, daughter of former President John F. Kennedy; Robert
F. Kennedy Jr.; and Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., invoking the
Democrats' one brief shining moment, as the song goes.
</P>
<P>
   All spoke warmly of Al Gore, comparing his beliefs to those of
the slain president and his brother, Robert Kennedy, who was
assassinated in Los Angeles at the Ambassador Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   - Wednesday night, Lieberman introduced himself to the nation.
He marveled that ``Only in America'' could someone like him - an
Orthodox Jew whose grandmother was harassed for her religion in
Europe, and whose in-laws are Holocaust survivors - run for the
nation's second-highest office.
</P>
<P>
   He also took on the Republicans in a humorous vein, joking that
``We may be near Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar
has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   - Following Lieberman was actor Tommy Lee Jones, who nominated
Gore - his college roommate at Harvard University - with a speech
not about his politics, but his personal side. Gore's daughter,
Karenna Gore Schiff, seconded the nomination with a speech also
about his human side, saying ``Dad is a man of faith in the most
gutsy, practical sense.'' Gore himself made a surprise walk-on
appearance after her speech, giving her a bear hug and waving to
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   - Outside Staples Center on Wednesday, the protests - and
clashes with police - continued. During one march from MacArthur
Park to the Rampart Division station protesting alleged police
brutality and the Rampart scandal, 38 people were arrested on
suspicion of blocking the building.
</P>
<P>
   At another protest outside Staples, about 2,000 activists
flooded the streets, also protesting the LAPD. Some threw sticks
and bottles that contained various liquids like urine or gasoline.
Police responded with pepper spray and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the LAPD was overzealous and brutal in its
response, while defenders like Mayor Richard Riordan and District
Attorney Gil Garcetti called it an appropriate, measured response.
</P>
<P>
   - Thursday, the concluding day of the convention, Gore accepted
the nomination with a 51-minute speech that was detail-oriented,
outlining numerous positions on policy issues, including passing a
hate-crimes law, supporting abortion rights, adding 50,000 police
nationwide and mandatory background checks for guns.

FAMILY FILES SUIT OVER BABY MIX-UP

<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ After giving birth to a boy, Linda Burgin
pressed baby to flesh for 45 minutes of newborn bonding in the dark
of her room at Northridge Hospital Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But when the lights shone bright, it wasn't Dylan she and her
husband saw - but someone else's baby.
</P>
<P>
   The Burgins are so distraught over the brief switch in 1998 that
they have sued the hospital, claiming negligence and malpractice.
They've also sought therapy for ``separation anxiety,'' fled
California for another state and forsaken having additional
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had dark hair: It was a Spanish baby,'' said James Burgin,
49, of Phoenix, a former Tarzana resident, recalling the family
ordeal on May 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screamed, Linda screamed. The nurse said: `I checked his
wristband: This is your baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   A Van Nuys judge recently rejected a motion from the hospital
that sought to prevent disclosure of the switch on grounds that
publicity could affect a fair trial and the hospital's ``economic
interest.'' The case is scheduled to return to court in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Burgins, who are white, are seeking unspecified emotional
and medical damages. While they bonded with and breast-fed the
wrong baby, they said they are worried another mother may have
nursed their son and passed on a communicable disease. The child
has not been diagnosed with any malady.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials declined to discuss the Burgins' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But hospital attorneys, in a statement to the court last month,
said Northridge Hospital acknowledges the baby switch, but said no
harm was done to the Burgins or their baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northridge Hospital Medical Center,'' the statement says,
``does not deny this factual allegation and maintains that their
conduct complied with the standard of care in the community and
that nothing they did caused or contributed to the plaintiff's
alleged injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, while not willing to discuss its standard of care,
issued another statement stressing its exemplary scores in its
accreditation survey last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most hospitals, we have concise protocols, safeguards and
checks and balances in our systems,'' said Andie Bogdan, Northridge
Hospital director of marketing. ``Our commitment to professional
development is substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge Hospital Medical Center is owned by Catholic
Healthcare West and has a 426-bed facility in Northridge and a
209-bed campus in Van Nuys. It was re-accredited last year.
</P>
<P>
   Baby switches, accidental and intentional, are relatively rare
across the nation. There have been six reported incidents of baby
swaps and 11 abductions since 1995, when they were first recorded,
according to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a record of the (Northridge) incident,'' said
JCAHO spokeswoman Donna Larkin. The state Department of Health
Services, which oversees and investigates hospitals, had no record
of the Burgin incident, either. The reporting of such incidents,
both agencies said, is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Coggan, a Beverly Hills attorney who represents the Burgins,
said the hospital was negligent because its nurse failed to follow
a procedure set up to identify newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was absolutely egregious,'' Coggan said. ``But
what happened afterward was even worse. The hospital is now trying
to argue that, even though they admit it happened, they're not
responsible for the actions of their employee.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dylan was born, his father James was pushing 47, his mother
Linda, 30. He was their first and only child.
</P>
<P>
   Until their case is settled, the Burgins say their 2-year-old
son won't wean from his mother, won't leave his parents' bed at
night and will not accept a baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly separation anxiety,'' Linda Vahl Burgin, 31, said.
''We never really bonded with our son.''
</P>
<P>
   James Burgin, a record company consultant for top-50 radio, said
he looks at Dylan and wonders about his paternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing has been a nightmare for us,'' he said.
``They (hospital staff) took the three most precious days of our
lives and ruined them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this happened, this was so devastating we couldn't bring
our son up in Los Angeles.''

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ In a test of its commitment to improving its
human rights record, the Colombian government has promised a
full-scale investigation into the killings by army troops of six
elementary school children last week.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the children were gunned down on Tuesday, top
commanders of the army publicly blamed guerrillas involved in
Colombia's long-running insurgencies for the deaths, saying that
rebels were using the children as human shields in a gunbattle. But
throughout the week, various witnesses came forward to say that
there were no rebels near the scene of the shooting, in a coffee
field in northwestern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The episode came at a particularly embarrassing moment for
President Andres Pastrana, who is preparing for President Clinton's
six-hour visit in the resort port of Cartagena on August 30.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
to certify whether or not Colombia has met several human rights
conditions in order to be eligible to receive the military
component of a new $1.3 billion aid program designed to combat drug
trafficking in two southern provinces dominated by Marxist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   If Albright does not certify Colombia, Clinton can still grant
the country a national security waiver to release the aid. A halt
in aid, which Clinton administration officials say is vital to
slowing the flow of Colombian cocaine to the United States, is
considered highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The government has announced that it is investigating 25
soldiers and officers of the army's 4th Division in the shootings
of the children and says that 43 investigators of three government
agencies have been put on the case. Forensic specialists have
already been sent to the village of Pueblo Rico to examine the
bodies. Several other children were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the children killed were on a school hiking trip from
the village of La Pica. Two others were residents who lived in the
coffee fields where the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials insist that the killings were not
intentional. ``The only option we can definitely rule out is that
Colombian soldiers would have fired intentionally on the
children,'' said Attorney General Alfonso Gomez Mendez.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the incident occurred as units of two army
battalions were chasing rebels of the National Liberation Army, the
country's second-largest rebel group best known for kidnappings and
bombing oil pipelines. Francisco Galan, a spokesman for the group,
denied his forces were anywhere near the combat.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings have been harshly criticized by human rights
activists here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas Division of Human
Rights Watch, said the incident ``goes straight to the heart of the
issue _ which is the abuse of the armed forces, including attacks
on the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't think Colombia qualifies at this stage for
U.S. military support.''
</P>
<P>
   Several aid groups, including Save the Children and the
Christian Children's Fund, have called on the Colombian government
to give a complete accounting of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials condemned the shooting, and said they
expect a full investigation.

   Management Council Likely to Say 49ers Violated Salary-Cap Rules
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Policy was president of the San Francisco 49ers from 1991
to 1999, and during that period the team captured Super Bowl XXIX
and never won fewer than 10 games. Policy was considered a genius
by many, able to massage the salary cap without breaking a sweat,
and he quickly became one of the highest-profile executives in the
sport. When his competitors whispered that he was bending the
rules, those words were often ignored as jealous ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Policy is now running the Cleveland Browns, and depending on
whom you believe, either his past has finally caught him or he is
enduring one of the worst witch-hunts of all time.
</P>
<P>
   According to team and league officials, the National Football
League's management council is close to finishing its more than
yearlong investigation into whether Policy and the 49ers violated
salary-cap rules with contracts involving the former tight end
Brent Jones and the former quarterbacks Steve Young and Jim
Druckenmiller. The council, according to those people, will most
likely conclude that there is sufficient evidence to believe that
serious violations did occur during Policy's reign, specifically
during the 1997 season, when the 49ers reached the National
Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Policy defended his actions in San Francisco,
insisting he did nothing wrong, and hinting the accusations, in
part, are a result of jealousy from other owners who were
constantly beaten by the 49ers under his reign. Policy compared the
investigation of him to that of President Clinton by Kenneth Starr,
the former independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fine line in the NFL between jealousy and focused
competitiveness,'' Policy said last week. ``I have tremendous
respect for most of the owners in the league, but on Sunday, if I
lose to them, I don't like them very much. If you take my situation
when I was with the 49ers, we won a lot. So multiply those feelings
I was talking about, and all those victories we had, those playoff
wins, the five Super Bowl appearances, and there is a subconscious
delight in watching a competitor get taken down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   If the management council _ which in these cases acts like the
prosecution in a criminal trial _ determines that Policy did
violate salary-cap guidelines, the council will try to negotiate a
settlement with Policy and others involved.
</P>
<P>
   If there was no settlement, the case would be turned over to a
special master. If that person determined Policy had violated the
rules, it would be up to Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to decide
punishment. The 49ers might lose a first-round draft pick while
Policy could be fined or suspended. The management council is also
investigating Dwight Clark, who worked in the front office under
Policy in San Francisco and followed him to Cleveland, as well as
the agents for Young and Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Policy seems primed for a long fight. ``The
management council has been extremely intrusive,'' he said. ``The
documents they have requested have been numerous; there have been a
number of witnesses and depositions. It has been relentless.
They've been more thorough than Ken Starr was during his days in
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want an acceptable conclusion, as do I. But I refuse to
agree to any settlement that would send the wrong message. I do not
feel that I personally did anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is conflicting information as to what kind of discipline _
if the accusations are proven true _ Tagliabue would be able to
levy against Policy. The NFL believes it could suspend Policy, if
that was deemed appropriate, under the large umbrella of conduct
detrimental to the league. However, the collective bargaining
agreement says that if a special master rules against Policy, the
only punishment allowed is a maximum fine of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought things could get nasty between himself
and the NFL, Policy said: ``I'll do everything possible to make
sure that does not happen. But like everything else, if this ever
reaches the stage where there is litigation, when you put it in
that environment, you don't have warm and fuzzy feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to team and league officials, at least one owner has
asked high-ranking NFL officials, including Tagliabue, to kick
Policy out of the league for good. Still other owners have said
that Policy should be suspended for at least one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners who are saying I should be severely punished are
basing those comments on what they hear, not the facts,'' Policy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Policy's defenders insist he has never broken the rules, and the
reason he is being investigated is that he was so successful. His
supporters also point out that none of the Super Bowl years are
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the NFL consider salary-cap violations to be almost as
big a threat to competitive balance as drugs or gambling. That is
definitely not a stretch. If one team can pay players under the
table to get around salary-cap rules, while all others are abiding
by the guidelines, the cheating team can win faster and keep that
winning team together longer.
</P>
<P>
   According to team officials, there are several main issues in
the 49ers case.
</P>
<P>
   _ The NFL says that Druckenmiller's original San Francisco
contract contained a fictitious year added on for salary-cap
purposes. The NFL believes that by adding that extra year, the
49ers got more cap room. Policy said that because of the
investigation he could not get into specifics but that
Druckenmiller's deal was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Young, the NFL maintains, took a reduction in salary to help
the 49ers sign Druckenmiller; he was promised that the money would
be given back the following the year, and he got it back. The
collective bargaining agreement bans undisclosed agreements,
promises or understandings of any kind involving salary that are
not disclosed to the league. Policy said the management council
examined Young's contract at the time and approved it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jones went back to the team seeking a payment believed to be
between $500,000 and $1 million he said was owed to him. Jones says
the payment was promised to him after retirement for ``other
services.'' The NFL believes Jones performed no services and the
payment was really for playing. Policy said he did everything by
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Policy said his main concern is for the reputation of the 49ers.
``I have no love for the people running the organization now,''
Policy said of the York family, which now controls the team. ``But
I will always be loyal to that franchise.''

   Lapses in Jets' Tempers
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bill Parcells _ the grumpy
he-says-jump-players-say-how-high Parcells _ is no longer coaching
the team, do players feel as if they get away with more?
</P>
<P>
   The former Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said in an
interview that earlier this preseason, quarterback Vinny Testaverde
got into a heated argument with one of the offensive coaches.
Johnson stays in regular contact with many of the Jets players and
coaches. The team said it had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week linebacker Bryan Cox and the defensive line coach Ray
Hamilton got into a profanity-laced argument during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Would these incidents have happened under Parcells? Jets players
say arguments between coaches and players have happened before,
even under Parcells, and are a part of football.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, do players need an imposing personality to keep
them in check?
</P>
<P>
   Giants players had little respect for the soft-spoken Ray
Handley when he replaced Parcells, and the laid-back Pete Carroll
was all but ignored by most New England players after following
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, the former Giants quarterback Kent Graham is
clearly having a better training camp than the starter, Kordell
Stewart. Going into this weekend, in three games, Stewart has a
43.9 passer rating. Coach Bill Cowher plans to stick with Stewart
as long as possible ... The new XFL has received 15,000
applications from players. &QL;

AS HELP ARRIVES, RUSSIAN NAVY SAYS ALL HANDS ON SUNKEN SUB ARE
LIKELY DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian Navy said Saturday that all 118 members of
the crew of the wrecked nuclear-powered submarine Kursk are now
probably dead, or will be before a British rescue submarine and a
team of Norwegian divers can undertake another desperate attempt to
open a rear hatch and look for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement broadcast on Russian state television from the
Northern Fleet headquarters at Severomorsk, Adm. Mikhail Motsak,
the chief of staff, said the powerful explosion that ripped through
the vessel a week ago had killed most of the crew in the first
minutes of the disaster. There was extensive flooding of the
submarine's nine compartments, he said, meaning that any sailors
who survived the explosion had to endure flood conditions that
further compressed any breathable air in the submarine to what he
called lethal ``high-pressure pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow flooding in the tail sections was taking place, which
inevitably shortened the time for the crew to survive there and
shortened the maximum time of sustaining life that we could count
on,'' Motsak said. ``It is possible that pressure in the
compartments is very high. There are air pockets there, but in fact
we crossed that critical line for the sustaining of life which is
envisaged in all the guiding documents. This line, in fact, was
being crossed yesterday, today and maybe tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any crew noises emanating from the submarine
since Monday led the navy command to conclude ``that the critical
state of the personnel has come,'' he said, adding, ``No matter how
hard it is to say this, it is quite likely that we will have to
admit the worst expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The admiral, speaking in a grim voice, said the accident ``was
the worst catastrophe that I personally have known, and the worst
in the history of the submarine fleet.'' He described some of the
drama that had accompanied the detection of noises from the crew
after the giant attack submarine, with twin nuclear reactors in its
power plant, sank in 350 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard noises by crew members acting in accordance with the
rules of organizations of communication with sunken submarines,''
he said. ``Analysis of the noises from the tail sections showed
that the crew members were telling us that water was coming into
the sections _ it was infiltrating _ and they asked us to supply
air.'' Later, he said, some crew members, desperate to escape the
flooding, might have tried to open the rear hatch of the Kursk,
causing sea water to flood in and kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The systems responsible for a tight seal in that compartment
broke down,'' he said, perhaps because ``some submariners tried to
leave the sub from more than 100 meters depth, which is not
envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Only deep sea divers, he said, can verify whether the hatch seal
has been broken. If it was, he said, that would explain why navy
rescue vehicles that have managed to dock on the hatch have not
been able to evacuate water from the airtight corridor that must be
established for rescue to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews have reported that when they tried to pump water
out of this docking corridor, water just kept flooding in. At
first, navy officials believed that deformed deck plates around the
hatch were preventing a tight lock. Now, Motsak said, they also
believe that the rear compartment under the hatch may be flooded,
causing water to rush into the docking corridor from inside the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the explosion that proved fatal to the ship and
crew are still unknown, the admiral said. He went through varous
possibilities, saying that while the navy believed that the ship
might have been involved in a collision, there might also have been
an internal explosion of unknown origin.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also believed, he added, that it was possible that
the 14,000-ton submarine had hit a World War II mine. He said that
between 1992 and 1999, six such mines had been discovered in the
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral said it was difficult to pronounce the crew beyond
hope ``because I have known the submarine's commander,'' referring
to Capt. Gennadi Lyachin, ``for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I appointed him to that post,'' Motsak said, ``I went to sea
with him to inspect the training of that crew, and this was one of
our best crews.''
</P>
<P>
   Motsak said the rescue operation would now move to the ``second
stage,'' but he did not specify whether that would mean calling off
the current rescue operation, or whether it would proceed at a more
deliberate pace aimed at penetrating the 490-foot submarine to
evacuate bodies.
</P>
<P>
   At least two efforts to dock on the wrecked hull occurred in the
hours before the admiral spoke Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Motsak said that the navy would eventually raise the submarine
to remove its weapons and nuclear reactors from the seabed, but
that ``it may take time.''
</P>
<P>
   A British-built minisubmarine loaded on the Norwegian ship
Normand Pioneer was within sight of the rescue flotilla in the
Barents Sea. Navy officials said some period of consultations among
Russian, British and Norwegian rescue teams would be necessary
before the British vehicle could make its first dive, late Saturday
night or early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A navy spokesman, Igor Dygalo, cautioned that the arrival of
foreign experts and their equipment ``should not be viewed as a
panacea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know the degree of damage inside the submarine and
do not know what the crew has done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Naval experts in the United States and Russia said a build-up of
air pressure inside any flooded compartments could have killed
members of the crew within a few days of the sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Eduard Baltin, the former commander of Soviet submarine
forces in the Pacific, said the most dangerous condition in such an
accident was the rupture of high-pressure air pipes in the
submarine. He said this would cause a build-up of pressure that can
reach 10 times normal atmospheric pressure, a level that is lethal
to humans and which can burst the seals separating airtight
compartments.

IMMIGRATION EMERGES AS EARLY ISSUE IN ITALY'S VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ August usually produces a truce in Italian politics as
party leaders head for the beaches along with everyone else. But
with national elections looming next year, the center-right
coalition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, fired an early strike last
week, issuing the outline of a 25-point political platform from his
vacation home in Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   A crackdown on illegal immigration was one of the highlights of
Berlusconi's Bermuda study session, and a signal that immigration,
a relatively recent, but fast-rising, issue on the Italian agenda,
will help define the battle between the ruling center-left
coalition and its center-right opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The current government, led by Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, is
keenly aware of how immigration is shaping up as a political
bludgeon. That awareness was demonstrated on Aug. 16 when Interior
Minister Enzo Bianco interrupted a day at the races in Siena, home
to the famous Palio horse races, to discuss immigration issues with
his German counterpart, Otto Schily.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the debate does not starkly pit those who oppose
immigration against those who favor it. Many politicians agree that
Italy, with one of the lowest birthrates in the industrialized
world and one of the largest retirement age populations, needs to
import workers, skilled and unskilled, to keep its economy going.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left government voices the same aim of curbing
illegal immigration and favoring orderly, legal immigration as the
right favors. Rather, the battle is being framed around
election-year images and inchoate concerns that Italy's once
homogenous culture is being transformed into an American-style
multiethnic society.
</P>
<P>
   The current government, so badly divided that it has not yet
agreed on a candidate for the elections, is painted by Berlusconi
and others as ineffectual and infected by ``buonismo,'' an Italian
word that suggests bleeding-heart liberalism. Center-left leaders
in turn seek to portray Berlusconi as an intolerant xenophobe.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Turco, minister of social affairs, is getting ready to
propose a new law to grant citizenship to immigrants and she
advocates allowing immigrants' families to join them. She has been
heavily criticized by the right and has countered by accusing
Berlusconi of lacking family values.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which a generation ago was a country that exported
immigrants, has become over the last few years one of the key entry
points to Western Europe for refugees from Albania, Turkey, Eastern
Europe, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, news shows and newspapers chronicle the desperate
traffic in refugees who are smuggled along the Adriatic coast in
crowded dinghies by criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, some would-be immigrants die in their attempt to
reach Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, a media tycoon who was prime minister for eight
months in 1994, has long espoused a tough line on illegal
immigration. His junior partner in his center-right coalition,
Umberto Bossi, of the separatist Northern League, has often made
xenophobic statements. Polls suggest that three out of four
Italians say they believe that illegal aliens are responsible for a
rise in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's latest proposal sounds draconian: he advocates that
no immigrant be allowed to enter Italy until he or she secures a
job and a work permit.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Italian law already imposes that requirement, at least
in theory. But tens of thousands of would-be immigrants sneak into
Italy every year.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1 to July 31, the police caught 16,097 would-be
immigrants seeking to enter Italy by boat. In the same period,
37,210 illegal aliens were repatriated. Estimates of how many
foreigners live in Italy illegally vary widely, from 70,000 to more
than 250,000, and many experts suspect the numbers are far higher.
</P>
<P>
   And the law, which requires undocumented aliens to be expelled
or repatriated, is unevenly applied. ``Policemen check my papers
all the time, but they let me go,'' said a 30-year-old illegal
alien from Ecuador, who insisted on the pseudonym Christian. ``They
can tell I am here to work, not to cause trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian, who earns $15 a day washing dishes in a restaurant,
said he arrived three months ago, flying from Colombia to Paris,
and then taking a train to Rome. He said he chose Italy over North
America because ``it was the easiest place to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy has only about 1 million registered foreigners _ 2 percent
of the population _ a far smaller percentage than in France,
Germany or Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the fears expressed by politicians and opinion polls
are irrational,'' said Mario Marazziti, director of the Community
of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic charity that works with illegal aliens
and the homeless. ``But the left is so weak right now that the
right can use people's fears of crime and disorder to demonize the
left. And that obscures the fact that business, which the right
claims to champion, needs foreign workers to survive.''

BUSH VOWS TO SEEK FEDERAL AID TO REPAIR INDIAN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Tenn., Texas)   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Campaigning here and across the border in New Mexico,
Gov. George W. Bush planned to unveil a new education initiative
Saturday, a call to spend more than $800 million to repair
crumbling schools on the country's Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, would spend the money
on the 185 schools on tribal lands throughout the country, most of
them managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a federal agency, his
aides said. His proposal calls for an additional $126 million to
replace the system's worst six schools, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The money involved is relatively little, at least when compared
with other education initiatives that Bush and his rival, Vice
President Al Gore, have already made during the campaign. But it
allows Bush to sustain his focus on education _ an issue perhaps
more traditionally associated with Democrats, but one that he has
said will be his main topic of discussion in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is largely through education proposals that Bush has styled
himself as a so-called compassionate conservative, and staked his
claim to the center of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragically, schools on tribal lands are often in poor physical
condition and lack basic resources,'' Bush said in a statement
released Saturday. ``The federal government has a front-line
responsibility to fix these schools and provide an environment in
which children can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already proposed spending $5 billion on a national
literacy program, while Gore has called for spending $115 billion
on education initiatives over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And education is where the two campaigns have one of their
sharpest disagreements, over whether the government should provide
vouchers so poor families can send their children to private
schools. Bush strongly supports the idea, saying it will spur
competition, while Gore says that it will undermine public
education in the country by draining needed resources away from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the trail Bush sometimes likes to joke that he is not running
for national principal or federal superintendent of schools, saying
that decisions about education are best left to localities. But the
schools on tribal lands are a special case: Because of longstanding
treaties between Indian nations and the government, they are among
the few schools in the country managed directly by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   A rally set for Saturday morning at Southern Methodist
University was the second part of a two-day campaign trip in which
Bush is seeking to temper any momentum Gore gained at the
Democratic National Convention. The itinerary itself was a dig at
Gore. First Bush traveled to Tennessee on Friday to highlight the
fact that some polls now show him leading Gore in Gore's home
state. Saturday's rally in Dallas, his aides said, would show how
strongly Bush, the Texas governor, is supported in his own home
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the people who know them best,'' read signs printed
for the events.

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION GAVE MEDIA BOOST TO CANDIDATES NATIONWIDE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla., Ind., Ky., Calif., Tenn., Colo., Mich.)  By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The main event may have been in the big arena, but
for Rep. Joseph M. Hoeffel of Pennsylvania and dozens of other
Democratic candidates from around the country, the action was all
in a small cluster of television studios to the side.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually around the clock on each of the four days of the
Democratic National Convention, Hoeffel and his colleagues filed
into the headquarters of the party-run Democratic News Service to
submit to interviews with television and radio stations back home.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel, locked in a tight re-election fight in his suburban
Philadelphia district, had been through the doors several times to
participate in Internet chat rooms, talk with Pennsylvania radio
personalities and appear by satellite on as many television
stations as he could, from Channel 6 in Philadelphia to Channel 69
in Allentown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great outreach,'' he said, as the bustling news service
became so filled with political faces it began to resemble the
Senate cloakroom. ``The media like being able to do a live feed.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates do not mind, either, no matter what the hour.
Elaine Bloom, who is running for Congress from South Florida, even
booked an interview in one of the studios on Thursday at 3:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans decided to use their four days of media
exposure in Philadelphia as an unabashed promotional vehicle with a
single focus, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Democrats took the
opposite tack in Los Angeles, fragmenting their television moment
into a thousand points of spotlight. Not only did candidates have
easy access to the production facilities of the Democrats' news
service, with a staff of 400 employees and volunteers, the service
qualified as one of the largest news-gathering outfits at the
convention. But unlike their counterparts at the Republican
gathering, many of the local Democratic candidates were also given
coveted speaking slots on the convention podium.
</P>
<P>
   What this meant for the broadcasters at home was not only a
local face to put on the air, but also more of a reason for doing
so, a point that may have been lost on observers concentrating on a
national perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying, `What an incoherent convention,' but they
misunderstand that half this convention was designed for local news
consumption,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The idea Vice President Al Gore's campaign had latched onto, she
said, was to keep local officials and candidates happy by giving
them the exposure they craved, and perhaps even creating a reverse
coattail effect in the process. ``You take care of everyone who's
running, because you want everyone who votes for that person to not
split their ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, local broadcasters found themselves being catered
to by the national party as if every rural set of call letters
produced a ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Steadman, news director of WEVV in Evansville, Ind., and
Owensboro, Ky. _ the 98th-largest media market in the nation _ had
to do little more than snap his fingers to book the Democratic
governor of Kentucky, Paul Patton, on the air with his 6 and 10
p.m. anchor, Kelly Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called us and offered us the lieutenant governor, and I
said no,'' Steadman said. ``And then they wanted to give us the
state party chair, who happens to be the governor's daughter. I
said, `If you're going to go through all that trouble, how about
giving us the governor?'''
</P>
<P>
   A governor sought, a governor delivered. ``When people start
talking about issues, they're going to love this Gore-Lieberman
team'' is the message Patton gave Sutton across the microwaves in
the news service's Studio 2 on Thursday afternoon. ``We represent
working-class Kentuckians, and that's going to come across very
strongly in the next 10 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   National party officials, convinced that the election will be
decided in swing states like Kentucky _ which has voted for the
winner in every presidential race since 1960 _ are hoping that what
came across last week was an impression of Gore as his own man, and
as the more able manager of the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It was through outlets like WEVV, the party believed, that its
message could be conveyed most cleanly. Local stations devote only
a few minutes each day to politics, and most of the time only the
most easy-to-digest themes of the campaign filter through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our media strategy is based on local television,'' said Joe
Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
``Four out of five people get the news about the convention from
their local paper, local television, local radio. The Republicans
spent more of their money on the creation of their show on the
stage. We spent a higher amount on getting our message out through
the smaller regional press.''

</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Republicans concentrated almost obsessively on Bush.
On the nights he could not be in the First Union Center, his image
was beamed onto three jumbo screens that dominated the podium, and
the ``talking points'' memorandums given to the delegates
summarizing his proposals were nine pages long. Gore, in contrast,
was barely a presence at the Staples Center until the convention's
third night, when he walked onstage to give his daughter a hug, and
the talking points left on delegates' seats were a mere page.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats were indeed relying more heavily than the
Republicans did on local news organizations to tell their story, it
may have been a trickier task to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of newspaper, radio and television coverage last
week in seven cities _ Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston,
Memphis and Miami _ indicated that while news organizations often
delved into the basic points the Democrats wanted emphasized, the
convention was treated more like a civics lesson than must-see TV.
</P>
<P>
   On television, the convention was rarely the lead: In Memphis,
which is in Gore's home state, and in Houston, which is in Bush's,
the weather, in the form of heat and hurricanes, tended to get
better play. Even on the night of Gore's speech, WCVB in Boston led
its 11 p.m. newscast with a report about the impending murder trial
of Michael Skakel, nephew of Ethel Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, in fact, while the ratings were slightly higher than
they had been for the Republican convention _ a trend that has
remained consistent for the last five presidential election cycles
_ the average number of homes reached each night, 15.3 million, was
the lowest for the Democratic Party since 1972, according to
Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, for instance, the top-rated radio station, WSB,
carried only one live speech, Gore's. ``We did not play up this
convention,'' said Chris Camp, the station's news director.
``Basically it comes down to the fact that conventions are more
scripted. There was no suspense, no mystery; everybody knew who the
nominee was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for Tennessee reporters, attendance was apparently not
mandatory. Only one of the four stations in Memphis, the Fox
affiliate, assigned a reporter to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered briefly whether we should send somebody to cover
the convention and spend $30,000 to $40,000 on a story that maybe
about 15 to 20 percent of our viewers truly appreciated,'' said
Peggy Phillip, news director of WMC, the NBC affiliate there. ``The
story that everybody is talking about this week is 118 Russians
under the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Jacobs, vice president for news at WSVN, a Fox affiliate
in Miami that sent a crew of five to Los Angeles, said that the
Democratic convention had proved to be more of a national story
than a local one for her station.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we covered the Republican National Convention, we covered
a lot of Jeb Bush and George P.,'' she said, referring to Bush's
brother, the governor of Florida, and Bush's nephew. ``There are
really not that many South Floridians in the spotlight this time.
But South Florida has a large Jewish population, and with Lieberman
being Jewish, we've looked at that angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the stations that did spend the money provided
the requisite breathless reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here is extremely jazzed,'' Phil Keating, a reporter
for WSVN, the Fox affiliate in Denver, observed from the Staples
Center after Gore spoke. ``He set himself apart, he didn't seem
stiff and he came across as a well-connecting speaker tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard, however, to match the enthusiasm for the
ticket felt by a candidate like Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan,
who is in a close race with the incumbent, Spencer Abraham, for a
U.S. Senate seat. She spent so much time at the Democratic News
Service last week that she could have had a control room named for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the press we got back in Michigan, it's
absolutely fabulous,'' said Robert Gibbs, Stabenow's communications
director. ``We could move our message directly from L.A. using
their satellites, right into the homes of millions of Michigan
voters.''

VENEZUELA FINDS SOURCE OF WEALTH IS ALSO CURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Like motorists everywhere, Venezuelans love
to complain about the price of gasoline, and they have been doing a
lot of that lately. But one thing sets them apart from almost
everyone else in the world: At less than 40 cents a gallon, gas is
cheaper than bottled water here.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans who are now paying nearly $2 a gallon for gas, such
carping may seem absurd. But the constant griping about gasoline
prices among Venezuelans is emblematic of their complicated and
conflicted relationship with a commodity that so dominates their
national life that it accounts for half of all government revenues
and four-fifths of the exports.
</P>
<P>
   This nation of 23 million people has the greatest petroleum
reserves outside the Middle East. Venezuela has also been the
largest oil supplier to the United States in recent years and, with
prices now at their highest level in a decade, it is looking
forward to record oil revenues of $21 billion this year. Yet oil
has come to be regarded here not as a blessing but as a curse.
</P>
<P>
   When petroleum emerged as the core of the economy in the 1930s,
governments were urged to follow a policy of ``sowing the oil,'' in
the famous phrase of the writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, to encourage
investment instead of mindless consumption. But the reality turned
out to be different, and a saying often heard here in recent years
cynically summarizes Venezuelan history this way: ``Columbus
discovered us, Bolivar liberated us, and oil ruined us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sick society, and it is sick as a result of an
illness called oil,'' said Anibal Romero, a professor of political
science at Simon Bolivar University. ``Oil is easy to produce; it
can be done by others with imported equipment, and it always sells.
As a result, it has asphyxiated the rest of the economy and led the
majority of Venezuelans to believe that if they are not rich, it is
because someone has stolen what belongs to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in poll after poll conducted over the past decade,
Alfredo Keller and Associates, a leading public opinion research
firm here, has found that 80 percent of Venezuelans believe theirs
is ``one of the richest countries in the world'' because of its oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly the same percentage believe that the main function of
government is ``to share this wealth among all,'' but they also
complain that they themselves ``have not benefited from these
riches.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than point their fingers at an economic model that
favors oil over all other activities, thus engendering a bonanza
mentality and discouraging individual initiative, Venezuelans
prefer to blame their leaders. Up to 80 percent believe, Keller
said, that the responsibility for their own poverty ``lies with
government and politicians,'' and that it is ``because of
corruption'' that the state has failed to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here have never thought of this country's problem as
economic,'' said Carlos Sabino, a sociologist at the Central
University of Venezuela who has written extensively about oil's
impact on Venezuelan society. ``They have always considered it a
moral and political problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly that sense of resentment and moral outrage that
President Hugo Chavez rode to power in the December 1998
presidential election, in which he won 58 percent of the vote. But
with the price of Venezuelan crude having quadrupled in the 18
months since he was sworn in, he too is facing pressure to deliver
the ``golden age'' of prosperity and social justice that
Venezuelans expect and that he promised as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 46, a former army colonel who in 1992 led an
unsuccessful coup, has stoked such expectations by claiming to have
almost singlehandedly engineered the worldwide rise in oil prices.
During his successful campaign for re-election last month to a new
six-year term, he reminded voters that it was his decision to cut
back production that has given new vigor to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the current boom in oil prices may have reawakened
memories of the 1970s and expectations that a new round of spending
and subsidies will follow. The 1970s, after all, were an era in
which oil revenues were so plentiful and Venezuelans were so
affluent that other Latin Americans referred to them as ``los
damedos,'' or ``the gimme-twos,'' a reference to their lavish
spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get out of the mess we put ourselves in then, we are going
to have to make sacrifices,'' said Luis Cortillo, 69, a retired
airline crew supervisor. ``But we don't want to accept that
solution; we want to go on living just like in the days when the
money flowed like water.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of entitlement is so deeply ingrained that past
governments have tried to raise gasoline prices at their peril. In
February 1989, President Carlos Andres Perez did that, and the
immediate result was riots and looting, in which hundreds of people
were killed _ events followed three years later by Perez's fall
from power and Chavez's coup attempt.

</P>
<P>
   ``The country is rich, but its people are not,'' said Lido
Araque, a 48-year-old gas-station attendant who earns about $200 a
month, when asked why Venezuelans should continue to enjoy low
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I would say the price of gasoline has to be kept at this
level for at least three more years, because when gas prices go up,
food and transportation costs rise too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez calls his movement to reform the Venezuelan state a
``revolution,'' and he clearly has the support of the overwhelming
majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
   But his government appears just as intimidated as its
predecessors by the specter of popular resistance to any effort to
bring local gasoline prices in line with international rates and
thereby discourage excessive consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``In determining the prices of energy, it is not just economic
factors that must be taken into account,'' Ali Rodriguez, minister
of energy and mines, said in a recent interview. ``We have a
critical social situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually ``there will be an adjustment made in the price of
gasoline,'' Rodriguez, who is also the president of OPEC, added.
``But it has to be done at the proper time, when there is an
economic recovery and employment is picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Chavez faces a situation that has no
precedent in Venezuelan history. Even with the price of a barrel of
locally produced crude rising so dramatically, the Venezuelan
economy shrank by 7.2 percent last year, and over half the work
force is either unemployed or working off the books in what is
euphemistically called ``the informal economy.''
</P>
<P>
   To placate his supporters, Chavez has spent hundreds of millions
of dollars on a military-run civic assistance program called Plan
Bolivar 2000, providing subsidized food and free medical care. He
has also proposed populist initiatives like the subsidized
manufacture of a relatively cheap ``People's Car'' that would
obviously encourage even greater gasoline consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But he has conspicuously hesitated to take steps that might hit
ordinary Venezuelans in their pocketbooks. Even the idea of trying,
by raising taxes, to prepare for the day when oil prices start to
decline again is controversial, and not just because the economy is
mired in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the problem of the state here has not been how
to obtain resources through taxes to cover public spending, but how
to distribute this growing income,'' Rodriguez said. ``For that
reason, because money was so abundant, we were not charged taxes,
and that had a cultural impact on Venezuelan society, in the sense
that no one here developed the habit of paying taxes or a sense
that not to pay taxes is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in early August, just before he embarked on a tour
of OPEC nations aimed at keeping oil prices at their current high
levels, Chavez announced ambitious plans to develop tourism,
agriculture, mining and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality, with the rest of the economy hobbled by a
recession, is that Venezuela is probably more reliant on oil than
ever, and thus more susceptible to the impact of a downturn when it
eventually comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments here are always like a gambler at a casino,''
Sabino said. ``They have their run of luck, and they come to
believe that everything can be resolved with an increase in the
price of oil. Nothing that Chavez is doing tells me that he is any
different from the others, and that is the problem.''

 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rivellino Jones of the misspelled name was refereeing
a soccer game in Manhattan last week, a moral victory for coach
Marty Jacobson. Perhaps those other embattled friends of
thelipsite(at)aol.com, Linda Bensel-Meyers and Billy Bean, could
take heart from Jake, although hang in there is almost always the
hardest advice to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers, the whistle-blower at the University of
Tennessee, is facing the start of a football season in which she
has been portrayed as the Volunteers' most dangerous opponent. The
team has just started practicing and Bensel-Meyers has already
informed the NCAA of three freshman players who turned in
remarkably similar compositions. She calls it institutional
plagiarism and blames it on the mores of the university rather than
on the athletes or tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Knoxville call it harassing the program. The NCAA
might not even find it in violation of whatever it is that concerns
that trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers has been decrying, for some time now, what she
sees as the exploitation of athletes and the subversion of the
humanistic values of the academy. A professor of Renaissance
literature and drama, she is also in charge of the first-year
composition program. She is only recently being heard beyond the
world of the Orange.
</P>
<P>
   In what I found the most cynical and clear-eyed approach to the
issue, Frank Cagle, the managing editor of The Knoxville
News-Sentinel, simply brushed it off. He wrote that the ``fate of
the football team has a deep impact on the morale, the business and
the general economy of East Tennessee'' and that what might be
construed as corruption in college sports was a ``national scandal,
not a local one. And it requires a national solution.'' In other
words, keeping our boys eligible by any means necessary is a
priority not to be tampered with unless every other school goes
honest, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers is idealistic and fuzzy-minded; she sees
universities using a bottom-line corporate model in which athletes
are resources. Even the coaches and athletic administrators end up
being victimized, especially if they don't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate problem is how do I avoid being cast as a
harridan because I harp on the issue,'' she said last week. ``The
administration's problem is that you can't put the peel back on the
orange once you see what's underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean, an outfielder whose six major league seasons on three
teams were haunted by the secret of his homosexuality, has decided
he wants to be back in baseball, the binding thread of his life
since childhood. Since he used his sports background to build
functioning teams in two restaurants, he thinks he can use his
business background in a front office. He would offer a rare
combination of experience and skills, as well as a test of sports'
institutional homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   His open, often moving description of life in a major league
closet last year in a front-page story in The New York Times led to
a number of speaking engagements and television appearances. In
talking about baseball, he realized he had not resolved that
critical part of his life; he had left before his career was over.
Even now, at 35, he tries to stay in playing shape and appear
regularly on talk radio; he is still gripping the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bean is in the process of selling his current Miami Beach
restaurant, Mayya, and writing to baseball club executives. He said
last week that he understands that a team would have to be
``courageous'' to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jake's message has always been simple: Don't quit. A
recovering drug abuser long clean, a soccer coach in a basketball
culture, an advocate for kids among clock-watching bureaucrats,
Jacobson's saga has been struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when his Martin Luther King Jr. High School team won
the first of its three straight city championships, mostly with
recent immigrants from the West Indies and West Africa, Jake has
been controversial in and out of his school. He was suspended from
coaching for 11 months last year when rival coaches accused several
of his players of being ineligible. He was reinstated and
vindicated, although his team lost in last year's championship
final.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bensel-Meyers, he is self-righteous and insistent on
putting the needs of the individual student ahead of the
institution. Like Bean, his charm masks a willingness to work
harder than most. And like them both, he has a larger vision. Jake
thinks the future of American soccer will rise from the cities.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the New York City Parks Department's inspired
partnership with the Parmalat milk company finished its six-week
Summer of Soccer 2000 Saturday. On weekday nights in Riverside Park
in Manhattan and Flushing Meadow-Corona Park in Queens, youngsters
played six-on-six games under the supervision of parkies and soccer
coaches and college players like Rivellino Jones. Jacobson ran the
Manhattan program, which included washing the mesh scrimmage vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that passion,'' he crowed last week as teen-agers from
Senegal and Brazil and Trinidad stormed up and down the turf with
bursts of heart-stopping athleticism. ``This is going to be the
urban game. These kids are going to be our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivellino Jones, 22, named for Roberto Rivelino, the Brazilian
star, is a symbol of that future. As a 16-year-old Trinidadian
overwhelmed by homesickness and a huge, chaotic high school, Jones
found his new roots at midfield on the King varsity. He was on
Jake's first title team and expects to graduate from Medgar Evers
College this year. He says he wants to be a public school guidance
counselor and coach. Like Jake.

ESSAY: BASEBALL MUST COME CLEAN ON ITS DARKEST SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE KETTMANN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It won't be easy, but baseball has to find a way to crack down
on steroids, which more and more big-leaguers appear to be using
every year and which could threaten to turn the game into a freak
show.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire has used steroids. This is now clear to any person
who looks at the facts about androstenedione, the
testosterone-booster McGwire was taking two seasons ago when he
broke Roger Maris' single-season home-run record. It's a steroid.
That's what most scientists say _ and what the government will most
likely say sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House's drug policy director,
used a speech to the Citizenship Through Sports Alliance at the end
of June to say he thinks androstenedione will be classified by the
government as a steroid ``within a few months.'' The International
Olympic Committee already classifies andro as an anabolic steroid.
Its medical director, Patrick Schamasch, told me in a phone
interview last month that Major League Baseball should have banned
andro long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But andro is only the beginning of the story. The drug was first
isolated by European scientists in the 1930s, but it was developed
in the 1980s by the East German sports machine. It was used as a
so-called bridging drug to tide East German athletes over when they
had to stop taking other steroids before testing at competitions.
Andro and other steroids went together then, and in all likelihood
they go together now.
</P>
<P>
   If steroids once seemed like the recourse of a few power
hitters, those days are long gone. Pitchers add around 4 to 6 mph
on their fastballs. Infielders once known only for their gloves
bulk up enough to inflate their home-run totals. And of course, the
big men get bigger.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we are very likely to see more incidents like the
recent discovery of vials of steroids and syringes in a car
belonging to Boston infielder Manny Alexander, though he wasn't
driving it at the time police discovered the illegal goods.
Baseball is investigating whether the steroids belonged to
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball will most likely ban androstenedione in the near
future, once a Harvard team of researchers completes a fresh study
into whether andro can boost athletic performance, not just muscle
mass. Some observers have been critical of baseball's reluctance to
take action on andro just after McGwire's record-setting season,
but this is an unfair criticism. That would have been terrible
public relations, and no major sport can afford that. Baseball
badly needed the boost it got from McGwire's and Sammy Sosa's
home-run show. It was clear at the time that baseball would need to
wait until a tasteful interval passed before it could take on
andro.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time to act, and not just regarding andro but all
steroids. The players' union strenuously opposes testing for
steroids, so immediate action is not possible. But if baseball's
leadership makes a public case between now and the end of next
season, when a new collective bargaining agreement will be
negotiated, the players would risk widespread fan outrage if they
resisted the call for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in home runs has become so pronounced, baseball
officials went to the trouble to have the ball inspected to show
that it isn't more lively now than it used to be. But even if the
ball isn't juiced, many players appear to be.
</P>
<P>
   The fans know that the modern mania of power, power, power has
robbed the summer game of much of the nuance and subtlety that
Roger Angell and Roger Kahn and so many others have memorably
celebrated. That's not to say that chemicals improve hand-eye
coordination or make connecting with a fastball any easier. They
can't do that. Hitting a baseball is still the hardest thing in
sports. But added strength can change what happens once a ball is
struck.
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters talk among themselves constantly about such signs
of steroid use as bizarre mood swings and large patches of acne in
strange places, like the shoulders _ sometimes so noticeable that
players wear dark T-shirts under their uniforms. Sometimes
sportswriters even talk with players about steroids, usually with
those who aren't using them and who resent those who do for the
advantage they gain.
</P>
<P>
   But little is written. I covered the Oakland Athletics for The
San Francisco Chronicle between 1994 and 1998 and wrote countless
articles about McGwire's plantar fascia, the connective tissue at
the bottom of his feet. But I never wrote any stories raising
questions about steroids, nor did the five other beat writers
covering the team in those years.
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters, in short, are part of the problem. They have a
tough job, and anyone who has covered a pro team week in and week
out through a long season knows that good judgment dictates not
needlessly alienating players you need to do your stories. That
means it is unlikely that many beat writers will report on steroid
use, even though more and more baseball old-timers are horrified at
what's happening to the game. Not only have the game's fundamental
skills been sacrificed for power, but baseball's oldest records
also risk becoming devalued, some Hall of Famers believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't come from me because it sounds like sour grapes, but,
yes, it's disturbing,'' one player in the Hall of Fame recently
told The Arizona Republic columnist Pedro Gomez. ``It taints all of
us who got here, because we earned it the right way. It taints what
Hank Aaron and Willie Mays and every one of us did to reach 500
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think some of these guys are constantly hurt? Their
muscles are too big for their ligaments and tendons. It's obvious
who is on the stuff. You don't need to be a scientist or specialist
to know. Just look at these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   What's striking about steroid use in baseball _ and in other
popular arenas _ is not just how widespread it seems to have
become, but how much public acceptance it seems to have gained.
Professional wrestling, in which bodies puffed up absurdly by
steroids are both mocked and celebrated, has gained an ever-higher
profile in recent years _ almost egging on baseball players, many
of whom love to watch professional wrestling, even in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Steroids do not just pump up athletes' bodies into grotesque
shapes, sacrificing suppleness to gain more raw power. They are
also dangerous. Liver failure, heart trouble and cancer all lurk as
potential consequences of heavy, sustained steroid use. Players
calculate that it's worth the risk to pump up their numbers, along
with their bodies, and make more money while they can. But it's
doubtful many of them are fully aware of the risks they are taking.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the National Football League, which has had limited
success in reducing steroid use, Major League Baseball does not
test for steroids. This policy may well have made sense back when
steroid use was an anomaly. Now that bulking up with chemical help
seems to be more popular than ever, it's incumbent on baseball to
take action.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has enough problems. It cannot afford to be passive on
steroids and wait until the problem gets so out of hand that a
player in a 'roid rage does something awful _ and the dark secret
finally becomes a full-fledged national controversy.

BUSH AND GORE PLAN AD BLITZES AS 80-DAY ELECTION DRIVE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moving on several fronts to capitalize on the
afterglow from their conventions, the presidential contenders plan
next week to open the biggest television advertising blitzes of
their campaigns, in which Gov. George W. Bush will emphasize
education and Vice President Al Gore will trumpet himself as a
champion of working families.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they were preparing for an intense, hard-fought
battle in the hectic 80-day marathon to Election Day and had begun
making critical decisions about where to campaign and where to
funnel resources, including an infusion of nearly $68 million in
federal subsidies each.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is seizing the offensive and making plans to advertise and
campaign in historically Democratic states. Among the two dozen
states chosen for an advertising drive that begins on Monday is
West Virginia, which Republicans have not carried since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the point at which the campaign pivots,'' said Karl
Rove, Bush's chief strategist. ``Our focus has been preparing for
the conventions. Now we're making major forays onto the turf that
the other guy considers his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials said they would focus largely on the battle
ground states of the Midwest and make particular appeals to women
who seemed enticed by the Republicans. They also said they would
continue to cite Bush's record in Texas as demonstrating his
failure to tackle health care for children, improving the
environment, gun control and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle lines are drawn,'' said Robert Shrum, one of Gore's
leading strategists. ``Al Gore comes out of the convention much
more clearly defined to people. There's a choice on a thematic
dimension: Who's going to stand up and fight for middle-class
families on prescription drugs, a patients' bill of rights and
education?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said they were also working closely with
state Republican Party organizations to develop ambitious programs
to identify potential supporters and encourage them to vote. The
Gore campaign is making such efforts as well, but is more reliant
on unions to help drive turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Democratic convention, polls showed that Bush was
ahead of Gore. The Gore campaign's objective has been to build on
the publicity and good feeling from the convention to help Gore
pull even with Bush by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 and every presidential campaign since, the candidate who
was ahead in the polls after the conventions won the election. But
because there is an open race and both camps seem relatively evenly
matched, Republican and Democratic strategists predict that the
2000 race may be closer to 1980, when President Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan were neck-and-neck in the polls after the convention
_ and Reagan pulled out a victory in the closing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it can be anything but a competitive race,''
said Tom Cole, chief of staff for the Republican National
Committee. ``Our biggest advantage right now is our base unified
quicker than theirs. But that's going to happen at some point for
them. Then we're going to be in a very close race.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Gore and his vice presidential candidate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, Cole added, ``They're not going to go gently into
that good night.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the best
evidence of the competitiveness was in his state, which was
Clinton-Gore territory in the last two elections but now appears to
be a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush has every opportunity to win this election,''
Thompson said. ``To give you an idea, George Bush has already been
here three times and Al Gore has been here four or five times. And
both of them are going to be in Milwaukee next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said now
that the public might be beginning to pay attention to the contest,
Gore should hammer away at a theme he introduced at the convention:
how the policies of a president can touch the lives of ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people weren't watching this _ they were watching
`Survivor' or something else,'' Gephardt said. ``Al Gore should
articulate the stakes in this election and in people's everyday
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion needs to settle for at least several days before
polls can give an accurate picture of how the relative standing of
Gore and Bush might have shifted after the two biggest political
events of the summer: the national party conventions and selection
of running mates.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus in interviews with a variety of strategists
and campaign officials on both sides is that both campaigns did
themselves some good on both counts _ or, at the very least, did
not lose ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, a Democrat, said his initial fears
that Clinton's appearance would siphon attention from Gore had been
allayed. ``This whole issue of contrasting Clinton and Gore _ I
wasn't sure how this would all work out,'' Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to Gore's speech, he added, ``But I will tell
you _ with no disrespect at all to the president _ I thought
halfway through the speech, `Bill who?'''
</P>
<P>
   Though both conventions seemed to be helpful to the nominees, if
anything, strategists in both parties seemed to agree, Bush put on
a slightly better convention than Gore. Several experts said that
was because the Republicans seemed more harmonious and laid out a
broader message of inclusion. By contrast, many strategists said,
the vice president's convention was a bit more uneven and seemed
less successful in reaching beyond the party's core voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush had a better convention week, but not a better speech,''
said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials said they were pleased that during their
convention they had made significant in-roads in presenting Gore as
more than a vice president; as a nominee with a populist streak who
will energetically fight for working families on a variety of
issues, from health care to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But even loyal Democrats here expressed some distress about Gore
and his difficulty in winning clusters of voters _ like women _ who
are historically inclined to vote Democratic. And they cited the
ball and chain of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that the people of America will not give him a
fair hearing,'' said Raymond Ensher, a delegate from Colorado.
``They continue to associate him, I think unfairly, with the
problems Bill Clinton has had.'' Ensher added: ``What really
worries me are the women. That really worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove, Bush's strategist, noted that Bush had already succeeded
in staking out issues that Bob Dole, the nominee four years ago,
did not dare discuss. ``Can you imagine if Bob Dole had stood up
and said, `I want to reform Social Security,''' he asked. ``The
race would be over. Can you imagine a Republican candidate saying,
`We've got to get rid of so many nuclear bombs?' We did it and got
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slightly better reviews for the Republican
production than the Democratic one, people in both parties said
Gore's choice of Lieberman seemed, at least in the short term, to
be better than Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, the former secretary
of defense, on the Republican side. That is because Lieberman, the
first Jew on a major party ticket, was greeted with euphoria among
Democrats and caused people to take more notice of Gore. The choice
of Cheney underscored Bush's determination to pick a competent No.
2 who would know how to govern. Yet it stirred little excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pick for him,'' Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said
of Lieberman. ``It generated some excitement and interest that
wasn't there. Cheney solidified Bush, but I couldn't really measure
what he's done broader.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback warned, however, that the Lieberman pick could come
back to haunt Gore. If the Democrats attack Bush for their
positions on Social Security privatization and education reform, he
said, Republicans can simply invoke Lieberman's record on those
issues, which is not too far from Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are also looking to the nationally televised
presidential debates beginning in October _ three are tentatively
scheduled _ to provide the last opportunities to scramble the
dynamic. Unless a candidate performs poorly, as Ronald Reagan did
in the first debate against Walter Mondale in 1984, debates usually
do not do much more than reinforce partisan allegiances. (Reagan,
however, improved his performances in later debates and went on to
win in a landslide.)
</P>
<P>
   The closer the race, the more influential the debates will be,
Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it affects only 1 percent that could make a
difference,'' he said, ``because I think the race is going to be
very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sturla, a Democratic state representative in Pennsylvania
who was a delegate here this week, said the debates would be
critical. But in the next breath he wondered aloud whether the
build-up of Gore as an accomplished debater _ and criticism of Bush
as lackluster _ could play right into the Bush strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans, knowing they will get crushed, have lowered
expectations so much that Bush would have to wilt and slither off
the stage,'' Sturla said, ``for his performance to be judged a
surprise and a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the debates, the candidates will mostly convey their
messages through paid commercials. Bush, who did not accept public
money in the primaries so he could exceed the federal spending
limit, has agreed in the general election to join Gore in financing
his campaign with federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign advisers and supporters seem almost preoccupied
over the possibility that the Democrats will begin broadcasting
harsh commercials that try to scare voters away from their
candidate _ all in a drive to gain an edge over Bush. The
Democrats, preferring not to portray the commercials as negative,
say they will not shrink from what they call issue comparisons.
Some Democratic operatives say it seems that the Republicans want
to goad Gore into a slash-and-burn posture so they can turn around
and paint him as mean-spirited, and then attack him right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore campaign will probably go pretty negative,'' said
Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, a Republican. ``It's important
that we respond right away to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers said their hope was that in the speech on
Thursday, the vice president diffused some of the concern that he
was not sufficiently likable, so voters were not more inclined to
warm up to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, for his part, conceded that Bush had a winning
personality that made it easier for his party to put on a moderate
face in Philadelphia. The hope, he said, is that people recognize
that a candidate's beliefs are at least as vital as personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good at public relations,'' Gephardt said of the
Republicans. ``They are good a manufacturing an illusion. They are
expert at it. They may succeed. But I hope they don't.''

U.S. TOUGHENS RULES ON MEDICAL PRIVACY, BUT SOME WANT MORE LIMITS
 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT PEAR  (Exclusive) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nine months of blistering criticism from
doctors, patients and consumer groups, the Clinton administration
says it has decided to beef up protections for the privacy of
medical records, beyond what it proposed last year.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the new rules, to be issued
before the Nov. 7 election, would not give patients full control of
their medical records, as many advocates of privacy rights had
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   They would, however, establish comprehensive federal standards
requiring doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and insurance companies
to limit the disclosure of medical information about individual
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The health care industry and insurance companies must comply
with the new rules within two years. Issued under a 1996 statute,
they would have the force of law; no further action by Congress
would be required.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching, complex rules will touch almost every aspect
of the health care system. They will come at a time when large
amounts of medical data, including genetic information about a
patient's risk of developing specific diseases, can be stored
electronically and sent across the country or around the world
easily by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said President Clinton was committed to issuing the rules on
medical privacy by late summer or early fall. ``That's a very high
priority,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that Americans are increasingly
concerned about privacy in general and want greater protection for
medical records, in particular. Some people say they shun testing
for cancer, HIV infection and other conditions because they fear
discrimination in insurance or employment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party platform promises new rules to protect the
privacy of medical information, but gives no details. If Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas wins the presidential election, his
advisers said, he would probably want to re-examine the rules,
rather than rely on the policy judgments of the Clinton
administration.  &QL; 
(OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House published the proposed rules in the Federal
Register on Nov. 3, 1999. After reviewing thousands of public
comments, federal officials said, they expect to make these
changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The rules, as originally proposed, would have applied mainly
to information transmitted electronically or stored in computers.
The final rules will also apply to many paper records. Most medical
records are still kept on paper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the proposed rules, health care providers and insurance
companies were supposed to advise patients of their rights and tell
them how personal medical information might be used or disclosed.
The new rules are likely to go further, requiring doctors to get
patients to sign forms acknowledging that they have received such
notices.
</P>
<P>
   _ The proposed rules would have permitted the use and disclosure
of medical information without a patient's consent for treatment,
payment and other loosely defined ``health care operations.'' They
would also have prohibited doctors from asking patients to sign a
consent form unless it was required by state law. The new standards
will allow doctors to seek the patient's consent. Under current
practice, doctors often ask patients to sign forms authorizing the
use and disclosure of medical information for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union said, ``The proposed
regulations are a step backward from current practice because they
require only notice and not consent.''  &QL; 
(OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the new rules would limit
disclosure of medical information to the ``minimum necessary'' and
give patients a right to see their medical records. In addition,
the rules would pre-empt weaker state laws.
</P>
<P>
   A person who discloses health information in violation of the
rules could be fined $50,000 and imprisoned for one year. If the
offense is committed for commercial advantage or personal gain, the
rules allow tougher penalties: a $250,000 fine and 10 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law directed the administration to issue rules on
medical privacy if Congress failed to pass legislation by Aug. 21,
1999. Lawmakers missed that self-imposed deadline. Congress could
alter any of the new standards, but has been at an impasse, under
pressure from scores of lobbyists with conflicting interests on the
issue of medical privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Gellman, an expert on privacy and information policy,
said the administration was ``taking a real gamble'' in issuing the
rules before the election because they might be criticized as not
going far enough to protect privacy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Health Insurance Association of America
and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said the proposed
rules exceeded the government's legal authority and would impose
new costs on patients and employers, who pay for much of the
nation's health care.
</P>
<P>
   When the rules were proposed last year, they were praised at
first, but then criticized by the American Medical Association, the
American Civil Liberties Union and experts like Janlori Goldman,
director of the Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the fine print, critics said the proposals were a
license to disclose sensitive medical information, rather than a
fence restricting access.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical comment, the American Cancer Society said it was
concerned that the proposed rules would allow ``the total free-flow
of information'' without input from patients.

`THE ROMANCE IS BACK,' ALONG A REVITALIZED RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELLEN ALMER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The water bikes that glide along the river here
invariably attract a good amount of attention. Office workers,
people chatting on cell phones, tourists _ they all hang over the
side of bridges to stare, take pictures, and ask where they, too,
can rent the curious contraptions.
</P>
<P>
   And this is before they've even laid eyes on the Venetian-style
gondola, complete with the warbling faux Italian gondolier, which
conveys mostly romance-seeking couples up and down the river for
evening tours of the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The once indifferent residents can hardly be faulted for their
newfound sense of enchantment, since barges and clunky commuter
boats are what they're used to seeing along the waters of the
Chicago River.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bikes, the gondola, the open-air cafes and the
planters bursting with purple pansies are just the beginning of a
multimillion-dollar construction plan, inspired by Mayor Richard M.
Daley, to turn what has long been a polluted industrial waterway
into a gleaming tourist attraction. Among other things, the plan
calls for a continuous, grassy pathway along the river, dozens of
new cafes, canoe rental stands, and more docks offering access to
the river.
</P>
<P>
   The city has already spent $15 million building a river walk and
adding an art gallery at the base of one of the river's bridges.
Officials say that over the next three years they plan to spend $50
million more to widen the river banks to make way for more
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river hadn't been much to look at for a long time, and
now, it doesn't even smell bad anymore,'' said Gene Arbetter, a
lifelong Chicagoan who rents out his river bikes from the serene
dock he shares with Old World Gondoliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other day, I came right up on a blue heron just
around this bend,'' said Arbetter, pointing to a wooden piling that
was sprouting what looked like a miniature herb garden. Just
overhead, taxi cabs and buses rushed over a bridge and an elevated
train rumbled past.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hutson, the owner of Old World Gondoliers (and a gondolier
himself), is even more rapturous about the river's new incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The romance is back,'' said Hutson, who uses the stage name
Goffredo when rowing and singing to his customers in Italian.
``These people get dressed up, bring wine or champagne _ it's
really quite breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chicago River's branches and tributaries stretch
for 150 miles, the new revitalization effort focuses on the main
stem of the river, which runs through the heart of downtown
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Many say the river has become a symbol of how the city has
changed from a gritty meat-packing town to a vibrant, clean city of
art museums, neighborhood festivals and outdoor restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is an industrial city changing into one of
the fastest-growing office sectors in the world,'' said Laurene von
Klan, executive director of the Friends of the Chicago River, a
group that tends to the river's overall health. ``To some extent,
the old image of us being the slaughterhouse to the world is giving
way to a new city, where tourism is the main industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some developers are recognizing the shift. In the past, many
buildings effectively turned their backs on the river. But that has
changed, and now the river is a hot residential market, with real
estate advertisements boasting of river views and builders making
town houses with huge front porches facing the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the river has been an unrealized asset
until now,'' said Patti Gallagher, the city's deputy commissioner
of strategic planning. It wasn't until about three years ago that
Daley got hold of some rough plans that had languished in
Gallagher's department for a new and improved river front, at which
point the renaissance began.
</P>
<P>
   But selling the river to Chicago residents, many of whom still
see it as less than pristine, might still be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still an unhealthy green color,'' said Jason Ur, a
graduate student in archaeology at the University of Chicago. ``You
can see quite a bit of garbage floating in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ur was somewhat won over on a recent river outing, during
which he and a group of friends paddled up the river in kayaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't so much interested in being in the water as I was in
the views of the skyline,'' Ur said.
</P>
<P>
   Although von Clan maintained that the health of the river's
water has improved, she admitted she would not swim in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of us is talking about doing it _ one day.''

 &HT;    Debbie Allen `Possessed' with dance, drama
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You expect to see black leotards on Debbie Allen, and today she
does not disappoint. The star and choreographer of television's
``Fame'' also has on a silk jacket with zebra stripe pattern, and
those chunky, soft black shoes that dancers like to wear.
</P>
<P>
   As far as figurative apparel, Allen wears many hats _ performer,
writer, director, producer, choreographer _ and she dons all of
them except ``performer'' for ``Soul Possessed,'' her romantic
dance-drama brainchild that opens the Alliance Theatre's 32nd
season Wednesday. But somehow it all comes back to dance, the
engine of her art, and the leotards. During an interview at the
Alliance's main, mirror-walled rehearsal room, waiting for her cast
to arrive, the petite but muscular Allen stretches, twists, puts
her palms on the floor and busts the occasional graceful move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 50 and I have no problem saying that,'' she says, ``or
being that.'' Leaning back in a metal folding chair, she raises a
straight leg to touch the kneecap to her nose.
</P>
<P>
   Among her legion of fans: Alliance artistic director Kenny Leon,
who chose Allen to kick off what we now know will be his final
season at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to being one of the most talented people on the
planet, Debbie has a very raw side _ she'll tell you the truth,
period,'' says Leon, who teams with Allen as supervising director
on the show. ``When I saw `Possessed' in Washington, it struck a
visceral chord in me, something disturbing to my soul. This was
before `Contact' (the Broadway dance show) hit. `Possessed' has a
similar charge, and I think it could have more weight if we pull it
all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the conversation with Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the inspiration for this piece?
</P>
<P>
   A: In my family, All Saints Day was very important, we'd pack up
for Baton Rouge and spend the whole day in the cemetery where my
father's forebears are buried. I became interested, too, in Day of
the Dead as it's celebrated in Latin America. Then four years ago I
was in Spoleto, Italy, to direct a dance piece, and I met Joaquin
Cortes _ the great flamenco dancer, a Gypsy from Spain who travels
the world like a rock star. I began to think about taking flamenco
and many dance styles _ jazz, hip-hop, the hoof-tap that Savion
Glover made so hot _ and using them to create a mythic tale. A
dance drama that tells a story with sparse dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the story about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's about a girl, Ysabel, who on the eve of her wedding
leaves her betrothed for a mysterious drifter _ a flamenco dancer!
The two men fight for possession of her soul. The setting seems
like the Louisiana bayous with their mix of cultures, but it's
timeless _ no period or place. The figure of Death appears, with
human qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does Death look like?
</P>
<P>
   A: Very sexy! And beautiful. You see, when my father died in
1983, it was devastating for my family but it redefined death for
me. In vodun (voe-DOON), what Americans call voodoo, and other
African religions, the spirits of ancestors are as real and present
as the living. In our show, Death is in love with Ysabel, who
represents Life. There's a scene in a juke joint that's wild, a
scene in a church that's serene. I'll be pleased if it means
different things to different people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you'll have potential producers and backers coming from
New York and L.A. to see the show?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yes, I came here with that in mind. ... I think we're on
to something fresh and exciting. Using dance to tell a story is not
new but it's kind of being rediscovered right now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In fact it seems as if Broadway choreography is on the rise
again, with women leading. You've got Susan Stroman's terrific
dance in ``Contact,'' Kathleen Marshall's in ``Kiss Me Kate.'' Do
you feel it's your moment to step back into that world?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never left that world!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just mean we haven't seen a Broadway show choreographed by
Debbie Allen since ...
</P>
<P>
   A: Since ``Carrie'' (1988). I did some good work, but the show
didn't catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's a legend among bombs.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, anyhow, I've been as dominant as anyone in keeping
dance alive as an international phenomenon, in musical films and so
forth, so this is not a ``return.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did it become an Alliance project?
</P>
<P>
   A: I came here a few years ago to see my sister (Phylicia
Rashad) in ``Blues for an Alabama Sky,'' and then ``Medea.'' I met
Kenny and liked him a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was it like growing up with your sister?
</P>
<P>
   A: We were always dancing and performing in the house and the
back yard. I was the biggest thorn in her side, too _ following her
around. I always wanted to be like my sister. Always wearing her
clothes when she wasn't looking. Any boyfriend she liked _ I liked
him too. If friends visited she'd say, ``Well if she comes in the
room, I'm leaving!'' But Phylicia was very protective of me. Seems
we've gotten even closer since our children were born.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a dancer, do you still lead a special daily routine of
diet and exercise?
</P>
<P>
   A: Exercise is not a problem, because even as a director and
choreographer I'm out there demonstrating moves. And I'm so good
during the day, too! Look, I've got my hard-boiled eggs (reaching
into a bulky purse, placing objects on table). I've got my jar of
beets! My grapefruit! Oh, but at night, the terror reigns! The
demon comes! The fat fairy attacks! I say, ``I can eat this
Haagen-Dazs, damn it, I earned it! I'm gonna sweat tomorrow!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The show's press release carries a note about ``adult
content.'' How young can the audience be?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have a child in the cast, so obviously we feel there's
nothing that child shouldn't see, but it's an individual parent's
judgment. Personally, I think it's important that young people see
that there is pain and consequences for certain actions. Young
audiences see the dark side of life everywhere, but here they'll
see it's not a joke, a game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you create your piece with the MTV generation in mind?
</P>
<P>
   A: Partly, yes, because some of those videos are very
sophisticated about telling a story in a few minutes. You see, our
young people are very attuned to dance drama _ they just may not
know it yet!

 &HT;    Mysterious Deep Throat still captivates old Washington lawyer
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The major characters, all but a few, have gone to their graves,
while the secondary players exist only as forgotten footnotes to a
drama now more than a quarter-century in the past.
</P>
<P>
   H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, John Mitchell _ all dead.
</P>
<P>
   And of course Richard Nixon, whose favor they curried and whose
loyalty they lost one by one.
</P>
<P>
   The show ended with President Nixon's resignation 26 years ago,
and the cast of Watergate went their separate ways. John Dean, the
presidential counsel whose devastating memory sealed Nixon's doom,
is an investment banker in California, disbarred from the practice
of law. Charles Colson, malevolent impresario of dirty tricks,
found Jesus and today counsels prison inmates. G. Gordon Liddy,
boldest of the tricksters, is a talk-radio celebrity in Washington,
unrepentant to this day.
</P>
<P>
   History is not without its follies. Eugenio Martinez, one of the
five burglars arrested in the June 17, 1972, break-in of the
Democratic National Committee headquarters, is selling cars, and
his partner, Virgilio Gonzalez, has vanished back into the
woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains someone else, and his whereabouts _ indeed his
identity _ loom larger as time goes by. Who was Deep Throat, the
unnamed source who met Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in an
underground parking garage at 2 in the morning? Did he even exist?
Was he one person or a composite of two or more? Was he only a
fiction created as a linchpin for Woodward and Carl Bernstein's
book ``All the President's Men''?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, candidate after candidate has been nominated _
Alexander Haig, Alexander Butterfield, Vernon Walters, Richard
Helms _ but the candidates themselves refused to be drafted. Now
Leonard Garment, an old Nixon hand who has made Deep Throat his
personal quarry, thinks he knows. ``In Search of Deep Throat''
(Basic Books, $25) is a lawyerly deduction from plausible
hypotheses but in the end an intuitive guess. ``It is my
conviction,'' Garment writes on Page 2, ``that Deep Throat ... was
John Sears.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Sears, too, has declined the honor, and
threatened to sue. But on what grounds?
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, why John Sears?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of Watergate,'' Garment writes, ``Sears was an
obscure political operative who had worked in the 1968 Nixon
presidential campaign and, briefly, in the Nixon White House. After
Watergate, Sears became more prominent. He gained national
attention when he served as campaign manager for Ronald Reagan in
1976 and 1980. Sears' name is well known and respected among those
who participate in or write about national politics but unknown to
most of those who have puzzled over the identity of Deep Throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever it was, his identity is known to only four people:
Woodward; Bernstein, Woodward's gumshoe twin back then; Ben
Bradlee, former editor of The Washington Post; and Deep Throat
himself. Woodward and Bernstein have said they would reveal the
name only when Deep Throat dies (which already clears a number of
suspects). Otherwise, ``No comment.'' In a few cases Woodward has
``cleared'' someone, and he denies it was Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Garment has written a brief whose considerable
appeal lies not only in its conclusion but, even more, in its
reasoning. As Garment acknowledges, no hard evidence exists. In its
absence, Garment read everything written about Watergate. He talked
to people who had bit parts. But mostly he read and re-read every
article Woodward and Bernstein wrote, and then compared them with
the narrative of ``All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, the co-authors wrote, had a source who was ``a former
official in the executive branch,'' and Woodward had ``a friend''
who had been in government. The worm of suspicion began to wriggle:
The two sources were one and the same, and they were the person
Woodward met in the parking garage at 2 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Throat smoked and he drank Scotch. Many people do, but now
Garment's memory was jogged. He heard the way Deep Throat, in the
book's narrative, spoke. Deep Throat was not an operator but
someone who saw politics as a dance of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More distinctively,'' Garment writes, ``Deep Throat knew
literature. He was given to conversing about large and conceptual
things. He was not good at concealing his feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the margin of the book, Garment wrote ``Sears,'' the name of
the young lawyer he had hired at the firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose,
Guthrie &AMP; Alexander. They had remained friends, even after Mitchell
maneuvered Sears out of the White House. At the end of a day Sears
would drop by Garment's office, where they would smoke cigarette
after cigarette, drink their Scotch straight and talk late into the
night about politics and theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sears,'' Garment remembers, ``was widely read, from Aristotle
to current politics, and full of Catholic metaphysics and Irish
charm.'' He could talk about ``the relationship between the nature
of the Triune and the tripartite structure of American government
and make it seem both plausible and poetic.''
</P>
<P>
   His ideas were all the more beguiling because they were elusive,
like Deep Throat himself. Yet when Sears spoke, you listened, and
Garment has no doubt he was not his only audience.

POLAND SPY INQUIRY SAID TO BE A FAILED POLITICAL TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  By   STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ A special Polish court last week cleared the
popular president, the former Communist Aleksander Kwasniewski, and
a former president, the Solidarity hero Lech Walesa, of charges
that they spied for the Communist secret police.
</P>
<P>
   But behind that bizarre and embarrassing drama, Poles believe,
are the desperate straits of Solidarity's current leader, the
ambitious Marian Krzaklewski, whose own candidacy for the
presidency is floundering badly.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski's Solidarity coalition, running Poland with a
minority government, is widely unpopular and is expected to lose
parliamentary elections, probably next spring, to Kwasniewski's
reformed Communists. And now that he has been cleared, Kwasniewski
is almost guaranteed re-election as Poland's president. The only
question is whether he will win an absolute majority in the Oct. 8
first round or be forced into a runoff against the second-place
finisher.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski, 50, is widely considered the brains and puppet
master behind the government. He is acknowledged by Western
diplomats in Warsaw as a shrewd politician, but they say he
crucially failed to come into the open and actually run the
government, and now seems likely to pay the price. Should he fail
to force Kwasniewski into a second round _ or even worse, run third
and not make the cut _ his political career could be in ruins, and
the party's showing in the parliamentary elections would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Krzaklewski is running third, with only 6 percent
of the vote, according to polls. Kwasniewski has a whopping 62
percent; former Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski is a distant
second with 10 percent, and Walesa, who persists in running against
his own Solidarity inheritor, is fourth with 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Poles and Western diplomats believe that Krzaklewski hoped
to embarrass Kwasniewski and force Walesa out of the running by
turning to a 1997 law that requires those seeking high office to
declare whether they collaborated with the universally despised
Communist secret police. If so , the maneuver appears to have
failed spectacularly, clearing the former Communist president of
suspicion and generating sympathy for Walesa, who is deeply
unpopular among most Poles, but still admired for his heroic stance
against the old Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa originally said that the accusations against him _ that
in the early 1970s, before he became a national figure, he was an
agent known as ``Bolek'' and informed the secret police about his
friends and colleagues _ were the result of a vendetta by former
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   But after the closed court cleared him, Walesa suggested that
former allies in Solidarity, who control the government, were to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they wanted to humiliate Walesa,'' said Jacek
Kucharczyk, deputy director of the Institute for Public Affairs, an
independent research organization here. ``It appears that
Krzaklewski's people sent papers to the court to incriminate him,
and then sent papers at the last minute to get him off the hook,''
he said. ``Solidarity seems pretty desperate about its standing in
the polls and they decided to play hardball.'' Now Walesa may
benefit from a sympathy vote, Kucharczyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, the previous prime minister and himself
a reformed Communist, said he had no doubt that the accusations
against Kwasniewski and Walesa _ and the timing and manner of their
trials _ were part of a political game by Krzaklewski and his
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Solidarity had strong proof against Kwasniewski,
especially when Krzaklewski decided to run'' for the presidency,
Cimoszewicz said. ``But it's important to kill your target, and now
he's getting killed. Solidarity wanted to destroy Kwasniewski, but
he's now immunized against attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 legislation, based on a Czech law, imposes no legal
penalty for confessing to collaboration with the old secret police,
so long as the person declares it _ as Olechowski did, apparently
with no great harm to his popularity. But anyone found to be lying,
through an investigation by the secret police and the finding of
this secret screening court, is banned from politics for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   So all presidential candidates were bound to be screened in any
case. The evidence against Kwasniewski, a member of the Communist
Party, was thin. But Walesa had a harder problem, given his own
admission that he signed some awkward documents in late 1970, when
he was 26, just after he participated in workers' strikes at the
Gdansk shipyards. And clearly he had a big file with the secret
services, which had faked some documents in the early 1980s, trying
to deny him the Nobel Peace Prize he won for leading the Solidarity
trade union.
</P>
<P>
   While Poles do not want the mercurial, unsophisticated Walesa to
return as their president, they do not want him humiliated, nor to
think of him as a collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Krzaklewski's problem was his decision in 1997 to be the
back-room boss of the government, ordering around his former
professor, Jerzy Buzek, whom he made prime minister. Krzaklewski
managed to undermine Buzek while not avoiding blame for the
government's growing unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krzaklewski is a wonderful organizer and politically clever,''
said one European Union ambassador. ``But if he wanted to be the
top young politician in central Europe, he should have become prime
minister himself. He didn't grow from his victory in 1997, and it's
sad for Poland, which had a chance to modernize its politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski, recognizing that he must at least run second to
Kwasniewski, or watch control of his party disintegrate, is
sounding an increasingly populist and nationalist note, especially
about the problems presented by Poland's application to join the
European Union. And Kwasniewski, 45, who has gotten plump in
office, is on a weight-loss regimen to renew his magnetism for
Poland's less substantive voters, trying to spare the electorate
the bother of a second round.

 &HT;    Of historic buildings, haunts in Abingdon
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABINGDON, Va. _ It is an unseasonably cool, moonless night in
this historic Blue Ridge Mountain town, a good evening for a ghost
tour in this old place that seems to have more than a healthy
share.
</P>
<P>
   I am being urged by my guide to step behind the Cave House to
inspect the spot where a pack of wolves emerged to attack Daniel
Boone's dogs in 1760. The 1858 building that houses the Holston
Mountain Arts and Crafts Cooperative was built over the limestone
cave that was the wolves' lair. There are no wolves now, of course,
but still the hairs on my neck stand up when I peer into what seems
to be a bottomless black hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it would be better to come here in the daytime,''
suggests storyteller Donnamarie Emmert, and I readily agree.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the better-lighted sidewalk, Emmert continues our trek
in search of the supernatural. It is a perfect way to learn about
the history of the downtown district _ and maybe encounter a ghost
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   On one cobblestoned corner, we stop to hear the tale of a slain
Civil War soldier whose riderless horse can be seen, we're told, on
certain moonlit nights.
</P>
<P>
   Up the hill we go into the dimly lit Tavern, a 1779 building
that has served as a frontier watering hole, a Civil War hospital,
a brothel, and now operates as a pub and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering her voice to a whisper, Emmert recounts the story of a
young prostitute who was stabbed to death on the second floor and
who apparently is jealous of any woman with long dark hair. A
female bartender quit her job abruptly one night, Emmert informs
us, when the glasses stored above the bar began hurtling toward
her.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the prostitute's demise, distinguished guests such
as Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay stopped to refresh themselves at
the Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   The town, named Abingdon in honor of Martha Washington's
ancestral home in England, was soon populated with doctors, lawyers
and tradesmen living in stately homes.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries later, downtown Abingdon retains much of its
historic character.
</P>
<P>
   The Martha Washington Inn, an impressive 1832 brick mansion,
offers luxurious accommodations, elegant dining and a wide, breezy
front porch where guests can sit and rock. Elsewhere along
tree-lined Main Street, historic buildings house shops peddling
antiques, crafts, books and artwork.
</P>
<P>
   But the centerpiece of Abingdon is the Barter Theatre. Across
the street from the Martha Washington Inn, the theater is the
second oldest playhouse in America. When Robert Porterfield opened
the theater in a former Presbyterian church in 1933, it was the
height of the Depression. Admission was 40 cents, but Porterfield
also would accept food.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of swapping ham for ``Hamlet'' quickly caught on as
farmers hungry for culture carted in eggs, meat and vegetables. By
the end of the first season the Barter had made a profit of $4.35
in cash, plus two barrels of jelly. Meanwhile, the hungry actors,
fed on a steady diet of the bartered produce, gained a collective
300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Barter soon established a reputation for nurturing young
actors who would later become famous. Some of the distinguished
alumni include Ernest Borgnine, Hume Cronyn, Gregory Peck, Patricia
Neal and Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Barter patrons can leave their eggs and butter at home in
lieu of plastic or greenbacks, but the performances are still
first-rate. We caught an excellent but dark and grim production of
``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' with Josephine Hall as the Irish
daughter desperate to escape her mother's tyranny. A seasoned
actress, Hall appeared in the PBS series ``The House of Elliott.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day's performance was more cheerful, as 35 dancers in
the Egyptian Folklore Ensemble showcased the musical and cultural
traditions on a stage that seemed as vast as their country.
</P>
<P>
   Plays are staged March through December and range from musicals
such as ``My Fair Lady'' to dramas like ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Barter's reputation grew, so has that of the neighboring
Martha Washington Inn. Various owners have spent more than $8
million since 1984 to improve the infrastructure while preserving
the architectural details. The 61 guest rooms have modern baths and
authentic Victorian and Georgian-period antiques and art. The
lobby, with its larger-than-life murals, is worth a tour itself.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of the other buildings in town, the Martha Washington
claims a ghost. During the Civil War, the building served as a
hospital staffed in part by student nurses. A young nurse known
only as Beth was assigned to care for Capt. John Stoves, a wounded
Union officer. As he lay dying, Beth played a violin and sang to
him to ease his pain. Not long after Stoves died, Beth contracted
typhoid fever and died, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bell captain Pete Sheffey, who conducts tours of the hotel, says
he still sees and feels Beth's presence. ``Furniture in the rooms
gets disarranged and doors open and close by themselves,'' he says.
``She'll come down the main staircase late at night wearing her
nurse's apron and old-fashioned clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   If you need a breath of fresh air after ghost stories like that,
Abingdon more than obliges. The town is ideal for casual walkers,
but serious hikers can venture past the Tavern down the hill and
across the railroad tracks to the Virginia Creeper trailhead. The
National Recreational Trail follows the former route of the
Virginia-Carolina Railroad through Damascus to Whitetop Mountain 34
miles across the state's highest mountains. Once a main route for
Native Americans, the trail is open to travel by foot and bike, or
on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 miles of additional trails can be found in nearby
Mount Rogers National Recreational Area, including a 60-mile
stretch of the Appalachian Trail. Camping is available along the
way, but those who prefer more comfortable accommodations will want
to head back to Abingdon.
</P>
<P>
   After a short hike on the trail and another trek up the rolling
hills of Main Street, the cool porches of the Albert and Victoria
Inn were a welcome sight. Almost as welcome as the rack of lamb and
bananas Foster that owner Hazel Ramos-Cano had prepared as a
special treat.
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN MUSTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to hang your hat: The Victoria &AMP; Albert Inn is an
elegantly restored 1892 home in Abingdon's historic district. The
five guest rooms rent from $99 to $125 nightly and include private
baths and gas log fireplaces. Smoking prohibited. 224 Oak Hill St.,
540-676-2707; www.naxs
</P>
<P>
   .com/victoria&AMP;albertinn.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of downtown across the street from the Barter
Theatre, the Martha Washington Inn offers a historic atmosphere
with modern conveniences. The rooms, all furnished in Victorian and
Georgian antiques with private baths, range from $159 to $309. 150
W. Main St., 540-628-3161; www
</P>
<P>
   .marthawashingtoninn.com.
</P>
<P>
   For a pastoral setting close in, the Shepherd's Joy provides
accommodations on a working sheep farm. Guests can stay in one of
four rooms in this Victorian house and watch sheep graze. Rates
range from $85 to $95. 254 White's Mill Road, 540-628-3273;
www.shepherdsjoy.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tying on the feedbag: The Alta Cucina is the restaurant most
recommended by the locals. The best choices are fresh fish such as
sauteed wild striped bass with saffron orzo and lump crab or the
grilled salmon in white wine and dijon sauce. 414 Main St.,
540-676-3003.
</P>
<P>
   For an elegant lunch, the dining room of the Martha Washington
Inn offers an assortment of salads, pastas, fish, chicken and a
specialty of Savannah she-crab soup. 150 Main St., 540-628-3161.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best place to go when the sun goes down: Built in 1779, the
Tavern in Abingdon has been restored to its original condition.
That means the interior is dark and cozy, the floors slanted and
the beer cold. In addition to a full bar, the Tavern serves
burgers, sandwiches, Cajun jambalaya, salmon, shrimp and steak. 222
E. Main St., 540-628-1118.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Great place to see fall color: The peak season in this part of
Virginia is from mid-September through mid-October. For best
viewing, head to White Top Mountain on U.S. 58 or to Elk Garden on
Va. 600 about 20 miles from Damascus. Other good spots can be found
anywhere in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area,
1-800-280-2267.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to get crafty: An arts and crafts cooperative, the Cave
House features quilts, split-oak baskets, pottery, dried flowers,
hammered dulcimers, dolls and fine art. 279 E. Main St., Abingdon,
505-628-7721.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bringing home a taste of the mountains: In Damascus, the

GIULIANI APPOINTS NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani named Correction Commissioner
Bernard Kerik as New York City's next police commissioner Saturday,
turning to a former undercover narcotics detective and familiar
member of his administration to command the nation's largest police
department.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, 44, will replace Howard Safir, a retired federal agent
and Giuliani's confidant and friend of 25 years, who announced his
resignation this month after four and a half years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik will be sworn in this week as the department's 40th
commissioner in just under 100 years, taking command of the
40,000-member force during a time when crime has fallen sharply but
the department has suffered intense criticism, from within and
without.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik's achievements have been significant at the city
Department of Correction, where he brought about substantial
declines in violence in the jail system and reduced overtime. But
some critics have said that his lack of a college degree, a
requirement for the rank of captain and higher in the Police
Department, sends the wrong message when the department is
struggling to recruit qualified candidates to the force.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, who won the Medal of Valor as a police detective, is 24
credits short of a degree in labor relations at Empire State
College.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Kerik is the most prominent element of a
broader change in the city's police hierarchy. Giuliani said
Saturday that he would promote Chief of Department Joseph P. Dunne
to be his new first deputy commissioner, replacing Patrick E.
Kelleher, who retired last week. Dunne was one of the three
finalists for the job of commissioner. The other was Dennison Young
Jr., counsel to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three candidates that I considered were Dennison
Young, Joe Dunne and Bernie Kerik,'' Giuliani said, ``and the city
is going to have the good fortune of having all three of them
working together, along with others because we work as a team, to
continue to build on this record that is such a superb one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik will have the opportunity to fill the positions of deputy
commissioner of organized crime control and chief of personnel, two
of the highest posts in the department. The men who hold those jobs
are retiring.
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner, Kerik's challenges will be many and his window
of opportunity will be small, with 16 months left in Giuliani's
second and final term as mayor. And in spite of the department's
successes, it has endured sharp criticism in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the police and minority residents are strained
after the torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house in
1997 and the fatal shootings of four unarmed black men in a
13-month period that ended last March. The department is also
facing the possibility of federal oversight because of a finding by
the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn that it has failed to
adequately discipline officers who use excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the department is struggling to recruit members and
retain its veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, a native of Paterson, N.J., who lives in Riverdale, the
Bronx, spent eight years in the Police Department, served as one of
Giuliani's bodyguards during his 1993 campaign and joined the
Department of Correction in 1994 as the director of investigations.
He was appointed first deputy commissioner in 1995 and commissioner
in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the New York Police Department, Kerik was warden
of the Passaic County Jail in New Jersey.

 &HT;    Refreshing winds waft through Blowing Rock
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOWING ROCK, N.C. _ The legend goes that a Cherokee brave dived
off the Blowing Rock to appease his gods and was caught in an
updraft so powerful that he was lifted back to his sweetheart's
arms.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't feeling quite that lucky on my visit to this popular
Blue Ridge Mountains attraction. In fact, I hung on to the flat,
upturned rock _ the parapet, it seemed, of a mighty castle _ for
dear life. My wife was capturing the iffy moment in snapshots. The
famous winds, funneled up from the Johns River Gorge 3,000 feet
below, sometimes make snow fall up and indeed felt strong enough to
knock me into the abyss (though not reverse the process).
</P>
<P>
   The view was thrilling. Ten miles south, Grandfather Mountain
reared up and tucked his rocky pate into wisps of cloud, like a
codger in the smoke of his own pipe. Vast expanses of forested
hills rolled eastward under a brilliant sun, while the shadows of
puffy white clouds swept across them like a tide.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere down there in the horizon-hugging haze were the
Atlanta heat, traffic and crazy-making distractions that we had
fled. Here, the wind and prospects did more than wake up the body _
they braced and cleared the head.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the rock was the first of many peak experiences we
enjoyed on a hiking trip to the 111-year-old, 4,300-foot-high
resort town of Blowing Rock.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived the evening before to find the village full _ but not
jammed _ with people enjoying the cool of a mountain summer
twilight. Strollers lapped ice cream cones and window-shopped Main
Street's three-block stretch of sophisticated shops. Others kicked
back and enjoyed the scene from the benches and gazebo in the
pretty park across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where an upscale crowd comes to decompress. That's why
it's so down-to-earth,'' says Vance Baker, a Duluth preacher's son
who came here 12 years ago to start Vance's Main Street Cafe and
Pub and is now stationed on the sidewalk to greet his customers.
``We get folks from New York and Miami and Atlanta, and they expect
the best _ you can't put anything past them.''
</P>
<P>
   Our accommodations, the Gideon Ridge Inn, south of town, were
just an arrow's flight from the rock, and with a view almost as
spectacular. This 1940s guesthouse evokes an English hunting lodge:
slate roof, exposed beams, leatherbound books, little lawns and
flower beds that spill down the hillside like pools of a mountain
stream. Our rooms (a cozy attic-like perch the first night, a
cedar-paneled cabin the second) were superb. We had no dinner
plans, so innkeeper Leslie Barnes sprang into action with her phone
and within minutes had us set up for both nights.
</P>
<P>
   Before we drove back into town, we sat on the Gideon's lawn and
watched dusk settle over the valleys. An ocean of green spread far
below us _ the parallel ridges like huge waves frozen in time. The
blue-gray mist that filled the distant hollows looked like the
ghosts of ancient lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The next day's battle plan was to cruise the scenic Blue Ridge
Parkway _ which has more good trailheads than, say, Buford Highway
has gas stations _ by starting at Grandfather Mountain and working
back toward town.
</P>
<P>
   Ol' Granddad, a privately owned preserve with a nature museum
and picnic areas, is, at 6,000 feet, one of the higher peaks east
of the Mississippi. Its upper climate is like Newfoundland's, and
we got a snootful of it. The wind was blowing so hard (65 miles per
hour) when we stepped onto the mile-high footbridge that it bowed
to one side and the cables made an eerie tuning-fork hum. Prayers
were murmured midspan. On the rocky outcrop at the far side, people
watched the mountain's rare resident ravens perform their wild
mating display of backward loop-de-loops. One buzzard-size
daredevil flapped up behind me and nearly scared me into orbit.
Quoth the raven: ``GURRRRRK!''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the magnificent view, Donald Jackson, a 30-year-old
engineer from Delaware, Ohio, pointed along the jagged wall of the
Blue Ridge and said, ``Look _ they really do look blue in that
haze! Awesome!''
</P>
<P>
   Among Grandpa's many paths, the 3.7-mile Grandfather Trail _
which starts at the footbridge parking lot _ is reputedly tops for
views, well worth its strenuous ladder climbs. I leave that
judgment to hikers with enough sense to bring a jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the hikes we enjoyed firsthand (distances are one way
unless otherwise indicated):
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The No-Car, Surprisingly Splashy Hike: Since Glen Burney Trail
begins just steps from Blowing Rock village, walkable from several
inns and motels, in the Cannon Garden off Laurel Lane, you might
expect a larky little stroll in your sandals. But noooooo _ you
need boot traction in this ferny, ever-plunging gorge. New Year's
Creek cascades over huge boulders along a 2.4-mile trail. Watch the
midday sun fall in pin-spotlight beams as if from cathedral
windows, setting sandy pools aglow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Splashy Hike II: The Linville River, named for William
Linville, who mapped the area in the 18th century, pours over two
falls, including a 90-foot plunge basin (a slit gorge through one
tremendous mass of quartzite). You reach the falls from a half-mile
trail off Route 221, or you may forge farther to dizzy overlooks in
the 440-acre Linville Falls Recreation Area, which has picnic and
camping sites. Some hemlocks are as big as California redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Lazy Lake Loop Hike: For those not inclined toward steep
inclines, this flat 2.4-mile route circles the clear, picturesque
Price Lake, with a trailhead on the Blue Ridge Parkway. There are
many views of the lake, where you're liable to greet people
drifting drowsily in rented rowboat or canoe. The lake is part of
4,300-acre Julian Price Park, which has a campground and more
difficult paths connecting to the Tanawha Trail (see below).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Cool-Enough-for-a-Preteen Hike: My favorite trail, the
13-mile Tanawha, can hug the parkway too closely (motorcycle noise,
anyone?) but compensates with its rugged beauty. A particularly
scenic stretch from Rough Ridge parking lot near milepost 303 to
Stack Rock parking near 305 winds far longer than the two miles
measured by the road. Linn Cove Information Center is a pleasant
pit stop where maps and hiking guides are sold. This stretch of
trail has bridges, stairs and boardwalks to carry you to
magnificent overlooks, across ``rock falls'' (fields of colossal
boulders that look frozen in mid-avalanche) and beneath the
parkway's Linn Cove Viaduct, so graceful it almost qualifies as a
rock formation itself. Tanawha means ``fabulous hawk'' _ also the
Cherokees' name for Grandfather Mountain, looming above.

   MOUNTAIN MUSTS

<P>
   &QR;  Where to hang your hat: The award-winning Gideon Ridge Inn has
matchless mountaintop views, delicious breakfasts and afternoon
tea. $115-$260. 202 Gideon Ridge Road, 828-295-3644;
www.ridge-inn.com. A golfer's dream, adjacent to Blowing Rock
Country Club, is the Green Park Inn, a rambling 1880s hostelry with
swimming pool. Guests have included Eleanor Roosevelt and John D.
Rockefeller (who according to legend tipped everyone a dime).
$99-$169. Route 321, 1-800-852-2462; greenparkinn.com. The grounds
of the Inn at Ragged Gardens _ a 1900s manor house _ are like a
piece of fresh countryside, with bark siding and wild-ish gardens,
wedged into the heart of the village. $145-$275. 203 Sunset Drive,
828-295-9703; ragged-gardens.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tying on the feedbag: It's not easy to find (on a steep
hillside above a Food Lion), but the Best Cellar is a 24-year-old,
lodgelike restaurant where the locals party and don't begrudge
having the tourists join in. Mostly it's for those who like their
drinks strong and their meat red (excellent prime rib), but the
menu is varied. U.S. 321 bypass, 828-295-3466. Twigs, a casual but
sophisticated restaurant with contemporary art, is likewise just
loud enough to be convivial and justly renowned for its crab cakes
and fresh local trout. U.S. 321 bypass, 828-295-5050.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sights from the heights: The Blowing Rock is a small,
privately owned park renowned for its spectacular overlooks and its
namesake rock, which gets powerful updrafts from the Johns River
Gorge. $4. U.S. 321,
</P>
<P>
   828-295-7111. Grandfather Mountain is a privately owned
3,000-acre preserve with a nature museum, picnic areas, overlooks
and hiking trails for all levels of ability. $10. U.S 221,
1-800-468-7325; www.grandfather.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Great place to see fall color: The rocking chairs on the front
porch of the manor house in Moses Cone Memorial Park. From this
vantage point on the 19th-century estate of the philanthropist
known as ``the denim king,'' you look out on lawns that slope down
to 22-acre Bass Lake, and surrounding you are 3,500 acres of
foothills covered with beech, oak, ash and sugar maples _ which
Cone imported from New England. Milepost 294, Blue Ridge Parkway,
828-295-7938.  &QR;  Where to get crafty: From the rocking chairs
mentioned above, look over your shoulder into the Parkway Craft
Center in the Cone manor house. Operated by the Southern Highland
Handicraft Guild, the shop has striking pieces in glass, wood,
fabric and stone, and is miles above the usual
scented-candle-and-dulcimer-tape joint that's overgentrifying
Appalachia these days. (See address, phone above.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best place to go when the sun goes down: Vance's Main Street
Cafe and Pub, housed in an old brick storefront, is a casual bistro
hung with modern art, the one true nightclub in an early-to-bed
kind of town. We heard a jazz trio make a smooth, funny segue from
``Satin Doll'' to the ``I Dream of Jeannie'' TV theme. 1121 Main
St., 828-295-7737.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other nearby fun: Linville Caverns, filled with eerily
molten-looking rock formations and the echoing gurgles of a
subterranean stream, makes a good 30-minute family foray. U.S. 221,
1-800-419-0540; www.linvillecaverns.com. The Tweetsie Railroad is a
refreshing mountainside variation on a kiddie theme park, with
rides, stage shows and a narrow-gauge railroad. U.S. 321,
1-800-526-5740; www.tweetsie.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: The drive is five hours from Atlanta. Take I-85
and turn north on U.S. 221 in Spartansburg, S.C. Just after the
Grandfather Mountain entrance, turn north on the Blue Ridge
Parkway, exit again on U.S. 221 eight miles farther on and continue
to town crossroads at U.S. 321.

   Dan Hulbert writes for thmbering out of the car and racing to
the porch, we hear at last the soothing sounds of Hot House Creek.
Wooden stairs from the lower deck lead directly to the chilly
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Inside there's a great room with fieldstone fireplace and
cathedral ceiling. The floors, ceiling and walls form a cocoon of
knotty pine. There's a fully equipped kitchen (and gas grill on the
porch), washer-dryer and satellite TV. Three large windows in the
dining room provide a splendid view of the lazy creek.
</P>
<P>
   The master bedroom downstairs has a quilt-covered king-size bed
and hot tub on the porch through the sliding glass doors. The loft
bedroom, with its own bath, opens on to a third-story deck. It's
perfect for the 12-year-olds _ my daughter, Caroline, and her
friend Allison Rohan. They quickly jump into their bathing suits
and soon are floating down the creek in a single hot pink tube.
</P>
<P>
   Tearing ourselves away isn't easy, but soon we are happily
trekking horseback with Rachel Callihan's Adventure Trail Rides
($35 for two hours; 706-632-9704).
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure our trusty steeds _ easygoing Jasmine,
high-spirited Thunder, steady Chance and the fidgety Forrest Gump _
are nearly as thrilled. Still, they tramp dutifully through 400
acres hard by the Chattahoochee National Forest, down century-old
logging roads edged with blackberry bushes and leafy rhododendron,
along ``Granny Callihan's Ridge'' (named after Rachel's
great-great-great-grandmother), across green meadows sprinkled with
purple clover and Queen Anne's lace and through McClure's Creek,
where the horses pause to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of newly mowed grass mingles with leather and horse
manure as we cross a country road into a field. The sun is slipping
behind the mountain that Callihan says once belonged to her great
uncle Sam Callihan _ ``but he sold it to the federal government for
$17 during the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   I let slow and sweet-tempered Jasmine cool her heels while the
others gallop across the pasture. Caroline is shouting, ``Awesome!
Awesome!'' and my husband, John, is striking a Marlboro Man pose as
they trot back.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the stables, I'm wobbling like a drunk on shaky legs.
Oh, I'm gonna be sore. Crank up the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Ridge Scenic Railway waits for no man (woman or child),
so the next morning we are up and at 'em. Promptly at 9:40 a.m.,
the cry goes out, ``All aboard!'' and we climb up the steps to
open-air car 2929, named Ridge Runner. Others ride in closed
vintage coaches as the bright red diesel-powered locomotive chugs
northward on 100-year-old tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-mile excursion follows the Toccoa River, which is called
the Ocoee on the Tennessee side. In Georgia, the river is wide and
fairly docile; the narrower Ocoee is rough and ready, with
challenging Class IV rapids (classifications range from I to VI)
bearing ominous names like Broken Nose, Tablesaw and Diamond
Splitter.
</P>
<P>
   At the depot in McCaysville, where most of the passengers have a
one-hour layover before returning to Blue Ridge, we and others who
have opted for the Ocoee Rail Adventure package are met by the
Wildwater Ltd. van.
</P>
<P>
   I approach the Ocoee with trepidation. Make that fear and
trembling: This was the proving ground for world-class kayakers
during the 1996 Olympics. Granted, though, our trip would be in the
less challenging middle Ocoee, not the rock-'em-sock-'em upper
course.
</P>
<P>
   During orientation we are taught simple self-preservation
techniques _ how to avoid falling out of the raft and what to do if
it happens, and how to safely handle the paddle so as not to render
one's raftmates toothless.
</P>
<P>
   We are assigned to a raft along with a Knoxville-area high
school ROTC instructor who calls himself Ski (for good reason _ his
name is Steven Wrzesniew-
</P>
<P>
   ski) and his son Eric, a freshman at Maryville (Tenn.) College.
A retired Air Force man, Ski knows all about survival. He brings
students here twice a year. I am glad he is in my raft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best classroom for me to teach fear management and
team building,'' Ski says. I hope his methods rub off on me.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, Matt Sloan, is studying creative writing at the
University of North Carolina, Asheville. He assures me he has
rafted dozens of rivers in several states. I notice his tongue is
pierced; he obviously knows no fear.
</P>
<P>
   We hit whitewater right out of the chute. The river rumbles
around us as we finesse our way through the rapids Grumpy and Gonzo
Shoals, which give us a tease of what's to come. The surging river
winds on, serving up one rush after another.
</P>
<P>
   For near two hours, we obediently respond to Matt's paddling
commands. I am concentrating on staying high, if not dry, but
occasionally I glimpse folks on the woodsy riverbanks waving to us.
</P>
<P>
   When I face my worse fear _ the twin terrors Slice 'N Dice,
back-to-back Class IV rapids _ I whoop and holler and shoot 'em
like a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, our team is home free. Awesome.
</P>
<P>
   My fear is gone, but something's in its place: tired, aching
muscles. Man, this relaxation business is a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Time to get back to Up the Creek _ and rev up that hot tub.

 &HT;    Chill out in mountain air of Cashiers
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASHIERS, N.C. _ The only thing that keeps you from feeling
completely away from it all is Clark Howard. And not only Clark _
ordinarily a congenial presence _ but the less welcome noise from
certain stations whose backseat lobbyists could not be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   You're only a little more than two hours from Atlanta up here,
but you have to turn on the radio to realize it.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature on the July day we left the city was already 86
degrees, and in a few hours would be knocking on the door of 100.
The farther we drove, the cooler it got. It never rose above 80 the
two days we were in Cashiers, and you're more often in shade than
in sun. This is, after all, in the Nantahala National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Cashiers-Highlands plateau is the only alpine rain
forest east of Oregon. It boasts the most abundant concentration of
waterfalls in the United States, with the Whitewater Falls being
the highest.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other reasons for coming here, and not just in
summer. There is, for one thing, the High Hampton Inn &AMP; Country
Club, a 1,400-acre antebellum estate that will fill your belly
three times a day and house you in a rustic cottage free of certain
conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son,'' I told our 12-year-old before we left, ``this resort
where we're staying is going to cost about $350 a night, and it
won't have a telephone or a television.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to turn his face away from the computer screen.
``You're kidding, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Assured I wasn't, he said with undisguised skepticism, ``That's
going to have to be some kind of hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly that, and yet it is not for everyone. (The hotel
acknowledges as much: ``Over the years we've found that not
everyone likes it here, especially those who want plush
accommodations,'' a brochure says.)
</P>
<P>
   If it is not plush, it is more than comfortable. But it is also
pricey. If you go on the American Plan (which most people do), your
room rate goes up according to the number of people in it. And if a
holiday for you means, among other things, a vacation from a coat
and tie, you're going to have to string something other than rope
around your neck if you want dinner. The resort's vast dining hall
_ where a buffet is offered at breakfast, lunch and dinner _ bows
to tradition at the evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   For a hotel that makes a concession to formality, a stay at the
High Hampton Inn is nothing if not casual. Plamen Parvanov, a
porter from Bulgaria in his third season, needlessly apologized for
the lack of a telephone in the cottage (phones are available in the
lobby), saying, ``That's why people come here. They want to get
away from it all _ from the telephone, the television, the radio,
all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   One such couple was Connie and David Thomas, from West Palm
Beach, Fla. This year they recruited friends to share one of the
four-bedroom, fully-furnished Colony Homes on the estate. ``We love
the weather, the food, the golf and tennis, and just being away
from South Florida,'' Connie Thomas said. ``And you don't have to
worry about where to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a golfer or a gardener, a hiker or a tennis player,
the High Hampton Inn is a kind of Valhalla. There's even a
meticulously kept croquet lawn (do they have par in croquet?), with
a lake beyond it and the rock face of a mountain on the far side of
the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The par-71 course is a scenic favorite with mountain views on
every hole and bent grass greens,'' according to Golf Magazine.
``At High Hampton you are away from the crowds, and you might be
able to hear the keening of a mountain hawk soaring overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I am not a golfer. But who doesn't appreciate getting away
from it all in his own fashion? The inn's eight hiking trails are
excursions into the natural world that city folks too easily
forget. Wild azalea, mountain laurel and huge rhododendrons cover
the grounds, and at night the only sound you might hear is that of
a waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   And you needn't confine yourself to the inn. Cashiers itself is
a town of modest charms and a growing number of shops and
restaurants. For many years, it existed in the shadow of
better-known Highlands, 10 miles south. Highlands was a bit more
chic and, at 4,100 feet, could claim an extra 600 feet in altitude.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also more people and more cars in Highlands.
Cashiers affords the daytripper and the weekender a more relaxed
experience. As one Highlander told me, you learn to go where the
crowds aren't, and it's easy to find yourself going up the road to
a town almost beyond radio's reach.
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN MUSTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to hang your hat: The High Hampton Inn &AMP; Country Club is
not the Econo Lodge. If you go on the America Plan (three buffet
meals a day), your room rate escalates according to the number of
people in your party. For example, a single person might pay $103
per night, but that same person and a spouse would pay $182. If
they brought a child, it goes up to $244. If they brought three
children and those kids' ages were (as ours were) 12, 10 and 3,
that same room would cost $353. But your meals are paid for, and no
one could ever go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   1-800-334-2551, Ext. 150; www.highhamptoninn.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of options, including:
</P>
<P>
   Laurelwood Mountain Inn. $67-$135 (the latter for a two-bedroom
suite). Fully equipped kitchens, fireplaces, whirlpool tubs. A
short walk from shops and restaurants. 828-743-9939;

</P>
<P>
   Millstone Inn. A bed-and-breakfast one mile east of town. Eleven
furnished rooms and suites, each with a fireplace and a sitting
room. But no children under age 10, no pets and smoking limited.
$131-$159 weeknights, $171-$198 weekends. Two-bedroom suites
available. 1-888-645-5786; www.millstoneinn.com
</P>
<P>
   Cabins in the Laurel. One- and two-bedroom log cabins, each with
complete kitchen, stone fireplace, satellite TV, VCR, front porch
with barbecue grill and rockers. Walking distance to shops and
restaurants. $110-$140 nightly, but two-night minimum. Children
welcome. No pets. Open year-round. 828-743-2621; www.nc-cabins.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tying on the feedbag: If you stay at the High Hampton, your
meals are amply provided. Many small restaurants available in
Cashiers (or in Highlands, 10 miles south). The Market Basket, near
the center of town, is only one of many good restaurants. Less than
quarter mile from U.S. 64 and N.C. 107. 828-743-2216.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best place to go when the sun goes down: On a cool night, the
four-sided fireplace in the High Hampton's lobby invites you to
sink into one of the comfortable chairs with a snifter of cognac.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Great place to see fall color: The High Hampton Inn and
unincorporated Cashiers are in the Nantahala National Forest. Half
an hour to the east is Pisgah National Forest. Whether you're
staying at the High Hampton Inn or lodging elsewhere, the fall
colors are all around you.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to get crafty: In Cashiers, as in better-known
Highlands, myriad crafts shops line the main street (and side
streets). One is Southern Hands, where the wares include blown
glass, fireplace accessories, Churchill Weavers throws, pottery and
turned wood. N.C. 107 N., one block from intersection of U.S. 64
and N.C. 107 (in Cashiers Commons). 828-743-5499.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bringing home a taste of the mountains: Don't miss the places
selling locally made (or made close by) jams, sourwood honey,
apples from western North Carolina and other produce. But the
Cashiers Farmers Market covers all bases. 828-743-4334. On U.S. 64,
less than a quarter-mile east of the intersection of U.S. 64 and
N.C. 107, the crossroads at the heart of Cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spotted along the road: Outside Cashiers a sign reads
``Eastern Continental Divide. Elevation: 2,964.'' Geography is no
respecter of maps, and you realize it when you cross a continental
divide.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other nearby fun: Arrowmont Stables, seven miles north of
Cashiers on N.C. 107, offers adults and children English and
western riding on Arabian, appaloosa and Tennessee walking horses.
Also, catch-and-cook fishing, campfires and cabin rentals.
1-800-682-1092; www.arrowmont.com.
</P>
<P>
   The par-71 course at the High Hampton Inn is one of the most
scenic in the country. (Greens fees are $32 per player per day.)
The inn also has six tennis courts ($5 per hour per player).
</P>
<P>
   On the grounds of the High Hampton Inn are eight walking trails,
varying in length from 45 minutes to three hours, and a 35-acre
lake that offers rowing, sailing, pedal boating and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Botanical Gardens will conduct a wildflower
workshop Oct. 8-10, including walks, field trips, lectures and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: I-85 north to Exit 1 in South Carolina, where
you pick up S.C. 11. Take S.C. 11 to Walhalla, S.C., and turn left
onto S.C. 107, which takes you into North Carolina and directly
into Cashiers (and right past the High Hampton Inn &AMP; Country Club).
</P>
<P>
   Another route would involve less travel on I-85. Exit onto 1-985
and take it to Ga. 23. At Dillard, near the North Carolina line,
exit east and look for signs for Highlands. Take N.C. 106, which
courses through the Nantahala National Forest. Cashiers is 10 miles
beyond Highlands.

 &HT;    Fun's fine and footloose in the `dancingest town'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ The social ``hour'' at the Waverly Inn
was already two hours old when those of us rocking and sipping wine
on the porch decided to move the party a few blocks down Main
Street to the Monday night street dance. That's right, a street
dance. On a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first: dinner. We counted heads, added in the
kids and asked innkeeper John Sheiry to call Cypress Cellar to
reserve a table for a party of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Besides myself, there was my husband and daughter, Michael and
Corinne Larsen and their two children from Switzerland and Cecil
and Jonette Eason from New Bern, N.C. Off we went, down the
sidewalk toward town, laughing and gabbing _ a bunch of strangers
who had become fast friends. At least for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of place this is: a small mountain town in the
heart of North Carolina apple country, where hundreds of folks cut
a rug (or just watch from lawn chairs) during the summer street
dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's square-dance time in the dancingest town in America,''
announces longtime caller Bill McEntire as the Thunder Rose Band
cranks up. And the first hometown hoedown of the season was under
way in the middle of Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Our hungry party ducked in to the Cypress Cellar for dinner, and
when we emerged, the square dancing had given way to free-form as
the band played ``Achy-Breaky Heart.'' Moms holding babies swayed
to the music, young and not-so-young couples locked arms, and
daddies swung their little girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a family get-together,'' McEntire tells me after the last
dance. ``We have 'em from 2 to toothless. Nobody's drinking.
Nobody's fighting. I'm guessing there were 1,000 people tonight.
I've had as many as 3,000 people out here.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntire is in his 51st year of calling the dances, which have
been held since 1918, except for two years during World War II.
(There are three more dances this year _ through Labor Day.)
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be in town Friday night, you can catch the
summer's final Music on Main Street program on the courthouse lawn.
Bring a chair. And over Labor Day weekend, the 54th North Carolina
Apple Festival will be in full swing downtown and in surrounding
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In any season, the pedestrian-friendly downtown is a magnet for
residents and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Main Street _ from Sixth Avenue on the north end to First Avenue
on the south _ is framed with shade trees, planters filled with
seasonal color and benches along wide sidewalks made for strolling.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the north end of the shopping district advises
visitors they are entering an international peace zone. More like
an international shopping zone, I'd say.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great little shopping town, chockablock with wonderful
antique emporiums, gift shops, galleries, a gem and mineral museum,
restaurants and great places to have a cup of gourmet coffee, ice
cream or a little something for the ol' sweet tooth.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours of shopping on Monday morning, we had made it
down one side of the street, landing at the nostalgic Days Gone By
_ the circa-1882 Justus Pharmacy _ for soda fountain-style
sandwiches and old-fashioned milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the midday heat, we slipped into the cool, dark Skyland
Arts Cinema Center to catch ``Chicken Run.'' This intimate movie
house has bistro seating and a cafe menu featuring pizza, other
snacks and beer and wine.
</P>
<P>
   But the fun isn't exclusively on Main Street. Tuesday morning,
before leaving town, we checked out the bounty of Henderson County
at the old-fashioned Curb Market, a farmer's co-op in operation
since 1924. Although it started with eight sellers under umbrellas
on Main Street, it has been doing business in the brick building at
Church and Second streets since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   A don't-miss attraction that's open Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays, the market features homegrown fruits and vegetables,
flowers, baked goodies, home-canned jellies and relishes, woven and
braided rugs, dolls, folk toys, quilts, afghans, table linens,
handwoven purses and cakes baked in Mason jars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the oldest farmer-owned farmers market in the
South,'' says Larry Ball, who sells dried and fresh cut flowers
along with very unusual lamps with shades made from hornets' nests
and bases of deer feet.
</P>
<P>
   Summer resident Jill Monroe stops to buy sunflowers from Ball
and shares a tip: ``Put a fourth cup of vodka in the water and it
makes them very happy flowers. They'll last a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, who has been summering in Hendersonville since 1940,
proclaims, ``I love this town. Although it's growing, it still
maintains the small-town atmosphere. Everyone is friendly. Nobody
is in a hurry. And I love this market. They bake the best buttered
biscuits you ever put in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Half the fun of a visit is chatting with the 100 or so friendly
vendors, some of whom are the fifth generation to run their booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming about all my life,'' says Joyce Pace, who
uses her married name, Mrs. Herbert J. Pace, to label her canned
goods. ``My mother had this booth, and she passed it on to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her most popular item is artichoke relish. ``One man said it's
good enough to open up, get a spoon and get under a shade tree and
just go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the market, you'll see the homemade ice cream tent where
the putt-putt-putt of a John Deere tractor engine turns the churn.
If you're lucky, it will be churning up a creamy frozen treat
called apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN MUSTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to hang your hat: The Waverly Inn is known for its
afternoon social hours on the veranda and enormous breakfasts. The
three-story inn with two broad verandas has 14 rooms and one suite
named for mountain wildflowers. The cookie jar is never empty, and
there's always a freshly baked cake waiting when you come in at
night. Innkeepers John and Diane Sheiry and Darla Olmstead, who
live on the premises, make sure your visit is going well. Rates:
$109-$195. 783 N. Main St. 1-800-537-8195; www.waverlyinn.com.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to the Waverly is the Claddagh Inn, a AAA
three-diamond property that brings a bit of Ireland to Main Street.
Breakfasts are bounteous here, too. 755 N. Main St. 1-800-225-4700;
www.claddaghinn.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tying on the feedbag: Try Cypress Cellar for a taste of

exotic decor and Middle Eastern fare (202 S. Washington St.,
828-696-2039) or the upscle Expressions for creative American
cuisine (114 N. Main St., 828-693-
</P>
<P>
   8516).
</P>
<P>
   For lunch, we love Days Gone By, an old-fashioned ice cream soda
parlor that serves breakfast, sandwiches, burgers and homemade
chili. 303 N. Main St. 828-693-9056.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best place to go when the sun goes down: Unless something's
happening downtown, I doubt I'd be inclined to leave the front
porch of the Waverly Inn. But I could be talked into taking a pint
at Hannah Flanagan's Pub, which has live music Thursday and
Saturday nights (300 N. Main St., 828-696-1665).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Great place to see fall color: Five miles from downtown at the
end of Laurel Park Highway is Jump Off Rock Park. So named because
legend has it that a young Cherokee maiden jumped off when she
learned her lover had been killed in battle, Jump Off Rock is a
scenic overlook that provides a panoramic view of the Blue Ridge
and Pisgah mountain ranges. 1-800-828-4244.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to get crafty: Downtown is a mecca for crafts _ both
traditional and contemporary. As you stroll along North Main
Street, pop into Touchstone Gallery, Wickwire Fine Art/Folk Art,
Brightwater Art Glass, Sweet Memories Gallery, Four Seasons
Crafters and Carolina Mountain Artists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bringing home a taste of the mountains: Apples, apples
everywhere _ with Red Delicious, Golden Delicious and Rome Beauty
being the most plentiful. Drive east out of town on U.S. 64 to the
apple houses. Harvest season is early September through
mid-October. Or stop by the Curb Market downtown for produce, jams
and jellies, sausage biscuits, baked goods and homemade ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mountain duds: Sherman's Sports and Army Store, 126 N. Main
St. (828-693-5422), stocks great outdoor gear, rain gear,
camouflage, boots, socks and sweaters. Or outfit yourself head to
foot at Mast General Store, 527 N. Main St. (828-696-1883;
www.mastgeneralstore.com).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spotted along the road: Driving east on U.S. 64, look for
Grandad's Apples in a big gray barn and note the bright green John
Deere tractor atop a faux silo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other nearby fun: Listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, Historic Johnson Farm was a late-19th-century tobacco farm
that became a boardinghouse for summer tourists. The heritage

 &HT;    A mountain retreat, Swiss style
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE SWITZERLAND, N.C. _ In the summer of 1909, three men and
their mules poked their way through virgin forest to the grassy
uplands where mountain folk had lived isolated for generations. One
of the three was a Charlotte lawyer looking into investment
possibilities, and the other two were real estate agents showing
him the neighborhood. They reached a plateau atop Grassy Mountain,
and the lawyer, a man named Heriot Clarkson, looked out upon the
valley below.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety years later, not far from where Clarkson and his guides
stood, the parking lot of the Switzerland Inn is crowded with
sedans of substance _ Lincoln Town Cars, Cadillacs, Jaguars.
License plates one weekend last month were about evenly divided _
half from North Carolina, half from Florida, South Carolina,
Georgia, even Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Other places in the North Carolina mountains are better-known,
but none are like this faux-alpine hideaway nestled at 3,500 feet
in the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandparents built here in the late '40s,'' Laura
Guissinger says while her sister, Ann, browses in the Grassy
Mountain book shop. They grew up in Baton Rouge, La. One still
lives there and the other lives in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been coming here every summer since we were kids,''
Laura Guissinger says.
</P>
<P>
   Now they were bringing their own families to this smallest of
dots on the North Carolina map. It has a post office, only a
handful of shops and eateries within walking distance and offers no
night life to speak of. But it brims daily with color and
tranquillity. In the fall, especially, Little Switzerland, just off
the Blue Ridge Parkway, is a place many folks come for a long
weekend. Many come to like it so much they plan ahead, booking a
week at the Switzerland Inn or another nearby mountain lodge.
</P>
<P>
   To the west stands Mount Mitchell, highest peak east of the
Mississippi. To the south, Linville Mountain. To the east and
northeast, Table Rock and Grandfather Mountain. To the north, Roan
Mountain, where Daniel Boone left his exhausted roan horse when the
animal could carry him no farther (Boone ventured on foot and
returned the next year to find his horse rested and nourished).
</P>
<P>
   The view is the familiar one of postcards and calendars. But
they never quite capture the reality of it on a clear day _ a blue
haze resting on mountains older than the Rockies, older than the
Alps. It must have been on such a day that Heriot Clarkson looked
out upon the valley from Grassy Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more than the view, one of the real
estate agents pointed out. Three quarters up the mountain were
seven full-flowing springs, ensuring a source of fresh water.
Clarkson was sold, and thus began a mostly peaceful commingling of
cultures _ outsiders bringing their money and manners, mountain
people receiving them with suspicion and unease.
</P>
<P>
   I'd come to Little Switzerland many times over the years,
staying at in-laws' family cottage up Bearwallow Road. This was one
of the cottages that Clarkson and his first round of investors
built, home today to descendants of Charles Duls, a law partner of
Clarkson's, and to countless generations of spiders and crawly
creatures that have never taken in the view that brings people to
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Forty miles east of Asheville and 15 miles north of Marion,
Little Switzerland has grown beyond the intimate summer colony its
founders envisioned _ but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot busier now than it used to be _ more people, more
traffic,'' Laura Guissinger says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But no one coming here from Atlanta would call it
crowded. And it's anything but hurried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just stumbled on it,'' says Trudy Hough of College Park.
She and her husband, Don, were enjoying a drive along the parkway
and looked for a room in Waynesville, N.C. When they couldn't find
one, they asked a park ranger if he knew where they might stay. He
suggested Little Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never heard of it,'' Hough says. ``It sounded like Helen,
Ga., and I told him, `I'm from Germany and if it's anything like
Helen, I want nothing to do with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Houghs found a room at the Switzerland Inn, planning to
spend the night. They ended up staying two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed us a cabin with a wonderful view, and when we
decided we'd stay two,'' she says, ``they gave us a cabin with an
ever better view.''
</P>
<P>
   At dinner both nights, they enjoyed that view over a bottle of
Moselle wine.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who spend any time in Little Switzerland, Trudy
Hough soon heard people recommending the Orchard at Altapass, a
restored apple-packing house that has become a community crafts
center and, on weekends, music hall. Six miles up the parkway, it's
in what once was the town of Altapass but today has come to be part
of the experience of going to Little Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw there was a little dance floor,'' Trudy Hough says,
``and I asked them, `Do you ever have music?'''
</P>
<P>
   They have it every weekend, kids and adults clicking heels to
the bluegrass that lives in these hills and hollows.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether the Houghs ran into 63-year-old Jack
McKinney when they were there, but he's around a lot. Descendant of
one of the oldest and most prolific mountain families in the area,
McKinney is an oral historian and part-time musician who remembers
only too well a less happy time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was seven of us, and we had 12 half brothers and
sisters,'' he says, biting into a red and yellow Stayman apple. The
Orchard's 280 acres had become rundown when Bill and Judy Carson,
along with his sister Kit Truby, bought it several years ago. Bill
Carson, a retired IBM software manager, wanted to live a more
peaceful life and became enamored of the people and culture of the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   And the people became enamored of him. The Orchard became more
than an apple-packing plant or even a place selling artifacts to
tourists. It became a community center that brought dignity and
worth to a culture that hadn't known any. ``Things that we didn't
feel like we could talk about, they let us talk about,'' McKinney
says of the Carsons.
</P>
<P>
   The Carsons' store manager, a New Jersey native named Ann
Kernahan, came to the mountains often while attending the
University of South Carolina. She moved to Oklahoma upon
graduating, but left something of herself behind. ``I'd been
waiting 20 years to get back,'' she says. ``This is where I want to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to her, McKinney affectionately says, ``She says she's
from New Jersey, but I know that can't be true. She's a
hillbilly.''
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance is mutual, native and outsider finding in one
another more than they would have expected. In its modest way, it's
the story of the southern Appalachians. The moneyed peopled who
founded Little Switzerland had no particular interest in the
mountainfolk living in the area. A summertime retreat for their
friends and families was enough. They had no idea, beautiful as the
view was, what riches were waiting to be cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN MUSTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to hang your hat: We stayed at the Switzerland Inn,
where the view is one of the best along the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Out-of-season rates range $95-$150 a night ($110-$180 starting in
October). The hotel closes for winter on Nov. 5. If you're on the
Blue Ridge Parkway, it's just off mile marker 334 (otherwise, off
N.C. 226A). 828-765-2153 or 1-800-654-4026; www
</P>
<P>
   .switzerlandinn.com. Also nearby: Big Lynn Lodge, 828-765-4257;
www.biglynnlodge.com. Rooms are $85-$129 through Nov. 5, when it
closes for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tying on the feedbag: The Chalet Restaurant at the Switzerland
Inn offers a fine buffet at breakfast and dinner, and the
Switzerland Cafe, just down the hill, is superb for lunch, offering
delicious soups and sandwiches, salads and entrees. And the
desserts are scrumptiously rich. (It's closed for dinner.) The
excellent beers from Highlands Brewing Co. of Asheville are
available at both places, along with respectable wines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best place to go when the sun goes down: By mid-October, dusk
is settling in by 6 p.m., leaving little more to see. The
Switzerland Inn's restaurant and bar are among the few choices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Great place to see fall color: Anywhere along the Blue Ridge
Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to get crafty: The Orchard at Altapass is a place to
spend half a day, crafts being only one reason. Other
arts-and-crafts places are plentiful, especially in nearby
Burnsville and Bakersville. Among those worthy of checking out:
</P>
<P>
   Emerald Village and North Carolina Mining Museum. Prospect for
your own gems _ aquamarine, beryl, smoky quartz, even emeralds _ at
this underground mine. McKinney Mine Road and Crabtree Creek Road,
Little Switzerland. 828-765-6463.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Ridge Soap Shed. A new shop that lets folks see how soap
(everything from oatmeal to olive) is made. And if you have
particular skin condition, they'll suggest a soap best for you.
Six-tenths of a mile north of Gillespie Gap exit off Blue Ridge
Parkway at 179 Meadow View Road, Spruce Pine. 828-765-6001.
</P>
<P>
   Barking Spider Pottery. Stoneware pottery. 1446 Conley Ridge
Road, Penland. 828-765-2670 or 1-888-765-2670;
www.penlandpottery.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bringing home a taste of the mountains: Again, the Orchard at
Altapass. Apples and peaches, jams and sourwood honey.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best CD for those winding roads: Guitar great Doc Watson
captures much of the flavor, but so do many others. You might, like
me, prefer the quiet of just observing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other nearby fun:+ We never go to Little Switzerland without
going to Carolina Hemlocks, a National Forest Service Recreation
Area on N.C. 80, about seven miles northwest of the parkway from
Buck Creek Gap. Kids and some adults ply the (mild) rapids of the
South Toe river in innertubes, leap and dive off rocks and
generally frolic in ways city kids no longer do. But the waters are
cool even in summer.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny used and rare bookstore Grassy Mountain Shop, two doors
down from the Switzerland Cafe, is one of the better ones in the
Southeast. 828-765-9070; www.johnsonc(at)mitchell
</P>
<P>
   .main.nc.us. (The store plans to close for the winter in late
October.)
</P>

 &HT;    `Titles to the Land': Aboriginal works reveal the heart and the
soul of a native people
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia _ Aborigines like to say that they have
the world's oldest culture, having inhabited this continent for
more than 40,000 years. But their best-known artistic expression is
hardly prehistoric; in fact, it's younger than rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, buggy night in 1971, Geoffrey Bardon steered his VW
van into Papunya, a bleak, treeless settlement where the government
had moved more than 1,000 Aborigines from their traditional home in
the bush. He was there to teach their children. Noticing them draw
in the red sand, he encouraged them to try a mural at the school.
Some elders volunteered to help.
</P>
<P>
   Make it authentic, Bardon insisted. ``Nothing whitefella.''
</P>
<P>
   When the mural was done, the men asked for more paint. Working
on castaway boards and, later, canvas, they set down their
ancestral stories with dot patterns and strange-looking hieroglyphs
that had been seen only in ritual sand mosaics. They poured their
hearts into it, as if by baring something of their souls they could
make Australia understand their mystical attachment to the land
they had lost to British colonization. The paintings attracted
buyers, and other artists in other settlements began to commit
their stories to canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the Aboriginal painting style that began in
Papunya has become one of the most evocative symbols of Australia,
its distinctive dots and squiggles seen everywhere from gift shops
to the fuselages of Qantas 747s. The abstract artwork hangs in
museums around the world and fetches hundreds of thousands of
dollars at auction. Some of the finest examples will be featured
during Sydney's Olympic Arts Festival in a retrospective at the Art
Gallery of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Souls Grown Deep,'' the critically praised show of black
Southern folk art during the Atlanta Olympics, the Sydney
exhibition promises to bring wider acclaim to another flowering of
vernacular genius. Both are outsider art in the truest sense. They
emerged from the fringes of society, out of the pain and pride of a
dispossessed people, through the vision of artists who had little
formal education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best of the dot painting is as good as any contemporary
painting,'' says Robert Hughes, the Sydney-born art critic of Time
magazine. ``The problem is that so much of it now is tourist
kitsch. But I feel conflicted even saying that, because this is
very often the only source of income these people have.''
</P>
<P>
   At their simplest level, the desert paintings are a sort of
aesthetic cartography. They describe the features of the
continent's sun-blasted interior through a system of icons thatwere
the closest thing to a written language among Australia's
indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard these paintings as titles to the land,'' says Ken
Watson, an Aborigine who is assistant curator of Aboriginal art at
the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Indeed, some tribes have used
paintings to dramatize their land claims against the Australian
government.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than geography at work. The most traditional
desert paintings depict ``dreamings,'' the creation parables and
collective wisdom that Aborigines pass down through the generations
in song and ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamings are considered sacred. When the first paintings
depicting them appeared in Alice Springs, the closest town of any
size to Papunya, the gallery was picketed by Aborigines who thought
the images revealed too much to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1972. Back then, Alice Springs had only one art outlet.
Today, it's a virtual Taos of the Outback, the grassy scent of
fresh canvas filling more than a dozen fine-art galleries. They
share the busy main street with a mob of souvenir shops that sell
dot-painting designs on boomerangs, mouse pads and anything else a
tourist can cart home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably got too many people making place mats instead
of paintings,'' grouses Daphne Williams, manager of Papunya Tula,
the artist cooperative that grew out of the first years of the
desert painting movement.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal art in all its guises has become a thriving business
in Australia, accounting for $200 million in annual sales by some
estimates. With counterfeiters angling for part of the action,
authorities are advising visitors to look for labels of
authenticity. Foreign backpackers have been known to pick up travel
money by dashing off faux-Aboriginal designs.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it wouldn't have occurred to anyone to rip off
indigenous art.
</P>
<P>
   When the British arrived in the 1780s, Aborigines had been
painting and carving for eons _ some of their cave renderings
predate the ones in Europe by thousands of years. Yet the newcomers
didn't seem interested in collecting anything beyond some craftwork
and artifacts for ethnographic purposes. No art museum bothered
with the natives until well into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The first Aboriginal painter to gain recognition was, tellingly,
a European-style watercolorist. Albert Namatjira's work was so
popular among white Australians that the government granted him
full citizenship in 1957, a first for an Aborigine. (It turned
around and jailed him the following year for supplying alcohol to
his relatives.)
</P>
<P>
   Things were changing by the time Bardon arrived in Papunya a
little more than a decade after Namatjira's death. Aborigines were
pressing for civil rights and land reforms. The mood was right for
an artistic statement of native pride, and 20 untutored men in the
middle of nowhere were the ones to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Bardon still marvels at their achievement. ``You have to realize
that Australia is a country of cultural imitation,'' he says. ``We
have McDonald's and Coca-Cola and this superficial imitation of
European art. These men, in their humble way, triumphed over that.
To see it emerge from a place of such squalor and poverty makes it
that much more amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists came from different tribes and had difficult family
names that were usually shortened to monikers that could have
belonged to blues singers: Old Mick, Long Jack, Clifford Possum.
Though they have been lumped together, they had varying styles.
Some painted with the graphic simplicity of a Southern quilt.
Others wove a dense visual tapestry that could have passed for op
art. Most of them used dot patterning, a technique derived from
body paintings and ground mosaics fashioned in the sand for
dreaming ceremonies that could rock the desert for hours with
chanting and stomping.
</P>
<P>
   Dotting was crucial in making the transition to canvas, says
Margo Smith Boles, curator of the University of Virginia's
Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection, perhaps the largest in
America. ``Dots create the illusion of movement. When an artist
represents a sacred place with concentric circles, and then paints
dots radiating out from them, it creates a shimmering effect. You
can feel the power emanating.''
</P>
<P>
   Dot paintings don't just look different; the way they're made is
uniquely Aboriginal.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall students at Kennesaw State University got to see the
process up close as the college hosted three painters-in-residence
from Fitzroy Crossing, a small town in the Kimberly country of
northwestern Australia. Art professor Roberta Griffin watched them
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any easels,'' she recalls. ``They laid the
canvases on the floor and walked around them as they painted. When
they were finished, we had to ask which side was up.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are hanging at Kennesaw State, along with the
artists' explanations of what they signify. Ngarralja Tommy May, a
former cattle hand in his mid-60s, portrayed a water hole where his
people could always find grubs and lizards that were ``really good
to eat.'' It's part of the land he grew up on _ the only land he
can paint, according to Aboriginal custom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not allowed to tell other people's stories,'' he says, by
telephone, back home in Australia. He adds that he remembers his
stay in Georgia every time he slips on the spiffy cowboy boots he
bought at Horse Town, a western wear store in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Ngarralja's art is in museums and private collections across
Australia. Yet his work has brought him few material comforts other
than a very used Holden station wagon. He certainly hasn't earned a
full-time living. Few Aboriginal artists do.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is the social structure. Artists in
traditional communities are expected to spread the wealth around
their extended families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an almost communistic system of distribution,'' says
Tim Klingender, director of Aboriginal art for Sotheby's Australia.
``If someone catches a kangaroo, he doesn't just eat it. There's a
protocol: His father gets the tail, his mother gets a leg, his
uncle gets a leg. It's the same way if the artist makes a big sale.
He's likely to buy a four-wheel drive for the community, and the
money is gone by the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The annals of Aboriginal art are full of hard luck stories. One
of the latest concerns one of the best, Johnny Warrangkula
Tjupurrula, one of the Loritja people who was a pioneer among the
Papunya artists. When Bardon met Tjupurrula, he spoke only broken
English, and that with a stutter. But when he reached for one of
the paintbrushes he kept tucked in his hatband, he was as lyrical
as an old master. In 1972, he painted a remarkable canvas that
pulses with the hypnotic detail of a van Gogh night vision. ``Water
Dreaming at Kalipinya'' sold for $150 _ a good sum for an unknown
painter _ and went into an artist's private collection in
Melbourne. It re-emerged in June when Sotheby's auctioned it to an
American collector for more than $287,000 _ a record price for an
Aboriginal painting.
</P>
<P>
   Tjupurrula didn't get a cent. Only France requires that
royalties be paid to artists when their work is resold at
appreciated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tjupurrula painted into the '90s and earned thousands of dollars
that supported his relations and otherwise sifted through his
gifted hands like sand. Now in his 60s and almost blind with
cataracts, he lives in a government nursing home in Alice Springs
and no longer paints. When he was told of the sale, he was puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still thinks of it as his painting,'' says Liz Tepper of
Warumpi Arts, the last gallery to represent Tjupurrula. ``He
doesn't understand the processes of white culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the artist is said not to be bitter _ only sad. Bardon, his
old friend and mentor, says that Tjupurrula finds it disheartening
that other Australians don't share his people's deep spiritual
connection to the land, the ultimate inspiration for all his
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny,'' he says, ``feels sorry for white people.''

<P>
   The ultimate ape gets his comeuppance. It's one of about a dozen
flicks where Godzilla battles formidable foes _ like Mothra,
Megalon and the robot Mechagodzilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 1985''
</P>
<P>
   Here comes that other big guy again. Raymond Burr, awkwardly
plopped into the '56 film release to entice U.S. audiences, returns
with a beard and more bogus oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' (1998)
</P>
<P>
   A botched U.S. effort with unending marketing of toys. Die-hard
fans dissed it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000''
</P>
<P>
   The new Japanese film sets the monster's height at 170 feet.
From the mid-'50s to 1975, he was 164 feet tall. From 1984 to 1989,
he was 262 feet, and in the '90s, he was 328 feet.

 &HT;    Graham's daughter one of the country's foremost Bible teachers
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH _ A portable potty in the yard of the traditional
red-brick ranch accommodates workers on a two-month remodeling
project that has stretched into eight months. Inside, on the floor
of a light-filled family room, a flat-faced white Persian cat with
drippy black markings around his eyes sleeps near his mistress's
feet. He is known both as Xerxes, for the historic King of Persia,
and Tammy Faye, for the former PTL hostess. A washing machine chugs
rhythmically in the background.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this, Anne Graham Lotz calmly submits to an
interview. Last week, she was a featured speaker at a gathering in
Amsterdam of 10,000 evangelists from around the world. Today, by 9
a.m., she is on her third load of laundry. Next weekend, she'll be
in the spotlight again, leading a revival at Atlanta's Philips
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   As the second daughter of evangelist Billy Graham and his wife,
Ruth Bell Graham, Lotz is used to a life that mixes the monumental
and the mundane. While her father rubbed his angular elbows with
royals and presidents, the five little Grahams exchanged typical
siblings' blows and insults in the mountain community of Montreat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lotz, 52, has gained a reputation of her own as one of the
country's foremost Bible teachers and as the best preacher in her
illustrious family.
</P>
<P>
   With her mother's elegant bone structure and sharp sense of
humor and her father's height and intensity, she draws in and holds
a congregation, telling them about ``Jee-sus'' in a soft, rich
Southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas her father preaches the same message repeatedly _
eternal life comes through Jesus Christ _ Lotz delves into
Scripture, extracting volumes from a few verses.
</P>
<P>
   She compares her role to that of her father and his heir
apparent, her brother, Franklin: ``Daddy and Franklin are
obstetricians, bringing the babies into the family of God. I take
them, once they're in the family, and help them to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Became 'child of God' early
</P>
<P>
   Lotz knew God loved her ``from the day I was born,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While her father traveled the world as the most famous Baptist
since ``John the,'' his children sat on the third pew of the little
Montreat Presbyterian church with their grandparents, who had
served as missionaries to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother always put a little slice of bread in her
pocketbook and Luden's cough drops,'' Lotz recalled. ``And she let
us draw on the bulletins.''
</P>
<P>
   The church and the community were close-knit. ``It was full of
retired missionaries who loved us,'' she said. ``They weren't
impressed at all with Daddy being an important person in their
midst.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the seasonal visitors to the mountains were _ and
peered in the windows of the Graham house.
</P>
<P>
   The little Grahams were not above taking advantage of the
tourists. Once, according to family lore, big sister Gigi talked
Anne into helping her create a makeshift tollbooth by stretching a
rope across the road and charging people to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The attention made Lotz self-conscious, she said. ``I think I
retreated a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   With the world's best known evangelist as a father, Lotz
committed herself to the Christian faith at age 5 or 6 through the
Cecil B. DeMille film ``King of Kings.'' When she wept at the
Crucifixion scene, her mother recognized it as religious conviction
and prayed with her. ``At that time, I became a child of God,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   By her senior year in high school, Lotz struggled with how to be
herself when, as one of the ultimate preacher's kids, she was being
scrutinized and judged. ``I decided at that point to please God,''
she said. ``It's a very freeing thing to live your life to please
one person.''
</P>
<P>
   This did not mean being boring. She lightened her hair and
dabbled in fashion modeling, hoping one day to make it a career.
</P>
<P>
   During one of his stays at home, her father realized his little
girl was growing up and had begun dating. He decided to take
matters into his own hands by calling the Fellowship of Christian
Athletes to try to set her up with the right kind of young man.
Steve Sloan, former star quarterback at the University of Alabama
and later college football coach, turned him down. Danny Lotz
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Lotz, 6 feet 7, was a former University of North Carolina
basketball star who had finished dental school and was completing a
stint in the Air Force. He was in his late 20s. She was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me this was something that would develop
into anything,'' she said. ``I was just going out with him to
please Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   A severe case of mononucleosis kept her from going away that
fall to Wheaton College in Illinois, where her parents had met.
Danny Lotz visited her at home every weekend. A year later, in
1966, they married in the same Montreat chapel where Ruth Bell had
become Mrs. Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic deeds
</P>
<P>
   Danny Lotz, son of a Baptist New York street preacher, was
living in Chapel Hill, establishing a chapter of the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes there, and setting up a dental practice in
Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   When their first child, Jonathan, born in 1970, was a toddler,
the family moved into their current brick ranch home in Raleigh.
Jonathan was joined by two sisters, Morrow, named after her mother,
Anne Morrow Graham, and Billy Graham's mother Morrow Coffee Graham,
and Rachel-Ruth, named for Ruth Bell Graham.
</P>
<P>
   By 1976, Anne Lotz was frustrated with a life of ``small talk
and small toys and small clothes and small sticky fingerprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Graham had kept open Bibles around the family's mountain
home to sustain her through the single-parent days when her husband
was taking the Gospel to the world. Lotz knew she needed to delve
into the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to take a course through Bible Study Fellowship, an
in-depth nondenominational program. ``Nobody would start it,'' she
said. ``I decided if nobody else would, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Busier than ever as she prepared for class week by week, ``I was
a better mother,'' she said, ``more patient. I was growing on the
inside in my relationship with God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a wonderful mom,'' said daughter Rachel-Ruth Wright,
who works with her mother's ministry. ``She wasn't the kind of mom
who's froufrou and writes little notes in your lunch. She taught us
what's important_God's love. What you see in public is exactly what
she is in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, all three children are Christian and married to
Christians. Lotz enjoys her grown children and revels in small
domestic deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the only person I know who still makes pie crust from
scratch,'' says longtime friend Dody Ragsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Not always welcomed
</P>
<P>
   Lotz gave up teaching her Bible study in 1988 to found AnGeL
Ministries, which takes its name from her initials and her sense of
calling. In the ensuing years, she has written several books and
traveled the world on speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time in Brazil we were sharing a room and I
heard some wild knocking in the bathroom,'' recalled Lotz's
assistant and confidante Helen George. ``When I went in there, she
was throwing shoes at cockroaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in South Africa, George was slipping down the hall
in her bathrobe with uncombed hair and an unmade-up face to join
Lotz for an early morning cup of coffee from the pot Lotz takes on
trips. Lotz threw open the door _ and greeted her unkempt friend
with a camera flash.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz has chalked up some significant achievements as the only
woman speaker at numerous international events. She has spoken on
every continent except Antarctica but, as a woman, has not been
universally welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Oklahoma Baptist Convention rescinded an invitation
after some pastors complained about being addressed by a woman. On
another occasion, some pastors near the front of an ecumenical
gathering conspicuously rose and turned their backs to Lotz as she
stood up to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection sent her to the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gospel of Matthew, the resurrected Jesus sent
Mary Magdalene to ``go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there
they will see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotz concluded that a prohibition against women in ministry in
the Book of Timothy cited by opponents of women in ministry,
including her denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention,
specifically refers to women speaking from a position of authority
over men.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mary Magdalene, she said, ``I feel I am commanded and
commissioned to share my testimony and God's Word. I do it from the
authority of Scripture, not from a position of authority over
men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is significant that here you have a woman rising to
prominence in a subculture that, on the whole, looks askance at
women preachers or religious leaders,'' said Randall Balmer,
chairman of the religion department at Barnard College and producer
of a public television documentary on Billy Graham. ``The fact that
she doesn't bill herself as a preacher or a pastor may make her
more effective as a wedge, sort of an advance guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough times
</P>
<P>
   Just as Lotz trusted in God to lead her down the right path in
her ministry, she has relied on prayer and Scripture through the
tough times of family life.
</P>
<P>
   There was the miscarriage after Jonathan's birth. ``I look back
now and if I had had that baby, I wouldn't have Morrow,'' she said.
``God takes away and he gives. He does it so perfectly. You look
beyond the roadblock _ that's not the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In her most recent book called, like her revival series, ``Just
Give Me Jesus'' (Word Publishing, $19.99), she frankly describes a
time when she was disillusioned with her marriage: ``I will never
forget that panicked, trapped feeling as I knelt in prayer with
tears streaming down my face, desperately pleading with the Lord
for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Through focus on her faith, she recaptured the romance.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz said she shared her personal feelings to help others. ``I
think a lot of people opt to get out of a marriage at that point
because they feel there is no hope,'' she said. ``I know from
personal experience there is.''
</P>
<P>
   She applied her faith in more drastic circumstances two years
ago when Jonathan was diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently cancer is part of God's plan for your life,'' Lotz
counseled her 28-year-old son. ``God's purpose for us is not to be
healthy and wealthy and problem-free. God's purpose for us is to
glorify him.''
</P>
<P>
   They prayed that Jonathan's cancer could be used to glorify God.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery and radiation treatment, the cancer is in
remission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like God gives you what you need when you need it,''
Lotz said. ``I would think I could never face something like that
with one of my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is facing the aging and declining health of both
parents. Her father, who has Parkinson's disease, was unable to
make the trip to Amsterdam for the evangelists' conference and was
too weak even to deliver a message by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz was with her father when he underwent treatment in June.
``It was so precious to be needed,'' she said. ``I had never seen
my daddy in that kind of weakness. He had always been so strong I
never felt like I could do anything for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Graham had back surgery in Raleigh and stayed in the Lotz
home to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like one of the highlights of my life was caring for
her,'' Lotz said.
</P>
<P>
   'Ministry all around us'
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she decided to undertake the latest phase of her
ministry, a series of five revivals in different cities including
Atlanta this year, Lotz replied simply, ``God leads.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, she said, she had not been satisfied with only
accepting speaking engagements arranged by other people. Sometimes
she felt less than fully effective. Occasionally she felt used to
help accomplish a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   After some false starts, including a dispute with a professional
event company that insisted she charge admission, Lotz looked into
staging the events herself. She asked God whether that was the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   She found the answer in her daily devotional that directed her
to the story of Jesus walking on water. When his disciple Peter
wanted to join him, Jesus commanded him, ``Come.'' She believed
Jesus was telling her through the verses to strike out on unknown
waters.
</P>
<P>
   With two revivals down and three to go, ``we're on our way.''
</P>
<P>
   With no admission fees, the events have yet to break even
financially. ``But all our bills are paid,'' Lotz said. ``I feel
like if God wants us to continue, he'll bring us the money.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has ``no idea'' what else God has in store for her,
but she's sure it will be larger and more exciting than anything
she could conceive in her own mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she continues to travel and speak whenever she
feels the circumstances are right. She has made friends with the
bell captains who check luggage at the Raleigh-Durham airport, the
security guards there and the people behind the ticket counters.
</P>
<P>
   She is constantly aware that any encounter may be arranged by
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go to Amsterdam and say God has me there to speak to
10,000 evangelists,'' she said. ``But maybe God's purpose isn't
only to have me there, but to have me speak to somebody on the
plane. Ministry is all around us.''

U.N. REFORM GROUP FAVORS GORE OVER BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Vice President Al Gore would give more
unqualified support to the United Nations and be more willing to
sign international treaties than his Republican opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush, an independent U.N. watchdog organization said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is still hedging his support for some important
international initiatives, as President Clinton did when he met
stiff resistance from Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, the Campaign for United Nations Reform, which
is based in Washington, sent both major candidates in this year's
race a comprehensive questionnaire on topics involving U.S.
participation in international affairs. The group also polled
candidates for congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied in a brief letter to Don Kraus, executive director
of the Campaign for United Nations Reform, saying that while he
believed that international organizations can serve the cause of
peace, he would never place U.S. troops under U.N. command. He
would pay U.S. debts to the organization, he said, only when its
bureaucracy has been reformed and U.S. dues lowered.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he wanted reforms at the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded to more than a dozen questions, often at some
length. He said that it was time the United States paid its dues to
the United Nations ``in full, on time and without conditions.'' He
added that there had already been substantial reforms in the U.N.
system. He said that agencies of the United Nations ``offer the
U.S. an effective means of doing our fair share to alleviate
suffering in some of the most miserable corners of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   On outstanding treaties not signed by the United States, Gore
gave unequivocal support to the Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, the Law of the Sea Treaty and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to stop the testing of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore continued to call for changes in an international
agreement banning land mines, reflecting longstanding objections
from the Pentagon. And he declined to endorse the International
Criminal Court, now taking shape without U.S. support. His said in
his reply that the court's treaty still had ``significant flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for United Nations Reform is a 25-year-old
organization that advocates stronger U.S. support for the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Among congressional responses to the organization's
questionnaire, attitudes toward the United Nations ranged very
widely, said Jennifer Taylor, program director for the campaign.
Some members of Congress were very supportive of the United
Nations' adherence to international treaties. But others, a small
minority, responded by advocating that the United States quit the
organization, which they said did not serve U.S. interests.

 &HT;    Smokies: Taking paradise by the reins
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGGIE VALLEY, N.C._ The Smoky Mountains look different from the
back of a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelier. Less familiar. These prolific peaks, viewed so many
times before _ through a dusty windshield on road trips to
Asheville, from hiking trails in the Pisgah National Forest,
through the gaudy neon glare of Cherokee _ seem to radiate fresh
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the pungent smell and unhurried gait of Noble, a
14-year-old draft- and quarter-horse mix. Maybe it's the
refreshingly cool temperature, which rarely climbs above 75 degrees
at this elevation. Maybe it's the company, an affable band of
strangers who've gathered for a bit of riding and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's because this place, the 1,000-acre Cataloochee
Ranch, is so close to paradise you half expect to enter it through
pearly gates.
</P>
<P>
   Nuzzling up to the edge of Great Smoky Mountains National Park,
the ranch sprawls over three peaks, the tallest of which, Hemphill
Bald, rises 5,600 feet above sea level. Its horse pastures cling to
the side of Moody Top, the second highest peak, while guests bunk
down in cabins and lodges on Fie Top. Earth-tone steeds stand out
against the vast green of Moody Top's rising meadows, grazing high
above the stable roof.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to forget where we are, just a three-mile uphill
drive from Maggie Valley, sort of the Myrtle Beach of Western North
Carolina. On the town's ultra-commercialized U.S. 19 strip you'll
find the scruffy theme park Ghost Town in the Sky, along with
myriad mini-golf courses, go-cart tracks and souvenir shacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world _ you don't see any signs of
civilization,'' says Ellie Roemer, 63, of the ranch's bucolic
setting.
</P>
<P>
   A retired real estate agent from Tryon, N.C., Roemer and her
husband, Lee, 64, are spending some quality time here with their
son Glenn, daughter-in-law Ines and grandson Dominic, visiting from
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a retired veterinarian, loves the mild climate and relaxed
pace. ``You can breathe deep here,'' he marvels.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta native Tom Alexander and his wife Judith opened the
ranch in 1939, after a three-year run with another horse haven in
nearby Cataloochee Valley. Alexander, who studied forestry at the
University of Georgia, was smitten with the Smokies at a young age.
``He wanted to figure out a way to live on top of a mountain and
make a living,'' says daughter Alice Aumen, 62.
</P>
<P>
   Aumen and other members of the Alexander brood ran it after the
patriarch died in 1972, and management responsibility recently
passed to her son Alex, 31.
</P>
<P>
   The all-in-the-family feeling extends to the guests. Young
couples with children mix amiably here with groups of singles and
seniors. Kids frolic over the grounds, playing horseshoes and touch
football. Other activities include wagon rides, fishing, hiking and
cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Meals are belt-loosening affairs. One night we gorged on
barbecue ribs, corn on the cob and banana pudding, only to wake up
the next morning to a bounteous breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage
and pancakes. Aumen urges weight watchers not to worry about the
waistline. With a sly smile, she quotes her mother (who died in
1997) as saying, ``calories don't live up here.''
</P>
<P>
   After-dinner entertainment ranges from bluegrass concerts to
presentations by wildlife experts and Native American folklorists.
Local naturalist Rob Gudger and his timber wolves are a favorite
with youngsters, who squeal with delight when he brings the beasts
up close for some frisky face-licking.
</P>
<P>
   The big draw, of course, is the horses. Cataloochee's stable can
accommodate a wide range of riders, from skittish beginners to old
hands. The only restrictions: You have to be at least 6 years old
and weigh 55 to 225 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll get a horse that will challenge me,'' says Brenda
Dempsey, 43, of Greenville, S.C. An avid rider since she was a
teenager, Dempsey has come back to the ranch for the second time in
two years with husband Steve and 12-year-old daughter JenniLynn.
``At a lot of places, they'll only allow you to walk in a line. I
can go beyond a walk here.''
</P>
<P>
   Novices needn't fret. There are beginner rides that proceed in a
reassuringly dawdling, head-to-tail fashion. The Roemers don't
consider themselves serious riders _ ``We're retired, we're not
serious about anything,'' jokes Lee _ but they quite enjoyed their
slow morning ride up Hemphill Bald, though Lee admits to a little
soreness afterwards. ``I'm glad I brought the Ibuprofen,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Hemphill Bald ride, one of four routes on the ranch, may be
the most breathtaking _ a steep, winding climb that the unflappable
Noble handles with ease. Ambling past dense thickets of
rhododendron, over trickling streams and through a herd of bulls,
our group ascends to the peak, pausing for a rest under a crooked
buckeye tree.
</P>
<P>
   The peak drops away into layer upon layer of mountains that fade
into the horizon. Far below us we can see the rooftops of the ranch
cabins. The air is still, interrupted only by an occasional snuff
from one of the horses, idly dozing at their hitching post.
</P>
<P>
   The pause stretches on. None of us seems to want to leave. All
that awaits us below is real life, with its deadlines and
appointments, its headlight blare and construction-site cacophony.
Who can blame us for lingering?

CIA AT ODDS WITH ALBRIGHT'S PLEDGE TO RELEASE REMAINING DOCUMENTS
ON CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also moving in `i' news file.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and George
Tenet, director of central intelligence, are at odds over the
extent to which the United States should release documentation of
its involvement with repressive Latin American regimes in decades
past.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to South America last week, Albright pledged to
push for the ``fullest possible declassification'' of files related
to the coup that toppled Chile's elected Socialist government and
the 17-year military dictatorship that followed.
</P>
<P>
   She also promised to start reviewing for release documents about
Argentina's ``disappeared'' and their children, victims of
state-sanctioned kidnappings during successive regimes between 1976
and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been something that the president and I have not only
supported, but have been instrumental in making sure it happens,''
Albright said in Chile on Thursday. She added: ``The whole enormity
of the project reflects our commitment to clarify the historic
record of a highly controversial period in our bilateral
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tenet recently notified members of Congress that he had
decided to withhold an unspecified number of documents about Chile
on the grounds they would disclose too much about how his agency
conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These materials present a pattern of activity that had the
effect of revealing intelligence methods that have been employed
worldwide,'' Tenet said in an August 11 letter to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The documents had already been cleared by the CIA's own
declassification experts as part of the last and largest release of
interagency files related to Chile, which is scheduled Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last year ordered the national security
agencies to ``retrieve and review for declassification documents
that shed light on human rights abuses, terrorism and other acts of
political violence in Chile'' between 1968 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're entitled to know what happened back then, and
how it happened,'' Clinton said at the time, referring to covert
American actions that aided the rise of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who
led the junta that overthrew Chile's Socialist president, Salvador
Allende Gossens.
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiative, which began after the arrest of
Pinochet in London at the request of a Spanish judge, has yielded
about 7,500 documents so far, most of them from the State
Department. Archivists who have reviewed the documents say none of
them reveals the CIA role in destabilizing the Allende government.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said he would submit the documents for a final interagency
review, and insisted, ``We are in no way trying to withhold
information embarrassing to the United States government.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of a broader declassification of documents voice
concerns that Tenet is doing just that: withholding details of
American complicity in the overthrow of a democratic government
and, by extension, in the repressive regime that followed. They
accuse the CIA director of flouting the spirit of Clinton's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're witnessing an internal division within the
administration,'' said Daniel Weiss, a spokesman for Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif. ``We believe the president genuinely wants to see
the full story on Chile and the United States told publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said the CIA chief apparently wants to withhold
information ``that would speak unfavorably of the United States.
But that's the historical process. That's the integrity we're
trying to establish, to understand fully what took place in
Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of CIA operations in Chile have been in the public
domain for a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, a panel headed by Sen. Frank Church provided an account
of CIA attempts to foment a military coup against Allende by
kidnapping Chile's top armed forces commander, Gen. Rene Schneider.
The plot, which resulted in Schneider's death, was ordered by
President Nixon and overseen by his national security adviser,
Henry Kissinger, the panel said in the first of its two reports.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's second report, which detailed covert CIA
actions in Chile between 1963 and 1973, was based on many of the
documents Tenet now seeks to withhold, according to Peter Kornbluh,
a senior analyst at the National Security Archive, a clearinghouse
for declassified government documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These documents are a major history of one of America's most
controversial covert wars,'' Kornbluh said. ``They have
extraordinary historical value. But they also are relevant to the
ongoing national discussion about the propriety of U.S. covert
operations in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   American records related to recent repression in Argentina are
not expected to provide as rich a historical trove. That country's
first military coup, in 1976, coincided with the election of
President Carter, whose human rights campaign strained ties with
the architects of a ``dirty war'' that eventually killed more than
15,000 people. But the United States was well apprised of Operation
Condor, a plan by South American regimes to arrest dissidents in
one another's countries.
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to say whether Clinton would back up
the openness of his top diplomat or ratify the caution of his
spymaster. A spokesman, said the matter is still under review.

 &HT;    `Titles to the Land': Aboriginal works reveal the heart and the
soul of a native people
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 20.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia _ Aborigines like to say that they have
the world's oldest culture, having inhabited this continent for
more than 40,000 years. But their best-known artistic expression is
hardly prehistoric; in fact, it's younger than rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, buggy night in 1971, Geoffrey Bardon steered his VW
van into Papunya, a bleak, treeless settlement where the government
had moved more than 1,000 Aborigines from their traditional home in
the bush. He was there to teach their children. Noticing them draw
in the red sand, he encouraged them to try a mural at the school.
Some elders volunteered to help.
</P>
<P>
   Make it authentic, Bardon insisted. ``Nothing whitefella.''
</P>
<P>
   When the mural was done, the men asked for more paint. Working
on castaway boards and, later, canvas, they set down their
ancestral stories with dot patterns and strange-looking hieroglyphs
that had been seen only in ritual sand mosaics. They poured their
hearts into it, as if by baring something of their souls they could
make Australia understand their mystical attachment to the land
they had lost to British colonization. The paintings attracted
buyers, and other artists in other settlements began to commit
their stories to canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the Aboriginal painting style that began in
Papunya has become one of the most evocative symbols of Australia,
its distinctive dots and squiggles seen everywhere from gift shops
to the fuselages of Qantas 747s. The abstract artwork hangs in
museums around the world and fetches hundreds of thousands of
dollars at auction. Some of the finest examples will be featured
during Sydney's Olympic Arts Festival in a retrospective at the Art
Gallery of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Souls Grown Deep,'' the critically praised show of black
Southern folk art during the Atlanta Olympics, the Sydney
exhibition promises to bring wider acclaim to another flowering of
vernacular genius. Both are outsider art in the truest sense. They
emerged from the fringes of society, out of the pain and pride of a
dispossessed people, through the vision of artists who had little
formal education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best of the dot painting is as good as any contemporary
painting,'' says Robert Hughes, the Sydney-born art critic of Time
magazine. ``The problem is that so much of it now is tourist
kitsch. But I feel conflicted even saying that, because this is
very often the only source of income these people have.''
</P>
<P>
   At their simplest level, the desert paintings are a sort of
aesthetic cartography. They describe the features of the
continent's sun-blasted interior through a system of icons thatwere
the closest thing to a written language among Australia's
indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard these paintings as titles to the land,'' says Ken
Watson, an Aborigine who is assistant curator of Aboriginal art at
the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Indeed, some tribes have used
paintings to dramatize their land claims against the Australian
government.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than geography at work. The most traditional
desert paintings depict ``dreamings,'' the creation parables and
collective wisdom that Aborigines pass down through the generations
in song and ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamings are considered sacred. When the first paintings
depicting them appeared in Alice Springs, the closest town of any
size to Papunya, the gallery was picketed by Aborigines who thought
the images revealed too much to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1972. Back then, Alice Springs had only one art outlet.
Today, it's a virtual Taos of the Outback, the grassy scent of
fresh canvas filling more than a dozen fine-art galleries. They
share the busy main street with a mob of souvenir shops that sell
dot-painting designs on boomerangs, mouse pads and anything else a
tourist can cart home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably got too many people making place mats instead
of paintings,'' grouses Daphne Williams, manager of Papunya Tula,
the artist cooperative that grew out of the first years of the
desert painting movement.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal art in all its guises has become a thriving business
in Australia, accounting for $200 million in annual sales by some
estimates. With counterfeiters angling for part of the action,
authorities are advising visitors to look for labels of
authenticity. Foreign backpackers have been known to pick up travel
money by dashing off faux-Aboriginal designs.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it wouldn't have occurred to anyone to rip off
indigenous art.
</P>
<P>
   When the British arrived in the 1780s, Aborigines had been
painting and carving for eons _ some of their cave renderings
predate the ones in Europe by thousands of years. Yet the newcomers
didn't seem interested in collecting anything beyond some craftwork
and artifacts for ethnographic purposes. No art museum bothered
with the natives until well into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The first Aboriginal painter to gain recognition was, tellingly,
a European-style watercolorist. Albert Namatjira's work was so
popular among white Australians that the government granted him
full citizenship in 1957, a first for an Aborigine. (It turned
around and jailed him the following year for supplying alcohol to
his relatives.)
</P>
<P>
   Things were changing by the time Bardon arrived in Papunya a
little more than a decade after Namatjira's death. Aborigines were
pressing for civil rights and land reforms. The mood was right for
an artistic statement of native pride, and 20 untutored men in the
middle of nowhere were the ones to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Bardon still marvels at their achievement. ``You have to realize
that Australia is a country of cultural imitation,'' he says. ``We
have McDonald's and Coca-Cola and this superficial imitation of
European art. These men, in their humble way, triumphed over that.
To see it emerge from a place of such squalor and poverty makes it
that much more amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists came from different tribes and had difficult family
names that were usually shortened to monikers that could have
belonged to blues singers: Old Mick, Long Jack, Clifford Possum.
Though they have been lumped together, they had varying styles.
Some painted with the graphic simplicity of a Southern quilt.
Others wove a dense visual tapestry that could have passed for op
art. Most of them used dot patterning, a technique derived from
body paintings and ground mosaics fashioned in the sand for
dreaming ceremonies that could rock the desert for hours with
chanting and stomping.
</P>
<P>
   Dotting was crucial in making the transition to canvas, says
Margo Smith Boles, curator of the University of Virginia's
Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection, perhaps the largest in
America. ``Dots create the illusion of movement. When an artist
represents a sacred place with concentric circles, and then paints
dots radiating out from them, it creates a shimmering effect. You
can feel the power emanating.''
</P>
<P>
   Dot paintings don't just look different; the way they're made is
uniquely Aboriginal.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall students at Kennesaw State University got to see the
process up close as the college hosted three painters-in-residence
from Fitzroy Crossing, a small town in the Kimberly country of
northwestern Australia. Art professor Roberta Griffin watched them
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any easels,'' she recalls. ``They laid the
canvases on the floor and walked around them as they painted. When
they were finished, we had to ask which side was up.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are hanging at Kennesaw State, along with the
artists' explanations of what they signify. Ngarralja Tommy May, a
former cattle hand in his mid-60s, portrayed a water hole where his
people could always find grubs and lizards that were ``really good
to eat.'' It's part of the land he grew up on _ the only land he
can paint, according to Aboriginal custom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not allowed to tell other people's stories,'' he says, by
telephone, back home in Australia. He adds that he remembers his
stay in Georgia every time he slips on the spiffy cowboy boots he
bought at Horse Town, a western wear store in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Ngarralja's art is in museums and private collections across
Australia. Yet his work has brought him few material comforts other
than a very used Holden station wagon. He certainly hasn't earned a
full-time living. Few Aboriginal artists do.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is the social structure. Artists in
traditional communities are expected to spread the wealth around
their extended families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an almost communistic system of distribution,'' says
Tim Klingender, director of Aboriginal art for Sotheby's Australia.
``If someone catches a kangaroo, he doesn't just eat it. There's a
protocol: His father gets the tail, his mother gets a leg, his
uncle gets a leg. It's the same way if the artist makes a big sale.
He's likely to buy a four-wheel drive for the community, and the
money is gone by the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The annals of Aboriginal art are full of hard luck stories. One
of the latest concerns one of the best, Johnny Warrangkula
Tjupurrula, one of the Loritja people who was a pioneer among the
Papunya artists. When Bardon met Tjupurrula, he spoke only broken
English, and that with a stutter. But when he reached for one of
the paintbrushes he kept tucked in his hatband, he was as lyrical
as an old master. In 1972, he painted a remarkable canvas that
pulses with the hypnotic detail of a van Gogh night vision. ``Water
Dreaming at Kalipinya'' sold for $150 _ a good sum for an unknown
painter _ and went into an artist's private collection in
Melbourne. It re-emerged in June when Sotheby's auctioned it to an
American collector for more than $287,000 _ a record price for an
Aboriginal painting.
</P>
<P>
   Tjupurrula didn't get a cent. Only France requires that
royalties be paid to artists when their work is resold at
appreciated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tjupurrula painted into the '90s and earned thousands of dollars
that supported his relations and otherwise sifted through his
gifted hands like sand. Now in his 60s and almost blind with
cataracts, he lives in a government nursing home in Alice Springs
and no longer paints. When he was told of the sale, he was puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still thinks of it as his painting,'' says Liz Tepper of
Warumpi Arts, the last gallery to represent Tjupurrula. ``He
doesn't understand the processes of white culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the artist is said not to be bitter _ only sad. Bardon, his
old friend and mentor, says that Tjupurrula finds it disheartening
that other Australians don't share his people's deep spiritual
connection to the land, the ultimate inspiration for all his
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny,'' he says, ``feels sorry for white people.''

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ ``If they want war, we will give them
defeat,'' declared President Joseph Estrada not long ago in the
latest version of his tough-guy political credo: ``Don't dare me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking this time about Muslim rebels and, like his
earlier turns at belligerence, this one worked. His poll numbers
went up last week.
</P>
<P>
   The public is desperate for its president to pull himself
together and start getting things done. A former movie actor with a
lackadaisical approach to government, Estrada has increasingly
become the subject of jokes, gossip and that old Philippine staple,
coup rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway into his six-year term, the economy is faltering,
corruption and cronyism seem to be ascendant and Muslim separatists
and kidnappers are getting out of hand in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his options narrowed, Estrada has unleashed his army
in a cathartic take-no-prisoners campaign against the rebels on the
island of Mindanao. He is also determined to resolve a kidnapping
of Western vacationers that has continued for almost four months on
the tiny neighboring island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   Three Malaysian hostages were freed Saturday. There were hopes
that the remaining nine Westerners and one Filipino could be
released over the weekend, officials said, though negotiators said
on Saturday that so far their talks had not been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently as a result of the effort to end the hostage
situation, though, those polled gave the president a positive
rating of over 50 percent for the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   But political commentators seemed unimpressed. Rep. Raul
Gonzales recalled the boost former President Bush enjoyed after the
Persian Gulf war in 1991 _ only to be undercut by his perceived
failure to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even that comparison is on the rosy side, said Amando Doronila,
a columnist for The Philippine Daily Inquirer. Bush had just won a
war; Estrada does not even have a workable strategy for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has flared in the three-decade-old insurgency following
his failure to build on the peacemaking and economic development
policies of his predecessor, Fidel Ramos. Analysts here say there
cannot be a lasting peace unless those policies are creatively
pursued.
</P>
<P>
   A recent spate of bombings in Manila that many people attribute
to the Muslim rebels heightened popular fears about the president's
inaction. At least now, people say, Estrada is doing something.
Last month, soldiers captured the headquarters in Mindanao of the
main insurgent group, the Moro National Liberation Front, and
Estrada traveled there to hoist the Philippine flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's enjoying a sort of windfall from Mindanao, but that
windfall is like opium,'' Doronila said. ``The opium deadens
people's awareness to the really serious problems that are hurting
them. They have temporarily forgotten the corruption and the
economic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's growth rate of less than 4 percent is well below
projections, slower than the growth in most other nations in the
region, and far too low to absorb soaring birthrates. One-third of
the population of 76 million remains below the poverty line and
unemployment has risen to more than 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly damaging among investors is the atmosphere
of old-style cronyism that surrounds Estrada's government, with
favored friends receiving both political appointments and
protection in questionable business deals. The World Bank recently
estimated that corruption was costing the Philippines $46 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing the hard work of making policy and legislation _ as a
senator, he once said his favorite moment was when the speaker
shouted, ``Recess!'' _ Estrada has fallen back on presidential
decrees, issuing hundreds of them in his first two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presidency is very erratic, not driven by any coherent
vision or planning,'' Doronila said. ``It's very much an ad hoc
presidency. But he has a sure touch for what is popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, a former B-movie actor who cultivates an image as a man
of the people, is entranced by the example of Ronald Reagan, but
the parallels go only so far. Unlike his American hero, he has
little philosophy of government and is not leading the nation in
any clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Reagan, he is not a natural in the role of president.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has the feeling that in reacting to a situation his first
words are, `How do I play this scene?' _ not whatever issues are
there,'' said the Rev. John Carroll, an American sociologist who
teaches here.
</P>
<P>
   But like Reagan, Estrada enjoys seeing the world in movie
images. The persona he projects as president _ along with the
public perception of him _ is based on his movie roles as a
pugnacious little guy who faces down the slick and the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this image, his base of support is among the nation's
poor. With most of the political and economic elite against him, he
swept to office in May 1998 with a huge plurality of 40 percent in
the field of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Now even the poor have begun to turn against him. Drivers of the
gaudy converted Jeeps, known as Jeepneys and used as public
minibuses, have said they no longer want him to use the Jeepney as
his symbol.
</P>
<P>
   So he has promised a new President Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation's life is like a motion picture,'' he said last year.
``With proper direction, the next scenes will change.''
</P>
<P>
   The new scenes he has written look like this: He will get to
work at 8 a.m. _ rather than in the afternoon _ and he will stay on
the job all day long. He will set aside his beloved Johnnie Walker
whiskey and drink red wine instead.
</P>
<P>
   And, he promised, he will curtail his ``midnight Cabinet,''
all-night karaoke-bar-style sessions with his cronies that one aide
said sometimes produced presidential decrees that had to be quickly
countermanded in the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 in the morning, I am the only sober one in the room,''
said the aide, Aprodocio Laquian, last March. He was promptly
forced to resign.

MULTIBILLIONAIRE LEAVES THE OPEN OCEAN FOR THE CHALLENGE OF
AMERICA'S CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERB McCORMICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Storm-tossed, soaked and seasick, Larry Ellison watched as his
hired posse of professional sailors scrambled to repair yet another
piece of broken equipment aboard his 80-foot maxi-yacht Sayonara.
It was the final days of December 1998, and Ellison and his 22-man
crew were battling fierce weather off the coast of Australia in the
54th running of the annual Sydney-Hobart Race.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, the chief executive officer of Oracle Corp., was far
removed from the Silicon Valley boardrooms where he has become a
multibillionaire. In the now infamous Hobart race, sailing with as
good a crew as money could buy, Sayonara overcame a litany of gear
failures to win line honors as the first boat to finish. Far
astern, six sailors perished in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   After dabbling in the sport in the '70s, Ellison took a long
hiatus before commissioning Sayonara in 1995. In the intervening
years, he has campaigned the boat vigorously. But Ellison's
commitment to yacht racing escalated to new, rarefied heights last
week when he announced his challenge for the America's Cup in New
Zealand in 2003, an effort that will cost $80 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Europe, Ellison was not on hand for the
announcement, leaving that duty to his chief operating officer,
Bill Erkelens, and his campaign manager, Paul Cayard. And Ellison
also declined an interview request for this article.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the disastrous Hobart race, however, in
early 1999 Ellison spoke about his experiences in a rare talk at
San Francisco's St. Francis Yacht Club, which will most likely
represent his cup challenge. During the speech, Ellison described
how one crewman broke an ankle, another a thumb, and a third
cracked his ribs. He strongly intimated that he was finished with
offshore ocean racing.
</P>
<P>
   But closed-course, around-the-buoys, America's Cup-style match
racing appears to be a different matter. And the next cup
competition has enticed several other billionaires to enter the
fray for the first time, including the Seattle businessman Craig
McCaw and the Swiss pharmaceutical heir Ernesto Bertarelli.
</P>
<P>
   As the former captain and project manager for Sayonara, Erkelens
was at Ellison's side during the Hobart race. So too was the Kiwi
skipper Chris Dickson, who will reprise that role with the Oracle
Racing challenge, and the former Team New Zealand America's Cup
sailor Robbie Naismith, who has also joined the team. In fact,
Erkelens said Ellison's interest in the cup was piqued when he
learned that the New Zealand crewmen who sailed aboard Sayonara
might be available for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes the team aspect of Sayonara, and the people,''
Erkelens said. ``Being able to relax with a group of people
completely outside of work seems to be a major draw to him.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the core group of Sayonara sailors with other
experienced cup players, Ellison hired Cayard, the skipper who
headed the America One challenge in the last cup, as well as
several of that program's key personnel, including the operations
manager, Bob Billingham. Ellison also purchased all of America
One's assets, which became available when Cayard decided that the
billionaires had essentially priced him out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cap on our old fund-raising model for America One, which
was based on corporate sponsorship and raising money from private
donations, seems be around 30 or 40 million dollars,'' Cayard said.
``That's less than half of what you're going to need to be
competitive now.''
</P>
<P>
   But money is not an issue for Ellison, who also purchased the
two Aloha Racing cup boats sailed by John Kolius' Hawaii-based
challenge earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to conjure a scenario in which Ellison will be
outspent, but it is also hard to lay odds on the success of a
Dickson-Cayard collaboration. Both are known for being fiercely
competitive, and neither suffers from a lack of self-esteem. But
Cayard is coming off a fresh, tough cup challenge, while Dickson
sat out the last event.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said that he planned to be aboard Ellison's cup racer,
but in what position remains uncertain. ``Dickson has a long
relationship with Larry as Sayonara's skipper, so he's the
incumbent skipper,'' Cayard said. ``I think we just have to wait
and see how things go. In two-and-a-half years, anything's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cayard is known as a team player, it will be
interesting to see how comfortable he will be if not unequivocally
in command. And if Cayard finds himself unhappy in a limited role
in a Dickson afterguard, Ellison may find himself with a
quarterback controversy not seen in the Bay area since Joe Montana
and Steve Young were both wearing the uniform of Cayard's beloved
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   How close Ellison will be to the day-to-day operation remains to
be seen. In the Hobart race, between bouts of nausea, Ellison took
a regular turn at the wheel, and he is said to be a good helmsman.
``Larry would like to be involved as much as his schedule allows,''
Erkelens said. ``But he doesn't want to be on board unless he has
spent enough time training to participate at the level required.''
</P>
<P>
   A lasting image of Sayonara's Sydney-Hobart ordeal is an aerial
photograph of the boat in the final miles, with Ellison slumped
over the lifelines, visibly drained. Now, in a manner of speaking,
he is again at sea. Only time will tell if the voyage is
triumphant, or plagued by that old, queasy feeling.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani named Correction Commissioner
Bernard Kerik as New York City's next police commissioner Saturday,
turning to a former undercover narcotics detective and familiar
member of his administration to command the nation's largest police
department.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, 44, will replace Howard Safir, a retired federal agent
and Giuliani's confidant and friend of 25 years, who announced his
resignation this month after four and a half years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik will be sworn in this week as the department's 40th
commissioner in just under 100 years, taking command of the
40,000-member force during a time when crime has fallen sharply but
the department has suffered intense criticism, from within and
without.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik's achievements have been significant at the city
Department of Correction, where he brought about substantial
declines in violence in the jail system and reduced overtime. But
some critics have said that his lack of a college degree, a
requirement for the rank of captain and higher in the Police
Department, sends the wrong message when the department is
struggling to recruit qualified candidates to the force.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, who won the Medal of Valor as a police detective, is 24
credits short of a degree in labor relations at Empire State
College.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Kerik is the most prominent element of a
broader change in the city's police hierarchy. Giuliani said
Saturday that he would promote Chief of Department Joseph P. Dunne
to be his new first deputy commissioner, replacing Patrick E.
Kelleher, who retired last week. Dunne was one of the three
finalists for the job of commissioner. The other was Dennison Young
Jr., counsel to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three candidates that I considered were Dennison
Young, Joe Dunne and Bernie Kerik,'' Giuliani said, ``and the city
is going to have the good fortune of having all three of them
working together, along with others because we work as a team, to
continue to build on this record that is such a superb one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik will have the opportunity to fill the positions of deputy
commissioner of organized crime control and chief of personnel, two
of the highest posts in the department. The men who hold those jobs
are retiring.
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner, Kerik's challenges will be many and his window
of opportunity will be small, with 16 months left in Giuliani's
second and final term as mayor. And in spite of the department's
successes, it has endured sharp criticism in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the police and minority residents are strained
after the torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house in
1997 and the fatal shootings of four unarmed black men in a
13-month period that ended last March. The department is also
facing the possibility of federal oversight because of a finding by
the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn that it has failed to
adequately discipline officers who use excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the department is struggling to recruit members and
retain its veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, a native of Paterson, N.J., who lives in Riverdale, the
Bronx, spent eight years in the Police Department, served as one of
Giuliani's bodyguards during his 1993 campaign and joined the
Department of Correction in 1994 as the director of investigations.
He was appointed first deputy commissioner in 1995 and commissioner
in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the New York Police Department, Kerik was warden
of the Passaic County Jail in New Jersey.

LONG ISLAND LABS, ON THE DEFENSIVE, STRUGGLE FOR COMMUNITY
CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIENT POINT, N.Y. _ Long Island has long had a deeply uneasy
and sometimes bizarrely suspicious relationship with the scientific
enterprises that have taken root on its shores.
</P>
<P>
   A deadly disease was sure to escape from the Plum Island Animal
Disease Center _ a mile off the eastern end of Long Island here.
The genetics research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory was sure to
develop altered foods that would ruin people's health and the
environment alike. If Brookhaven National Laboratory did not
completely radiate Suffolk County, it was sure to cause a black
hole that would pull everyone from Alec Baldwin to Amy Fisher in
for good.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the institutions themselves are partly to blame.
Although it was confined to Plum Island, there was an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease there in 1978. Cold Spring, for its part,
was a leader of the shadowy eugenics movement during the first half
of the 20th century, propounding racist pseudoscientific human
breeding theories. And a byproduct of Brookhaven's Nobel
Prize-winning research was enough pollution in the area to make the
federal government name the lab a Superfund site; the government
also found that the lab should have done more to prevent, or at
least detect, a leak of radioactive water that was discovered there
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It has become one of the great enduring battles of Long Island:
finding an acceptable balance between the scientific institutions
and a highly divergent population that mixes commuters and
celebrities, baymen with moguls, pensioners and new homeowners. The
arguments take on a special vehemence here, where conservatives and
liberals are united by a radical environmentalism and a whole
generation has cut its political teeth keeping the Shoreham nuclear
power plant from opening after it was built at a cost of $5.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some laboratories now find themselves fighting
against their own pasts. For institutions like Plum Island and
Brookhaven, which are run by the federal government, it is more
than a question of good neighborliness. If they fail to win support
from the community, and the politicians who represent their areas,
they will lose government financing and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Take Plum Island. Some neighbors like to paint it a latter-day
island of Dr. Moreau, and they trade outlandish yarns about 50-foot
chickens who scratch and peck there. Others have more carefully
reasoned concerns about safety precautions at the lab, and its
occasional requests to transport viruses or infected animals on and
off the island. Recently, when the government proposed upgrading
Plum Island to give it the ability to study animal viruses that can
be passed on to humans, those concerns boiled over. The plan was
scuttled, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. David Huxsoll, the new director of Plum Island, which is
run by the U.S. Agriculture Department, said the relationship with
the public would be a large part of his job description. And he has
a radical plan to win community support: he wants to open up the
long-isolated island to guided tours so people can see it for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has met with, well, mixed reactions. ``Visit Toxic
World _ A New Day of Fun Dawns at the Plum Island Animal Disease
Center,'' was the headline of one mocking article in Dan's Papers,
a weekly Hamptons institution.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ``see for yourself'' approach is employed farther
west, in Upton, at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Its
director, John H. Marburger III, is also trying to make up some of
the goodwill that was lost before his watch began. To that end, he
has invited more local civic groups _ including critics _ onto
panels about the lab, has briefed more community organizations and
has continued to hold open houses where the neighbors can learn
about research projects.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lab's past, it can still be a very hard sell, and one
that some scientists worry is undermined by a fear or distrust of
science itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has never been more dependent on science, and yet
the public has never been more distrustful of science,'' said Dr.
Robert P. Crease, an associate professor of philosophy at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, who is working on the second
volume of a history of Brookhaven National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the fear originates with fringe groups who spread
odd conspiracy theories worthy of ``The X-Files,'' like a book
called ``The Montauk Project'' that is cited by people who insist
that the Army experimented with space aliens in Montauk during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear also manifests itself in groups closer to the
mainstream who are worried about the environment and children's
health and concerned by what they consider a cavalier and sometimes
misleading attitude on the part of scientists in the past.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just found on Long Island. A report on the topic
released recently by the British House of Lords warned that
``public unease, mistrust and occasional outright hostility are
breeding a climate of deep anxiety among scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists warn that this view is too simplistic. As
Marburger, the director of Brookhaven, said, ``Parents still want
their children to learn about science, and they are not unhappy if
their children become scientists or engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   But for institutions that are dependent on public financing, any
loss of confidence is a dangerous thing. Brookhaven is a case in
point.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,300-acre laboratory, which employs 3,200 people, is less
famous these days for its groundbreaking research and its Nobel
Prize winners than for its recent environmental problems. Built in
1947 on what was then a fairly remote stretch of the island, the
laboratory conducted its research for many years unchecked by
environmental laws. By the end of the Cold War, the site was so
polluted with industrial solvents, pesticides and low-level
radioactive waste that it was declared a federal Superfund site.
</P>
<P>
   Its recent troubles began in late 1996, when laboratory
officials announced that they had discovered a plume of radioactive
tritium leaking from its High Flux Beam Reactor. The leak, and the
discovery of official inaction that had prevented it from being
detected earlier, led the government to dismiss the organization
that had run the lab for 50 years. The lab also shut down the
reactor _ temporarily, officials thought.
</P>
<P>
   News of the leaking tritium _ a radioactive isotope of hydrogen
_ galvanized civic groups in Suffolk County. Organizations like
Standing for Truth About Radiation, an East Hampton antinuclear
group which prominently features celebrities like Baldwin and the
model Christie Brinkley on its board, mobilized to shut the reactor
down. Some advocacy groups claimed, without hard evidence, that the
lab was spreading cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the cause was taken up by politicians. Rep. Michael P.
Forbes, who represents the area, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato joined
forces to keep federal dollars from being used to restart the
reactor. It was a significant break from the past, when elected
officials routinely deferred to scientists when making policy
decisions about the lab and took pride in sending money for new
projects home to their districts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, meanwhile, grumbled that the elected officials were
bowing to the will of uninformed lay people and Hamptons
celebrities to earn political mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said in an interview that he lobbied to shut down the
reactor for the good of both the neighbors and the laboratory. ``I
was concerned that an effort would be launched to shut down the lab
completely if the problem wasn't addressed,'' he said, adding,
``This was like a tourniquet _ close the reactor, stop the
bleeding, save the laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   The reactor was shut down permanently in November 1999 by the
Department of Energy, which oversees the lab. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said the decision was made for economic reasons, not
environmental ones.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Shapiro, who used the reactor for his physics
research for 30 years, said that he felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is partly science's fault,'' he said. ``Scientists probably
haven't done a very good job of outreach to the public. And
celebrities naturally have an audience _ they're beautiful people,
they have an aura that scientists definitely don't have. They're
much better looking than me. But what's disturbing is that they're
being taken as authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the lab's nuclear reactor paled in comparison
with the next accusation that was hurled at Brookhaven: that it was
creating a doomsday machine.
</P>
<P>
   This accusation surfaced in 1999 in an article in The Sunday
Times of London, which suggested that the lab's crowning new glory
_ its Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which smashes together the
nuclei of very heavy atoms at nearly the speed of light _ could
destroy the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then an article in Scientific American magazine raised the
possibility that the collider could create a black hole. Once again
groups protested, and a lawsuit was filed to keep it from opening.
Once again the laboratory was deluged with e-mail messages and
phone calls. But the lab managed to collide two beams of gold ions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world did not end,'' said Thomas Ludlam, a scientist who
works on the collider.
</P>
<P>
   If Brookhaven has long been a flashpoint, Cold Spring, by
contrast, has enjoyed rather low-key relations with its neighbors.
Sure, the occasional Nimby issue popped up, but it was usually more
about neighbors objecting to new construction at the laboratory,
not to what was going on within its walls.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this summer, a cornfield was vandalized _ the very field
where the late Barbara McClintock did her Nobel Prize-winning
research on corn to learn about genes. A militant environmental
group claimed responsibility, saying it was taking a strike against
genetically modified foods. (The lab, clearly shaken, responded
that the corn was naturally bred, not genetically altered, but said
little else about the attack for fear of encouraging copycat
crimes.)
</P>
<P>
   It is in this highly charged atmosphere that Dr. Huxsoll, the
new director of Plum Island, now finds himself. To try to convince
his neighbors of the benefit of the work the lab does, he said, he
hopes to open a visitors center on Orient Point where people can
watch video displays about the importance of studying
foot-and-mouth disease, and the economic ravages that would be
caused if there was an outbreak of it in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there have already been bumps in the road. A plan to bring
in the carcasses of several hundred sheep that are believed to be
infected with a variant of mad cow disease ran into significant
local opposition. And many neighbors are still angry over the way
the government tried to upgrade the laboratory to Biosafety Level
Four in 1999, giving it the ability to study diseases that animals
can give to humans, without seeking community reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Forbes successfully lobbied the Clinton administration to
remove the financing for the upgrade from the budget. But the
Agriculture Department still wants to upgrade Plum Island.
</P>
<P>
   Huxsoll said he still hoped to win the community over.

<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ When President Clinton crisscrossed Africa on a
six-country visit in March 1998, his plane overflew Nigeria in a
pointed snub at the generals leading it. Ground down by misrule and
miscreants, Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, was an
ailing giant perilously close to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On his second trip to Africa, next weekend, Clinton's main
destination will be Nigeria, which under the elected civilian
government of Olusegun Obasanjo, who took power 15 months ago, has
undergone one of Africa's most stunning and convulsive political
transformations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rhapsodized about a renaissance on his last visit to
Africa. Nowadays, no one mentions the leaders he heralded then as
beacons of Africa's rebirth: only months after his trip, the
leaders of Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Eritrea all went to war,
against one another, from the Horn of Africa to Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The hopes of Washington, and the West, now rest largely with
Obasanjo and Nigeria. As he tries to restore freedom and bring some
measure of Nigeria's immense wealth to its overwhelmingly poor
people, Obasanjo must contend with secessionist tendencies, the
spreading imposition of Muslim law in the north, rampant corruption
and decades of neglect of the infrastructure that should hold his
country together.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's performance has been mixed. Faced in eight northern
states with the declaration of Shariah law, the legal code of Islam
based on the Koran, he has reacted cautiously and called for a
political solution to the challenge of Islamic extremism. Yet he
ordered soldiers to destroy a town in the oil-producing Niger
Delta. His initial crackdown on corruption went far and wide, but
his own aides have engaged in old-style influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
   He has called himself a true believer in democracy and appears
to have reined in the military, but he has surrounded himself with
weak ministers and has little regard for the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As daunting as his problems are his potential assets: 113
million people above ground and billions of barrels of crude oil
underground. On the continent with the world's richest natural
resources and poorest people, Nigeria has so much oil that it may
eventually rank second only to Saudi Arabia, but its inhabitants
have one of the lowest standards of living. On a continent riven by
cleavages among ethnic groups, Nigeria has the most, perhaps as
many as 400.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is home to Lagos, a reeling, clogged metropolis that is
yet Africa's most thrilling city. It is a country that has given
birth to some of Africa's most resonant music and literature, yet
it is also a place where only one in 270 people has a telephone.
The National Electric Power Authority is so unreliable that several
nationwide blackouts have occurred in recent months. Long lines at
gas stations _ the iconic image of a country of corrupt leaders and
suffering masses _ have reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sense here _ even less than elsewhere in Africa
_ that politicians can improve the lives of ordinary Africans. The
politicians, said Uti Akpan, 30, a textiles trader in Lagos, ``have
abandoned the schools because their children do not go to schools
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hungry, but they carry our money and go and invest
outside,'' he said. ``If there's democracy here, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Obasanjo, a retired general who is the West's new darling in
Africa, seems resolved to try to improve the lives of Nigerians,
even if he may find it as hard as previous leaders have to look
beyond the big gated villa that is Abuja, Nigeria's spanking new
capital, to the sprawling diversity and violent strife that lie
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In tranquil Abuja, in the sparsely populated heart of the
country, the troubles of the nation that has long represented both
Africa's highest hopes and deepest despair seem unimaginable. Drive
two hours north to Kaduna, however, and the despair is on stark
display. In a city that once had a cosmopolitan tone and religious
integration, riots killed thousands of residents this year, and
neighborhoods reduced to rubble have become segregated between
Muslims and Christians. ``If we want to get proper peace in Kaduna,
we have to divide the state into two,'' Simeon Achi, 61, a
Christian community leader, said inside his house there. ``Let them
go to the north and let our people go to the south.''
</P>
<P>
   To the northwest, in Zamfara, the first state to adopt Islamic
Shariah law this year, motorcycle taxi drivers have been whipped
for carrying women. A cow thief's hand was chopped off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi, the state's deputy
governor, when asked whether his government would continue cutting
off hands. ``It's a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme of this vast country, in the mangrove
swamps of the Niger Delta, people are threatening to take up arms
to form their own republic _ so that all the country's oil would
become theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every ethnic nationality in this country now has a focus on
where it wants to go if the nation disintegrates,'' said Bello
Orubebe, a lawyer in the oil city of Warri.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, under the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,
Nigeria was an international pariah. But for its oil, the West
would most likely have forgotten it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June 1998, Abacha mysteriously died. His successor,
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, surprisingly decided to restore civilian
rule. And in May 1999 power passed to Obasanjo, a man much admired
abroad for having relinquished power in 1979 after three years as a
military ruler and viewed at home as a possible unifier of this
almost impossible country.
</P>
<P>
   He is a Christian from the south in a country traditionally
dominated by Muslims from the north, yet has the respect of that
northern elite; he is a former absolute ruler who, in the three
years he spent in jail under Abacha's rule, is said to have become
both a democrat and a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The shaky democracy over which Obasanjo presides has been tested
severely despite the new openness. Still, the center has held so
far _ although in so fragile a fashion that President Clinton will
spend his two days in Nigeria only in Abuja, for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria and the transition there is of huge importance,'' said
a Clinton administration official in Washington. ``Given its size
and its potential role in stabilizing and democratizing Africa,
Nigeria represents a huge opportunity for our own interests in
Africa and also a huge challenge to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Nigeria has risen from receiving nearly
nothing in American aid to being at the top in sub-Saharan Africa:
$109 million for general aid _ still less than $1 for every
Nigerian _ as well as $10 million to reform its military and about
$50 million to train and equip its soldiers for peacekeeping
operations in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants Nigeria to play an increasing security
role and to help America resist calls to intervene in places like
Sierra Leone. And so within this short period Nigeria has gone from
untouchable to being, along with South Africa, one of Washington's
two most important partners in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the West's hope for Nigeria lies in its leader,
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Although his earlier presidency was marred by widespread
corruption and human rights abuses, when the newly oil-rich Nigeria
saw itself in the 1970s as Africa's leader, Obasanjo was one of the
leaders of pan-Africanism.
</P>
<P>
   Under Abacha, Obasanjo was jailed in 1995 on a trumped-up charge
of attempting a coup. After the general's sudden death, Obasanjo
was released and soon declared his candidacy for president.
</P>
<P>
   The Hausa-speaking Muslim military elite, who have controlled
Nigeria for most of its 40 years of independence, trusted Obasanjo
even though he was a Christian Yoruba. The southwestern Yoruba and
the northern Hausa are two of the country's three main ethnic
groups; the third is the southeastern Ibo. The military elite
bankrolled his campaign to an easy, if not altogether transparent,
victory in February 1999. As Obasanjo prepared to take over in May
1999, he remained a giant question mark. Would he be a stooge of
the north or his own man? Would he be a democrat his second time in
power?
</P>
<P>
   Onukaba Adinoyi-Ojo, who was appointed managing director of The
Daily Times, a state-owned newspaper, by Obasanjo last year, said
the president was converted to civilian rule after his first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a reluctant democrat,'' said Adinoyi-Ojo, who has
been a protege of Obasanjo since the early 1980s. ``Over the years
he interacted with a lot of world leaders and saw that democracy
was more beneficial. He saw that only democracy could protect
everyone's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after taking over, Obasanjo flushed the military of
its politically ambitious senior officers, set up investigations
into corruption and human rights abuses and, describing himself as
a ``detribalized politician,'' appointed officials from diverse
ethnicities in the military, ministries and his cabinet. The north,
used to a monopoly on power, felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a born-again Christian has made Obasanjo ``approach
government with a messianic attitude,'' Adinoyi-Ojo said. ``He sees
his second coming as a call from God as if he were a messiah come
to save this country. That's made him impatient. He's domineering.
There's almost an I-know-it-all kind of attitude. Some feel he
doesn't consult widely. I think he's aware of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's failings have been overlooked by foreign governments.
Restive Nigerians tend to swing to the other extreme nowadays,
giving Obasanjo credit for little and seemingly forgetting the
genuine strides during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact that Obasanjo has been able to hold this country
together is praiseworthy,'' said Hakeem B. Harunah, a historian at
the University of Lagos.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lagos, the political capital until two decades ago and the focal
point of the opposition to the military, had felt the army's clamps
more than any other corner of Nigeria. ``There's a kind of freedom
that we now enjoy,'' said Soji Omotunde, 45, a publicist who was
browsing recently in a bookstore in the neighborhood of Ikeja. ``In
spite of the political upheavals which are the product of a lack of
democracy, we are on a path to survival.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, having grown used to the idea of greater freedom, most
Nigerians now mention it as an afterthought. Instead, they focus on
how their daily lives have otherwise not changed: despite the
billions of dollars this country earns each year from oil, most
Nigerians live in grinding poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos reels daily, dragged down by the weight of its estimated 8
million inhabitants, collapsing roads and an undercurrent of
violence. Only the great Nigerian spirit _ of ``suffering and
smiling'' at the same time, as the late Afrobeat musician Fela
Anikulapo-Kuti described it _ lifts up Lagos' squalid slums and
gaudy mansions into what is perhaps Africa's most vibrant city.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Persuading Nigerians that a democracy can keep improving their
lives remains a race against time for Obasanjo. Generals have long
used the public's lack of confidence in politicians as an excuse to
seize and keep power. Nigeria's last experiment with civilian rule,
which began in 1979, ended in 1983 because politicians proved
altogether corrupt and incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that the continuing shambles in Abuja will produce a
repeat of the past. National Assembly members have exerted most of
their energies in the last year on matters like obtaining
allowances to buy furniture for their homes. This month the Senate
president, Chuba Okadigbo, No. 3 in government, was impeached after
an investigation found that he had awarded himself $370,000 for
furniture and $220,000 as a Christmas bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria now has its third Senate president in a year. The first
had to resign after lying about his age and academic record; the
first House speaker, No. 4 in the government, suffered a similar
fate for the same reasons. Both allies of Obasanjo, they had been
elected to their positions after his aides handed out bags of money
to lawmakers to secure their votes, congressmen and senators
acknowledge privately.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has come to be known as ``Ghana-must-go'' politics
_ after the huge multicolored bags that illegal Ghanaian immigrants
used when they were expelled from Nigeria in the early 1980s. In
the National Assembly, the bags were needed to carry the bricks of
notes of the local currency, the naira, of which the largest
denomination until recently was worth only 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of the $5 billion estimated to have been stolen by
Abacha has been recovered from overseas accounts, but the amount
has been loosely controlled once back in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``What baffled me is that even the money recovered from Abacha
has been stolen,'' said Akpan, the Lagos textiles trader. ``If you
recover money from a thief and you go back and steal the money, it
means you are worse than the thief.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy remains stagnant, partly because of the government's
failure to privatize important sectors like the telephone industry.
Nigeria's economy, like those of most African nations, still
remains tightly controlled by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is still trying to live off government patronage,''
said Kenneth Enahoro, 47, a businessman and the son of a prominent
politician, Anthony Enahoro. ``The economy was destroyed by the
long years of irresponsible military rule. It's going to take
honest work to try and resuscitate the economy and give food to the
man on the street, without relying on government handouts.''
</P>
<P>
   After its vigorous start, the Obasanjo administration became
bogged down by the various forces fueling the country's anger.
Certain things have remained constant since British colonialists
created it in 1914: a breakup has always been a nightmare, one that
came close in 1967 when the Ibo tried to secede in the war of
Biafra. A million Nigerians died.
</P>
<P>
   With the military out of power, the country's sectarian and
separatist forces have hit Obasanjo with full might. Out of favor,
powerful northerners have challenged him by encouraging the spread
of Shariah law. In Kaduna, the possibility that it would be
enforced led to deadly clashes between Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have a country that is ruled by one law and, once
you travel one hour away, by a different law,'' said Yohanna
Madaki, a Christian lawyer, retired colonel and former military
governor. With soldiers off the streets, ethnic-based vigilante
groups have mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't feel that they can rely on the government for
protection, so they are going outside the system,'' said Ozonnia
Ojielo, a lawyer at the Center for Conflict Resolution and Peace
Advocacy, a private organization in Lagos. ``The result is that all
these vigilante groups have created a sense of lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of looming anarchy resurrected the military ruler in
Obasanjo late last year. When clashes occurred in Lagos involving a
Yoruba extremist group he ordered that its members be ``shot on
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, 12 police officers were killed in the
Niger Delta by inhabitants of the town of Odi. Hundreds of troops
sent by Obasanjo flattened Odi and killed many innocent people. The
president later expressed regret, but the goodwill he had earned by
visiting the delta soon after his inauguration evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought a civilian regime would bring us succor,'' said
Orubebe, the lawyer in Warri, perhaps the most unlivable city in
West Africa. Its streets are forever choked with cars and
motorcycles and a thick bluish haze hangs in the air. Mountains of
garbage had grown so high recently that several streets were
blocked off.
</P>
<P>
   Orubebe spoke at dusk. After night fell, Warri reached its full
surreal power. Surrounded by towering oil company gas flares that
lit the sky, the city itself, lacking electricity, sank into
darkness. Candles flickered along narrow streets in the center of
town, where the shadows of thousands of people darted in and out of
traffic and engine fumes mingled with the smoke from roadside
cooking fires and burning garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest patches of light came from the walled communities
where officials from the oil multinationals live with their own
water, electricity and communications _ eery replicas of suburban
London or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The obverse of Warri is Abuja, a city of new villas and wide
traffic-free streets, where the building cranes in the sky point to
the destination of the delta's oil money. Leaders from Sierra Leone
to Congo to Angola have plundered Africa's riches, stashing the
money away in Switzerland and erecting sprawling gated villas.
Nigeria has perhaps Africa's biggest villas.
</P>
<P>
   Whether its new leaders will really look beyond the villa gates
remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum last week to foster better relations between the
executive and legislative branches, Obasanjo accused lawmakers of
neglecting their duties and focusing on obtaining government
contracts. The lawmakers shot back that they had rooted out
corruption by removing the Senate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Chuba Ikpeazu, 34, a congresswoman, accused Obasanjo of
continually undermining the legislature so that he could enjoy a
``civilian dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in these quarrels, Ikpeazu saw the noisy workings of a
young democracy. In the halls of the new National Assembly building
here, and in Lagos' flourishing media, Nigerians are arguing,
clamoring, challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year can't do much,'' Ikpeazu said. ``The important thing
is that we have laid the foundation.''

AFTER STUDENT'S DEATH, SCHOOL'S ACTIONS ARE QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ There is no question that Rob Pace did something
reckless. A college-bound honor society student with an arrest for
marijuana possession in his recent past, Pace, 18, went on a class
trip to Great Adventure amusement park in April carrying drugs in
his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested at the gate, he was processed and released by the
police in Jackson Township, N.J., but Riverhead (N.Y.) High School
officials refused to bring him home to Long Island. A school
official told the police: ``He's 18. He can do what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the police transcript of the conversation, Joseph
E. Ogeka, then the associate high school principal, told an officer
that he did not want Pace ``going back on the bus with our kids.''
Speaking from Riverhead, Ogeka told the officer that if the boy's
parents could not be located, ``he's gonna have to take a train or
he's gonna have to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time school officials had reached Pace's parents, Rob
Pace had set off on his own, apparently contemplating the
consequences of his arrest for possession of two and a half
marijuana cigars, four Ecstasy pills and cocaine. A former varsity
athlete, Pace made it to Bethpage, L.I., on the Long Island Rail
Road before deciding he could go no further. ``Please tell anyone
who ever knew me that `I'm sorry for letting them down!''' read a
note he left on his seat. Then he jumped between train cars to his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, the question remains whether school officials
also acted recklessly that day.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Pace was legally an adult and could be released on his
own without the police contacting his parents. But he was a student
in a public school that takes responsibility for children in their
parents' absence. The school's policy states that students caught
with drugs must be removed from school activities _ and that
parents or guardians are to do the removing.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 14, Pace was left alone, and it was apparently more
than he could handle. ``I know through thick or thin you guys will
always stand next to me,'' he wrote to his parents and older sister
in the note. ``I'm the one who can't stand next to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines taunt his mother. ``If Rob were not alone, he would
not have had to stand next to himself in order to get himself
home,'' Karen Pace told the Riverhead school board after her son's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rodgers, a lawyer who represented Pace in his earlier
arrest, called the school's posture ``zero tolerance run amok.''
Rodgers characterized the school's attitude as: ``He broke the law.
He's on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials first said the police urged school personnel
not to come to the police station. Then the police transcripts
emerged, telling a different story. There have been tense moments
at school board meetings as the Pace family has sought information.
But officials, while expressing condolences, refuse to answer
questions on the advice of lawyers, because of an impending
lawsuit. Now, the tragedy in the middle-class community on Long
Island will be a matter for civil litigation rather than basic
civility.
</P>
<P>
   The Paces expect little money from a lawsuit. ``I just want the
answers to the questions that have gone unanswered for all these
months,'' Karen Pace said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Paces are more accustomed to boosting Riverhead than
battling it. Robert Pace, Rob's father, is a carpenter turned real
estate salesman; Karen transcribes medical records. They were
sweethearts at Riverhead High. They volunteered in community
groups, sent their daughter to college and were preparing to send
their son.
</P>
<P>
   They do not condone their son's drug use, but know he was not
wayward. ``He went to school every day,'' Mrs. Pace said. ``We ate
dinner together every day. He worked every day. He did his tae kwon
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Doll knew Rob Pace as a member of Riverhead's youth court,
where teen-agers hear cases of young misdemeanor offenders. Doll,
who runs the court, said she was surprised by his arrest last year
with three other youths at a beach party. But she thought it showed
character when the friendly teen-ager with an affecting smile
stepped down from the court, saying ``I feel like a hypocrite''
judging others.
</P>
<P>
   Judging others is a perilous business, as school officials must
realize. ``We were all kids,'' Doll said. ``Everyone tries things.
That doesn't mean that's who you are.''

 PAT HEARN, 45, PIONEERING NEW YORK ART DEALER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Hearn, one of the leading art dealers of the last
two decades, a founder of the Gramercy International Art Fair and a
pioneer of the art scene in the East Village, Soho and Chelsea,
died on Aug. 18 at her vacation home in Provincetown, Mass. She was
45 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Colin de Land.
</P>
<P>
   In her 17 years as a dealer, Hearn was widely respected as
unusually empathetic to artists, open to new art and willing to
share artists and ideas with other dealers. When her cancer was
first diagnosed and it seemed that her insurance company would not
cover her treatment (although it eventually paid for some of it),
her friends organized a benefit to which hundreds of artists and
dealers donated work and money.
</P>
<P>
   Her gallery was in some ways a continually evolving artwork in
which everything, from the 1950s-ish cursive letterhead to the
furniture and design of her different spaces, expressed a distinct
personality and sensibility. Yet none of this competed with the art
on view, which reflected an eclectic mix of artistic generations
and media _ painting, Conceptual Art and video art _ and a
viewpoint that evolved from somewhat kitschy neo-pop to neo-geo to
an ecumenical feminism.
</P>
<P>
   The artists to whom Hearn gave first shows, or first New York
shows, included the painters Philip Taffee, Milan Kunc, Peter
Schuyff, Jutta Koether, Monique Prieto and, most recently, Jeff
Elrod, and the Conceptualists Susan Hiller, Renee Green, Lincoln
Tobier and Simon Leung. She showed artists she knew from her school
days in Boston, including the painter George Condo, the
installation artist Jack Pierson and the photographer Mark
Morrisroe, and fostered the careers of such older artists as the
painter Mary Heilmann, the video artist Joan Jonas and the
Conceptualist Lutz Bacher. She was especially proud that she was
able to mount posthumous shows of the work of Eva Hesse and Ana
Mendieta.
</P>
<P>
   Behind all this was a very complex woman, at once sophisticated
and wholesome, stringent in her taste, yet extremely generous.
Slim, dark-haired and usually dressed in a stylish mixture of
designer and vintage clothes, Hearn resembled a bohemian Holly
Golightly. In the early years she was usually trailed around her
gallery by a nervous, adoring Chihuahua named Chi-Chi. She liked to
give Easter Sunday parties and in the late '90s she held an annual
Christmas party, complete with decorated tree, in her Chelsea
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn was born in Providence, R.I.. She studied painting and
video at the Boston Museum School, sang with a band called Wild and
Wonderful, and had a brief encounter with performance art before
becoming an art dealer. She spent a year in Paris on a travel grant
from the museum school in 1981, and while working at an alternative
space called Usine Pali Kao began to realize that she was more
interested in other artists' work than in her own. She returned to
Boston, and while living on unemployment insurance, started a
performance space in her home _ a ground-floor room in the Hemenway
Hotel _ that she and her friends called the Poly Cow. A few months
later she left for New York and a few months after that, in
November of 1983, she opened her first gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of location, Hearn tended to be the first art dealer on
the block. When most East village galleries were situated between
First Avenue and Avenue A, she opened on Avenue B and Sixth Street
and then expanded to a big Soho-style space with polished wood
floors on Ninth Street near Avenue D. In 1988 she moved to the
relatively gallery-free southwest corner of Soho, on Wooster Street
near Grand, which soon teemed with new, experimental galleries. And
in 1995, hers was one of three galleries to open on a deserted
stretch of West 22nd Street in the wilds of west Chelsea on the
same snowy February night. The other two were the Matthew Mark
Gallery and the Morris-Healy Gallery, and the joint opening
signaled a radical reshuffling of the downtown art scene that would
eventually bring nearly 150 new galleries to Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Hearn, Marks and Paul Morris of Morris-Healy
had begun to explore the idea of a New York art fair for younger
dealers. The result was the Gramercy International, a lively,
live-in fair that took place at the Gramercy Hotel on Lexington
Avenue and 21st Street for five years before graduating to larger
spaces. The 2001 Gramercy International will be held on Pier 90 and
will include 160 participants, nearly double the number of last
year's fair at the Javits Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn's first marriage ended in divorce. She and de Land, whose
Soho gallery, American Fine Arts, is as much an art piece as her
own, were married last year after almost 10 years together.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to de Land, Hearn is survived by her mother, Alice
Darcy Hearn of Cranston, R.I.; two sisters, Marie, of Providence,
and Marion, of Warren, R.I.; and two brothers, John, of Providence,
and William J., of Cranston.

A FLY-FISHING GUIDE FOR HOLLYWOOD HABITUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAY OTTULICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone call came unexpectedly; he said that he was Aidan
Quinn and that he wanted to book a day of guide/instruction as a
birthday present for a friend and left it at that. We figured out a
time block last August. I penciled it in on the calendar and when
the window narrowed down, it was agreed he would call me back. Of
course, I mentioned it to friends who immediately bandied about the
names of possible candidates for Quinn's fly-fishing mystery man.
The women and their much-vaunted intuition finally parsed it down
to Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   On the chosen day, with a litany of Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn
movies running around in my head, I jumped in my rig and headed for
the appointed rendezvous. The last few miles were down a winding
dusty gravel road with a backdrop bookend vista of the distant blue
highlands of the Catskills and the Berkshires. I pulled off on a
drive that led to a gentle clove flanked by a large white farmhouse
and a small barn. I parked by the barn, walked over and mounted the
porch. Rang the bell. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I waited a few minutes, sat on a chair and began to wonder if I
was at the right house. I walked off the porch and around the side
of the place. A large extension pushed out toward the backyard,
there were a couple of reassuring vehicles parked out of view from
the front. At a side door was a rigged up fly rod. Eureka! It had
to be the right place. I made my way back around front and rang.
Again nothing, but emboldened by the sight of the rod I was
determined to check out the two back doors. As I again turned the
corner, Liam Neeson stepped outside calling my name with a smile
and hand extended.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson invited me in, and we had coffee, tea and rolls while
waiting for the tardy Quinn. Naturally, after fixating on Brad
Pitt, my mind now drew a complete blank and I couldn't think of a
single movie of Neeson's, but thankfully we had serious fly fishing
to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn showed up about five minutes later, we finished our
breakfast and headed to the lawn out back to practice a little
warm-up casting at a small pond. It was reminiscent of the old
``Chip 'N' Dale'' cartoons, with Liam and Aidan each insisting that
I help the other. Neeson had standard casting down already; I just
demonstrated how to haul, a technique that increases line speed and
distance. Quinn was a beginner, and we concentrated on the basic
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the house we met Neeson's wife, Natasha Richardson, saw
the twins, picked up lunch, said good-bye and took off for Liam's
local stream. A guide's forte is knowing his territory, years of
angling the same streams brings an intimate knowledge. Take a fish
out of water and he's lost, but a guide has a bulwark of fish lore
and habit to fall back upon _ you know where you should find fish.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very dry August and streams were down to trickles, the
fish would be concentrated in the deeper holes and below
oxygen-rich riffles. Neeson's stream had a dam with stairstep
spillway and a small plunge pool at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The tailwater was teeming with large crayfish. We worked our way
with dry flies toward the dam, and the fish were hungry. Both Quinn
and Neeson easily caught aggressive sunfish, and Liam missed a
hookup on a trout. He cast to the spot again a number of times but
couldn't raise it. It was midday now and much too bright, so we
broke for lunch at a small pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward we jumped into a small aluminum boat. I rowed them
around the edges of the impoundment, targeting the shadowed shore
and the numerous fallen trees that provided additional cover. They
traded Hollywood stories to while away the lulls.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn was casting a Turks Tarantula, an attractor fly. A good
way to describe it is as sort of a year-round hopper pattern; it
works everywhere and most seasons. I told him to give it a twitch,
its small rubber legs tantalizingly vibrating in the center of the
spreading concentric circles.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow shot up out of the depths like a missile and busted
the fly on the surface. Neeson and I shouted encouragement, and
Quinn, a quick study, deftly brought the fish to the boat. It was
his first trout on a flyrod, a 14-inch beauty. Aidan, the beginner,
was top rod that day, always a good way to start.
</P>
<P>
   We drove back to the homestead and had a leisurely late
afternoon repast on the terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Liam asked me to show him how to tie a few practical knots. My
last memory of that day is of his big thumbs twisting leader into a
barrel knot, Alaskan guide style. A few months later Liam was
reported as saying he was going to take a hiatus from movies, stay
in New York, do theater and fly fish. &QL;

EDITORIAL: TWO VISIONS OF GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader sees no meaningful difference between the Democratic
and Republican parties this year, and at least on a cosmetic level
he has a point. Both parties have tried hard to project a centrist
image while tranquilizing their activists. In Philadelphia, George
W. Bush's inclusiveness pitch required keeping the Republican right
wing offstage while throwing it a bone or two in the platform. The
Democrats in Los Angeles reversed the process, giving the
Kennedy-Jackson wing of the party plenty of air time but little
consolation in the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is clear that there are measurable differences
between the two candidates on domestic policy, and that on issue
after issue the Democrats would still urge a more vigorous
deployment of federal resources to solve national problems. These
differences may not be enough to satisfy Nader's aggressively
populist inclinations, but if the election were held now, they
would give the voters a real choice.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference, perhaps the defining difference, lies in
how the Bush and Gore men would distribute the lion's share of a
projected budget surplus of $4.6 trillion over the next 10 years.
Bush, warning that this money should not be hijacked by federal
programs, would use about $1.3 trillion to cut taxes, mainly for
affluent families. Al Gore would cut taxes by only $500 billion,
mostly subsidies of one sort or another for middle-income families.
He would also use every penny of the surplus generated by Social
Security, about $2.5 trillion, to reduce the national debt. Bush
would use the same money partly to reduce the debt and partly to
finance a new system of personal retirement accounts. When all is
said and done, Gore would have about $1 trillion for new spending,
Bush about $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers imply important differences in philosophy. Perhaps
oddly, they cast Gore as the conservative custodian of President
Clinton's policies of securing growth by chipping away at the
burdensome national debt, and Bush as the risk-taker who would
reverse course on tax policy and divert part of the Social Security
payroll tax to private retirement accounts at a time when Social
Security's long-term solvency is still very much in doubt. They
also reflect Gore's stronger faith in the remedial powers of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   There are also important differences in emphasis when it comes
to new spending. Both would use about the same amount, $100
billion, for education, Bush's signature issue. Gore, however,
would spend $400 billion on health care, mainly to expand insurance
coverage and underwrite a prescription drug program under Medicare,
while Bush would spend only $100 billion on health. And Gore would
put as much into environmental programs _ at least $125 billion _
as Bush would into all other programs combined, defense included.
These figures must be treated with caution, since the projected
surpluses are iffy. But they do give some indication of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers aside, on some issues there are telling ideological
differences. The environment is a case in point. Gore would spend
billions to make industry more energy-efficient, thus counteracting
global warming. But even more important to conservationists is his
gut commitment to preserving the federal government's central role
in protecting the environment. Among other things, that means
resisting congressional efforts to destroy the government's
regulatory machinery, as the Gingrich Republicans tried to do in
1995, and building on Clinton's surprisingly strong record of
enlarging America's protected wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that Bush has thought about the issue at all, he
has greatly alarmed even moderate Republicans in Congress by
suggesting that he would roll back protections of the national
forests, open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil
exploration and cede greater authority on environmental matters to
state and local interests, usually a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Important differences on social issues like gun control and
abortion are by now fairly well known. Gore's proposals for keeping
guns out of the wrong hands are stronger, and he unequivocally
supports Roe vs. Wade, whereas Bush is generally opposed to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a major difference on a central issue of
governance, campaign finance reform. Having engaged in profligate
fund-raising himself, Gore now supports the McCain-Feingold bill
eliminating soft money from the American political system, and
indeed says he will make it his first order of legislative
business. Bush would abolish corporate and labor soft money but
allow unlimited individual contributions to continue, which means
that the corrupting flow of soft money that has been so much in
evidence at both conventions this year would also continue.
</P>
<P>
   In time, other differences will emerge. But for now there is
plenty of evidence that there are two parties out there _ not, as
the Nader people would have it, one big corporate party with a
``pro-life'' and a ``pro-choice'' wing.

   JEWS-AMERICA _ WASHINGTON _ Only in America . . . is the

   GORE-FRIEND _ DAYTON _ Vernon Courtney, director of the National
Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center, was in the same dorm as
Al Gore at Harvard in the mid-1960s. The two used to shoot pool and
play ping pong, alternating victories, and also shared an interest
in hunting. Courtney, a young black man from the seaport town of
Hampton, Va., was recruited to attend the Ivy League university. He
recalled Gore as a guy whose ``daily uniform'' then was bib
overalls and who always presented himself as a guy from Tennessee,
downplaying the senator's son in an effort to be one of the guys.
``The thing I find interesting is he comes off so dry now. He
wasn't that way at all. He was pretty gregarious,'' Courtney
recalled. They haven't stayed in contact but after someone told Al
he ran into Courtney, Gore fired off an e-mail to him that said
``Don't forget to vote for me.'' Courtney also knew Tommy Lee

   FLATRAIN _ Trying to unclog its highways from Miami to Orlando
to Tampa, planners in Florida had proposed a high-speed train that
would reach speeds of 240 mph. But Gov. Jeb Bush killed the $6.3
billion project, which included annual payments from the
Legislature for 20 years, because he was not convinced the train
would have enough riders to justify its cost. Now, a retired
Lakeland businessman, is on the verge of putting the proposal on
the November ballot. Using a provision of the state constitution
that lets referendums be placed on a ballot if their are sufficient
petitioners to do so, fast-train advocate C.C. Dockery is waiting
on the state Supreme Court to rule on his request. Fast trains are
the latest fad among urban planners; turning their use into reality

the state famous for its armed Zapatista Mayan Indian rebels will
elect a new governor. In the wake of Vicente Fox's historic
opposition victory in last month's presidential election, polls
show that change could be contagious: Even in Indian communities
once under tight control by the ruling party, posters for a Fox
ally are up on dirt-floor homes. Chiapans appear to be slightly
favoring Pablo Salazar, a former ruling party member who is now
representing an alliance that includes Fox's conservative National
Action Party and the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. If

   WEBVAN - ATLANTA _ Lynda Reis, who spends more than $180 a week

local grocery store. ``I spend less money per week,'' Reis said
while inspecting an order delivered to her home by the online
grocer. ``I would have bought what I didn't need if I went to the
store.'' The economics of buying groceries online and having them
delivered to the home may make sense for Reis. The question is
whether they will work for Webvan. While the company has generated
a lot of positive buzz and impressed many customers, it is a long
way from making money. (DeGross, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   LIES _ As you consider that new job, here's a question to
ponder: Will you have to lie at work? In much of the American

forthcoming your new employer really is. (Mallory, Atlanta

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Minorities watching the recently

   TWINS _ WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
book signings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their
semi-regular reunions in White Plains Saturday, it's actually a
pretty familiar story around these parts: The one about strong

   DIGITAL-COMPASS _ You may remember a time when you were a kid
and you got a toy compass maybe from the neighborhood candy store
or maybe even from a box of Cracker Jacks. Those cheesy little
devices featured a jiggling needle balanced on a pin, and the
painted end of the needle always pointed north. Unless there was a
magnet nearby or the needle fell off the pin. Today you can carry
around a digital device that does the same thing more reliably. The
Co-Pilot from Precision Navigation Inc. gives you a digital readout
that tells you exactly which way you're headed with an accuracy of
plus or minus 5 degrees. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News) 12. WITH

   TRAVEL-ABINGDON _ ABINGDON, Va. _ It is an unseasonably cool,
moonless night in this historic Blue Ridge Mountain town, a good
evening for a ghost tour in this old place that seems to have more

&AMP; Country Club, a 1,400-acre antebellum estate that will fill your

Throat his personal quarry, thinks he knows. ``In Search of Deep
Throat'' (Basic Books, $25) is a lawyerly deduction from plausible

   OLY-SWM-JOSHDAVIS _ Four years ago, Josh Davis had to be the
happiest and luckiest man in Atlanta. Although he didn't win a
single individual medal at the Olympics, he struck gold three times
as a relay swimmer for the United States and left the Games with
more of that precious metal draped around his neck than any male
athlete from any country. Times change, and so has Davis' role. He
still is not the individual star of the U.S. team, but the
27-year-old former Texas Longhorn is its leader, the emotional rock
for a squad that certainly will need one in Sydney, Australia.
These Olympics will be no house party for the U.S. swimmers the way
the Atlanta Games were. The rest of the world has been improving,
and the talented Aussies will be defending their home surf in a
country that's fanatical about the sport. ``Everyone's talking
about swimming there. It's kind of like the NBA and NFL over
here,'' said Olympic swim coach Richard Quick. (Maher, Austin

<P>
   OLY-SWM-TEXAS _ At the recent U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials there
were times when there were so many Longhorns in the final it was a
wonder they didn't turn the pool orange. The Three Amigos, seniors
Jamie Rauch, Scott Goldblatt and Nate Dusing, all finished in the
top six in the 200 meter freestyle and are eligible to swim on the
U.S.'s 800 meter relay team in Sydney. The 100 meter butterfly was
another Texas affair with Longhorn recruit Ian Crocker beating
Tommy Hannan. If you count Gary Hall, who had a cup of coffee at
Texas, eight of the 24 men selected to the team were either former,
current or incoming Longhorns. And there were a rash of Texas
swimmers who didn't make the team but still turned in impressive
performances, including incoming freshman Brendan Hansen, who
finished third in both the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke. (Maher,

Sydney, Australia next month with a gold medal ? and nothing else
but souvenirs. But the U.S.'s trip to the Olympics every four years
in basketball is not as easy as it used there's as much pressure on
Fortner to carry on a tradition of dominance as on her 12-player
superstar roster. She's looking forward to it. (Estwick, Austin

BOTH SLOPPY IN THE MUD, JETS MANAGE TO BEAT GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAFAEL HERMOSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets' annual preseason game with the New York
Giants is usually a bonfire of emotions, from the pregame
tailgating outside Giants Stadium to the testosterone on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon showers dampened the parking lot plans and kept many
fans home for Friday's game. The players were slowed down by their
own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' emerged with a sloppy 27-24 victory that had nothing
to do with a wet field. The final score was deceptive without
considering that the beleaguered Jets secondary was unable to stop
the Giants' offense. The Giants missed a 45-yard field goal and the
Jets had a field goal blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without their injured quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, the
Jets relied on his backup, Ray Lucas, and their running back,
Curtis Martin, to slice through the Giants' defense and finish
their preseason at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost their third straight game, with one more
exhibition left against Baltimore on Friday. They struggled to
comprehend how they had gone backwards since training camp opened
and hoped this latest stumble was an exception, not a prelude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we lost our heads at times,'' said Giants
quarterback Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Al Groh preferred to discuss a victory without
Testaverde, who was scratched from the lineup just before the
opening kickoff because he sprained his left big toe against
Baltimore last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to let prudence take over,'' Groh said. ``He and I both
wanted him to play. Because we have a player like Ray, it was an
easy decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were unable to apply any pressure on Lucas and had
trouble covering his receivers. Lucas had a game reminiscent of his
run late last season: he completed 19 of 26 passes for 286 yards
and three touchdowns, including a flea flicker that left the Giants
bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Vinny's team but if he goes down I'm ready,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin capped off what he termed his best preseason ever by
rushing 18 times for 107 yards. Lucas called Martin the Jets'
``lethal weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were left to cover their embarrassment with jokes.
Linebacker Mike Barrow suggested that an instructional video could
be made from the game on how not to defend the run.
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel lambasted the team's sloppiness in being
penalized 16 times for 105 yards, including a surreal 11 penalties
in the second quarter. The Giants had only been penalized nine
times for 101 yards in their first two preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two weeks before we open up the season, but some guys
are going to get a wake-up call,'' Fassel said without naming
players. ``I wanted to progress and we digressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel questioned why his team lacked intensity. He has had
reason to get flustered in previous weeks, with special teams'
debacles and the infamous fumble forced by Jack Golden, a rookie,
that gave Jacksonville the victory last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel criticized Friday night's nonexistent pass rush, which
was supposed to be upgraded this season with Barrow's addition.
Barrow, the middle linebacker, returned after missing the first two
games with a sprained right knee, but he was one of the game's
guilty parties.
</P>
<P>
   During one disconcerting second quarter sequence, the Giants'
defense nudged the Jets downfield to an eventual field goal with
four penalties in one series, including penalties on three straight
snaps. Barrow was penalized twice, although one was declined
because cornerback Dave Thomas also committed a penalty on the
play. Twice the Jets gained first downs on Giants' mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's lit into us before,'' cornerback Jason Sehorn said.
``It's frustrating to see something, to see potential in the team
and then go out and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' rebuilt offensive line provided the most cause for
worry. After looking solid in the first two preseason games, it
allowed its first sack and was called for four false starts. That
contributed to 11 offensive penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Collins continues to show an ability to compensate for his
team's mistakes. He completed 16 of 28 passes for 275 yards and two
touchdowns, including a 73-yard touchdown to Amani Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dayne continued to struggle, rushing 12 times for 37 yards.
Dayne, the Giants' first-round pick, fumbled his first carry and
carried only two more times in the first half. Fassel again said
that from the sidelines he could not judge the holes Dayne was
getting.

   NEW YORK _ The Liberty, which was the best team in the Eastern
Conference this season, returns to Madison Square Garden on Sunday
afternoon, facing elimination in the two-of-three-game Eastern
Conference finals after losing to Cleveland by 56-43 on Thursday
night in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers shut down New York's offense, limiting its top four
scorers _ Tari Phillips, Vickie Johnson, Tamika Whitmore and Becky
Hammon _ to 27 points combined.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty entered Thursday night's game having won 15 of its
last 18 games. The Liberty defeated the Washington Mystics in the
first round of the playoffs by convincingly winning the first two
games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, who finished 7-25 last season, advanced to the
conference finals this season by beating Orlando in the first
round. The Rockers won that series by winning both games at home,
where they won 16 of 19 games this season. But the Rockers are just
4-13 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Center Chasity Melvin, a third-year pro, led the Rockers with
nearly 12 points a game this season. But on Thursday night, Rushia
Brown led all scorers with 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty beat the Rockers twice at Madison Square Garden
during the season, both times by double digits.  &QL;

IN KANSAS CITY AREA, UP TO DATE IS DOWN TO EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   by SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENEXA, Kan. _ This suburb in the bistate Kansas City
metropolitan area prides itself in being on the cutting edge when
it comes to attracting growth-oriented business and industry to its
modern corporate parks _ a philosophy that might seem to rule out
much interest in a declining limestone mine.
</P>
<P>
   But as extraction slowed a few years ago at a 200-acre mine in
the path of the community's westward growth, city officials wrote
and enacted special building and zoning codes to permit the
development of the cavernous space, 50 to 100 feet below the
surface, as an industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 250,000 square feet of the underground Lenexa development
is occupied by tenants, and 200,000 square feet is being readied
for occupancy. The operator of the park, the Minneapolis-based
Meritex Enterprises, is seeking tenants for the remaining area of
about 2.5 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lenexa and Meritex are the newest players in a half-century-old
pattern in the urban area of Kansas City, Mo.-Kan., where an
estimated 20 million square feet of business and industrial space _
more than 10 percent of the total _ has been created in former
limestone mines. There are about 30 distinct underground business
parks, led by the mammoth Hunt Midwest SubTropolis, a 913-acre
world in itself with 6.5 miles of roads and 2.1 miles of rail
corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost is probably the most important reason why we are here in
the underground _ it's a lot cheaper,'' said Garland J. Nall, site
manager of Love Box Co., who supervises a 265-by-750-foot warehouse
with 21 loading docks in the Lenexa development.
</P>
<P>
   But he said worker comfort was also a big plus. The natural
temperature underground ranges between 56 and 64 degrees, rising
according to the number of people working in a space and the length
of time it has been occupied. Nall said the temperature level is
ideal for warehouse workers, who usually have to tolerate extreme
summer heat and chilly winter drafts in surface warehouses. Office
workers often find the underground a bit cool and usually wear long
sleeves and use small electric heaters.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 businesses have operations in underground parks in and
around Kansas City, employing about 4,000 people. There are a few
other areas of the country that have, or are beginning, underground
industrial development _ including Indianapolis, Louisville, St.
Louis and an area north of Pittsburgh _ but Kansas City has the
overwhelming majority of the space in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the result of a combination of geology and geography,''
said William E. Seymour, senior vice president of Meritex.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its central location, Kansas City is appealing as a
national and regional distribution point, with easy access to
interstate highways and rail lines. And the fact that it is on two
thick layers of high-quality limestone _ the only source of
construction aggregate for the area, which has no gravel piles _
led to a lot of mining, which, in turn, opened up vast underground
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mining started here around 1875-80,'' said Dr. Syed E. Hasan,
a geology professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, who
has written extensively on underground development and mining. ``At
first they were quarrying it, then around 1900 they started cutting
into hillsides.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, the mining was being done with the future
industrial use of the space in mind. Mine operators started using
the ``room and pillar method'' _ carving the supporting pillars in
a regular grid to allow space between them for roads and buildings.
Today's pillars are typically 25 feet in diameter and spaced 60 to
65 feet apart, center to center.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 massive whitewashed pillars support the
16-foot-high ceilings of the Hunt Midwest complex along the north
bank of the Missouri River within the city limits of Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The pillars have numbers to help visitors locate specific
businesses; regular exit signs help them find their way out.
Fluorescent lights line the roadway ceilings, but looking down the
long rows of pillars, especially in the unoccupied areas, still
gives a sense of peering into the limitless unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, about 400 tractor-trailer trucks make their way in
and out of Hunt Midwest directly off Missouri Highway 210 just east
of Interstate 435. They enter through a series of tunnel-like
openings in a hillside that has been sliced open to reveal a wall
of limestone. The surface of the site is occupied by two giant
theme parks, Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun, and the mining
operation of Hunt Midwest continues to extract two million tons of
rock a year from part of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Steadman, vice president and general manager of Hunt
Midwest Real Estate Development, said that adapting underground
space for industrial and other uses is relatively simple. It
involves painting the pillars, pouring concrete floors and roads,
installing lighting and sprinkler systems, then putting up walls as
required by tenants. Except for the ubiquitous rock pillars and the
absence of outside light, an office in the underground looks very
much like an office anywhere. As Seymour of Meritex said jokingly,
``The corner office doesn't get a window; it gets a pillar.''
</P>
<P>
   Operators of underground industrial parks say a tenant can
occupy space in the underground for about half what it costs to
occupy a similar amount of space above ground. Lease rates start at
about $2 a square foot annually, compared with about $3.50
aboveground. In addition, there are savings for construction
because no roofs, foundations or exterior finishing are required.
Energy savings are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seymour and Steadman said that tenants could expect to pay
cheaper insurance rates, in part because the underground is secure
from floods, tornadoes and other weather problems. Further,
transient traffic through underground parks is rare; there are only
a few entrances and exits, and breaking into a limestone cave is
more than most burglars would attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Underground developments have their own building and safety
codes. Although there have been occasional mine collapses in this
region in recent years, all are thought to have involved abandoned
mines, most of them worked as much as a century ago without the
balanced distribution of support pillars found in today's
underground industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
   Brant Gaul, a Lenexa city planner who worked on the codes for
the Meritex project, said that before any building permit is issued
for the underground, every pillar is inspected for stability. The
code also provides for annual inspections by independent
geotechnical engineers. He added that the city government had so
much confidence in the safety of the Meritex development that it
had purchased 40 acres on the surface to build a public works
service center.
</P>
<P>
   Underground developments are considered apt for a variety of
uses _ particularly warehouses and distribution centers, and light
industry such as printing, records storage, and offices. Steadman
said that about 70 percent of the 4.3 million square feet of
occupied space in Hunt Midwest SubTropolis is used for warehouses
and storage, 15 percent for manufacturing, 8 percent for freezing
and cooling of food, and the rest as offices.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single tenant of the Hunt Midwest underground is the
Postal Service, which operates two facilities in a total of 550,000
square feet. The larger operation is the nationwide distribution
center for the booming business in collector's stamps. The other is
a regional distribution center for regular stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour said that no business that uses hazardous or highly
flammable processes can locate in an underground park, nor can any
business that uses explosives or stores things that have a strong
smell, such as rubber tires.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, Hunt Midwest uses some of the SubTropolis
space to play host to a biannual charity ball that attracts more
than 1,000 people in black-tie finery. SubTropolis is also the site
every February of a 10K race called the Groundhog Run. Laurie
Wimberly, who has taken part in the Groundhog Run twice, said that
the underground provided ``the perfect temperature'' for running in
the middle of winter.

 &HT;    Parties must move beyond rhetoric to win minority voters
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Minorities watching the recently concluded
political conventions may be forgiven if they feel a little giddy
from all the attention from their new-found Republican and
Democratic suitors. But those who have had the good fortune to
experience romance know that courtships always produce hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping some perspective in a courtship is a most effective way
to avoid making decisions based on ardor, not logic. The Republican
and Democratic valentines addressed to minorities _ especially
Latinos _ demonstrate that the leadership of both parties have gone
from demographic denial to acceptance of the fact that the face of
America is darkening and that the voice of America has a bit of an
accent.
</P>
<P>
   There are pretty big howevers, however, before either courtship
can be declared a success. Declaring love and acceptance isn't
going to be enough for Democrats to keep Hispanics from defecting
or for Republicans to make converts.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of history to overcome on what George and Ira
Gershwin so aptly described as this ``bumpy road to love.''
Rhetoric about a record of inclusion doesn't mean much to those who
grew up in the Texas of the 1940s and 1950s and recall firsthand
that the Democratic Party of those days was about as welcoming as a
federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, minorities were discouraged from voting, much
less running for office. Republicans then were virtually
nonexistent, so Democrats were the devil minorities knew.
</P>
<P>
   And rhetoric about inclusion doesn't mean much for a new
generation of minorities who are as diverse as the country itself.
Political parties are going to have to undergo a cultural shift _
if you'll pardon the expression _ to appeal to minorities in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   One size does not fit all when it comes to dealing with what's
called ``minority issues.'' A small-business owner isn't going to
view the world the same as an employee; an established professional
isn't going to respond to a message that assumes all minorities are
poor and need government salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Simple stuff really, but the evidence to date indicates that
those old stereotypes and assumptions about what minorities
``want'' will die hard.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been too long ago that I heard politicians saying to
minority constituents to ``get together.'' Translation: ``You
people try to get together and pool your feeble intellects to
figure out what you want and get back with me.''
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to listen too hard or too long before some
blithering idiot decries the lack of minority ``unity.'' Anglos
aren't united about anything. That's why there are Republicans and
Democrats and Libertarians and none of the above. So why should
minorities have to agree on all issues?
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging that some forward thinkers in both political
parties realize where the future lies and are trying to move there.
Even so, there are going to be occasions as we move down this road
when questions arise about motive.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democrats see a party in ruins, and some want minorities
to salvage it. A quarterback sent in the last 15 seconds of the
last quarter to reverse a 14-point lead doesn't have much of
chance, but is sure to catch hell if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   That point was made effectively by Ron Kirk, Dallas' first
African American mayor. Kirk tells a joke about how African
Americans become mayors: ``There's an airplane hurtling along at
top speed. Suddenly, the navigation system dies. The engine fails.
The wing catches fire. The pilot bursts into the cabin and singles
out a black passenger. You, he says, haven't you always wanted to
fly a plane?''
</P>
<P>
   Ain't love grand?

 &HT;    Gore acquaintance recalls Harvard years
 &HT;    By Margo Rutledge Kissell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Not everyone can claim he has played ping-pong or
shot pool with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Courtney does.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural
Center in Wilberforce, Ohio, said he got an early glimpse of the
competitive side of the vice president and Democratic presidential
nominee when the two attended Harvard University more than 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Hampton, Va., native had been recruited to attend the Ivy
League college. Courtney majored in English and American literature
from 1965 to 1969 and said that during his sophomore and junior
years, he and Gore were in the same dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play him a fair amount in both those table sports.
He was pretty competitive,'' Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two knew each other ``just in passing'' but had also
talked about hunting, which Courtney said was a common interest.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled Gore as someone who wore bib overalls and presented
himself as ``a guy from Tennessee,'' downplaying being a senator's
son to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a conscious effort to be one of the guys,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I find interesting is he comes off so dry now. He
wasn't that way at all. He was pretty gregarious,'' Courtney
recalled. ``I've heard a number of other people who have kept up
their friendship with him say he's pretty animated in private but
tends to quiet down in public settings.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney's biographical sketch said he was a National Merit
commended scholar. While an undergraduate at Harvard, he was active
in Harvard Student Agencies, the Black Student's Union and
represented his dormitory, Dunster House, on several intramural
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney said he didn't stay in touch with Gore after they left
campus, but said he recently received an e-mail from the
campaigning vice president.
</P>
<P>
   When the museum hosted an Alex Haley exhibit this summer, a
high-ranking Coast Guard official was there because of the guard's
newest cutter, named in honor of the writer-historian to honor
contributions of black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney said the official later apparently told Gore he had run
into Courtney, who had known him in college. Soon after, Courtney
said he received the brief electronic message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message sent was `don't forget to vote for me,' ''
Courtney laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a really, really smart guy and I think his
intellect would certainly put him in good stead to be a decent
president. There is no doubt in my mind he could do the job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Courtney wouldn't reveal how he will vote come Election
Day, adding, ``I'm one of those Independent characters who makes
that decision in the booth.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's path after Harvard eventually led to the White
House, Courtney took a different route.
</P>
<P>
   After serving two years in the Army, he returned to the seaport
town of Hampton, Va., where he worked in public schools serving
adult learners. He later attended graduate school at Pennsylvania
State University, earning a master's degree in education in 1978
and advancing to doctoral candidacy in 1979. He was a Woodrow
Wilson Foundation Fellow from 1981 to 1984, during which time he
worked as director of institutional advancement at Wilberforce
University. In 1987, he was named assistant director of the
National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center, where he became
director two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney said he also knew another member of the dormitory,
football All-American Tommy Lee Jones, whose path led to Hollywood
and film fame.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he wasn't like the tough-talking characters he has
portrayed, according to Courtney. He remembered him as someone who
``never had very much to say. He wasn't around very much. Even
then, he was very much into drama and theater.''

 &HT;    Lieberman choice not a world's first
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only in America . . . is the elliptical refrain
that immigrants and their descendants use to thank their lucky
stars that they are here in the land of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in America, right?'' Joseph Lieberman asked cheering
delegates in Los Angeles the other night, suggesting that the U.S.
is the one nation in which the grandson of Jewish immigrants could
grow up to be the Democratic vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Upon closer examination, the answer to Lieberman's question is,
not really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is overwrought and it is simply not true
historically,'' said Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, the Bronfman Professor
of the Humanities at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's nomination certainly is historic, as has been noted
daily since his selection. He is the first Jewish candidate for
high office on a major party's ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But if elected, he would not be the first Jewish politician
chosen to lead his nation.
</P>
<P>
   Even leaving aside the obvious case of Israel, history provides
several examples.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Leon Blum headed the Popular Front Socialist regime
in the 1930s, ``after which he was jailed by the Nazis,'' Hertzberg
said. Pierre Mendes-France and Rene Mayer held power briefly in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Remi Marechaux, the press attache at the French embassy in
Washington, said that a politician's religion typically does not
take center stage in France, suggesting that some French voters
might even be unaware of the religion of their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria, the Socialist Bruno Kreisky served as chancellor in
the 1970s and '80s after spending World War II in exile in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In Victorian England, Benjamin Disraeli (baptized in the
Anglican church) spoke and wrote frequently about his Jewish
heritage in the course of a long political career in which he twice
served as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the Western world regarded Disraeli as a Jew even
though his father in a fit of pique at the London synagogue had
converted him before his bar mitzvah,'' Hertzberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore picked Lieberman for reasons other than
his religion, which is as it should be, he said. ``You can argue
that Lieberman's nomination came on time just as Kennedy's
nomination came on time 40 years ago,'' he said. ``In a country
this complicated and plural, who is going to throw rocks, a few old
Ku Kluxers?''
</P>
<P>
   But Deborah Lipstadt, the director of Judaic Studies at Emory
University, said that Lieberman's nomination deserves the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a man who is two generations away from
immigrants, whose father drove a bakery truck, who is a traditional
Jew,'' Lipstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed, though, that the self-congratulatory tone may be a
bit strong, given that such barriers still stand for blacks and
Hispanics, and only once has a woman, Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in
1984, been a major party's candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in America may be too much,'' Lipstadt said. ``But maybe
thank God, at long last in America.''

 &HT;    Government gridlock stalls payment to dying man
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Richard Stocks has a technicolor resume.
He worked the Yellow Cat, White Canyon, Blue Lizard and Red Canyon.
He worked off a creek named for salt, La Sal, and he toiled in the
Great White North.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stocks paid much attention to the colors, save one.
When he worked those territories, he worked inside them,
underneath, in tight little excavations called ``dog holes,'' also
known as uranium mines. He was looking for the yellow rock that the
United States used to fend off its Cold War antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, and many like him on the battle lines, knew they were
fighting a Cold War, but they never reckoned on its heat.
</P>
<P>
   Now 81, Stocks is dying. The federal government owes him
$100,000, but it's unlikely he'll ever see it. His attorney is
prodding a Senate committee to break out of budget lockstep, but
with no luck so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've plumb ignored me,'' Stocks said. ``I think it's a
stinking deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks can't pass along the award for someone else to claim
after his death. He has no blood relatives eligible to receive a
posthumous award, so the compassionate payment would simply revert
to the federal government, said his attorney, Keith Killian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, our client has been diagnosed with terminal
cancer,'' Killian wrote this week to Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
a Colorado Republican. ``He is not expected to live until fall.
This deserving uranium miner needs your help!''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which
could jump-start the process of getting Stocks his compassionate
payment. Killian already has written all the other members of the
Appropriations Committee, but so far has come up empty, and time is
running short.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks said he had no interest in pushing his survival to its
medical maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed up,'' he said. ``I don't want tubes in me or
nothing. I want to die when my time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks started courting cancer unknowingly when he was 14 and
went to work in the uranium mines, where the work was hard and the
pay was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could work for yourself and make a pretty good living,''
he said. Of course, a miner had to pack his tools to the mine on
his back, but it was 1933 and the uranium business looked to be
more profitable than the sawmill job his father had, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Breathing was hard in the mines, enough so that miners such as
Stocks blasted at night and allowed the dust to settle before they
went in during the day.
</P>
<P>
   The occasional mine stood out, though. Timber Mountain, he said,
``was a smoky dog hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the carnotite, the uranium-bearing mineral he pulled out
of the earth, ended up in the lab of Madame Marie Curie, he said,
via his buyer in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   No one has verified that, he said, but then again, no one ever
asked. ``Certainly not the government, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks spent years in the mines before war broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked until I went into the service and then after that I
went to Alaska to work a uranium mine there, all high-grade ore.''
</P>
<P>
   Drafted into the Army in World War II, Stocks served in four
major campaigns in the Pacific Theater and wrapped up his military
service in Korea, where he was among forces that supervised the
Japanese surrender.
</P>
<P>
   During his times in the mines, he said, no one ever mentioned
the possibility of contracting radiation-related disease, such as
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks' cancer started in his prostate gland, he said, and might
have been checked there had his doctor not lost a report.
``Incidentally, he's not my doctor anymore,'' Stocks said.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer radiated to his bladder and physicians most recently
noticed that nodules on his lungs had metastasized and one of his
kidneys no longer functions, said Stocks' niece, Delma Pangreen,
who cares for him.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1990 recognized that uranium workers worked in
dangerous conditions without being told of thted dog holes. Those
workers, Congress decided, would be eligible for $100,000 payments
if they contracted radiation-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks was one of the first to seek compensation and submitted a
claim in 1992, which was rejected. His second claim was the one
that netted him the government's IOU.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even after the trust fund for the payments ran dry,
Congress expanded the payments to include people who worked in
uranium mills and who hauled the ore.
</P>
<P>
   Congress moved quickly this year on a bill by one of Stocks'
senators, Orrin Hatch, to expand the Radiation Exposure
Compensation Act, but it seems paralyzed on the subject of Stocks
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks is in a sort of no-man's land. His senator, Hatch, a Utah
Republican, was unaware of his plight. Hatch spokesman Derrick
White in Washington, D.C., said Hatch would welcome a phone call
from Stocks or his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, said staffer James Doyle, also is interested in
helping, but would like to see Hatch involved.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Stocks has plans for the $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it get it, I'll send some kids to school,'' he said,
referring to his wife's family, and he said his niece Delma is in
line for some money.
</P>
<P>
   Killian said he worries that Stocks won't survive to see the
next federal budget cycle, but Stocks said he was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible I could live for a year yet,'' he said. ``Or it
could happen tomorrow. At my age, you never know.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Roommate Finders, an apartment referral service,
the on-hold telephone tune is the bouncy theme from ``The Odd
Couple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have people come in and say, `I don't want any
Felix Unger types,''' said Michael Santomauro, the company's
founder, speaking about the nit-picky neat-freak from the old
television show. ``They'll say: `I'm a slob and I want them to know
that. I want them to prefer to live with someone like me.'''
</P>
<P>
   As one of perhaps two dozen companies that occupy a sliver of a
niche in the New York real estate market _ bringing together
apartment dwellers with folks who want to rent that extra bedroom
or, often, just a corner of the living room _ Roommate Finders,
along with its competitors, deals with ``people looking to live
with the perfect stranger,'' Santomauro said.
</P>
<P>
   The niche is the apartment referral industry, which ran afoul of
state regulators two decades ago after scandals shed light on a
variety of scams. And the sliver is roommate referrals _ an
enterprise characterized by wide-ranging fees, complicated refund
policies and, recently, an increase in consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   When done properly, roommate referral means more than merely
handing out often outdated apartment listings. It is as much a
social, even psychological, practice as it is a business dealing
with apartment sizes, locations and rents. It calls for mixing and
matching an array of personal preferences, interests, habits and
quirks. It is one of the few commercial activities in which
focusing on ethnic, religious or gender profiles is permissible.
And often it does bring together perfect strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Yuko Nakaguchi and Benjamin Dzang.
</P>
<P>
   Nakaguchi is a diminutive, demure young woman from Shizuoka,
Japan. Dzang is a lanky, jocular, globe-trotting son of a diplomat
from Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried about living with a stranger,'' said Nakaguchi, who
moved into Dzang's two-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights,
Brooklyn, a year ago. ``But I met a good person to live with. No
problems. He sometimes cooks Ghanaian food for me, and I cook
Japanese food for him. So we are doing a good exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakaguchi, 27, and Dzang, 25, were brought together by Japanese
Clientele Shares and Apartments, a roommate referral service that,
while willing to do business with anyone able to pay a $500 fee,
focuses on ``shareseekers'' (to use the industry parlance) from
Asia, and from Japan in particular.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Gay Roommate Information Network that brought Blair
Lawhead and Barry Kawakami together in November _ but determinedly
not for matchmaking purposes. ``Absolutely not,'' said Lawhead, 37,
who when not playing the violin in Broadway orchestras runs a
nonsurgical hair-replacement service _ ``Please don't say wigs,''
he said with a laugh _ out of his apartment in the Chelsea Gardens
co-op on West 23rd Street. ``It's just the opposite for me,
strictly a business thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay Roommate Information Network is operated by DG Neary
Realty. ``It's not a dating service, it's a roommate service,''
said Dan Gerstein, a principal of DG Neary.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein said he tells clients they should not accept a share
with a someone for whom they feel a romantic chemistry. ``Instead,
date,'' he said. ``Because when the fires of passion cool, you're
going to have to have breakfast with that person, and that could be
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Santomauro's Roommate Finders does not cater to a specific
clientele. And while services rendered by different referral
agencies certainly vary _ to the point where the Better Business
Bureau of New York has recorded a significant increase in
complaints this year _ the work done by Roommate Finders meets
expectable, if unwritten, industry standards. It goes well beyond
the mere distribution of apartment listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take into account 35 compatibility factors, so we don't
waste anyone's time,'' Santomauro said. ``We take into account age
range, sexual orientation, if they are open to living with two
other roommates, to parent and child situations _ moving in with a
family _ to pets, pet peeves, religious or racial preferences, if
any, marijuana use, reformed alcoholics, smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask: `Are you looking for a roommate for purely
practical-financial reasons, or for companionship, or both? Do you
keep routine hours? Entertain a lot?''' Other factors commonly
included in roommate profiles are attitudes toward noise, overnight
guests, cleanliness, work schedules and dietary considerations,
like keeping kosher.
</P>
<P>
   But besides exchanging personal data, Gerstein said, roommate
services should _ but do not always _ provide full information on
their listings: factors like apartment size, building amenities,
transportation connections. ``We not only describe the space they
are renting, but the entire apartment,'' he said. ``We give them
the floor plan, so that they have an idea what common space there
is and what sort of creature comforts.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We list apartments throughout the New York area,'' Gerstein
said, ``so the prices range from as low as $300 to as high as
$1,300 or $1,400.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide range of fees and refund policies among the two
dozen or so roommate referral services that are listed in the
Yellow Pages or that buy display ads in New York City neighborhood
newspapers or in The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Roommate Finders, a ``shareseeker'' pays $300
for unlimited use of the service for a year, even if the original
or subsequent matches do not work out. If the client finds an
apartment on his own within the first 30 days, 50 percent is
refunded. (Most services accept listings from tenants at no charge,
but some ask for a small fee. At Roommate Finders, for example, the
listing fee is $25.)
</P>
<P>
   The Gay Roommate Information Network charges a shareseeker only
$50, in part because it wants to serve its constituency. ``But
we're not totally altruistic,'' said Gerstein, whose parent company
specializes in apartment sales and rentals in downtown Manhattan.
``It gives us publicity for the real estate company. Our hope is
that people will come back to us when they are ready to buy or rent
an apartment, and that's how we really make our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Rainbow Roommates, used to specifically serve
the gay community. But Douglas Levy, its president, said it
recently merged with Roommates NYC, ``a straight but gay-friendly
company.'' Rainbow Roommates charges $250 for four months' worth of
service. ``If someone is not satisfied, we will consult with them,
try continuously to make a new match,'' Levy said, but the company
does not give refunds.
</P>
<P>
   At Japanese Clientele Shares and Apartments, the $500 fee has no
limit on the time or number of listings available to a client. ``If
people register with us but find a place on their own,'' Kawahara
said, ``we credit the whole $500 permanently. So they could come
back any time they want to use the service again.''

 &HT;    Together by choice
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ They're buried as they lived, side by side,
in a plot that seems at once too small for their stature and a
perfect fit with their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Their grave marker is no bigger or more ornate than most others
in the cemetery located behind the small white Baptist church they
helped build on land they donated nearly 150 years ago. The few
facts carved in stone _ Chang and Eng came into the world together
on May 11, 1811, and died together on Jan. 17, 1874 _ barely
scratch the surface of this richly complex, real-life saga of the
original Siamese twins.
</P>
<P>
   They surely were among the most exotically foreign creatures
this part of the world had ever seen. And yet their story _ and
that of their descendants _ is quintessentially American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once when I was 8 or 9, we were sitting around the table at
home talking about famous people,'' recalls Milton Haynes, 64, of
Raleigh. ``And I said, `Who are we?' I can still remember my daddy
saying, `You can tell 'em we're descended from Siamese twins.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's the last Saturday in July, and Haynes is waiting his turn
in a long buffet line in the White Plains Recreational Building. To
his right, the U.S. and North Carolina flags are displayed on a
beige brick wall. Dead ahead, a couple of tables laid end-to-end
nearly buckle beneath the weight of homemade casseroles, platters
of chicken and bowls of baked beans and banana pudding. The excited
chatter of reunited cousins and great-aunts fills what little air
circulates in the low-slung building.
</P>
<P>
   It could be any one of countless family reunions held in small
Southern towns on sultry summer afternoons. On their name tags,
Haynes and his wife, Chase, also have printed the name ``Chang.''
Across the room, Jessie Bunker Bryant, a statuesque woman in her
early 70s bent low over a table of fat notebooks filled with
genealogical information, has written ``Eng'' on hers.
</P>
<P>
   So has Sarah Bunker, at 11 one of the youngest of the
approximately 150 descendants of the twins packed into this small
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many `greats' I am,'' sighs Sarah, who has no
siblings and shudders slightly at the thought of being permanently
attached to a certain pesky young relative.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most family ties are figurative. For Chang and Eng
Bunker, they were literal, although it is the way the two men
worked with, around and through their condition, rather than the
physical oddity itself, that their descendants come together to
recall and celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left us a great legacy,'' says Tom Atkins, 39, the
self-described ``youngest great-grandchild'' (by Eng), who moved
three years ago from Gwinnett County to Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine taking off from home for a foreign country when you're
still a kid and doing what they did. I don't know how anyone could
do that, let alone people in their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in what is now Thailand, connected by a band of cartilage
at the base of the breastbone, Chang and Eng unwittingly spawned
the phrase Siamese twins (the accepted term now is ``conjoined'')
and were initially considered to be such a bad omen that they were
ordered put to death. Though they were spared, even being invited
at age 13 to visit the Bangkok palace of King Rama III, Chang and
Eng's shared life was hardly their own for years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the twins turned 18, a Scottish trader paid a
small sum of money to the boys' mother and got permission from the
king to take them to New York. ``The Siamese Double Boys,'' as an
exhibition poster billed them, spent the next three years touring
the United States and Great Britain with an act that largely
featured them tumbling and audiences staring at them curiously. In
Britain alone, more than 300,000 people paid to see them. But after
promoters and exhibitors took their cuts, there was little money
left for the twins. Soon after turning 21, the twins went into
business for themselves in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By 1839, Chang and Eng were in need of a vacation and a career
change. They found both in Wilkesboro, N.C., where they applied for
U.S. citizenship and set about becoming farmers in an area known as
Trap Hill. Adopting an arbitrary last name, Bunker, they began
sinking roots. In a double ceremony in April 1843, Chang married
Adelaide Yates, with whom he would eventually have 10 children, and
Eng married her sister, Sallie, with whom he would have 11. In
1845, the two growing families moved to a bigger house on a large
piece of farmland near Mount Airy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mount Airy is best known as the picturesque birthplace of
TV's Andy Griffith. Its downtown is dotted with a Floyd's City
Barbershop, a Snappy Lunch and other establishments offering fond
reminders or actual souvenirs of the fictional Mayberry. But in the
mid-1800s, the Bunker twins _ having toured with P.T. Barnum and
appeared onstage around the world _ loomed largest in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the I-74 connector highway runs through what was once
their vast expanse of farmland in White Plains. The original White
Plains Baptist Church stands on their donated land, not far from
Bunker Road. The ``double chop'' method Chang and Eng developed to
fell large trees is still used by pairs of woodchoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bunkers grew tobacco, among other crops, and owned slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Shoemaker, a Duluth resident who accompanied her husband,
Dick, an Eng descendant, to his third reunion this year, summed it
up: ``They apparently fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been their biggest accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   But life wasn't perfect in White Plains. The Civil War nearly
destroyed the twins financially, and it touched them emotionally as
each saw his eldest son march off to fight for the Confederate
cause. By then, their families had grown too big and the tension
level had risen too high to be contained in one house. In 1857, the
twins divided their farm in two along Stewart's Creek and
alternated living in each house for three days at a time. Each man
was treated as the master in his own house.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward now to 1989. A Thai TV producer contacted Milton
Haynes in Raleigh. Could Haynes, a great-grandson of Chang, get a
bunch of the descendants together for a documentary being done on
the twins?
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of the family hadn't held a joint reunion for as
long as anyone could remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always known as `the other side of the creek' to
us,'' says Haynes, who thinks it was simply a matter of so many
descendants becoming so spread out over time. ``And we to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes contacted Jessie Bunker Bryant, one of Eng's
great-granddaughters, and the resulting reunion at a church in
Wallberg, N.C., drew about 175 people. Since then, Chang and Eng
descendants from as far away as Idaho and Washington state have
come to North Carolina for the annual reunion held on the last
Saturday in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured since these two gentlemen had never been separated,
we should try to get together,'' says Haynes, inching his way along
the buffet line at this year's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the most unlikely guest at this year's reunion was
30-year-old Darin Strauss of New York. Strauss' first novel,
``Chang and Eng,'' was published this summer to much acclaim.
Starting with details from the twins' history, Strauss broadened
his story into a haunting exploration of themes relating to
identity and the conflicting need to belong to someone else and to
break away. ``A spirited _ and promising _ debut,'' the New York
Times chief book critic wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some descendants' reviews were less glowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really tried to be objective, but I just can't be,'' says
Tanya Rees, 50, a great-great-granddaughter of Eng and the
executive director of the Surry County Arts Council, housed in the
Andy Griffith Playhouse. ``In terms of interest and fascination,
it's really hard to improve on the truth about their lives. From a
family perspective, it's quite disappointing t

 &HT;    Know where you're headed with digital compass
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You may remember a time when you were a kid and
you got a toy compass.
</P>
<P>
   Those cheesy little devices featured a jiggling needle balanced
on a pin, and the painted end of the needle always pointed north.
Unless there was a magnet nearby or the needle fell off the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Today you can carry around a digital device that does the same
thing more reliably. The Co-Pilot from Precision Navigation Inc.
gives you a digital readout that tells you exactly which way you're
headed with an accuracy of plus or minus 5 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The Co-Pilot comes in three models and the basic model, the
V500, is designed to be used exclusively in a car. The unit
attaches to the windshield and gives continual readouts of the
car's direction of travel.
</P>
<P>
   The compass warns the driver if its readings are being distorted
by outside influences such as a nearby metal bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The device is 2.5-by-2.5 inches, and has large digits that are
illuminated for night navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Precision Navigation also makes two other Co-Pilot models, the
V550 and V600, that are designed to be used both inside and outside
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Co-Pilots can be ordered from www.precisionnav.com. The
compasses also are available from specialty retailers such as
Sharper Image.
</P>
<P>
   The V500 sells on the Web site for $39.95, the V550 costs
$49.95, and the V600 for vehicle and handheld use sells for $59.95.

 &HT;    Don't be fooled; nobody follows Bible to the letter

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman chooses which
biblical laws to follow literally and which he will modify to suit
his needs.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious conservatives condemn that approach. But Jesus
would applaud it.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman does not drive on the Sabbath because rabbis teach
that driving is a form of prohibited work, and he is an observant
Jew.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic vice presidential nominee often does hard
work on the Sabbath that he has decided the Bible permits.
</P>
<P>
   He admits walking to his office on the Jewish day of rest to
consider and cast votes in the Senate, shuffle papers and attend
meetings. But that work is for the public good, he insists, and is,
therefore, allowed by the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that is playing fast and loose with Holy Writ and
amounts to taking a ride on the slippery slope to moral relativity,
where they fear anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   They insist that the Bible be read literally and followed
religiously. But no one does that. No one ever has.
</P>
<P>
   All people of faith, despite what they say, are selective
literalists. That is, like Lieberman, they accept parts of
Scripture literally. They liberally interpret other parts or simply
ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   There is good precedent for doing so. David took forbidden bread
from the tabernacle to feed his troops. Jesus healed on the
Sabbath. He forgave the woman taken in adultery when stoning was
the biblical remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jew nor Christian follows the biblical laws for ritual
sacrifice in the Hebrew Scripture. Yet, none has been repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians insist that the sacrifice of Jesus made them
unnecessary, but they are still on the books to be followed by
those who claim to read Scripture literally.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians manipulate the Ten Commandments to make Sunday
the Sabbath in place of Saturday. Seventh-Day Adventists do follow
the commandment to hallow the actual Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of Christians believe the literal teaching
about the death and resurrection of Jesus that is the heart of
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   But few Christians in this day of family values and the
condemnation of homosexuality follow St. Paul's strong
recommendation to avoid marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And no one, save the lunatic fringe, follows his advice that
married couples should live together as brother and sister (1Co
7:29).
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is confident in his faith. He accepts parts of God's
word literally and interprets the rest.
</P>
<P>
   All people of faith do. Some just won't admit it.

 &HT;    Conduct unbecoming
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't want much: just a fair wage for an honest
day's work.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, many workers say that fairness, honesty and
integrity are far too often absent from the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firm KPMG recently reported in its 2000
Organizational Survey, which was released this spring, that
American workers are witnessing a high level of illegal and
unethical conduct on the job. Workers say the misbehavior is
serious, the firm reports, and that Corporate America is doing very
little to deal with the problems effectively and may even be
discouraging employees from reporting problems to their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't look good. Seventy-six percent of employees
across all industries admitted to observing violations of the law
or company policy during 1999. And 49 percent of those employees
said they believed if the misconduct they observed were made
public, their employers would ``significantly lose public trust,''
the consulting firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the law isn't at issue, in much of the American
workplace, there is a corporate culture of lying. And it seems to
be getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   All the layoffs of the last 15 years have eroded the trust and
respect between employers and employees. And just as parents tell
their young children when they catch them in a white lie, people
can get into the habit of lying. Once they do, it's a hard habit to
break.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to buck the trend and make a go for that fair pay,
honest work deal, it's best to try upfront to get a sense of the
integrity of a potential employer.
</P>
<P>
   Although standards and codes of conduct vary by industry, says
Win Swenson, national managing director of KPMG's integrity
management services, your bosses ``need to have standards that are
going to tell people what it is they are supposed to do.'' So, the
first thing to look for when sizing up the company is a written
code of conduct, he advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies have good published statements of here's our code
of conduct, that's (an) indication that people in the company think
this important enough to talk about. That's a good sign,'' Swenson
says.
</P>
<P>
   Second, management ought to have a system in place to monitor if
the codes and standards are being kept. ``There needs to be a
management structure to ensure that compliance and ethics are
occurring,'' Swenson says. ``It's not enough to say `Here are the
standards' and (management) not ensure that things are happening''
in accordance with them, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a company that is serious about promoting a
workplace of integrity and ethical business practices will also
have performance measurements and systems in place to reward
employees who measure up to or exceed them.
</P>
<P>
   When something does go wrong, an employee must have a safe and
confidential way of reporting misconduct without fear. ``There has
to be a healthy way by which people can raise issues,'' Swenson
says. ``If there's generally a shoot-the-messenger mentality about
the raising of ethical issues, people certainly won't raise them.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, says Swenson, companies that are serious about an
ethical and honest work environment will thoroughly communicate
their standards to employees and provide training that helps
workers achieve their stated performance goals.
</P>
<P>
   Judging how your future employer is faring may take some
investigation, but it's time well spent, Swenson says. Start by
checking the corporate Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Says Swenson, ``If they do make their code of conduct available
on the Web site, evaluate it this way: Where is the CEO? Does the
CEO have a cover letter? How does it strike you? Is he behind it?
Or is it a perfunctory statement? A little bit of a threat? How do
you as a reader react to it? If it sounds real, there's a better
chance that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a code of conduct or statement of company
standards online, ask for a written copy, Swenson says. ``It is not
in any way a taboo to say, `I'm just curious how you guys look at
this stuff,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other ways to find out? Swenson suggests asking, ``How will I be
evaluated?'' ``What will it take for me to be promoted?''
</P>
<P>
   If you're concerned, you definitely should ask, he says. By
asking, ``You run the risk of suggesting that ethics is important
to you, but it may be a risk you want to run,'' Swenson says.
</P>
<P>
   You might also conduct an Internet or news database search for
reports on company performance and conduct, Swenson advises. ``Find
out what comes up with the company,'' he says. ``Have they been
involved with some aromatic litigation or that sort or thing?''
</P>
<P>
   If you run across something, don't hesitate to ask management
about it. Don't just jump to conclusions, Swenson counsels. ``I've
seen bad things happen at very good companies, and what they do is
try to do better. If you've found it, I wouldn't cross the company
off the list at all. I'd ask about it. If you find a whole lot of
it and the industry scuttlebutt is that that is just how this
company operates, then that's a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, talk to folks who work at the company, Swenson says.
They can be an invaluable source of information about the work
environment and ethical standards at a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask them what it's really like here,'' Swenson says. ``People
tend to be happier at companies that do manage these issues well.
They don't feel good if they feel they are working in an
environment where they feel _ even subtly _ that they are being
pressured to work in an unethical environment.''

 &HT;    Chalk it up to mutual understanding
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Can we talk?
</P>
<P>
   With the school year approaching, it's time for teachers and
parents to reopen the lines of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody agrees that children learn best when education becomes
a team effort between families and schools. But often teachers are
afraid of losing their authority and parents are just too busy for
much partnering to occur.
</P>
<P>
   To save everyone time and stress, we asked working teachers and
frenzied moms and dads exactly what advice they would give the
other side in order to make this school year the most productive
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Here are lists of the top suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TEACHERS WISH PARENTS WOULD REMEMBER:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get to know your child's teacher. ``Share the news from home.
Teachers want to celebrate good things in a child's life and want
to offer support and understanding during times of trial,'' said
Judy Whelley, a teacher coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't overschedule your child. ``They're so involved in their
other activities _ dancing, soccer, music lessons _ they're tired
when they come to school, or they haven't done their homework,''
said Susan Lightcap, an elementary school teacher. ``School should
come first.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure they're rested. ``Start with an early bedtime well
before school starts, so they're in the habit of going to bed on
time,'' said Beverly Horowitz, an early childhood instructor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide a comfortable, well-lit homework area. Check homework
daily, but also encourage your child to work independently, Whelley
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Model reading and writing. ``Talk with your child about
something from the newspaper or from a book you're reading. Let
them see you making grocery lists, writing notes . . .,'' Whelley
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go to the library. Use your card and be sure your child has
his or her own card, Whelley said. ``It's important to keep your
child reading over the summer, whether it's from library books or
newspapers,'' said Lori Anger, a teacher at McKinley Elementary in
Xenia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit television time. Encourage your child to be physically
active and to spend time doing household chores, talking with
family members, playing board games and more, Whelley said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read to your child daily. ``Establish a time every day that is
inviolate, that you don't allow anything else to interfere with,''
said Becky Brunsman, who teaches kindergarten. Two good resource
books are ``The New Read Aloud Handbook'' by Jim Trelease (1995);
and ``Black Books Galore! A Guide to Great African American
Children's Books,'' by Donna Rand, Toni Trent Parker and Sheila
Foster (Wiley, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your child in school. ``Don't schedule camping trips and
vacations during the school year,'' Lightcap said. ``They can't
learn if they're not here.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Visit school often. Don't just put in face time at
parent-teacher conferences. ``Come for the special performances and
happenings,'' Whelley said. ``Stop by during the day once in a
while to observe your child in class and meet classmates. If at all
possible, volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT PARENTS WISH TEACHERS WOULD REMEMBER:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dare to discipline. ``Be assertive. You are the authority
figure in the classroom, not the students. They need and expect
this,'' said Richard Melson, who has four children in the Dayton
public school system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress the value of education. ``Because the kids are dropping
out. They don't want to go to school,'' said Martina Rose McKever,
whose daughter Elita is entering third grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accept each child as an individual. ``Keep an open mind and
accept the child for what they are,'' said Edward Breen, a parent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be a friend. ``I know teachers want to start out the school
year knowing that they have control of their classroom,'' said
Patty Nogle, whose youngest daughter Jenny graduated last year from
high school. ``But they have to be approachable, so the kids aren't
just floundering on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not try to be a friend. Yes, parents are split on this
issue. But many insist buddying up with students is a bad idea.
``Especially at the high school level. . . . Children do not always
understand why you must `come down on them' if you're their
friend,'' Melson said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set high standards and expect children to meet them.
``Teachers should do that instead of settling for mediocrity,''
said Georgia Cox, who has two childrenin elementary school. ``They
should treat children as though they expect them to rise to the
level they have set.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Communicate often. ``The bottom line is communication both
ways,'' said Noreen Atkins, a parent and teacher. ``The student
really benefits when he knows that parents and teachers are in
constant communication.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Prepare families before school starts. ``My children would
rather have open house before school starts to give them a chance
to see where things are in the building and to meet their
teachers,'' said Suzanne Geisler. ``The first week of school we get
so many fliers and forms they're overwhelming. . . . I wish I could
get those before school started so I would have a little more time
to go through them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Be honest. ``You are human and will make a mistake. Let both
the parent and student know that you understand this,'' Melson
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do more guided self-learning and less lecturing. ``I think
children really learn best . . . when they are actively engaged in
the process of finding out things on their own,'' said Mary Walker,
who has a child in high school.

DISILLUSIONED, DISABLED RACERS TURN THEIR BACKS ON NYC MARATHON 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANE HERBST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Disabled marathoners will have another opportunity to
compete in New York City next year, in the Achilles Marathon,
scheduled for April 1 in Prospect Park in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the Achilles Track Club, an athletic group for
the disabled and the organizers of the new race, say that getting
approval for the marathon as well as maintaining their status quo
in the New York City Marathon has not happened without a struggle.
The result, at least to Achilles, is that its relationship with the
New York Road Runners Club, which runs the New York City Marathon,
has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a conscious and deliberate attempt to
diminish the contribution of disabled runners,'' said state Sen.
David A. Paterson, who is legally blind and ran in last year's New
York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Laufer, general counsel for the Road Runners, says the
club is neither anti-Achilles nor anti-disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pro-athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Achilles was created as part of the Road Runners before becoming
a separate nonprofit organization. A sign of its independence is
the creation of its eponymous marathon _ with 500 disabled and
1,500 able-bodied athletes, including elite competitors _ and one
that its members say was supported enthusiastically by City Hall
last fall. But, said Dick Traum, who runs the Achilles club,
support from city officials later vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``From November on, it sounded like someone stepped in and put a
halt to it, and the only reasons would have been the arrogance of
power and political connections,'' said Paterson, a Democrat from
upper Manhattan serving his 15th year who joined the board of
Achilles at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden it became hush-hush and by March it was
over,'' Paterson said. ``When you work in government, you learn to
recognize the signals. When people are all for something and then
no one talks, you know someone played a card.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the marathon gained approval after Traum met with
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who determined that the marathon
would indeed be held in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry came to the rescue,'' said Traum, himself a disabled
marathoner whose right leg was amputated after a car accident.
``He's the one who said `Let's go ahead with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stern denied that support from City Hall had waned, but he said
that the Road Runners and the city were not going to support a
marathon that would be in Central Park, where the Achilles race was
originally proposed, in direct competition with the New York City
Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in the Road Runners club who didn't want to
extend themselves and why should they?'' Stern said. ``They've
spent years building up the New York City Marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue was when and where,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Steinfeld, the Road Runners president, did not return
repeated calls for comment. Laufer said that although he did not
know about anyone trying to block the new marathon, ``people had
differing opinions'' about holding it.
</P>
<P>
   The Achilles Marathon is not the only disabled issue facing the
Road Runners. In January, the club settled a discrimination suit
filed by another group of disabled athletes, agreeing to create a
separate division for wheelchair athletes in the New York City
Marathon. In March, the Road Runners announced that this division
will be highly competitive and will include prize money next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains for the professional wheelchair athlete threatened
to affect the nonelite disabled athlete negatively. The Road
Runners decided to cancel the 8 a.m. start for about 100 disabled
athletes severely slowed by multiple sclerosis, organ transplants,
heart problems, amputations or age who need extra time to complete
the 26.2-mile race before dark.
</P>
<P>
   Marathon organizers said the early start was canceled because of
safety concerns. These competitors would already be on the course
when elite wheelchair racers sped by. Instead, the slowest
participants would have been placed at the back of the pack, behind
the 30,000 able-bodied runners at the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 1, following months of protest from Achilles
members, marathon organizers ruled that the disabled would start at
8:50 a.m., two hours before the main start on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   While some Achilles members say it's better than no early start
at all, others remain furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``That extra hour means so much, it means finishing in daylight,
not in the cold, it makes it safer, it means finishing with the
support of the crowds at the end,'' said Maureen Lally, 47. She has
malformed hips and couldn't walk more than half a block until she
started training with Achilles. She finished the 1998 and 1999
marathons in over nine hours. ``Why after 24 years would you change
it?''
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Road Runners made another significant change, one
that has not been reversed: ousting Traum from the club's board of
directors, after he had served 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to stick it to me,'' said Traum, who said there
is now no voice in the Road Runners for Achilles.
</P>
<P>
   Laufer disagrees with Traum's assessment. While declining to
comment on Traum's ouster from the board, citing confidentiality
restrictions, he said the board ``acted in the best interests of
the club.''

   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ When the Bird House at Riverbanks Zoo in
Columbia, S.C., opens early next year, visitors will experience the
beauty of birds and their habitats. And, as added treats, there
will be the works of muralist David Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But Rock wants his lush paintings to be wallflowers, both
literally and figuratively. He hopes people will appreciate them
without even realizing they're there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm successful, you're not really supposed to notice my
work,'' says Rock, who has done murals for zoos and aquariums
around the country. ``It should be a continuation of what people
are seeing around them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Riverbanks Zoo Bird House, what people see around them
will be 14,000 square feet of displays of tropical birds from
Africa and South America, as well as penguins. The $5 million
expansion of the aviary is part of $20 million in improvements
under way at the 26-year-old zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Satch Krantz, executive director of the zoo, says the expansion
isn't about having more birds in the facility; rather, the intent
is to improve the way the various species are displayed. He says
zoo officials wanted Rock's paintings in the Bird House because of
the reputation he has established with his work for the Bronx Zoo
in New York, the Cleveland Zoo, the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago and
other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely well-known in the zoo community,'' Krantz says.
``He's considered the best among the handful of people who do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock's career as a zoo muralist started in a roundabout way. He
graduated from college with an art degree, but he went to work as a
carpenter. While putting up scaffolding for a zoo mural, Rock met
an artist who encouraged him to switch from a hammer to an
airbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Rock says he likes to keep a certain amount of spontaneity in
his work, changing colors or repainting scenes if what he's done
doesn't suit him. However, there was one thing he was certain he
wanted to include as soon as he saw drawings of the Bird House
design that showed a creek flowing up to one of the building's
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm creating the illusion that the creek continues into the
building,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other exhibits for which he created one large painting,
projects where he created one large painting for an exhibit, Rock's
work at Riverbanks Zoo involves a variety of habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this more fun,'' Rock says. ``Rather than
painting one scene, there's a good diversity of things here.''

PLACING FIRST IN OLYMPIC TRIALS, GYMNAST AIMS FOR NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was hours before the preliminaries of the U.S.
Olympic trials on Friday when anxiety began creeping into Elise
Ray's thoughts like smoke slithering under a door.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, she was consumed by trepidation as she went through
her morning practice. This wasn't normal at all. Usually, she is
jitter-proof, butterfly-free. After all, Ray was the unflappable
gymnast who managed to stay in one piece while her neophyte
teammates crumbled around her at the forgettable 1999 world
championships. And Ray was the confident risk-taker who
spontaneously increased the difficulty of her final vault to place
first at the nationals in July.
</P>
<P>
   But now there was the burden of expectation on her compact
frame, and there was the unnerving upheaval surrounding the
subjective selection process for the six-woman Olympic team. Was
the national champion safely on her way to Sydney, Australia, if
she slipped out of first at the trials?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling the pressure more than I expected to,'' Ray said
late Friday. ``I went back to my hotel room after the morning
workout, calmed down, closed my eyes and did a little visualizing
before the meet. I just thought about each of my routines and
thought positively.''
</P>
<P>
   This daughter of a psychotherapist had found her own solution to
her jangled mental state. She took the edge off her fears, settled
her mind and then delivered an unwavering performance that left her
in first place after the preliminary round of the trials.
</P>
<P>
   By combining her top score from nationals with her work so far
at the trials, Ray seems as if she's certain to make the team if
she can maintain a lofty standing through the finals Sunday night.
If anyone might safely expect to make the team, it's Ray. At least,
for now.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no guarantees. As the blustery voice of a
selection panel that will choose the team just minutes after
Sunday's finals, Bela Karolyi has made it clear that he will not be
bound by the order of finish. With the 18-year-old Ray leading a
new generation that is trying to pry an Olympic opportunity from
the 1996 golden oldies _ 1996 gold medalists Shannon Miller and
Dominique Dawes, both now 23, and Amy Chow, now 22 _ some wonder if
the scores of young and old will mean anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what will happen,'' said Vanessa Atler, who
fell to sixth place over all after blowing her dismount on the
balance beam. ``If Bela doesn't like you, you could be out the
door. If Bela does like you, it's OK if you mess up. It's a
difficult situation for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that Karolyi's comfort zone with those gymnasts who
once wowed the world in Atlanta does count for something. He has
watched Chow and Dawes improve their performances since nationals.
And he seems to have faith in Miller, America's most decorated
gymnast, even though she had a bad fall on the vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veterans all have the edge,'' said Miller's coach, Steve
Nunno, who watched his pupil finish seventh in the preliminaries.
``I think Bela knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray understands that, too. And she embraces all of the former
gold medal winners at the meet as her close friends, but she is
also eager to carve out her own niche in women's gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not her motivation, Ray realizes the adulation,
attention and financial boost she would receive by doing well in
the Olympics. In small but uplifting ways, she has already begun to
be recognized, like inside the malls around her hometown of
Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also in a bank and wrote my name on the slip and was
recognized, so that was fun,'' Ray said. ``It's kind of nice to
have people notice you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to miss Ray on the arena floor as well. Belying her
sunny last name, Ray isn't one of those gymnasts who pastes on a
phony game show-host exuberance when she performs. The intensity
she revealed when nailing a 9.812 on her first event of Friday
night, the uneven bars, did not change even in the more graceful
moments of her high-flying floor routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with my level of pizazz,'' Ray said, smiling
after the competition, on the heels of a 9.8 on the floor exercise.
``You have to balance personality with how much focus you need. I
think the judges look for a general air about you, like confidence.
Everyone, whether they feel it or not, tries to put off an air of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours Friday afternoon, Ray's faith was a little
unsteady. But she found comfort in visualization and peace from a
tiny silver pin. Before every meet, Ray's family sends her a card
and an angel pin to stick on her USA team jacket. On Friday night,
she arrived in the interview room with a silver angel playing a
harp under her left lapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of pins,'' Ray said. ``I keep them all in a
little box at home. I think having one on reminds me that my family
is always with me, and in a way, it makes me feel a sense of
protection.''

COLOMBIA VOWS TO INVESTIGATE KILLING OF 6 CHILDREN BY TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 1st graf to recast and give kids' ages.) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ In a test of its commitment to improving its
human rights record, the Colombian government has promised a
full-scale investigation of an army attack on an elementary school
hiking trip that left six children between ages 8 and 10 dead last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the children were gunned down on Tuesday, top
commanders of the army publicly blamed guerrillas involved in
Colombia's long-running insurgencies for the deaths, saying that
rebels were using the children as human shields in a gunbattle. But
throughout the week, various witnesses came forward to say that
there were no rebels near the scene of the shooting, in a coffee
field in northwestern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The episode came at a particularly embarrassing moment for
President Andres Pastrana, who is preparing for President Clinton's
six-hour visit in the resort port of Cartagena on August 30.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
to certify whether or not Colombia has met several human rights
conditions in order to be eligible to receive the military
component of a new $1.3 billion aid program designed to combat drug
trafficking in two southern provinces dominated by Marxist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   If Albright does not certify Colombia, Clinton can still grant
the country a national security waiver to release the aid. A halt
in aid, which Clinton administration officials say is vital to
slowing the flow of Colombian cocaine to the United States, is
considered highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The government has announced that it is investigating 25
soldiers and officers of the army's 4th Division in the shootings
of the children and says that 43 investigators of three government
agencies have been put on the case. Forensic specialists have
already been sent to the village of Pueblo Rico to examine the
bodies. Several other children were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the children killed were on a school hiking trip from
the village of La Pica. Two others were residents who lived in the
coffee fields where the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials insist that the killings were not
intentional. ``The only option we can definitely rule out is that
Colombian soldiers would have fired intentionally on the
children,'' said Attorney General Alfonso Gomez Mendez.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the incident occurred as units of two army
battalions were chasing rebels of the National Liberation Army, the
country's second-largest rebel group best known for kidnappings and
bombing oil pipelines. Francisco Galan, a spokesman for the group,
denied his forces were anywhere near the combat.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings have been harshly criticized by human rights
activists here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas Division of Human
Rights Watch, said the incident ``goes straight to the heart of the
issue _ which is the abuse of the armed forces, including attacks
on the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't think Colombia qualifies at this stage for
U.S. military support.''
</P>
<P>
   Several aid groups, including Save the Children and the
Christian Children's Fund, have called on the Colombian government
to give a complete accounting of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials condemned the shooting, and said they
expect a full investigation.

HOME SWAP GIVES COUPLE THE CONVENIENCES OF A VILLAGE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  By TRISH HALL    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, if the house you want isn't for sale, you have to
entice the people to move by offering something they want even
more.
</P>
<P>
   Your house, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, Camilla Calhoun and Aldo Rafanelli lived in an old
house on an acre and a half of land in Millwood, N.Y., in
Westchester County, next to a nature preserve with 140 acres. It
was definitely private. But, any time they wanted a magazine, or a
quart of milk, they had to get in the car and go out. Their older
son, Marco, was in college, and their younger one, Alessandro, was
about to go. Suddenly, their house seemed way too big and way too
much work. ``The kids were not going to be around to cut the
grass,'' Rafanelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a house in the suburbs is only marginally easier
than finding an apartment in Manhattan. Prices have been
escalating, and in the most sought-after towns, there isn't much on
the market. Wanting to cut down on maintenance chores, they first
tried condominiums, but ``we couldn't find any lovable, or likable,
condos,'' Rafanelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Calhoun was driving around with a broker in the
village of Tarrytown and passed Grove Street, which she had always
admired for its collection of architecturally arresting houses.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to a particular one she liked, manageable in size
and charmingly Victorian, which the broker said belonged to a
family with three young children looking for a larger place. Since
they hadn't yet put the house up for sale, Calhoun asked to be
notified if the house went on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, she and her husband found a house they liked well
enough, and they made a bid on it. They weren't in love with it,
but choices were limited. But Calhoun couldn't get the other place
out of her head, and so she asked the broker to suggest a trade:
their large house in the highly regarded Chappaqua school district,
at the market price, for the Grove Street house, at the market
price.
</P>
<P>
   The broker for the other couple said she would come over
immediately and assess the possibilities. She did, Calhoun said,
and ``she said, this is definitely it.'' The next day, Calhoun and
Rafanelli went to look at the house on Grove Street, and they, too,
were sold. After a bit of negotiating, they worked out the sales,
setting a price of $624,000 for the larger house and $349,000 for
the smaller one.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Calhoun and Rafanelli moved into the house, which
is perched high on a hill above the Hudson River. Like their old
house, this one has four bedrooms, but all the rooms are much
smaller. Their distinguished furniture, much of it from Rafanelli's
family home in Florence, more than fills the space. ``It looks like
an antique shop more than a house,'' he said. But they are
adjusting to the smaller space, and thinking of doing some
renovations that will make the main floor more open and give the
dining room a river view.
</P>
<P>
   Their new house is just 15 minutes from the old one, but it
offers a completely different way of life. In the evening, they can
stroll down the hill to the village shops, maybe sit in a cafe and
watch the people go by. At their old house, they couldn't even go
for walks in the evening, because there were no sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the village life,'' Rafanelli said. ``I can buy bagels
without getting into the car. Here, you have everything you need.''
It reminds him of home. ``The village is everything in Italy,'' he
said. ``There is no such thing as suburbia.'' Calhoun, an
environmental consultant, calls it the ``anti-sprawl choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a radical change, and there are reasons that people
like sprawl. Here, their neighbors are quite visible. And sometimes
audible. ``The first morning we woke up, we heard somebody
coughing,'' Calhoun said. ``We had never been in a neighborhood
before. It's a little more intimate.'' Since they moved in, they
have only eaten indoors twice. Now, they can't just walk out to
their garden to pick some herbs, because they don't have one. But
there's a good gourmet shop nearby, and Rafanelli says he doesn't
really miss the battle of the garden, which he defended every year
against wildlife like coyotes and turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Talking and watching the river view, Calhoun suddenly looks
away, seeing something out of the corner of her eye. Then she
realizes: ``That was a bird. I didn't know if I would see any more
birds.''

   OCEANSIDE, Calif. _ Two years after Californians voted to end
bilingual education and force a million Spanish-speaking students
to immerse themselves in English as if it were a cold bath, those
students are improving in reading and other subjects at often
striking rates, according to standardized test scores released this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators had predicted catastrophe if bilingual classes
were dismantled in this state, which is home to one of every 10 of
the nation's public school children, many of them native Spanish
speakers. But the prophecies have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In second grade, for example, the average score in reading of a
student classified as limited in English increased 9 percentage
points over the last two years, to the 28th percentile from the
19th percentile in national rankings, according to the state. In
mathematics, the increase in the average score for the same
students was 14 points, to the 41st percentile from the 27th.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which represent the first attempt to measure the
new law's effects, are expected to have an impact beyond
California's borders, most immediately in Arizona, where voters
will be presented with a ballot initiative in November asking them
to outlaw bilingual education in much the same way that California
has. The California test scores are also expected to influence
Colorado, where a similar measure narrowly missed getting on the
ballot this fall, and in Massachusetts and New York, where
anti-bilingual forces are marshaling.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know precisely how much the erasure of
bilingual education contributed to the rising scores _ class sizes
in the second grade have also been reduced over the same period,
for example _ but the results are remarkable given predictions that
scores of Spanish-speaking students would plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of Ken Noonan, who likened the change in
his position on bilingual education over the last two years to a
religious conversion. Noonan, who founded the California
Association of Bilingual Educators 30 years ago and who is now the
school superintendent in this city 35 miles north of San Diego, was
among those who warned in 1998 that children newly arrived from
Mexico and Central America would stop coming to school if they were
not gradually weaned off Spanish in traditional bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would hurt kids,'' Noonan said of the ballot
initiative, which was called Proposition 227. ``The exact reverse
occurred, totally unexpected by me. The kids began to learn _ not
pick up, but learn _ formal English, oral and written, far more
quickly than I ever thought they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read the research and they tell you it takes seven
years,'' added Noonan, a Californian whose Mexican mother never
learned English. ``Here are kids, within nine months in the first
year, and they literally learned to read.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Noonan need not look further than his own district,
where, in a mirror of the state, one of every four students, or
more than 5,000, is classified as limited English proficient.
Oceanside was among the most diligent school districts in the state
in adhering to the new law, and recorded some of the biggest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In the second grade in Oceanside, for example, the average
reading score of students initially classified as limited English
jumped 19 percentage points over the last two years _ to the 32nd
percentile from the 13th, according to preliminary state figures.
Only in the 10th and 11th grades, in a reflection of the entrenched
language problems of teen-age Spanish speakers statewide, were the
increases below 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanside's performance was all the more striking when measured
against the nearby district of Vista, where half the limited
English speakers _ about 2,500 students _ were granted waivers by
the superintendent to continue in bilingual classes. In nearly
every grade, the increases in Oceanside were at least double those
in Vista, which is similar in size and economic background to
Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the results so far in California represent a
tentative affirmation of the vision of Ron Unz. Unz is the Silicon
Valley entrepreneur who almost single-handedly financed and
organized the initiative that has all but eliminated bilingual
education in California, in which students were taught math, social
studies and science in their native language until they gradually
picked up English. (Students who now wish to be taught in such
classes must seek a waiver from their districts, on the grounds
that they would otherwise be educationally or psychologically
harmed by the pace of the English immersion class.)
</P>
<P>
   Unz, who has played an active role in the Arizona effort, said
he had been dismayed to read several years ago that students across
California were languishing in bilingual classes for six years or
more, routinely failing to graduate. He also found that there was
little research that supported bilingual education, which had been
developed in Congress in the 1960s, at least in part, as a means to
send federal aid to poor Southwestern school districts. Even
supporters concede it soon became entrenched as a way to pay the
salaries of thousands of bilingual teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test scores these last two years have risen, and risen
dramatically,'' Unz said in a telephone interview. ``Something has
gone tremendously right for immigrants being educated in
California.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Oceanside, as in many districts in the state, the
elimination of bilingual education has been accompanied by other
changes, making its impact hard to gauge with precision. Class
sizes in the lower elementary grades have been pared to 20, from
more than of 30 two years ago, with an infusion of state aid. For
the most intransigent readers, Spanish speakers chief among them,
an old-fashioned, sound-it-out, phonics approach to teaching
reading has replaced whole language, a more progressive approach
that encourages students to use context clues to extract meaning,
sometimes at the expense of pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   With so many variables introduced at once, Kenji Hakuta, a
professor of education at Stanford University, argued that few
conclusions about bilingual education could be drawn from the
results, other than that ``the numbers didn't turn negative,'' as
many had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Hakuta said said that given a new emphasis on testing statewide,
some districts are clearly teaching to the exams. Scores are up
across the board in nearly all grades, though rarely as sharply as
in Oceanside.
 &UR;  &LR; He said that districts like Oceanside were posting such sizable
gains, in part, because their previous scores had been so abysmally
low _ and remained so.
</P>
<P>
   While the school districts are required to implement the new
law, it is difficult to ascertain to what degree they have been
teaching their Spanish-speaking students in English. The law
requires only that teachers instruct ``overwhelmingly'' in English.
But that is often easier to do in third grade, when the subject is
multiplication, than in 11th grade, where it might be trigonometry.
The state has mounted little effort to measure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his initial, personal opposition to the new law, Noonan
of Oceanside said that he was insistent that his district, in a
city of 152,000 whose residents range from migrant farmers to naval
officers to dot-com millionaires, would strictly follow the will of
the voters and teach Spanish-speaking students exclusively in
English.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, Noonan's district makes an interesting case study.
</P>
<P>
   Though the state permitted districts the discretion to grant
waivers, Noonan took a hard line. Of 5,000 students in the district
who, according to a basic skills test, were found to have limited
English proficiency, 150, or 3 percent, sought waivers; only 12
were granted.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in the nearby district of Vista, where parents
supporting bilingual education have created a powerful advocacy
group, about one of every two students sought a waiver from the new
law, and all such requests were granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy,'' said Dave Cowles, the Vista superintendent,
``is that we give the parent the information about the benefits and
the downside of the bilingual program, and then let them decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, for the first time in recent memory, Oceanside is
outpacing its archrival Vista.
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, the average score of third-graders who primarily
speak Spanish improved by 11 percentage points in reading over the
last two years, to the 22nd percentile; in Vista, the gain was a
more modest 5 percentage points, to the 18th percentile. In fifth
grade in Oceanside, limited English speakers gained 10 percentage
points in reading, with the average score in the 19th percentile;
in Vista, there was no increase, the average score of limited
English speakers staying flat, in the 12th percentile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to comment on which ultimately works better,''
said Cowles, the Vista superintendent. Yet he added, ``If these
results are indicative of how students learn best, then we have to
take them into account when we talk to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, virtually all vestiges of bilingual education have
been disassembled, including at Garrison Elementary, a
stucco-coated building surrounded by eucalyptus trees, where nearly
one of every two students is a native Spanish speaker. There,
Leticia Cortez, a certified bilingual teacher, now teaches
mathematics in English to her Spanish-speaking first graders. She
resorts to speaking Spanish to a student only if he appears to be
in emotional distress, and then only to counsel him, not to
instruct.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Christian Dominguez, 7, whose broad grin
is usually flanked by deep dimples, but who cried for the first two
weeks he spent in Cortez's class, which he entered only days after
arriving from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I could talk in English,'' he recalled, ``was
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But nine months later, Christian is able to read short books
about dinosaurs and the cartoon character Arthur, while
understanding what he hears on his favorite television show,
``X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Says his mother, Rocio, 28, a baby sitter, ``I'm happy, oh,
wow!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is so much English being spoken by parents and
children and teachers in Oceanside that Gabriela Diaz, 8, who will
soon enter the third grade, has experienced an unforeseen
consequence of Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friends from Mexico come here,'' she said, ``I don't
understand what they're saying.''

 &HT;    Court could let Florida voters decide on high-speed rail
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than a year ago, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush derailed a
deal to build a French-style bullet train from Miami to Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Too expensive, too uncertain, Bush explained in January 1999
when he killed state funding for the $6.3 billion project
</P>
<P>
   Now retired businessman C.C. ``Doc'' Dockery is one court
decision away from letting voters decide the fate of high-speed
trains in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dockery met a deadline to produce more than 450,000
signatures from registered Florida voters. He is pushing a proposed
state constitutional amendment using a state statute that allows
citizens to put initiatives on the ballot if they get enough
verified signatures plus Florida Supreme Court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Dockery's attorney, a former Florida Supreme Court justice,
presented arguments to the state's highest court in June. If the
Florida Supreme Court complies with a request for an expedited
opinion, a ruling may come soon. A passion for trains and a love of
Florida led Dockery, 67, to propose the amendment. He wants to help
unclog Florida's interstates, loaded with commuters and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Dockery, whose former company helped settle workers compensation
claims, said he would not profit by the amendment, which lacks only
state Supreme Court approval before landing on the Nov. 7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Since fall, Dockery estimates he's spent $1.5 million gathering
more than 600,000 signed petitions. He said he pushed forward after
positive reactions from four focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an investment, believe me. I've spent a lot of the
inheritance of my wife and kids. I'm just passionate about this,''
said Dockery, who served on the state's high-speed rail commission.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal would compel the governor and Legislature to begin
construction by November 2003 on a ``magnetic levitation'' train,
monorail or other high-speed ground transportation system that
travels on pathways separate from motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective ballot question says the speed of the system
should exceed 120 mph and connect the state's five largest urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's 1996 fast-train deal with private companies,
planners envisioned the so-called Florida Overland Express (FOX), a
train based on French bullet-train technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Dockery amendment encourages a look at all technology
available.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic levitation _ known to planners as ``maglev'' _ uses
magnetic currents to make train cars float on a guideway. Another
magnet propels the trains. Fully developed, such a maglev train
could exceed 500 mph, according to a report by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental maglev trains are being developed in Germany and
Japan. Wendell Cox, a former member of the Los Angeles County
Transportation Commission and a frequent author on rail policy,
wrote that high-speed rail in Florida ``would not materially
improve the environment, air traffic congestion or highway traffic
congestion.''
</P>
<P>
   FOX planners, Cox said, overestimated potential ridership and
underestimate potential construction costs. Florida needs bigger
and better roads to fix gridlocked traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said it would be wrong to construe Dockery's proposal as a
FOX resurrection, mainly because it calls for a speed of only 120
mph _ not truly high-speed rail, he said.

   French trains on which FOX would have been based could attain
220 mph or better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 220 mph doesn't solve the problems, then a 120 mph train
isn't going to do it,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal General Accounting Office last year reported FOX
construction could run up to at least $8 billion. The GAO said
ridership might never be enough to offset operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The FOX cost included $70 million a year from the Legislature
for 40 years.

   Last year, Bush said, ``The only way I could see for this thing
to work would be for the state to accept greater and greater
liability, which was never the intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Dockery argued that through the referendum, Bush could develop a
high-speed system ``as expensive as he wants it to be or as
inexpensive as he wants it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dockery said Bush sent him an e-mail on the proposal, calling it
``interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the sum total of what he had to say to me,'' said
Dockery, a Republican supporter and a former lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials did not return requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial structure of this deal was not viable,'' the
governor said last year. ``I am absolutely convinced of that.''

BUSH VOWS TO SEEK FEDERAL AID TO REPAIR INDIAN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Tenn., Texas)   (Eds: Subs to update with Bush unveiling proposal.) 
By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Campaigning here and across the border in New Mexico,
Gov. George W. Bush unveiled a new education initiative Saturday, a
call to spend more than $800 million to repair crumbling schools on
the country's Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, would spend the money
on the 185 schools on tribal lands throughout the country, most of
them managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a federal agency, his
aides said. His proposal calls for an additional $126 million to
replace the system's worst six schools, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The money involved is relatively little, at least when compared
with other education initiatives that Bush and his rival, Vice
President Al Gore, have already made during the campaign. But it
allows Bush to sustain his focus on education _ an issue perhaps
more traditionally associated with Democrats, but one that he has
said will be his main topic of discussion in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is largely through education proposals that Bush has styled
himself as a so-called compassionate conservative, and staked his
claim to the center of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragically, schools on tribal lands are often in poor physical
condition and lack basic resources,'' Bush said in a statement
released Saturday. ``The federal government has a front-line
responsibility to fix these schools and provide an environment in
which children can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already proposed spending $5 billion on a national
literacy program, while Gore has called for spending $115 billion
on education initiatives over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And education is where the two campaigns have one of their
sharpest disagreements, over whether the government should provide
vouchers so poor families can send their children to private
schools. Bush strongly supports the idea, saying it will spur
competition, while Gore says that it will undermine public
education in the country by draining needed resources away from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the trail Bush sometimes likes to joke that he is not running
for national principal or federal superintendent of schools, saying
that decisions about education are best left to localities. But the
schools on tribal lands are a special case: Because of longstanding
treaties between Indian nations and the government, they are among
the few schools in the country managed directly by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   A rally Saturday morning at Southern Methodist University was
the second part of a two-day campaign trip in which Bush is seeking
to temper any momentum Gore gained at the Democratic National
Convention. The itinerary itself was a dig at Gore. First Bush
traveled to Tennessee on Friday to highlight the fact that some
polls now show him leading Gore in Gore's home state. Saturday's
rally in Dallas, his aides said, would show how strongly Bush, the
Texas governor, is supported in his own home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the people who know them best,'' read signs printed
for the events.

NEW SURVEY OF PROPERTY CAN HELP HOME BUYERS AVOID SNAGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface words should be set in italics.) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good fences make good neighbors, right?
</P>
<P>
   But suppose your neighbor puts  &UR; his &LR;  fence on  &UR; your &LR;  property?
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens more frequently than most people think,'' said
William Selsberg, a Stamford, Conn., real estate lawyer. ``That's
why I always advise clients to get a new survey when they're buying
property. The problem is that only about 40 percent of them take my
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Selsberg and other real estate lawyers say that any
boundary-line dispute _ including those involving misplaced fences,
sheds, shrubs, gardens, decks, pools, patios and driveways _ should
be addressed promptly and if possible resolved before closing to
avoid expensive, drawn-out backyard feuds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's going to be a problem with a property line, I want
to know about it before the closing takes place,'' Selsberg said.
``The last thing a lawyer wants to do is represent someone in a
closing and then have them end up in litigation five or 10 years
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, he said, boundary-line problems can be readily
identified if the buyer obtains a new survey of the property before
the purchase. That is something many buyers are unwilling to do,
because a survey can cost $800 to $1,500 or more. Unfortunately,
Selsberg said, most lenders do not require a new survey as a
condition of providing a mortgage. Instead, lenders will often
accept an old survey if it is accompanied by an affidavit from the
seller indicating that there have been no changes since the prior
survey. The problem with that, Selsberg said, is that while sellers
may make such representations honestly, they may not be making them
accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people believe they know where their boundary lines
are,'' he said. ``But then the day comes when they want to sell the
house, the new buyer gets a new survey, and they suddenly find out
that their neighbor's vegetable garden has been on their property
for the last 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Under ideal circumstances, Selsberg said, such problems can be
resolved with little more than a neighborly chat. But what happens
when there is bad blood between the two neighbors, or when the
neighbor who originally planted the garden moved and sold the house
to a new owner who now truly believes he is planting in dirt he
owns? And what happens if, instead of a garden, the neighbor has
erected a shed, a patio, a deck or even a pool?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you end up in litigation,'' Selsberg said. ``I had
a client in Westport who decided to clear some trees out of his
backyard. Unfortunately, he cleared some trees out of his
neighbor's yard, too. We ended up settling the case for $20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   John G. Hall, a real estate lawyer in New York's Staten Island,
said that in most cases the severity of a boundary-line
encroachment _ the legal term used to describe one property owner's
use of an adjoining owner's property _ depends on the degree of the
encroachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate, an encroachment of a foot or two may not be as
serious as a six-inch encroachment in the suburbs,'' he said. ``But
in Manhattan, an encroachment of an inch and a half could be a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   A serious encroachment, Hall said, could render title to the
property technically ``unmarketable.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that unless a prospective buyer agrees to buy the
property ``subject to'' the encroachment, the buyer could decline
to conclude the purchase unless the encroachment is removed. And
that could be a problem if the encroaching property owner is not
inclined to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Brav, president of Good Deed Abstract, a title agency
in Valley Stream, N.Y., said that it was prudent to resolve
boundary-line issues even when an encroachment did not seem to
bother either owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a friend who bought a house, didn't do a new survey, and
found out only after he moved in that the fence he thought was on
his property was really a foot and a half onto the property of the
lady next door,'' Brav said. ``And although the lady didn't mind
having his fence on her property, when she died and a builder
bought the land, the builder quickly notified my friend that the
fence had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major property-line problem, Brav said, can occur when
adjoining owners use the same driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most driveway easements are reciprocal agreements that are
spelled out in both deeds,'' he said, explaining that a reciprocal
easement occurs when each property owner grants the other the right
to use part of his or her land. ``But in some cases, there's
nothing in writing and nothing in the deeds, and that's where you
get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Brav said, if a person is buying property and it is
clear that it will be necessary to use part of a neighbor's
driveway to get to a garage or parking area, the purchaser should
ensure that there is something in writing _ preferably in the deed
to the property _ giving him the right to use the driveway. In
fact, he said, even if there is an easement specified in the deed,
the purchaser should try to determine whether there are any special
conditions or agreements that govern the use of the neighbor's
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be issues of maintenance or repair of the driveway
that have been worked out between the former owner and the
neighbor,'' he said. While such agreements may not affect title to
the property, he said, they could have an impact on the
relationship between the new neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to have a survey conducted when buying property
is to determine whether all of the improvements on the property
being bought are legal, within the property lines and do not
encroach on the neighbor's property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what a previous owner may have done with a
property that could later cause problems,'' said William Trang, an
engineer with the Staten Island surveying firm of Wohl &AMP; O'Mara.
Besides showing property lines, Trang noted, a survey also shows
the location of pools, decks fences and anything else that has been
added to the property.
</P>
<P>
   One common problem that purchasers encounter, he said, is buying
a house with a deck built without the required permits. ``It's not
only the size of the deck that's an issue,'' he said, ``but the
height and location as well.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Trang said, it is not uncommon for decks built
without a permit to violate zoning code provisions that require the
deck to be a certain distance away from the side and rear property
lines.
</P>
<P>
   And while a new survey will not tell a prospective buyer whether
an improvement like a deck is legal, it does give the buyer's
lawyer the information he needs to obtain such a determination from
the local building department.

EDITORIAL: IMPRISONING THE WRONG MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 20:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders, a man with a history of mental health problems,
served more than two years in a New York state prison because he
shares a last name and a birth date with a violent criminal.
Despite repeated protests from Kerry Sanders that he was not Robert
Sanders, the escaped convict whom police were really after, no one
at any stage of the criminal justice system took even the minimal
steps needed to learn that the wrong man was in prison. Now the New
York State Department of Correctional Services is refusing to own
up to the negligence of its actions.
</P>
<P>
   The bare facts, chronicled by Benjamin Weiser in the Aug. 6 New
York Times Magazine, are not in dispute. Sanders was arrested in
Los Angeles in October 1993 after spending a night on a public
bench. The arresting officer and public defender say Sanders
acknowledged being Robert Sanders from New York, an escaped felon,
though he signed documents as Kerry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, neither in California nor in New York were Kerry
Sanders' fingerprints or photograph compared to those of Robert
Sanders. Nor did anyone on Kerry Sanders' mental health team at
Green Haven prison in Stormville, N.Y., raise questions about how a
prisoner with no previous record of mental health problems (Robert
Sanders) had become schizophrenic, and why a New Yorker kept
talking about his hometown as Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The real Robert Sanders was arrested in a drug bust in October
1995, and it was then that the state of New York realized there was
a man sitting in Green Haven who had not been convicted of a crime.
Sanders was returned to his mother in Los Angeles carrying $48, a
pack of cigarettes, a soda, some medications and deeper mental
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The family hired a lawyer, who has settled with Los Angeles
County for its role in this wrongful imprisonment. But in New York,
the case is headed for trial in federal court. That is an outrage
given the scandalous negligence and incompetence shown by the state
in failing to identify its prisoner properly. The state should
negotiate a settlement with Sanders that would acknowledge its
negligence, fairly compensate him for two lost years and provide
him with top-notch psychiatric care for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   On a heartening note, New York's attorney general, Eliot
Spitzer, has indicated to this page that he is open to the
possibility of settling the case. He said that a settlement would
not amount to a dangerous precedent for the state because the facts
in the case are ``so unique.'' One would hope so.

 ANGELS' ERSTAD HITS WITH ALL HE'S GOT
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darin Erstad decided to give himself a week away from
baseball at the end of last season, a major concession. His
instinct has always been to try harder, and he had just finished a
frustrating season in which he batted .253, and he wanted to know
why. He wanted to understand.
</P>
<P>
   But he forced himself to take a vacation. Seven days, he
determined.
</P>
<P>
   After four days, he pulled out videotape at his home in Fargo,
N.D., and began reviewing his at-bats _ all of his at-bats _
charting the pitches, searching for trends. When he finished the
1999 season, Erstad did the same for all of his at-bats in 1998,
and all of his at-bats in 1997 and in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who had tried to keep hitting as simple as possible,
believes he has developed a better understanding of his swing and
his approach, as borne out by his production this year.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad is batting .358, and with 189 hits and six weeks to play
in the regular season, he has a chance to approach the
single-season record for hits. George Sisler had 257 hits for the
St. Louis Browns in 1920, and if Erstad maintains his current pace,
he would finish the year with 251.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad had two hits Friday, including the game-winning home run
off Mike Stanton in the top of the 11th inning, as the California
Angels came back from a five-run deficit to beat the New York
Yankees, 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also saved the game for Anaheim in the bottom of the 10th
inning by making a spectacular diving catch in left-center field
with two outs and the winning run on third base; Roger Clemens
called it one of the three best catches he had seen in his 17 years
in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays so hard,'' Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said.
``He's a throwback. I don't think there's ever a day they can hang
his jersey in his locker. They've always got to throw it in the
washer.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when adolescents are often forced to specialize in one
particular sport, Erstad is something of a throwback. Growing up in
North Dakota, he played hockey and football and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what my best sport was,'' Erstad said, ``but I can
say I was most comfortable on skates.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball seasons were short, his instruction simple. Keep
your left elbow high when you hit, his father told him, the
standard advice given to all kids by their parents. Except that
Erstad turned out to be a better athlete than other kids, scoring
bundles of goals as a forward in hockey, punting for the University
of Nebraska on their national championship team in 1994. In spite
of his limited experience in baseball, the Mets drafted him in the
13th round in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad stayed in college and was the first pick in the 1995
draft. Yankees catcher Chris Turner was in the Anaheim organization
at that time and when Erstad advanced to Triple-A in 1996, Turner
and the others waited to see if Erstad was a prima donna, if he
would flash around his money. Erstad kept mostly to himself,
however, and played hard. Someone brought a hockey net into the
Vancouver clubhouse, just for fun, and someone donned the catcher's
gear and pretended to be a goalie _ not Turner. The puck they used
was small and hard and made of plastic, and Erstad's teammates
gawked as he peppered the fringes of the net with slap shots.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad jumped to the majors in 1996, hit .299 in 1997 and .296
in 1998. He was seen as a potential candidate for the most valuable
player award in 1999, but he started slowly and soon scouts
chattered about how he seemed to fight himself at the plate, how he
turned his intensity on himself and how it hurt him. It's the same
thing scouts once said about Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saying that people always give me is, `Try easier,''' said
Erstad, sitting at his locker in the visitors' clubhouse at Yankee
Stadium Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He looked his questioner directly in the eye and continued,
evenly. ``But I don't necessarily agree with that,'' he said.
``I've tried that, and I end up standing up there and not having
any intensity. You need to have an intensity, a calm intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think how to put this into words. It's almost
like a volcano _ calm, calm, calm, building, building, building.
And then you go to swing and _ bwap!''
</P>
<P>
   His hands moved, as he mimicked the motion of a swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go, tight, tight, tight, and then swing,'' he continued.
``It's got to be bop-bop-bop, and then you go. Every time you
swing, you want to feel like you're exploding on the ball.
Sometimes I do that too early. You see a pitch you want to hit and
you try to reach back for more or want to hit it further and
harder. I do that, especially on fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing all this, Erstad waited four days after last season
before diving into the videotape. ``People had told me, `Just
forget about it like it never happened,''' Erstad said. ``That just
never made any sense to me. So I said, OK, I'm going to stare this
thing in the face and figure out what the heck is going on. You
want to know: `What's going on out there? Why did I stink so
badly?'''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad does not possess the sweeping, arching swing typical of
left-handed batters; rather, he swings with a chopping motion,
almost downward. He made some mechanical adjustments he chooses not
to discuss, and tried to relax his approach. Rod Carew, the Angels'
former hitting coach, told Erstad repeatedly that he should ``take
what the pitchers give you'' _ in other words, if there is a tough
pitch outside, then hit it to left field, and if you get a good
pitch inside, then drive it. ``Maybe I was too stubborn last
year,'' Erstad said.
</P>
<P>
   He singled in his first at-bat this year, against the Yankees,
went 9 for 14 in that three-game series and batted .449 in April.
He has 62 multihit games, 12 more than any other American League
player.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said: ``He's an intense player, and after last year, he
came back and really found his confidence in April. He has just
battled and battled to the point where he's probably afraid to go
back to where he was.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANSIDE, Calif. _ Two years after Californians voted to end
bilingual education and force a million Spanish-speaking students
to immerse themselves in English as if it were a cold bath, those
students are improving in reading and other subjects at often
striking rates, according to standardized test scores released last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators had predicted catastrophe if bilingual classes
were dismantled in this state, which is home to one of every 10 of
the nation's public school children, many of them native Spanish
speakers. But the prophecies have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In second grade, for example, the average score in reading of a
student classified as limited in English increased 9 percentage
points over the last two years, to the 28th percentile from the
19th percentile in national rankings, according to the state. In
mathematics, the increase in the average score for the same
students was 14 points, to the 41st percentile from the 27th.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which represent the first attempt to measure the
new law's effects, are expected to have an impact beyond
California's borders, most immediately in Arizona, where voters
will be presented with a ballot initiative in November asking them
to outlaw bilingual education in much the same way that California
has. The California test scores are also expected to influence
Colorado, where a similar measure narrowly missed getting on the
ballot this fall, and in Massachusetts and New York, where
anti-bilingual forces are marshaling.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know precisely how much the erasure of
bilingual education contributed to the rising scores _ class sizes
in the second grade have also been reduced over the same period,
for example _ but the results are remarkable given predictions that
scores of Spanish-speaking students would plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of Ken Noonan, who likened the change in
his position on bilingual education over the last two years to a
religious conversion. Noonan, who founded the California
Association of Bilingual Educators 30 years ago and who is now the
school superintendent in this city 35 miles north of San Diego, was
among those who warned in 1998 that children newly arrived from
Mexico and Central America would stop coming to school if they were
not gradually weaned off Spanish in traditional bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would hurt kids,'' Noonan said of the ballot
initiative, which was called Proposition 227. ``The exact reverse
occurred, totally unexpected by me. The kids began to learn _ not
pick up, but learn _ formal English, oral and written, far more
quickly than I ever thought they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read the research and they tell you it takes seven
years,'' added Noonan, a Californian whose Mexican mother never
learned English. ``Here are kids, within nine months in the first
year, and they literally learned to read.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Noonan need not look further than his own district,
where, in a mirror of the state, one of every four students, or
more than 5,000, is classified as limited English proficient.
Oceanside was among the most diligent school districts in the state
in adhering to the new law, and recorded some of the biggest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In the second grade in Oceanside, for example, the average
reading score of students initially classified as limited English
jumped 19 percentage points over the last two years _ to the 32nd
percentile from the 13th, according to preliminary state figures.
Only in the 10th and 11th grades, in a reflection of the entrenched
language problems of teen-age Spanish speakers statewide, were the
increases below 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanside's performance was all the more striking when measured
against the nearby district of Vista, where half the limited
English speakers _ about 2,500 students _ were granted waivers by
the superintendent to continue in bilingual classes. In nearly
every grade, the increases in Oceanside were at least double those
in Vista, which is similar in size and economic background to
Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the results so far in California represent a
tentative affirmation of the vision of Ron Unz. Unz is the Silicon
Valley entrepreneur who almost single-handedly financed and
organized the initiative that has all but eliminated bilingual
education in California, in which students were taught math, social
studies and science in their native language until they gradually
picked up English. (Students who now wish to be taught in such
classes must seek a waiver from their districts, on the grounds
that they would otherwise be educationally or psychologically
harmed by the pace of the English immersion class.)
</P>
<P>
   Unz, who has played an active role in the Arizona effort, said
he had been dismayed to read several years ago that students across
California were languishing in bilingual classes for six years or
more, routinely failing to graduate. He also found that there was
little research that supported bilingual education, which had been
developed in Congress in the 1960s, at least in part, as a means to
send federal aid to poor Southwestern school districts. Even
supporters concede it soon became entrenched as a way to pay the
salaries of thousands of bilingual teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test scores these last two years have risen, and risen
dramatically,'' Unz said in a telephone interview. ``Something has
gone tremendously right for immigrants being educated in
California.''

</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Oceanside, as in many districts in the state, the
elimination of bilingual education has been accompanied by other
changes, making its impact hard to gauge with precision. Class
sizes in the lower elementary grades have been pared to 20, from
more than of 30 two years ago, with an infusion of state aid. For
the most intransigent readers, Spanish speakers chief among them,
an old-fashioned, sound-it-out, phonics approach to teaching
reading has replaced whole language, a more progressive approach
that encourages students to use context clues to extract meaning,
sometimes at the expense of pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   With so many variables introduced at once, Kenji Hakuta, a
professor of education at Stanford University, argued that few
conclusions about bilingual education could be drawn from the
results, other than that ``the numbers didn't turn negative,'' as
many had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Hakuta said said that given a new emphasis on testing statewide,
some districts are clearly teaching to the exams. Scores are up
across the board in nearly all grades, though rarely as sharply as
in Oceanside.
 &UR;  &LR; He said that districts like Oceanside were posting such sizable
gains, in part, because their previous scores had been so abysmally
low _ and remained so.
</P>
<P>
   While the school districts are required to implement the new
law, it is difficult to ascertain to what degree they have been
teaching their Spanish-speaking students in English. The law
requires only that teachers instruct ``overwhelmingly'' in English.
But that is often easier to do in third grade, when the subject is
multiplication, than in 11th grade, where it might be trigonometry.
The state has mounted little effort to measure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his initial, personal opposition to the new law, Noonan
of Oceanside said that he was insistent that his district, in a
city of 152,000 whose residents range from migrant farmers to naval
officers to dot-com millionaires, would strictly follow the will of
the voters and teach Spanish-speaking students exclusively in
English.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, Noonan's district makes an interesting case study.
</P>
<P>
   Though the state permitted districts the discretion to grant
waivers, Noonan took a hard line. Of 5,000 students in the district
who, according to a basic skills test, were found to have limited
English proficiency, 150, or 3 percent, sought waivers; only 12
were granted.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in the nearby district of Vista, where parents
supporting bilingual education have created a powerful advocacy
group, about one of every two students sought a waiver from the new
law, and all such requests were granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy,'' said Dave Cowles, the Vista superintendent,
``is that we give the parent the information about the benefits and
the downside of the bilingual program, and then let them decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, for the first time in recent memory, Oceanside is
outpacing its archrival Vista.
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, the average score of third-graders who primarily
speak Spanish improved by 11 percentage points in reading over the
last two years, to the 22nd percentile; in Vista, the gain was a
more modest 5 percentage points, to the 18th percentile. In fifth
grade in Oceanside, limited English speakers gained 10 percentage
points in reading, with the average score in the 19th percentile;
in Vista, there was no increase, the average score of limited
English speakers staying flat, in the 12th percentile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to comment on which ultimately works better,''
said Cowles, the Vista superintendent. Yet he added, ``If these
results are indicative of how students learn best, then we have to
take them into account when we talk to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, virtually all vestiges of bilingual education have
been disassembled, including at Garrison Elementary, a
stucco-coated building surrounded by eucalyptus trees, where nearly
one of every two students is a native Spanish speaker. There,
Leticia Cortez, a certified bilingual teacher, now teaches
mathematics in English to her Spanish-speaking first graders. She
resorts to speaking Spanish to a student only if he appears to be
in emotional distress, and then only to counsel him, not to
instruct.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Christian Dominguez, 7, whose broad grin
is usually flanked by deep dimples, but who cried for the first two
weeks he spent in Cortez's class, which he entered only days after
arriving from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I could talk in English,'' he recalled, ``was
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But nine months later, Christian is able to read short books
about dinosaurs and the cartoon character Arthur, while
understanding what he hears on his favorite television show,
``X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Says his mother, Rocio, 28, a baby sitter, ``I'm happy, oh,
wow!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is so much English being spoken by parents and
children and teachers in Oceanside that Gabriela Diaz, 8, who will
soon enter the third grade, has experienced an unforeseen
consequence of Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friends from Mexico come here,'' she said, ``I don't
understand what they're saying.''

 &HT;    BRITISH RESCUE TEAM ARRIVES AMID REPORTS SUB CREW LIKELY ALREADY
DEAD
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A British rescue team reached the waters above the
foundered submarine Kursk early Saturday evening, hours after a top
Russian navy official said that the 118 crewmembers aboard probably
are already dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the British team, equipped with a
state-of-the-art rescue mini-submarine, would proceed. British
officials have said that the team's only mission has been to save
lives, but it had become clear that this goal may have been
impossible even before they departed from Scotland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Commander David Russell, who is with the team, told the
BBC that his crew intended to proceed until they are certain there
are no survivors. ``It may be that it's a simply an impossible
task, but we're going to keep going until we know until there's
nothing more we can do,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   As the rescue team was approaching the site on the Barents Sea,
a top Russian navy official went on live television to tell his
country that the crewmembers almost certainly were all dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard as it is to say this, we will most likely have to say
that our worst expectations have come true,'' said Vice Adm.
Mikhail Motsak the head of the navy's general staff. He made the
statement sitting grimly behind his desk in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He said a colossal explosion sent the Kursk to the seabed in
seconds killing most off the crew almost immediately. A Russian
government commission investigating the disaster said the explosion
was apparently in the forward torpedo compartment, which was loaded
with up to 30 conventional warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the submarine hit the seabed at high speed, its torpedoes
apparently detonated,'' Motsak said. ``Most likely the whole of the
front section of the submarine has been flooded and the staff in
those sections died in the first minutes of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The surviving crewmembers tapped out messages on the Kursk's
hull after the accident describing their circumstances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew in the compartments in the stern were telling us that
water was filtering into their sections and they wanted us to
provide air supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``As water slowly filled the compartments in the stern the
pressure inside built up, inevitably reducing the life expectancy
of the crew and affecting their condition.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the air pressure in the non-flooded compartments
must now be intolerable. ``There are pockets of air but in fact we
have crossed the critical survival threshold which we set for the
crew according to our guidelines,'' he said. ``We've been crossing
this threshold yesterday, today and maybe tomorrow. That is how I
see the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, I want to say that the absence of any signals from
the submarine leads us to conclude that the critical point has been
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Motsak said the focus of the rescue mission was therefore
changing: ``I think that the essence of the second stage of the
operation we are conducting is to retrieve them, dead or alive, to
be able at least to give them their due on land.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the incident as ``the gravest disaster that I, as a
sailor, have known in the history of the submarine fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   Specially trained Norwegian divers are also on the way and are
expected to arrive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy said it was eager to receive the assistance.
``We hope that the British or Norwegian rescuers will manage to do
at least something,'' navy spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky told
reporters in Murmansk, near the submarine's base. ``Even if one
person is saved, that will already be a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, which arrived at about 11 a.m. (ET), was expected to
send down a remote-controlled, unmanned probe to carry out a
photographic reconnaissance of the submarine before launching the
30-foot LR5 mini-sub.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the only good news of the day, the weather in the
area had improved dramatically after whipping Russian rescue teams
with high waves and wind for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   Russian rescue teams have been gathered at the scene of the
accident for days, but high currents and zero visibility have
frustrated the rescue efforts. On Saturday, Russian rescue teams
failed to latch on to the badly damaged rescue hatch at the rear of
the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the
situation was 'beyond critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, commander of the Northern Fleet, said
there had been no contact of any kind with the submarine since
Monday despite repeated claims that knocking had been heard from
inside the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy had given wildly contradictory estimates of how
long the Kursk's emergency oxygen supplies could last, ranging from
a few hours to two weeks. But officials admitted they had no idea
of conditions inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have not determined precisely how the
submarine got into trouble in the first place. There have been no
reports of other vessels in the area with which the Kursk might
have collided. A likely scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's
forward compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the
area Aug. 12 at the time the Kursk was lost. A Norwegian seismic
center said the second blast registered at magnitude 3.5,
equivalent to a mild earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are distressed that the military was slow to
accept help and are angry at President Vladimir Putin for keeping a
low profile and staying on vacation at a Black Sea resort when the
vessel went down.
</P>
<P>
   Putin returned to Moscow from Ukraine early Saturday, cutting
short his trip to a summit of former Soviet republics. He said he
did not fly to the rescue site because it would have been a
distraction to the recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As bleak as the situation seems, it is impossible to rule out
the possibility that there are survivors, said a British submarine
expert. ``I have come across examples of men surviving a couple of
weeks in these kind of scenarios,'' said Commander Geoff Tall,
director of the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Hampshire, England.
``We still have to go for it. It has to be worth it.''

KNICKS, PRESSED TO MAKE CHANGES, CONSIDER EWING TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During their unsettling summer, the New York Knicks watched
Grant Hill ignore their welcome mat, failed to land free agents
like Brian Grant and Danny Fortson and watched their competition
get stronger. As a result, an organizational policy shift has taken
place, with the team pursuing deals to trade Patrick Ewing,
according to an Eastern Conference official.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Knicks officials would not comment on trade
discussions. But they have at least entertained the idea of dealing
Ewing before. In February, just before the trade deadline, there
was a brief conversation between the Knicks and Wizards that
involved Ewing. Ewing has a clause in his contract that gives him
the right to refuse any trade, but the Wizards would be a likely
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As a Georgetown University hero, Ewing is beloved in Washington
and would be received with open arms. He has never been granted
such affection in his 15 seasons without a championship as a Knick,
and he would probably be receptive to returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come to me with a deal, we'll talk about it then,''
Ewing said in an interview when the Wizards trade speculation arose
in February. ``Right now, all I can say is I'm playing for the
Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were heavy hints by Ewing that he could see
himself ending his career in another location. While he was
recovering from the partial tear in his Achilles' tendon early last
season and feeling more unappreciated by the organization and his
teammates, Ewing repeatedly mentioned Miami as a place he would
like to play.
</P>
<P>
   Now Seattle has emerged as a potential site for Ewing to play
out his career. Ewing has given the Knicks permission to shop him
and provided Knicks general manager Scott Layden with a list of
eight teams he would accept, The New York Daily News reported on
Saturday. Among them are the Wizards and Sonics. The Daily News
reported a deal for Sonics forward Vin Baker was being discussed.
The Sonics would likely be the more attractive team for Ewing,
considering that Seattle has the potential to be a playoff
contender.
</P>
<P>
   But any deal for Ewing is made cumbersome by the $14 million
salary he will make in the last year of his deal this coming
season. The Wizards would be in the best position to take on his
salary in an exchange that would involve Juwan Howard or Rod
Strickland going to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   With Ewing at the end of his contract, the Wizards would have
his cap space for next summer's free-agent crop. The only way for
Michael Jordan, the Wizards' head of basketball operations, to use
his cache to woo name players and build a playoff team is with cap
money. There is a catch, though _ Ewing is believed to want a
contract extension wherever he ends up. He has said he wants to
play at least two or three more years, a scenario few teams would
want to entertain for a 38-year-old. There could be a compromise,
though.
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing plays out his deal in Washington, the common
denominator between Jordan and Ewing _ the agent David Falk _ might
be able to assure Ewing a position in the Wizards organization
after he retires.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is speculation, though. At the end of the season,
an Eastern Conference official said trade scenarios concerning
Ewing were in the works. But Layden was unwavering in his support
of the beleaguered Ewing. At the time, the Knicks had just lost the
Eastern Conference finals in six games to the Pacers. The two games
the Knicks won in the best-of-seven series were the two games Ewing
missed due to injury. A year earlier, the Knicks went to the NBA
finals without Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   In June, just before Game 6 against Indiana, Latrell Sprewell
was asked if the team played better without Ewing. His answer?
``The numbers don't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, two days after the Knicks were eliminated in Game 6
with Ewing, Layden stood in the parking lot at SUNY-Purchase, the
Knicks' practice facility, and said: ``I believe in order to get
back to the finals, Patrick has to be part of the team. That's very
important. I think Patrick is a critical part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But two months later, after failing miserably to bolster their
team with free agents, watching Miami land Eddie Jones and all but
finalize a deal for Grant, the Knicks are in the mode to rethink
their position on Ewing. And Ewing, after all the years of being
blamed for every team failure, may be willing to acquiesce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some ways, Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden
president, foreshadowed such a potentially tumultuous end to
Ewing's career with the Knicks. In March, Checketts discussed the
future of Ewing with the team and whether No. 33 would retire as a
Knick. ``The fact is that whether he plays beyond his contract or
not, Patrick will be one of the greatest to ever play in the NBA
and certainly one of the best to ever play for the Knicks,''
Checketts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it will end. It's always tough. Was it time
for Dan Marino? Was it time for John Elway? Was it time for Michael
Jordan? When is a guy done physically? And when should he retire
because he is at the pinnacle? You can ask all these questions, but
it should be up to Patrick. And obviously, we'll have to play a
role in that decision.''

BUSH AND GORE PLAN AD BLITZES AS 80-DAY ELECTION DRIVE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Adds details on where Bush's commercials will appear and
content on education initiatives; Gore's strategies on Bush's
vulnerabilities.) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moving on several fronts to capitalize on the
afterglow from their conventions, the presidential contenders plan
next week to open the biggest television advertising blitzes of
their campaigns, in which Gov. George W. Bush will emphasize
education and Vice President Al Gore will trumpet himself as a
champion of ``working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they were preparing for the hectic 80-day
marathon to Election Day and had begun making critical decisions
about where to campaign and where to funnel resources, including an
infusion of nearly $68 million in federal subsidies each.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is seizing the offensive and plans to advertise and
campaign in historically Democratic states. Among the 21 states
chosen for an advertising drive that begins on Monday is West
Virginia, which Republicans have not carried since 1984. The
commercials will also appear in the Midwestern swing states of
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and states like Oregon,
Washington and New Mexico, where President Clinton prevailed in
1992 and 1996 but where Bush thinks his chances are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the point at which the campaign pivots,'' said Karl
Rove, Bush's chief strategist. ``Our focus has been preparing for
the conventions. Now we're making major forays onto the turf that
the other guy considers his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials lay out Bush's broad goals for education,
including greater local control of schools, stricter standards and
increased federal spending to promote reading and strengthen
teacher training and math and science.
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials said they would focus largely on the battle
ground states of the Midwest and make particular appeals to women
who seemed enticed by the Republicans. They also said they would
continue to cite Bush's record in Texas as demonstrating his
failure to tackle health care for children, improving the
environment, gun control and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle lines are drawn,'' said Robert Shrum, one of Gore's
leading strategists. ``Al Gore comes out of the convention much
more clearly defined to people. There's a choice on a thematic
dimension: Who's going to stand up and fight for middle-class
families on prescription drugs, a patients' bill of rights and
education?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said they were also working closely with
state Republican Party organizations to develop ambitious programs
to identify potential supporters and encourage them to vote. The
Gore campaign is making such efforts as well, but is more reliant
on unions to help drive turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Democratic convention, polls showed that Bush was
ahead of Gore. The Gore campaign's objective has been to build on
the publicity and good feeling from the convention to help Gore
pull even with Bush by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 and every presidential campaign since, the candidate who
was ahead in the polls after the conventions won the election. But
because there is an open race and both camps seem relatively evenly
matched, Republican and Democratic strategists predict that the
2000 race may be closer to 1980, when President Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan were neck-and-neck in the polls after the convention
_ and Reagan pulled out a victory in the closing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it can be anything but a competitive race,''
said Tom Cole, chief of staff for the Republican National
Committee. ``Our biggest advantage right now is our base unified
quicker than theirs. But that's going to happen at some point for
them. Then we're going to be in a very close race.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Gore and his vice presidential candidate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, Cole added, ``They're not going to go gently into
that good night.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the best
evidence of the competitiveness was in his state, which was
Clinton-Gore territory in the last two elections but now appears to
be a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush has every opportunity to win this election,''
Thompson said. ``To give you an idea, George Bush has already been
here three times and Al Gore has been here four or five times. And
both of them are going to be in Milwaukee next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said now
that the public might be beginning to pay attention to the contest,
Gore should hammer away at a theme he introduced at the convention:
how the policies of a president can touch the lives of ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people weren't watching this _ they were watching
`Survivor' or something else,'' Gephardt said. ``Al Gore should
articulate the stakes in this election and in people's everyday
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion needs to settle for at least several days before
polls can give an accurate picture of how the relative standing of
Gore and Bush might have shifted after the two biggest political
events of the summer: the national party conventions and selection
of running mates.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus in interviews with a variety of strategists
and campaign officials on both sides is that both campaigns did
themselves some good on both counts _ or, at the very least, did
not lose ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, a Democrat, said his initial fears
that Clinton's appearance would siphon attention from Gore had been
allayed. ``This whole issue of contrasting Clinton and Gore _ I
wasn't sure how this would all work out,'' Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to Gore's speech, he added, ``But I will tell
you _ with no disrespect at all to the president _ I thought
halfway through the speech, `Bill who?'''
</P>
<P>
   Though both conventions seemed to be helpful to the nominees, if
anything, strategists in both parties seemed to agree, Bush put on
a slightly better convention than Gore. Several experts said that
was because the Republicans seemed more harmonious and laid out a
broader message of inclusion. By contrast, many strategists said,
the vice president's convention was a bit more uneven and seemed
less successful in reaching beyond the party's core voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush had a better convention week, but not a better speech,''
said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials said they were pleased that during their
convention they had made significant in-roads in presenting Gore as
more than a vice president; as a nominee with a populist streak who
will energetically fight for ``working families'' _ a favorite Gore
phrase _ on a variety of issues, from health care to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   But even loyal Democrats here expressed some distress about Gore
and his difficulty in winning clusters of voters _ like women _ who
are historically inclined to vote Democratic. And they cited the
ball and chain of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that the people of America will not give him a
fair hearing,'' said Raymond Ensher, a delegate from Colorado.
``They continue to associate him, I think unfairly, with the
problems Bill Clinton has had.'' Ensher added: ``What really
worries me are the women. That really worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove, Bush's strategist, noted that Bush had already succeeded
in staking out issues that Bob Dole, the nominee four years ago,
did not dare discuss. ``Can you imagine if Bob Dole had stood up
and said, `I want to reform Social Security,''' he asked. ``The
race would be over. Can you imagine a Republican candidate saying,
`We've got to get rid of so many nuclear bombs?' We did it and got
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slightly better reviews for the Republican
production than the Democratic one, people in both parties said
Gore's choice of Lieberman seemed, at least in the short term, to
be better than Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, the former secretary
of defense, on the Republican side. That is because Lieberman, the
first Jew on a major party ticket, was greeted with euphoria among
Democrats and caused people to take more notice of Gore. The choice
of Cheney underscored Bush's determination to pick a competent No.
2 who would know how to govern. Yet it stirred little excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pick for him,'' Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said
of Lieberman. ``It generated some excitement and interest that
wasn't there. Cheney solidified Bush, but I couldn't really measure
what he's done broader.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback warned, however, that the Lieberman pick could come
back to haunt Gore. If the Democrats attack Bush for their
positions on Social Security privatization and education reform, he
said, Republicans can simply invoke Lieberman's record on those
issues, which is not too far from Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are also looking to the nationally televised
presidential debates beginning in October _ three are tentatively
scheduled _ to provide the last opportunities to scramble the
dynamic. Unless a candidate performs poorly, as Ronald Reagan did
in the first debate against Walter Mondale in 1984, debates usually
do not do much more than reinforce partisan allegiances. (Reagan,
however, improved his performances in later debates and went on to
win in a landslide.)
</P>
<P>
   The closer the race, the more influential the debates will be,
Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it affects only 1 percent that could make a
difference,'' he said, ``because I think the race is going to be
very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sturla, a Democratic state representative in Pennsylvania
who was a delegate here this week, said the debates would be
critical. But in the next breath he wondered aloud whether the
build-up of Gore as an accomplished debater _ and criticism of Bush
as lackluster _ could play right into the Bush strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans, knowing they will get crushed, have lowered
expectations so much that Bush would have to wilt and slither off
the stage,'' Sturla said, ``for his performance to be judged a
surprise and a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the debates, the candidates will mostly convey their
messages through paid commercials. Bush, who did not accept public
money in the primaries so he could exceed the federal spending
limit, has agreed in the general election to join Gore in financing
his campaign with federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign advisers and supporters seem almost preoccupied
over the possibility that the Democrats will begin broadcasting
harsh commercials that try to scare voters away from their
candidate _ all in a drive to gain an edge over Bush. The
Democrats, preferring not to portray the commercials as negative,
say they will not shrink from what they call issue comparisons.
Some Democratic operatives say it seems that the Republicans want
to goad Gore into a slash-and-burn posture so they can turn around
and paint him as mean-spirited, and then attack him right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore campaign will probably go pretty negative,'' said
Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, a Republican. ``It's important
that we respond right away to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers said their hope was that in the speech on
Thursday, the vice president diffused some of the concern that he
was not sufficiently likable, so voters were not more inclined to
warm up to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, for his part, conceded that Bush had a winning
personality that made it easier for his party to put on a moderate
face in Philadelphia. The hope, he said, is that people recognize
that a candidate's beliefs are at least as vital as personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good at public relations,'' Gephardt said of the
Republicans. ``They are good a manufacturing an illusion. They are
expert at it. They may succeed. But I hope they don't.''

 &HT;    FOX LAYS OUT VISION FOR A NEW FUND FOR MEXICO, MORE U.S. VISAS
FOR WORKERS
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When he visits the United States next week,
Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox will ask leaders to show ``a
vision for the future'' and seriously consider his ideas for ending
illegal immigration and spurring job growth here to prevent it, Fox
said in an interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas include opening the U.S. border to more legal
Mexican workers and contributing to an international development
fund with as much as $10 billion to $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not begging or asking for charity,'' Fox told Cox
Newspapers. ``That's not done between friends or partners. What I'm
asking for is understanding, intelligence, talent, a vision for the
future and an integral vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States has something, it's that kind of
talent,'' said Fox, who was once president of Coca-Cola in Mexico.
``And if the United States has done something in the past, it's
been to look at immigration with a vision. It is a country
constructed by immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, Fox _ who will visit Washington D.C. and Dallas,
Texas _ becomes the first Mexican president in 71 years not to
belong to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI in its
Spanish initials.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that his government, which breaks that monopoly on
power, has ``moral authority'' to propose new ways of tackling
tough problems like illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand that we are friends, neighbors and
partners, but we are very unequal neighbors and partners,'' Fox
said. ``We have to remember that Mexico lacks resources . . .
That's why my proposal is to create a very large fund that each
country will contribute to based on the size of its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox envisions perhaps using a poorly-funded bank established by
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a vehicle for
billions in donations from the United States, Canada and Mexico to
help invest in businesses in poor areas of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be for all countries, as is done in Europe,'' Fox
said. ``Certainly most funds would go to Mexico, and we are
certainly asking the United States and Canada to contribute more.
You ask more of big brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will arrive in Canada Tuesday for a visit and head for New
York and Washington D.C. on Wednesday. He will meet with President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
nominee on Thursday. On Friday he heads to Texas to meet with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's relationship with ``Texas is super intense,'' Fox said.
``It's not just commerce. The number of people (legally) crossing
the border is impressive. These are people who are active, people
who are contributing to the development of the region, people who
are working on one side of the border and living on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until today, I think most relationships between countries have
almost always between central governments,'' Fox said. ``And that's
a departure point. However, an intense relationship can't be forged
unless there are relationships established between states _ states
like Texas, with its magnitude, its economy and the great number of
Mexicans who are there.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Because he is not yet president, Fox said his visit is
``exploratory,'' and that he will meet with Gore or Bush again
after the U.S. presidential election. But he wants to get started
on discussing his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, he proposes opening the U.S.-Mexico border to
the free transit of workers, like the European Union. In the short
term, he'd like to obtain more legal visas for Mexican workers to
fill specific labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also supports a proposal for a new amnesty for undocumented
immigrants in the United States, which is being pushed by the
Democratic Party and U.S. labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, Fox noted, has said
that the United States needs more ``human resources.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those could easily come from Mexico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has suggested various time-frames _ including 10 years _ for
his vision of opening North America's borders to a free flow of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday he said he believes his idea would take longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a project whose final arrival could be 30
years down the road,'' Fox said. ``But all projects need steps to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening borders, Fox said, would probably require a pact of
``economic convergence.'' Mexico would have to meet goals of
reducing unemployment, increasing wages to close the gap with the
United States and controlling inflation.
</P>
<P>
   To help control drug trafficking through the border _ a problem
some say is a major obstacle to liberalizing transit _ Fox
suggested that the United States also work harder to reduce
consumption and money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new Mexican democratic government, the government of
Vicente Fox, is going to wage the mother of all battles against
drug trafficking,'' Fox said. ``If we set goals for each year and
each month, and each (country) meets them, then in probably six,
eight or 10 years, we can end or at least reduce substantially the
problem of drugs and be in a position to open the border.''

IN COURT, FAMILIES SIT WAITING ON THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the cramped law library on the top floor of Kings
County Family Court, in Brooklyn, the day begins with frilly
dresses, wide grins and cheers of congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old twig of a boy, an orphan since birth, gets parents
of his own. A pair of brothers _ one 20 and disabled, the other 10,
with eyes like darts _ are adopted by the quiet couple who took
them in seven years ago. A 5-year-old girl with a lispy whisper of
a voice gets a new name.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen or so adoptions completed on this morning represent
the rare moments of brightness in this theater of boredom and
despair _ not least because they have been so long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   The woman adopting the 5-year-old girl, for instance, has been
waiting to do so ever since the birth of the child, who was left by
her 13-year-old biological mother in a hospital. The woman, whose
name was not revealed, because of confidentiality laws on adoption,
could almost feel the birth pains, she said. She has cared for the
baby ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gimme a kiss!'' she demands, showing the girl the adoption
papers. The girl climbs on top of her, smothering her face and arms
with kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting is the leitmotif of Family Court. Well before court
begins at 9 a.m., hundreds of men, women and children line up to
pass through a metal detector. Then they line up to get on an
elevator. Then they wait to see a judge. Sometimes they wait past
sundown.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week it seemed fitting that the clock in the
waiting room in front of the intake court _ Family Court's
emergency room _ was over two hours slow.
</P>
<P>
   On this day the hard wooden benches were packed in this
windowless waiting room in the courthouse. The water fountain on
this floor didn't work. The women's bathroom lacked the luxuries of
many restrooms _ no diaper-changing stations, no toilet-seat
covers, only one functioning stall.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of people in the waiting room on this day had
brought something to read. Most of the others stared into space. A
few rested their heads on their arms in an effort to sleep, which
seemed impossible in the din. Children wailed. Every now and then,
someone became agitated and started muttering or yelling. Every few
seconds, a court officer bellowed the name of the next person to
appear before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a circus,'' declared Debra Benders, 40, who was
seeking custody of her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only what you're going through, but what everybody
else is going through,'' said Urcelina Ortiz, who was there to try
to prevent her son, accused of selling drugs, from being locked up.
(Family Court handles most criminal charges against children under
16.)
</P>
<P>
   She watched another mother, whose son was released from custody,
burst into tears. She stared at a woman covered with bruises. It
was a painful reminder for Ortiz, 41, who years ago had come into
this courthouse seeking an order of protection from her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Caver, 29, a slight, soft-spoken mother of four, arrived at
10 a.m. to try to prevent the termination of her parental rights.
Her children had been placed in foster care four years ago, when
she was diagnosed with manic-depressive disorder. Since then, she
said, she had tried to do all that was asked of her _ taking
medication, attending therapy. Mostly she had waited for the legal
system to return her children.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, she and her husband, Burnard Hayes, 36, spent the
hours holding each other tightly on a bench, dozing on each other's
shoulders. Not until 5 p.m. did she learn that her case would be
adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Some people call Family Court the candy store of melodrama. But
it is also a theater of the most ordinary betrayals, the place
where the most intimate details of domestic life are revealed,
where the violations of trust and love between men and women,
parents and children are scrutinized by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Family Court, with a branch in every borough, offers a lopsided
demographic picture of the city. Most of those passing through it
are poor. More than half are black, according to a study by the
Vera Institute of Justice, and more than 40 percent are Hispanic.
Only 7 percent are white, and 1 percent are Asian.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inside Room 276, the intake courtroom, a fluorescent light
flickered disconcertingly. Every time the doors opened and the
court officers yelled a name, they practically drowned out Lee
Elkins, the quiet-spoken judge handling a roster of 183 cases that
day. The telephone rang. Lawyers chatted with each other, and when
the murmur grew too loud, a court officer yelled ``Order!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come into this courthouse, see the facility, suffer the
long wait, if you're talking about the most intimate details of
your life and doors are opening around you and people are harried,
it has to give you the impression that your dignity as a person is
not respected,'' Elkins said. ``If anything, Family Court should be
the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical state of the courthouse alone, he added,
exacerbates what is already a distressing situation. ``It's
uncomfortable, it's hot, there's no privacy, the noise level,'' he
said. ``If anything, we need an environment that makes people
calmer.'' (A new courthouse is scheduled to be built, but work has
not yet started on it.)
</P>
<P>
   When he is not assigned to intake, Elkins, known for his
reflective demeanor, handles 25 to 30 cases a day, all involving
the perilous decisions of child protection: whether to return
children to a mother who beat her son with a hanger; whether to
hand over a toddler to a mother with acute depression.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is the urgency imposed by a new federal adoption law;
a child who has been in foster care for 15 of the previous 22
months must be either freed for adoption or reunited with parents.
Few believe the city's Family Court system will be able to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Family Court caseloads are growing faster than those of any
other court, state officials say. More than 232,000 cases were
handled last year citywide by 42 judges, a caseload that has
tripled in the last 20 years. On this day, Elkins' work began,
happily, with the adoption certifications at 9:30 a.m. It didn't
end until well past 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Vera Institute found that three-fourths of the
people interviewed were still waiting, after three hours, to see a
judge. They had been to court an average of 4.7 times.

EDITORIAL: GUATEMALA'S MISSING CHILDREN  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Probably thousands of children disappeared in Guatemala's
36-year civil war, the vast majority taken by the security forces,
typically after the army had attacked a Mayan Indian village and
massacred many of its inhabitants. While most of the children were
probably killed, there is reason to think that many of the younger
children were adopted illegally by soldiers or taken to orphanages
and later adopted by families in other countries, including the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of abducted children has become a major issue in
Argentina, where mothers and grandmothers of children who
disappeared during the ``dirty war'' of the 1970s brought this
horror to international attention. In El Salvador, a
nongovernmental group, Pro-Busqueda, has reunited dozens of
children with their biological families. But with war increasingly
fought in villages instead of battlefields, more nations need to
find abducted children and connect them to their families.
</P>
<P>
   The war ended in 1996, but Guatemalans are only now beginning to
realize the dimensions of this problem. The Archdiocese Human
Rights Office of Guatemala City's Roman Catholic Church recently
released a report that documents the cases of 86 children who
disappeared and lists hundreds more. Independently, a new group
called Watch (watchproj(at)aol.com) is being set up in Guatemala
and Chicago, to collect information and begin efforts to find
children. But the archdiocese office, like the nation's truth
commission, which published its report last year, urges that the
government set up an organization. A governmental group would be
best at spreading the word to Mayan communities that vanished
children might be alive and also at ensuring the safety of families
who look for them. More important, only a governmental group can
combat the obstruction of the armed forces, which has been a
problem in Argentina and El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   President Alfonso Portillo seems more willing than his
predecessor to help victims of the war. Guatemala has announced
that it will admit state responsibility, pay reparations and push
for justice in 60 cases of atrocities that Guatemalan groups had
taken to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. This is
groundbreaking, but justice may remain an empty promise, given that
the still-powerful military is defiant and human rights activists
continue to be intimidated and killed. A priority for investigation
should be the children who have disappeared. This is one instance
where those presumed dead could indeed be brought back to life.

 &HT;    FOX LAYS OUT VISION FOR A NEW FUND FOR MEXICO, MORE U.S. VISAS
FOR WORKERS
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When he visits the United States next week,
Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox will ask leaders to show ``a
vision for the future'' and seriously consider his ideas for ending
illegal immigration and spurring job growth here to prevent it, Fox
said in an interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas include opening the U.S. border to more legal
Mexican workers and contributing to an international development
fund with as much as $10 billion to $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not begging or asking for charity,'' Fox told Cox
Newspapers. ``That's not done between friends or partners. What I'm
asking for is understanding, intelligence, talent, a vision for the
future and an integral vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States has something, it's that kind of
talent,'' said Fox, who was once president of Coca-Cola in Mexico.
``And if the United States has done something in the past, it's
been to look at immigration with a vision. It is a country
constructed by immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, Fox _ who will visit Washington D.C. and Dallas,
Texas _ becomes the first Mexican president in 71 years not to
belong to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI in its
Spanish initials.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that his government, which breaks that monopoly on
power, has ``moral authority'' to propose new ways of tackling
tough problems like illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand that we are friends, neighbors and
partners, but we are very unequal neighbors and partners,'' Fox
said. ``We have to remember that Mexico lacks resources . . .
That's why my proposal is to create a very large fund that each
country will contribute to based on the size of its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox envisions perhaps using a poorly-funded bank established by
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a vehicle for
billions in donations from the United States, Canada and Mexico to
help invest in businesses in poor areas of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be for all countries, as is done in Europe,'' Fox
said. ``Certainly most funds would go to Mexico, and we are
certainly asking the United States and Canada to contribute more.
You ask more of big brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will arrive in Canada Tuesday for a visit and head for New
York and Washington D.C. on Wednesday. He will meet with President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
nominee on Thursday. On Friday he heads to Texas to meet with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's relationship with ``Texas is super intense,'' Fox said.
``It's not just commerce. The number of people (legally) crossing
the border is impressive. These are people who are active, people
who are contributing to the development of the region, people who
are working on one side of the border and living on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until today, I think most relationships between countries have
almost always between central governments,'' Fox said. ``And that's
a departure point. However, an intense relationship can't be forged
unless there are relationships established between states _ states
like Texas, with its magnitude, its economy and the great number of
Mexicans who are there.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Because he is not yet president, Fox said his visit is
``exploratory,'' and that he will meet with Gore or Bush again
after the U.S. presidential election. But he wants to get started
on discussing his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, he proposes opening the U.S.-Mexico border to
the free transit of workers, like the European Union. In the short
term, he'd like to obtain more legal visas for Mexican workers to
fill specific labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also supports a proposal for a new amnesty for undocumented
immigrants in the United States, which is being pushed by the
Democratic Party and U.S. labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, Fox noted, has said
that the United States needs more ``human resources.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those could easily come from Mexico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has suggested various time-frames _ including 10 years _ for
his vision of opening North America's borders to a free flow of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday he said he believes his idea would take longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a project whose final arrival could be 30
years down the road,'' Fox said. ``But all projects need steps to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening borders, Fox said, would probably require a pact of
``economic convergence.'' Mexico would have to meet goals of
reducing unemployment, increasing wages to close the gap with the
United States and controlling inflation.
</P>
<P>
   To help control drug trafficking through the border _ a problem
some say is a major obstacle to liberalizing transit _ Fox
suggested that the United States also work harder to reduce
consumption and money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new Mexican democratic government, the government of
Vicente Fox, is going to wage the mother of all battles against
drug trafficking,'' Fox said. ``If we set goals for each year and
each month, and each (country) meets them, then in probably six,
eight or 10 years, we can end or at least reduce substantially the
problem of drugs and be in a position to open the border.''

VOCATIONAL SCHOOL TRAINING PROGRAM FAILS, AUDIT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After an auspicious start seven years ago, a program
designed to help vocational students find jobs after graduation has
fallen into complete disarray, according to an audit by the city
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Project Pathways, was started in 1993 by the
School Construction Authority as a way to funnel qualified students
from the city's vocational high schools into apprenticeship
programs in the construction trades. In its first years it was very
successful, placing 98 percent of the students in apprenticeships
within two years of their graduation.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the report from Alan Hevesi, the city
comptroller, the program was quickly derailed by mismanagement and
lack of oversight by the construction authority, the agency in
charge of building schools in the city. In 1998, only 38 percent of
the students were placed in apprenticeship training after
completing the Project Pathways program, and by early this year
only 3 percent of the students who graduated in 1999 had entered
the apprenticeship training.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of poor administration, a lack of monitoring, and
the failure to ensure that all parties were adhering to their
obligations, a program with a successful record for providing
valuable opportunities for the students in the city's vocational
high schools is being allowed to fail,'' said the report, which was
completed on June 28. ``This does a disservice to all the parties
involved with the program, especially to the students who, in good
faith, did what was expected of them in the program and expected
help with placements in union apprenticeship programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The construction authority, which is one of several agencies
involved in the program and has the primary responsibility for
administering it, issued a statement Friday praising the success of
the program. The response disputed Hevesi's conclusions and said
auditors had not fairly measured the success of the program, in
part because they focused on the placement rate for graduates
rather than on the number of students who eventually entered
apprenticeship programs.
</P>
<P>
   The authority also said a moratorium on new apprenticeship
programs issued by the state Labor Department reduced the number of
placements, but the auditors said the decline had begun years
before the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   The scathing audit comes at a time of declining enrollment in
the city's vocational high schools, even though construction
industry representatives have loudly and repeatedly complained of
shortages of trained workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the Board of Education is caught up in the move to
higher academic standards, which is very important, but the trap is
they forget about or neglect everything else,'' said Frank Carucci,
vice president of the United Federation of Teachers for vocational
and technical high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Board of Education said the city schools
intended to focus on vocational training, and said Chancellor
Harold Levy had scheduled a meeting with construction industry
representatives next month to discuss expanding the program.
</P>
<P>
   David Klasfeld, the deputy chancellor for operations, said
Friday that the board intended to maintain a route to ``the
industries in the city and to give kids the opportunity to get into
these long-term high-paying jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Pathways has only been a small part of the vocational
education program, and each year only a few hundred of the 25,000
students in the system were involved. Acceptance into the
senior-year program, which is offered at 10 of the city's 18
vocational high schools, is based on grades, attendance and
interest in the program. Students take a nine-week course to
introduce them to the construction trades, and when they graduate
from the program are given an opportunity to enter an
apprenticeship program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many students view the Project Pathways program as a
door-opening opportunity for a career right out of high school that
they might not otherwise have had,'' the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the audit, principals complained about a lack of
information for available positions and about long waiting lists
for those that were available.
</P>
<P>
   One union official said the program started failing to work well
after the first three years, the audit said. Another said he called
the construction authority ``several times when he needed
apprentices, and no one returned his calls,'' according to the
audit.
</P>
<P>
   The audit specifically criticized the construction authority's
record-keeping and its inability to match graduates with available
apprenticeship slots. Auditors also reported long delays when they
asked the authority to supply records for their review of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Project Pathways program may soon be replaced. The authority
and groups representing city builders and construction unions are
working on a plan for a new program run by a new nonprofit
organization, Construction Skills 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Debra Perry, a spokeswoman for the construction authority, said
the details of the new organization were being worked out by the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the construction
authority and the industry and union groups.
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Coletti, chairman of the Building Trades Employers'
Association, said the groups thought that a training program could
be run more effectively by a nonprofit group than by the
construction authority.
</P>
<P>
   Coletti said the original program lost its focus as the
construction authority gave increasing emphasis to its primary
task, building and repairing the city's schools. He gave the
authority credit for pioneering the training effort but said
greater reliance on private industry could produce a better system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down and asked the question `Is it really the role of
any public agency to administer a program of this nature?''' he
said. ``We needed to create a public-private approach.''

UNDERGROUND HEALTH CARE NETWORK CATERS TO IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When investigators shuttered a large, unlicensed
medical clinic that they said offered Chinese and Western remedies
here last week, they provided a glance behind a curtain that
shrouds an expansive underground health care system serving
hundreds of thousands of the city's immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   While the clinic, the New York Beijing Hospital of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, may have been more brazen than other centers _ it
advertised in a local Chinese paper and ran a Web site promising
care for a variety of ills _ it is only one of perhaps thousands of
clinics, herbalists, spiritual centers and makeshift medical
offices where many of the city's immigrants go for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied by a lack of health insurance, fearful of the medical
centers' potential connections to immigration authorities and
longing for familiar remedies dispensed by someone who speaks their
language, many of the city's immigrants have been driven to create
their own complex methods of getting health care.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape of their alternative medical sources is as vast
and textured as the city's immigrant population, comprising herbal
healers used by many people from the Caribbean and South and
Central America, voodoo priests frequented by some Haitians,
pharmacists who double as internists and doctors, from regions
ranging from Russia to India to Poland, who lack an American
license but set up shop offering some form of care to those who
seek them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole unregulated sector of medicine at work in New
York,'' said Dr. Francesca M. Gany, the executive director of the
New York Task Force on Immigrant Health. About 65 percent of the
hundreds of immigrants who responded to a survey said they used an
alternative source of care in addition to or instead of the city's
larger health care system, Gany said.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments doled out by these centers varied: herbal
remedies used to treat stomach aches and cradle cap; exorcisms for
patients with chronic stomach pain; amulets attached to babies to
ward off evil spirits and antibiotics that were dubiously obtained
and unwisely administered.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, patients who are new immigrants mingle in two
medical worlds, the city's vast array of hospitals and clinics, and
a second sphere, where folk remedies are obtained. A few avoid the
U.S. medical system entirely, believing they cannot afford it or
fearing the doctors, and rely totally on other healers. Others get
no health care at all, relying on home remedies until they become
terribly ill and end up in a hospital emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Sambrano, an immigrant from Honduras, said she inhabited
both worlds, depending on her needs. ``I think some plants work
better than medicine,'' said Sambrano, who was waiting to meet with
a spiritualist at Botanica Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   While many doctors say some folk treatments like herbs are
harmless and even beneficial, health care experts are concerned
that vast swaths of immigrant groups lack access to conventional
health care, and that other centers like Beijing Hospital the
closed by officials may be offering wholly unregulated medicine
they are ill-equipped to provide.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, patients may end up paying more for some care than
they could be getting at city clinics that charge on a sliding
scale based on income.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minds of our patients, alternative medicine is the
standard of care and what we do is alternative medicine,'' said Dr.
Guillermo Santos, the medical director of Betances Health Unit, a
community health center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poses two problems,'' Santos said. ``People may have
serious illnesses they may be trying to cure at home. Or they don't
tell providers what they are using out of fear.'' The center's
doctors try to stay current on the herbs that patients tend to use,
and have worked with neighborhood shamans, showing them how to spot
the basic symptoms of diseases like tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Some alternative centers clearly operate outside the law, like
the New York Beijing Hospital, which law enforcement officials said
gave thousands of mostly Chinese patients treatments they were not
authorized to offer. And pharmacies that hand out drugs without a
prescription are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Certain practices are as dangerous as they are unlawful.
Investigators were tipped off to the Beijing center when a patient
sued, charging that she became infected after workers there removed
an intrauterine device, according to court filings. Investigators
say they are looking into a similar clinic in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jackson Kuan, the assistant director of gastroenterology at
Flushing Hospital, said he occasionally sees patients who have
misused herbs on the advice of alternative healers. He said he
recently saw a Korean patient who had been given an herbal
concoction that led to fatal liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   And health care workers have been alarmed in recent years by the
increased use of mercury among Caribbean residents.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal centers usually operate far below the radar screen of
law enforcement, advertising mostly by word of mouth or through
subtle marketing in the language of their intended customers, an
increasingly diverse group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard just to become aware of the various services that
are being provided,'' said Wayne M. Osten, director of the State
Department of Health's Office of Health System Management. Osten
said the department closes 20 to 25 unlicensed medical centers a
year. ``We are looking to hire staff with those skills to better
police it, because as you get more and more communities it does
become a tougher problem to monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many healers operate legally, if on the fringes. For
instance, Gany and other experts said, some of the centers serve as
entrees to the larger medical world, where new immigrants are
directed to clinics and hospitals and assured that immigration
officials will not be notified if they use them.
</P>
<P>
   Further, understanding how immigrants use alternative centers
helps doctors better treat patients who do not share their language
and culture. ``I don't think these places are necessarily an
impediment to care,'' said Dr. Mary McCord, a pediatrician who had
an intern conduct a study of her patients' herbal use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get people to tell us what they are doing, we can
negotiate, because people do make choices,'' McCord added. ``They
might say `I have asthma but I have heard bad things about those
medicines so let me try honey and onions.' So maybe we can get them
to use honey and onions and something else. One skill in being a
doctor is to accept where people are coming from and to be willing
to negotiate according to their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The folk healers range greatly from group to group, neighborhood
to neighborhood, with much overlap. Caribbeans, Hispanics and
Russians alike use herbal medicine, although often in different
preparations. Russians, according to health care workers, lean more
toward vitamins. Shamans have different functions, sometimes
performing voodoo ceremonies for Caribbean clients, or doing what
they say is healing work with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese gravitate toward herbal treatments and acupuncture,
as do some Koreans. South East Asians often partake in yoga and
medicines from their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Each nation offers its own folk remedies, herbs and medical
concoctions _ like rose water for nerves; shark oil for various flu
symptoms; cordial de monell, a sedative mixed with oil, for
teething; or anise for nausea. These treatments are most often
purchased at botanicas, stores that specialize in herbal medicines,
oils and religious wares. At Botanica Santa Barbara, one can find
fresh rosemary, dozens of ointments, creams and oils to keep away
evil spirits, ignite romance or invite prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Garcia, a card reader, helps customers with personal
problems and does procedures with her hands that she says remove
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people go to the doctor and when it doesn't work,
come here,'' said Antonio Mora, the store's owner.
</P>
<P>
   But while many immigrants prefer folk or home remedies to
conventional medicine, far too many are shut out of the health care
system because they lack insurance or are unaware of what is
available to them cheaply, experts said. Roughly 40 percent of
legal immigrants are uninsured, said David Sandman, a program
officer at the Commonwealth Fund, a private philanthropic
organization. Among illegal immigrants, the number is far higher,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal welfare reforms contributed to the number of uninsured
by making even legal immigrants who arrived after August 1996
ineligible for Medicaid for five years. But New York also has
several systems in place to insure many immigrants, even those
lacking documentation. There is a Medicaid program available to all
immigrants for emergencies, a state-financed program for pregnant
women regardless of their status and a state insurance program for
children of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   However, many immigrants have no idea about these services, and
are cut off from any pipeline to them. Others are fearful that if
they use them, health care workers will tip off immigration
officials. And some groups shun public assistance as a shameful
handout they would rather live without.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the distrust many immigrants feel toward the
medical establishment. McCord said that many of her Dominican
patients have negative notions about asthma medicine. Santos said
many Jamaican patients shun hypertension medicine, preferring
herbs. And some Asians are afraid to have blood drawn because they
think it will only weaken them, said Dinah Surh, the administrator
of Sunset Park Family Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her center has gone to great pains, in fact, to attract
immigrant groups. It set up a mosque for Muslim patients to pray
in. Its clinical staff could pass for a small United Nations
mission. It offers acupuncture as one way of attracting Chinese
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The center went for other touches, Surh said. ``We wanted to
have a fish tank. Some Chinese groups said we need gold- colored
fish for good luck so we added those. But the tank is right below a
skylight, and they told us the good luck would go out of the
skylight. So we put a shade there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors said that thousands of years of herbal medicine is
nothing to sneeze at, and point to a highly increased interest
among American patients in Eastern techniques like yoga and
acupuncture. Indeed many large hospitals have adopted these types
of practices in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And conventional doctors have a few tips to learn from folk and
traditional healers, some experts concurred, like advertising in
various languages and getting the word out through community
groups. But still, many immigrants will always rely on a mix of
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use conventional medicine,'' said Ray Gongora, who
immigrated from Cuba in the 1960s and often turns to herbs. ``But
emotionally I don't get what I need. They give you blood test and
send you on your way, but if you're not prepared mentally, you get
depressed.'' &QL;

<P>
   If that sounds familiar, it might be because Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's choice of a new police commissioner is regarded as a man
much like the mayor himself. As commissioner and first deputy,
Kerik was charged with matching the decline in crime on the streets
with a decline in violence in the city jails, which were seen as
abysmal. By most accounts, he succeeded, transforming what had
traditionally been a chaotic department into one of the
best-managed agencies in the city.
</P>
<P>
   A former undercover narcotics detective, Kerik, 44, knows how to
navigate the streets. He received the Police Department's Medal of
Valor after a 1991 drug arrest in Washington Heights: a cocaine
dealer, cornered by Kerik and his partner, Hector Santiago,
unexpectedly leapt from a taxi and started shooting, hitting
Santiago once in the elbow. Kerik jumped from his car and chased
the gunman in a running gun battle into a housing project two
blocks away. The dealer finally collapsed, next to 6 kg of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago credits Kerik with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Bailey Kerik was born in Paterson, N.J., in 1956. He
dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Army, serving in the
military police and training members of the Special Forces in
karate (he holds a black belt). Later, after about four years
working as an investigator and a guard for Saudi Arabian royalty,
Kerik returned to New Jersey, where he became warden of the Passaic
County Jail. Kerik reportedly took a $27,000 pay cut to join the
New York Police Department in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik joined the New York Department of Correction in 1994 as
the director of investigations. He was appointed first deputy
commissioner in 1995 and commissioner in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik has since trimmed his ponytail and exchanged his street
clothes for suits. But colleagues say he is still nimble, and still
in touch with the streets. He consults subordinates, listens to
union leaders and subjects long-standing policies to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say one thing for Kerik, which is that he gives me an
open door,'' said Peter Meringolo, the president of the Correction
Captains Association. ``Unfortunately, that hasn't always been
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Meringolo went so far as to crown Kerik man of
the year, the only time a manager ever received the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Decisiveness is another trait Kerik is known for: Once he has a
plan, he executes it with determination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, convinced that the Correction Department's battered
buses were contributing to its negative public image, he declared
that only spotless vehicles be allowed off Rikers Island, the
city's largest jail.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik's biggest accomplishment has been the reduction in
violence in the city's jails, where inmates used to frequently
slash and stab one another _ and sometimes the guards _ with
homemade weapons. Brutality by the guards had also been reported,
as some took the offensive and began beating unruly inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, inmates were usually punished for violence with
time in special confinement wards, but Kerik began proceedings to
prosecute them for new crimes in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik brought to the jails a version of the Police Department's
Compstat program, in which practices are altered and resources
allocated in accordance with carefully monitored trends. In the
beginning, he used the program to stop much of the violence by
inmates. He then expanded the idea into a tool for holding managers
at all levels of the department responsible for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   The approach, called TEAMS, for Total Efficiency Accountability
Management System, is a semifinalist in an annual competition at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard that rewards
innovations in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik has told friends that he plans to expand the Police
Department's use of Compstat to monitor and improve not just
crime-fighting but community relations.
</P>
<P>
   Another area on which Kerik is likely to focus is reducing
expenditures for overtime work. Using his TEAMS approach, Kerik has
cut the annual overtime budget at the Correction Department to
about $50 million, or about half what it was when the jails seemed
to be exploding with violence in 1990. By contrast, the Police
Department's overtime costs have mushroomed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   According to critics, changes in the city's jails may have more
to do with legal pressure than the commissioner's desire to make
things better.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, his administration has been a very mixed
bag,'' said John Boston, the director of the Prisoners' Rights
Project at the Legal Aid Society of New York City. ``His candor was
refreshing, but I think his accomplishments have been somewhat
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some within the New York police force wonder whether Kerik will
find it difficult to command respect in a department that he left
as a detective third grade, the lowest rank of detective. Captains
in the department must have a college degree, but Kerik is pursuing
his now at Empire State College, where he is 24 credits short of a
bachelor's degree in labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik's friends say he is devoted to his 15-year-old son from a
previous marriage and to the baby daughter he has with his current
wife. ``Bernie Kerik brings new insight, new vision,'' said Lenny
Lemer, a sergeant with the Police Department who has known him for
12 years.

UPSHAW FINDS A HOME AS MANAGER IN THE `ADVERSITY LEAGUE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willie Upshaw, like any good catch-and-release angler, is
maintaining the delicate balance between playing his fish and
letting them go.
</P>
<P>
   In three years as the manager of the Bridgeport (Conn.) Bluefish
in the independent Atlantic League, Upshaw, who played 10 seasons
with the Toronto Blue Jays and the Cleveland Indians, has grown to
realize that there is a lot more to managing than filling out the
lineup card. He now understands that his players do not want to be
Bluefish for the rest of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the players to look at it as playing in the Adversity
League,'' Upshaw said recently. ``They have to fight back, play
hard if they want to get out of here and get to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing the best interests of the team with those of his
players has been the biggest challenge Upshaw has faced, not to
mention dealing with the nagging fear that he could lose his best
player to a major-league team at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating for me the last couple of years,'' he
said, ``but I try to win with the hand I am dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the Bluefish struggled early, compiling a 35-35 record,
but they have gone 21-12 since, and at 56-47 overall are in first
place in the North Division. The nine-team Atlantic League has no
formal affiliation with major-league baseball, but it serves as an
alternative developmental route to and from the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being healthy has been huge for us in the second half,''
Upshaw said. ``We could not put out a steady lineup in the first
half. Our hitting and defense have also improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw, now 43, was hired by Bridgeport in October 1997, mostly
because of his qualifications, partly because as a resident of the
neighboring town of Fairfield he was the sentimental choice.
</P>
<P>
   He was coming off major-league coaching stints, as a hitting
instructor with Toronto from 1991 to '92 and a batting instructor
for the Texas Rangers from 1993 to '94. He returned to the Blue
Jays in 1995 as the hitting instructor and was promoted to batting
coach from 1996 to '97.
</P>
<P>
   With the inception of the Atlantic League three years ago,
Upshaw put down roots in Connecticut. He and General Manager
Charlie Dowd have built the Bluefish into one of the league's most
successful franchises, fielding a winning team each season _ they
won the league championship in 1999 _ and drawing about 4,300 fans
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw now enjoys the sweetest things in both his professional
and personal life: running his own team and spending time at home
with his wife, Cindi, and their four children, Brock, Courtney,
Chad and Kendall. Nevertheless, he said he would love to manage in
the major leagues some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie would be able to succeed at the next level, because he
commands respect from all of his players,'' said Steve Schoenfeld,
the assistant general manager of the Bluefish. ``He would make them
check their egos at the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, under Upshaw's leadership, has developed a
reputation as a place for players seeking to work their way back to
the majors. The former Yankee Mariano Duncan played with the
Bluefish in 1999, and the former Pirate Jose Lind and Alex Cole are
regular starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with them a little differently,'' Upshaw said of former
major-leaguers. ``I try to get them to be leaders and to set
examples for the rest of the players. As the manager, I'm in a
position where they're going to listen to me. All I ask is that
they be on time and play hard. They have never taken advantage of
me. They know I'm not going to take a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bluefish have an inviting park; 10,000-seat
Harbor Yard is the independent league equivalent of Camden Yards.
Located in the middle of Bridgeport, Fairfield County's largest
city (population 141,686), the stadium, with moderate ticket costs
($5 to $11), convenient parking, state-of-the-art facilities but
minor-league coziness, provides a warm family feeling for Upshaw's
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great place for baseball,'' Upshaw said. And baseball
is the heart of the matter. So when Upshaw deals with players who
are not producing and, as a result, consider quitting the game, the
manager tries to point out the positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them the advantages of still being here, '' he said.
``Once they leave, they can't ask themselves woulda-coulda-shoulda.
They should stick around a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport hopes Upshaw does the same.  &QL;

RUSSIAN NAVY ALL BUT CAPITULATES ANY HOPE FOR SURVIVORS ON STRICKEN
SUBMARINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS to significantly recast lead to highlight more
definitively lack of any hope for survivors and includes detailed
speculation on explosion and subsequent events) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian Navy said Saturday that all 118 members of
the crew of the wrecked nuclear-powered submarine Kursk are now
probably dead and that in the frantic initial hours trapped in the
sunken vessel survivors signaled their comrades on the surface to
send down air because their sealed compartments were filling with
water.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men may have attempted what would have been a
suicidal exit through a rear hatch, a senior admiral suggested,
thinking that they could swim to safety and causing one of the last
dry compartments to flood.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of Russia's Northern Fleet,
said most of the sailors died in the first minutes after a
still-unexplained explosion sent the Kursk crashing to the seabed a
week ago. He reported his preliminary findings in a grim statement
broadcast on state television from the Northern Fleet headquarters
at Severomorsk.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, British and Norwegian auxiliary ships were steaming
over the horizon with a rescue submarine strapped on the deck of
one and carrying a team of Norwegian divers to join the recovery
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk disappeared last Saturday during maneuvers in the
Barents Sea. Western intelligence sensors and seismic monitoring
stations in Norway detected two underwater explosions in the area
of the submarine, with the second and more powerful blast
registering the yield of up to two tons of high explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Motsak, speaking from his desk without any prepared text, said
the accident ``was the worst catastrophe that I personally have
known, and the worst in the history of the submarine fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the navy was now investigating three possible causes of
the blast: a collision with another vessel or a World War II mine,
or some unknown internal accident that set off the explosion that
ripped through the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crew died in the first minutes of the disaster, he
said, just after the explosion destroyed the forward section of the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Motsak interspersed his factual presentation with descriptions
of the drama that has gripped Russia since Monday morning, when the
navy first reported the sinking. The rescue flotilla located the
battered attack submarine with twin nuclear reactors at 4:55 a.m.
Aug. 13 lying on the seabed in 350 feet of water, the admiral said.
Russian surface ships soon afterward detected noises from the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard noises by crew members acting in accordance with the
rules of organization of communication with sunken submarines,'' he
said. ``Analysis of the noises from the tail sections showed that
the crew members were telling us that water was coming into the
sections _ it was infiltrating _ and they asked us to supply air.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, in a separate news conference, the admiral acknowledged
that rescuers had been unable to supply the air to the sailors.
``That's a possible construction defect, on which we'll have to
work in future submarines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some crew members, desperate to escape the flooding, he said,
may have tried to open the rear hatch of the Kursk, causing sea
water to flood in and kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The systems responsible for a tight seal in that compartment
broke down,'' the admiral said, perhaps because ``some submariners
tried to leave the sub from more than 100 meters depth, which is
not envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Only deep sea divers, he said, can verify whether the hatch seal
has been broken. If it was, he said, then that would explain why
navy rescue vehicles that have managed to dock on the hatch have
not been able to evacuate water from the airtight corridor that
must be established for rescue to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, a navy spokesman said that a Russian rescue
submarine made a third dive to the Kursk around 8 p.m. in an
attempt to lock onto the hatch and open it.
</P>
<P>
   The British rescue submarine could make its first dive Sunday
morning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Motsak said there was extensive flooding that may have reached
all of the submarine's nine compartments. That would mean that any
sailors who survived the initial explosion had to endure conditions
including icy water that further compressed any breathable air in
the submarine to what he called lethal ``high-pressure pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Naval experts in the United States and Russia said a buildup of
air pressure inside any flooded compartments could have killed
members of the crew within a few days of the sinking. Any accident
in which you rupture high pressure piping is considered the most
dangerous, said Adm. Eduard Baltin, former commander of the Soviet
submarine fleet in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Motsak and Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov both said at a joint news conference that after the Kursk
was first disabled by explosion or collision at periscope depth, it
then lost ``longitudinal balance'' and fell into a steep dive. It
hit the bottom with such force that it might have detonated a
torpedo in one of the forward tubes, whose explosive equivalent is
roughly equal to the blast measured by Western seismic monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion probably ruptured high-pressure pipes in the
compartments, thus increasing air pressure, Baltin said. In
addition, the Russian and American experts said, intruding sea
water, itself under high pressure at a depth of 350 feet,
compresses the air in the closed spaces and can reach the lethal
state of 10 times normal atmospheric pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow flooding in the tail sections was taking place, which
inevitably shortened the time for the crew to survive there and
shortened the maximum time of sustaining life that we could count
on,'' Motsak said. ``It is possible that pressure in the
compartments is very high. There are air pockets there, but in fact
we crossed that critical line for the sustaining of life which is
envisioned in all the guiding documents. This line, in fact, was
being crossed yesterday, today and maybe tomorrow,'' he said
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any crew noises from the boat since Monday led
the navy command to conclude ``that the critical state of the
personnel has come,'' he said, adding, ``No matter how hard it is
to say this, it is quite likely that we will have to admit the
worst expectations.''

 MOSCOW: worst expectations. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The admiral's sober report was issued a day after President
Vladimir Putin returned to Moscow and cut short a vacation amid
criticism that he had neglected the stricken families and delayed
too long on a decision for foreign assistance in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Putin made no public appearance. Kremlin spokesmen
reported only that he met with his national security advisers and
discussed the status of the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Murmansk said there were still no plans for Putin
to travel to the area, where relatives again Saturday were shown on
local television mourning what now appears to be the certain loss
of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews have reported that when they twice docked on the
rear hatch and then tried to pump water out of the docking
corridor, water just kept flooding in. At first, navy officials
believed that deformed deck plates around the hatch were preventing
a tight lock. Now, Motsak said, they also believe that the rear
compartment under the hatch may have been flooded and so water was
rushing into the docking corridor from inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the explosion that proved fatal to the ship and
crew are still unknown, the admiral said. But a new possibility, he
said, was that the 14,000-ton submarine hit a World War II mine. He
said that between 1992 and 1999, six such mines have been
discovered in the Barents Sea, the most recent last September.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral said it was difficult to pronounce the crew beyond
hope ``because I have known the submarine's commander,'' Capt.
Gennadi Lyachin, ``for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I appointed him to that post,'' Motsak said. ``I went to sea
with him to inspect the training of that crew, and this was one of
our best crews.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the rescue operation would now move to the ``second
stage,'' to concentrate on penetrating the hull of the 490-foot
submarine to begin evacuation of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Motsak said that the navy would eventually raise the submarine
to remove its weapons and nuclear reactors from the seabed, but
that ``it may take time.''

O'NEILL ACCUSES UMPIRE OF RETALIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul O'Neill leaned on the railing in front of the
Yankees' dugout in the first moments after their extra-inning loss
to Anaheim on Friday night, glaring at the home plate umpire, Gary
Cederstrom, as Cederstrom passed on his way to the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you can sleep tonight,'' O'Neill said he yelled at
Cederstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't threaten me,'' Cederstrom retorted, according to
O'Neill, who was furious.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill often debates with umpires after balls and strikes, but
his rage with Cederstrom reached a higher level: He believes
Cederstrom called strikes on him in retaliation for complaints
O'Neill made in the fourth inning. ``The most intentional thing
I've ever seen in my life,'' O'Neill said. ``In 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, O'Neill griped to Cederstrom about a strike call
he had made. The two debated; at one point, O'Neill stepped away
from home plate. Anaheim's Ramon Ortiz threw a pitch that appeared
to be well outside the usual parameters of the strike zone, and
Cederstrom called O'Neill out on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was incensed, turned and argued with Cederstrom, until
both Bernie Williams and Manager Joe Torre pushed him away. For the
remainder of the game, the tension built between O'Neill and the
umpire. Cederstrom declined to comment; Torre did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing, it really is,'' he said. ``I didn't hear any
of the conversation, and I really didn't get into it with Paul. But
it certainly looked like Gary was bothered by something and sort of
pranced around a little bit. It's disturbing to me, the strike
zone, and you hope there's nothing more than that. There's a lot of
dignity in this game, and that's the way it should be. You have the
best people in the world doing their job, and you hope everybody
does their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cederstrom didn't throw him out, and he restrained himself in
that regard. He kept him in the game, and that was the important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have theorized throughout history that umpires will
retaliate, but it is extremely rare when a player suggests this
publicly. The Yankees have issued informal complaints against
umpires in the past. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager,
said he had no plans to ``pursue anything against Gary
Cederstrom.''  &QL; 
RIVERA SHRUGS OFF A BAD GAME  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mo Vaughn's three-run homer disappeared into the
right-field stands Friday night, Mariano Rivera had five blown
saves for this season _ one more than during the 1999 season, when
he converted 45 of 49 chances. Rivera, unavailable for questions
after Friday's game, spoke amiably with reporters Saturday,
accepting blame for the loss. ``That was ridiculous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked why he thinks he isn't as dominant as he was last
year, why he seems to have trouble keeping his fastball down on
some nights, and whether he should have taken a couple of warm-up
pitches Friday, just before Vaughn's home run; Vaughn fouled
Rivera's first pitch off the right big toe of catcher Jorge Posada,
who slumped to the ground for a couple of minutes before resuming.
Rivera waited on the mound throughout the delay, without throwing,
and Vaughn slugged his next pitch over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera responded to all of these questions in a similar fashion:
``Today is a new day,'' he kept saying with a smile, effectively
declining to contribute to the analysis. ``It's a shiny day, a
sunny day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera allowed just 43 hits and 18 walks in 69 innings last
year, striking out 52. This year he has surrendered 45 hits and 17
walks in 54 1/3 innings, with 40 strikeouts, and has 26 saves in 31
chances.  &QL; 
TWINGE PUTS WILLIAMS ON BENCH  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who played in the Yankees' first 118 games this
season, was scratched from the lineup after feeling a twinge in his
side during batting practice. The Yankees announced that the injury
was not serious and that he was not expected to miss any more time;
it may be that the twinge provided a convenient reason for Joe
Torre to give Williams _ who has been slumping a bit _ the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense he's a little tired, I do,'' Torre said before making
the lineup change.  &QL;

   OLY-SWM-JOSHDAVIS _ Four years ago, Josh Davis had to be the
happiest and luckiest man in Atlanta. Although he didn't win a
single individual medal at the Olympics, he struck gold three times
as a relay swimmer for the United States and left the Games with
more of that precious metal draped around his neck than any male
athlete from any country. Times change, and so has Davis' role. He
still is not the individual star of the U.S. team, but the
27-year-old former Texas Longhorn is its leader, the emotional rock
for a squad that certainly will need one in Sydney, Australia.
These Olympics will be no house party for the U.S. swimmers the way
the Atlanta Games were. The rest of the world has been improving,
and the talented Aussies will be defending their home surf in a
country that's fanatical about the sport. ``Everyone's talking
about swimming there. It's kind of like the NBA and NFL over
here,'' said Olympic swim coach Richard Quick. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman) 35.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SWM-TEXAS _ At the recent U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials there
were times when there were so many Longhorns in the final it was a
wonder they didn't turn the pool orange. The Three Amigos, seniors
Jamie Rauch, Scott Goldblatt and Nate Dusing, all finished in the
top six in the 200 meter freestyle and are eligible to swim on the
U.S.'s 800 meter relay team in Sydney. The 100 meter butterfly was
another Texas affair with Longhorn recruit Ian Crocker beating
Tommy Hannan. If you count Gary Hall, who had a cup of coffee at
Texas, eight of the 24 men selected to the team were either former,
current or incoming Longhorns. And there were a rash of Texas
swimmers who didn't make the team but still turned in impressive
performances, including incoming freshman Brendan Hansen, who
finished third in both the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke. (Maher,

   OLY-BKO-FORTNER _ Former Longhorn basketball standout Nell
Fortner has a big task at hand. She is head coach of the U.S.
women's Olympic basketball team. Like the men's national team, they
are expected to return home from the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia next month with a gold medal ? and nothing else
but souvenirs. But the U.S.'s trip to the Olympics every four years
in basketball is not as easy as it used to be, as other countries
have closed the talent gap. There's as much pressure on Fortner to
carry on a tradition of dominance as on her 12-player superstar
roster. She's looking forward to it. (Estwick, Austin

 &HT;    New UNC chancellor wants voters to fund costly renewal
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his first day as the ninth chancellor of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, James Moeser sipped
water from a campus landmark, the Old Well, for good luck. He's
going to need it. The Texas-born former chancellor of the
University of Nebraska at Lincoln takes over North Carolina's
flagship public college at a critical juncture. The state's
16-campus university system wants to borrow $2.5 billion _
UNC-Chapel Hill would get nearly $500 million _ for improvements,
but North Carolina voters must approve the bonds in a Nov. 7
referendum. Moeser, 61, talked to staff writer Chris Burritt about
challenges at UNC-Chapel Hill, the first public university to open
its doors, in 1795, and its role in examining and influencing the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much time will you spend promoting the bonds?
</P>
<P>
   A: A big chunk of it. I am simply going to make the case that
this is the best investment that people can make in their own
future. This is a university that literally feeds and stimulates
the economy of the state by the research that we do and the
transfer of that research into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly half a billion dollars that comes to this campus
out of the bond issue, I will pledge to double or triple that with
private dollars. We will marry state dollars from the bond issue
with private dollars that we will raise.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long will raising the private funds take?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will probably be the life of my tenure here. It could go
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a tour of some of the university's buildings badly in need
of repairs, what did you see?
</P>
<P>
   A: The thing that just amazes me is we have this faculty here,
doing work of an incredible quality, attracting the best students
in the country to come here to study, and yet they are hampered by
facilities that are woefully inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   One lab had $3 million worth of very sensitive scientific
equipment, and it was a lab that . . . regularly floods. Tiles were
coming down because the roof was leaking.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great university that has been basically neglected. .
. . Struggling with this kind of deficiency is like running a race
with a concrete block tied around your ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before you officially began as chancellor, you approved the
recent hiring of Matt Doherty as UNC's men's basketball coach.
Explain the balance of athletics and academics.
</P>
<P>
   A: We are a university first. . . . I will never say to the
coaches that I expect you to win national championships. I think
that puts unfair and undue pressure on coaches to win at any price.
Obviously, I want to have successful programs. . . . But far more
important to me is that we have coaches who first of all are
teachers who see their student-athletes as students.
</P>
<P>
   I think athletics at its best can be a character-building
experience. I am very concerned about what I see in America with
the cost of intercollegiate athletics (and) with the pressures to
win _ sometimes to win at any price.
</P>
<P>
   I think there is a kind of ugliness that is getting into sports,
the undue taunting on the field or by people at sporting events. .
. . We have gotten a long way from respecting our opponents and
treating them with . . . civility.
</P>
<P>
   Q: UNC likes to think of itself as a beacon of wisdom for the
South and having some role in shaping the debate about the South.
Do you believe that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think Chapel Hill is the flagship of the South. That goes
right to Southern studies. I want Chapel Hill to be the place if
you are going to do Southern studies. If you are going to study the
American South, this ought to be where you go.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the year 2000, is the South still worthy of study? Is it
still different enough, or its past intriguing enough, for academic
interest?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it is not just a matter of looking at the past and
looking at the Civil War. What are the interesting questions to ask
about the contemporary South? The state of race relations? The
state of economic development?
</P>
<P>
   The South, probably more than any other sector of the country,
has people who know that they are Southerners and where the South
is. You can't tell me where the Midwest is, but the South is very
clearly identifiable, partly because of an event that took place in
the middle of the 19th century.

 &HT;    Furcal tough baserunner to pin down
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Speed in baseball is easy to identify, not so easy to
explain.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Cristian Guzman might be the fastest man in the
majors, but he has difficulty stealing a base. In Florida, Luis
Castillo might be the game's foremost base-stealing threat, but it
took him more than three years to get the green light.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Rafael Furcal has stolen just 26 times, but he has
sat out 30 games. As a rookie, he's still deciphering opposing
pitchers. As a 19-year-old, he will challenge a respected outfield
arm just to see what happens next. On a team of All-Stars and even
future Hall of Famers, he is the most watched man on the field.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain that? Furcal is not the fastest man in the
National League. He isn't even the fastest in the Braves system.
George Lombard is, according to manager Bobby Cox. But what Furcal
becomes every time he reaches base is a situation. And that is
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as quickness, I don't think there's anyone better,''
Braves right fielder Brian Jordan said. ``This guy gets started as
quick as I've ever seen. You don't think he's going to tag up, and
he takes off like he's shot out of a gun. Pretty exciting to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Otis Nixon,'' Braves pitcher Greg Maddux said. ``Kenny
Lofton, Castillo, Vince Coleman, Ozzie Smith. Like all those
little, pesky squirts.t 3.9 on a routine grounder. Mickey Rivers
could go 3.7. Mickey Mantle, the legends say, was quicker than
that.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Furcal and the game's current class of quick
players is that they are running at a time when baseball has
stopped to wait for the long ball. The running game popularized in
the 1980s has been reeled in. The home run is more important. Speed
around the majors is down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy like this comes along, it'd be great to say this is
the wave of the future,'' said Gary Hughes, director of pro
scouting for the Cincinnati Reds. ``But the problem is creating the
wave. There's not that many guys with that kind of speed that can
play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aspect of the game that's kind of lost now a days,''
said Dick Balderson, Atlanta's director of scouting. ``The thing
about it is, we don't get many athletes in the baseball business
anymore, kids who can run like that but have the skills to play the
game. The guys who can run usually end up being football players.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, a recent managers' survey in Baseball America
listed Castillo, Los Angeles' Tom Goodwin and Arizona's Tony Womack
as the fastest players in the National League, and Guzman, Kansas
City's Johnny Damon and Toronto's Raul Mondesi as the fastest in
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   How fast is fast? When Marlins manager John Boles finally set
Castillo loose last year, after he'd already appeared in 230 career
games, he stole 34 bases in the final 50 games. With a major-league
high 48 steals thus far this season, he has accumulated 82 steals
in his last 170 games.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, but as a rookie in 1985, Coleman stole 110 bases in
St. Louis, when the Cardinals routinely were stealing 200 bases a
season over a seven-year run. In the last seven years, only one
team has reached 200, the Colorado Rockies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, in his second season, has stolen just 28 bases in his
career. He has made a far bigger impact by reinventing the triple
in Minneapolis. With 19 triples entering the weekend, he is on pace
for 24, a total unseen since Ty Cobb did it in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal, who leads all rookies with 26 steals, put a dent in
Cobb's portfolio when he passed 23, Cobb's 1906 total, which had
lasted as the most steals by a 19-year-old. Cobb hit .320 that
year. Furcal entered the weekend at .304, having legged out 16
infield singles, nearly 20 percent of his 88 hits this year.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal had just three steals this month, but the rookie said he
thinks he can steal between two and three bases a week, now that he
has replaced the injured Quilvio Veras atop the order. He had hit
seventh or eighth 31 times earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think I can go,'' he said. ``When you're hitting
eighth every time in the National League, the pitcher behind you is
going to try to bunt. In the minors, you don't have the pitchers
hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   What has distinguished the first five months of Furcal's career
is the eye-rubbing, did-that-just-happen play that transcends
statistics. Such as on Aug. 8 when he dropped down a bunt double in
Cincinnati and in the same inning forced a throwing error on a
routine grounder to shortstop before tagging up from third on a
pop-up to center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the outfielders have to get to the ball quick,
because you don't know what this guy is going to do,'' Jordan said.
``It makes no matter where the ball is hit. You got to make sure
you know where this guy is.''
</P>
<P>
   The National League is just getting used to that, making sure
when Rafael Furcal is. The task will become only more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, as you see him get more comfortable at the major
league level and a little more understanding of what goes on,''
Balderson said, ``I think you'll see a lot of stolen bases. I mean,
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's outrun a lot of things. His technique needs to be worked
on, his knowledge of the pitchers and when to do things and not to
do things, that will all improve.''

 &HT;    Texas' state pleases Brown
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In December 1997, Mack Brown was introduced to the
Texas fans as the new football coach at a basketball game on
campus. Just before walking on the floor, Brown found himself
seated next to Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Brown asked the future Republican candidate for president what
he should say in this, his first public appearance before the Texas
people. ``Doesn't really matter what you say,'' Bush replied.
``Just make sure you end it by saying how happy you are to be in
the great state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got up there and mumbled something for about a minute,''
Brown said. ``And then I said, `And Sally and I are just so proud
and happy to be in the great state of Texas.' I thought the roof
was going to come off the place.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS CONVERSION
</P>
<P>
   Brown was born in Cookeville, Tenn., played at Florida State,
and has been a head coach at Appalachian State, Tulane and North
Carolina. But today he is Texas through and through and loving
every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage in my life, I feel really fortunate to be
here,'' said Brown, who coached 10 seasons at North Carolina before
making a quick, and controversial, exit from Chapel Hill to Austin.
``There is a passion for winning, which is what you would expect.
But the people here love to have fun. We just love this place.''
</P>
<P>
   That love has been returned. Texas fans have found in Brown what
they believed was the perfect antidote for the buttoned-down
corporate image created by John Mackovic. Makovic was a very good
football coach who beat Nebraska for a Big 12 championship in 1996.
But Texas fans wanted more than competence from their coach. They
wanted passion.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a salesman, quickly immersed himself in the Texas culture
and embraced every tradition as his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Brown loves tradition and makes us realize how important
it is not just now but many years from now when we look back on
playing football at Texas,'' running back Hodges Mitchell said.
``The people I know just love the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   WINS, MIXED RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   So far, the results on the field have been respectable. In 1998,
Texas rode the powerful legs of running back Ricky Williams, who
won the Heisman Trophy. The Longhorns finished 9-3 after beating
Mississippi State in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Texas stunned No. 3 Nebraska (24-20) on Oct. 23,
handing the Cornhuskers their only loss of the season. But things
fell apart at the end. Texas lost at Texas A&AMP;M 20-16 after the
bonfire tragedy at College Station. And Nebraska beat the Longhorns
22-6 in a rematch in the Big 12 championship game. A 27-6 loss to
Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl left Texas with a 9-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing its last three games of the 1999 season, Texas is
ranked in everybody's top 10 going into 2000. With the talent and
the schedule, which does not include Nebraska or Kansas State in
the regular season, some think the Longhorns might get in the
national championship race ahead of schedule.THE QB QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   Before Texas can begin the pursuit of anything, however, it must
choose a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Major Applewhite, the All-Big 12 quarterback in 1999, has
started 21 games and thrown for 5,601 yards in just two seasons.
Applewhite, named for former Alabama running back Major Ogilvie,
was the Big 12 co-offensive player of the year last season. But he
suffered a knee injury in the Cotton Bowl that kept him out of
spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   The injury cleared the way for sophomore Chris Simms, considered
by many to be the nation's top quarterback coming out of high
school in 1998. The New Jersey native, the son of former Giants
All-Pro Phil Simms, originally committed to Tennessee but changed
his mind and signed with Texas. Simms is 6 feet 5 and 222 pounds
but played sparingly last season. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis,
who coached Eric Zeier at Georgia, plans to play both passers when
Texas opens the season with Louisiana-Lafayette on Sept. 9. After
that, nothing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good problem to have,'' Davis said. ``Most of the time,
schools play two quarterbacks because they have two No. 2s. We have
two No. 1s.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite (6-1, 207) said he is fully recovered from knee
surgery and is not going to give up the job without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to be a fair process,'' the native of Baton
Rouge, La, said. ``I'm no different than the coaches. I want the
best quarterback to be out there because I want to win. I just want
that quarterback to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms is not as intense as Applewhite, but he is just as intent
on leading the Longhorns. ``This is why you come to a place like
Texas,'' he said. ``All I want is an opportunity. Then the rest is
up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you coach, that's what you dream about,'' Brown said.
``Great players competing with other great players. That should be
the goal at Texas. Always.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Brown can't contain the smile of a man just happy
to be in Texas.

 &HT;    Push on Fortner to bring home the gold
 &HT;    By Gary Estwick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. women's Olympic basketball coach Nell Fortner has
a big task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Like the men's team, the women are expected to return home from
the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, with more than
souvenirs. There had better be gold medals in those suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. women's quest for Olympic gold is not as easy as it
used to be because other countries' basketball teams have closed
the talent gap. There's as much pressure on Fortner to carry on a
tradition of dominance as there is on her 12-player superstar
roster.
</P>
<P>
   But what, her worry? Fortner is looking forward to the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to put into words,'' said Fortner, who played
at Texas from 1977-81. ``It's something that was three years away
in '97 that was hard really to grasp at that time. I feel good
about where we're at, and it's just exciting to finally be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Players understand the pressure on Fortner. ``The pressure is
also on Nell because she is the head coach and under her guidance
we go,'' said team member Dawn Staley. ``I think it's a
double-edged sword. She has a responsibility, and we have a
responsibility to her to put what she prepares for us out there on
the basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortner's Olympic dream started three years ago, when she left a
head coaching job at Purdue to coach the Olympic team. From there,
she has spent the last three years traveling the globe, coaching 10
U.S. squads to a combined 84-14 record. The USA Women's National
Team, which trained from September through April, compiled a 29-2
overall record before breaking for the WNBA season.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, Fortner was named head coach of the expansion
WNBA Indiana Fever. She will join the team after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to win comes at a time when several of Fortner's
Olympic players are still competing in the WNBA playoffs. On the
way are the Houston Comets' Sheryl Swoopes and Olympic alternate
Tina Thompson and the Los Angeles Sparks' Lisa Leslie and DeLisha
Milton.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets lead the Sparks 1-0 in the WNBA's Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players are in a big rush to exit the playoffs. When
the time comes, though, they'll be united with one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a difficult transition at all, especially
when you look at team spirit and competition,'' Thompson said. ``We
know the Olympics doesn't have anything to do with the WNBA, the
Houston Comets or the Los Angeles Sparks. It has to do with the
United States. We're all representing our country. It's a different
thing altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, U.S. team members Staley, Teresa Edwards, Katie
Smith, Natalie Williams and Kara Wolters had their first training
session together since April in Colorado Springs, Colo. Olympic
alternates Jennifer Azzi and Katrina McClain also participated in
the workouts. Chamique Holdsclaw and Nikki McCray arrived late this
week. Ruthie Bolton-Holifield and Yolanda Griffith will arrive
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Fortner said it's been difficult running practices with only
seven players. The short-handed team at times has practiced against
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's been a challenge, we've still been able to get in a
few things as far as teaching new things, just going over and
reviewing things we've done in the past, and also conditioning,''
Fortner said. ``Right now we're moving along as best we can with
the number of players that we have, but they've come in with great
attitudes, trying to get this thing going and setting the tone for
the weeks ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the players currently working out don't have good
credentials. Consider the veteran Edwards, a three-time Olympic
gold medalist (1984, '88 and '96).
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said this year's team will face stiffer competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at one time it was considered to be easy, that we
could just go out, train two to three weeks and just beat
everybody,'' she said. ``The fact that we can't do that anymore
just proves that these countries have really gotten better, paid
attention, grown and produced quality athletes on the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Edwards doesn't foresee another gold medal being added
to her collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we're head and shoulders better than everyone
else,'' she said. ``It's just recognizing that and feeling the
sense of urgency about that and having that desire to go out time
and time again to keep proving that.''

 &HT;    Josh Davis is a solid anchor for U.S. swim team
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four years ago, Josh Davis had to be the
happiest and luckiest man in Atlanta. Although he didn't win a
single individual medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics, he struck gold
three times as a relay swimmer for the United States and left the
Games with more of that precious metal draped around his neck than
any male athlete from any country.
</P>
<P>
   Times change, and so has Davis' role. He still is not the
individual star of the U.S. team, but the 27-year-old former Texas
Longhorn is its leader, the emotional rock for a squad that
certainly will need one in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   These Olympics will be no house party for the U.S. swimmers the
way the Atlanta Games were. The rest of the world has been
improving, and the talented Aussies will be defending their home
surf in a country that's fanatical about the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's talking about swimming there. It's kind of like the
NBA and NFL over here,'' said Olympic swim coach Richard Quick. He
added that the last time the Aussies and Americans hooked up in
Sydney, at the Pan Pacific championships last year, the ratings for
the showdown were the highest of the year for any TV show. At the
pool in Sydney, the fans once again will be deafening in their
support of the home team.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches know that the Olympics can be like a college meet,
when momentum can carry the day. Swimming fast _ or slow _ can be
contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think leadership and chemistry are the key. Americans are
used to a team effort. They thrive on a team effort,'' Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these young guys can learn from the veterans, and we
have tremendous veterans and tremendous leadership on this team,''
men's coach Mark Schubert added.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other U.S. veterans have more eye-popping times and
better individual medal hopes than Davis, but none is more
respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be the leader of the team. Even the Toms
(Wilkens, Dolan and Malchow) will tell you Josh is the leader,''
said Texas' Jamie Rauch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all that experience,'' Neil Walker said. ``And if
you've got a problem, he'll listen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the team captain for four years. It's a role I
enjoy,'' Davis said, laughing about some of the chores he's picked
up since the last Olympics. ``When guys don't like something the
coaches are doing they'll say, `Let's get Josh. The coaches will
listen to Josh.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is almost always upbeat. At the trials, while some other
swimmers had to be coaxed to talk with reporters, Davis would bound
over and announce, ``Hi. I'm Josh Davis. Who needs to talk to me?''
</P>
<P>
   QUIT? NEVER
</P>
<P>
   Davis loves what he's doing, which is being a full-time swimmer.
He'll probably be buried in a Speedo or one of those new
full-length body suits. People who don't know him might assume
he'll retire from swimming after these Olympics. They'd be wrong.
He plans to swim in 2004, when he'd be on the wrong side of 30, and
again in 2008, when he'd be 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel stronger and better than ever, like a fine wine getting
better with age,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of enthusiasm for the sport is contagious. Walker, a
former Longhorn, said at the Olympic trials that he'll probably
keep swimming after the Games and cited Davis as an example of how
a swimmer can keep improving.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials, Davis finally broke a record he'd been
chasing for years, one he'd seen as a wide-eyed 15-year-old
visiting Austin _ Matt Biondi's American record in the 200-meter
freestyle. That was set in 1988 when Austin played host to the
Olympic trials. At the time, Davis, who started later than almost
any other Olympic-caliber swimmer, had only been swimming
competitively for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   There's no secret for how Davis has continued to improve or why
he has a physique that stands out even on the pool deck at the
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He swims with us, and Josh is a real hard worker,'' UT
Olympian Nate Dusing said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have an edge on most people out of the pool,'' Davis
once said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is deeply religious and a committed family man. He and his
wife, Shantel, have two children and a third one is on the way.
That's one of the reasons Davis now trains with Texas coach Eddie
Reese's brother, Randy, at Circle C. The Davis family had outgrown
its other place and figured Circle C would be an ideal setup.
There's been another benefit to the arrangement as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie was real comfortable with me and I was real comfortable
with Eddie,'' Davis said. ``I needed someone like Randy to kick me
in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Although known as a dedicated worker, Davis also has a sense of
humor. At the trials, he made a point of not looking at former
Longhorn Gary Hall Jr. when he raced him. It wasn't any part of a
psyche-out routine. It's just that Hall's antics can crack Davis
up, something he doesn't want to happen before an important race.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Davis suffered a string of disappointments in
his individual events. At the 1996 Olympic trials, he finished
third in the 100 freestyle, just missing making the team in that
event. He also was fourth in the 400 freestyle and qualified only
in his specialty, the 200 meters. He was ranked No. 1 in the world
at that distance in 1995 but finished seventh in the Olympic Games.
In the relays, however, he flourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to swim faster in relays,'' Davis said back then. Maybe
that's part of being a team player. After finishing third in the
semifinals of the 100 freestyle this year in Indianapolis, Davis
wasn't shooting any higher in the finals, saying that the team
needed Walker and Hall to take on Alexander Popov and some of the
other world-class sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Davis ended up finishing sixth in the finals of the 100
freestyle behind Walker and Hall.THORPE LOOMS
</P>
<P>
   Davis is also one of the best U.S. swimmers in the butterfly and
the backstroke, just not quite good enough to nail down one of the
top two spots to make an Olympic team. He briefly thought about
trying to swim the 200 medley at the trials, as he has in some
other meets, but discarded that idea, figuring he couldn't make up
the two seconds he needed on the likes of Wilkens and Dolan. He's
as good as anyone in the world for three legs, but is a fish out of
water in the breast stroke.
</P>
<P>
   His forte remains the 200 freestyle, but that race has changed
with the emergence of the ``Thorpedo,'' Australia's hugely talented
teen-ager, Ian Thorpe. Thorpe's world record is more than a second
faster than Davis' American record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can go 1:46 and then 1:46 low. At that point it's
anybody's game,'' Davis said. A defeat of Thorpe would be daunting
for the Australians and a huge momentum swing for the Americans. In
the 800 freestyle relay, Davis should be the anchor of a young
squad that includes three UT swimmers, Dusing, Rauch and Scott
Goldblatt. The Aussies are loaded for that relay.
</P>
<P>
   Schubert said, ``We're going to focus on improvement in the
training camp and building a great team atmosphere and getting
everybody excited about improving and swimming faster than they did
in Indianapolis . . . I think the old guys can foster them (the
younger athletes) and get them through this Olympic experience,
which sometimes for a younger athlete can be a bit overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   With typical confidence Davis plans to break camp and head home
for the birth of the family's third child on Sept. 4th and then
head to Sydney to lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you serve people, you end up being a leader,'' Davis said.

 SPORTS COLUMN: THE BATTLES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to delete photo note; there are no photos NYT3 and(Editors: Different spellings of Rivellino and Rivelino in last
graf are correct.) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rivellino Jones of the misspelled name was refereeing
a soccer game in Manhattan last week, a moral victory for coach
Marty Jacobson. Perhaps those other embattled friends of
thelipsite(at)aol.com, Linda Bensel-Meyers and Billy Bean, could
take heart from Jake, although hang in there is almost always the
hardest advice to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers, the whistle-blower at the University of
Tennessee, is facing the start of a football season in which she
has been portrayed as the Volunteers' most dangerous opponent. The
team has just started practicing and Bensel-Meyers has already
informed the NCAA of three freshman players who turned in
remarkably similar compositions. She calls it institutional
plagiarism and blames it on the mores of the university rather than
on the athletes or tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Knoxville call it harassing the program. The NCAA
might not even find it in violation of whatever it is that concerns
that trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers has been decrying, for some time now, what she
sees as the exploitation of athletes and the subversion of the
humanistic values of the academy. A professor of Renaissance
literature and drama, she is also in charge of the first-year
composition program. She is only recently being heard beyond the
world of the Orange.
</P>
<P>
   In what I found the most cynical and clear-eyed approach to the
issue, Frank Cagle, the managing editor of The Knoxville
News-Sentinel, simply brushed it off. He wrote that the ``fate of
the football team has a deep impact on the morale, the business and
the general economy of East Tennessee'' and that what might be
construed as corruption in college sports was a ``national scandal,
not a local one. And it requires a national solution.'' In other
words, keeping our boys eligible by any means necessary is a
priority not to be tampered with unless every other school goes
honest, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers is idealistic and fuzzy-minded; she sees
universities using a bottom-line corporate model in which athletes
are resources. Even the coaches and athletic administrators end up
being victimized, especially if they don't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate problem is how do I avoid being cast as a
harridan because I harp on the issue,'' she said last week. ``The
administration's problem is that you can't put the peel back on the
orange once you see what's underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean, an outfielder whose six major league seasons on three
teams were haunted by the secret of his homosexuality, has decided
he wants to be back in baseball, the binding thread of his life
since childhood. Since he used his sports background to build
functioning teams in two restaurants, he thinks he can use his
business background in a front office. He would offer a rare
combination of experience and skills, as well as a test of sports'
institutional homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   His open, often moving description of life in a major league
closet last year in a front-page story in The New York Times led to
a number of speaking engagements and television appearances. In
talking about baseball, he realized he had not resolved that
critical part of his life; he had left before his career was over.
Even now, at 35, he tries to stay in playing shape and appear
regularly on talk radio; he is still gripping the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bean is in the process of selling his current Miami Beach
restaurant, Mayya, and writing to baseball club executives. He said
last week that he understands that a team would have to be
``courageous'' to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jake's message has always been simple: Don't quit. A
recovering drug abuser long clean, a soccer coach in a basketball
culture, an advocate for kids among clock-watching bureaucrats,
Jacobson's saga has been struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when his Martin Luther King Jr. High School team won
the first of its three straight city championships, mostly with
recent immigrants from the West Indies and West Africa, Jake has
been controversial in and out of his school. He was suspended from
coaching for 11 months last year when rival coaches accused several
of his players of being ineligible. He was reinstated and
vindicated, although his team lost in last year's championship
final.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bensel-Meyers, he is self-righteous and insistent on
putting the needs of the individual student ahead of the
institution. Like Bean, his charm masks a willingness to work
harder than most. And like them both, he has a larger vision. Jake
thinks the future of American soccer will rise from the cities.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the New York City Parks Department's inspired
partnership with the Parmalat milk company finished its six-week
Summer of Soccer 2000 Saturday. On weekday nights in Riverside Park
in Manhattan and Flushing Meadow-Corona Park in Queens, youngsters
played six-on-six games under the supervision of parkies and soccer
coaches and college players like Rivellino Jones. Jacobson ran the
Manhattan program, which included washing the mesh scrimmage vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that passion,'' he crowed last week as teen-agers from
Senegal and Brazil and Trinidad stormed up and down the turf with
bursts of heart-stopping athleticism. ``This is going to be the
urban game. These kids are going to be our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivellino Jones, 22, named for Roberto Rivelino, the Brazilian
star, is a symbol of that future. As a 16-year-old Trinidadian
overwhelmed by homesickness and a huge, chaotic high school, Jones
found his new roots at midfield on the King varsity. He was on
Jake's first title team and expects to graduate from Medgar Evers
College this year. He says he wants to be a public school guidance
counselor and coach. Like Jake.

HASSEN MALL, 78, FIRST NONWHITE SOUTH AFRICAN JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Judge Hassen Mall, an Indian
immigrant who was South Africa's first nonwhite jurist and a key
figure in the nation's effort to lay to rest its apartheid past,
died Friday. He was 78, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Mall, who had been suffering heart and kidney problems, was the
chairman of the amnesty committee of the country's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission. In that role he weighed some of the
worst atrocities of the apartheid era and the fate of those who
perpetrated them.
</P>
<P>
   With his health declining and his eyesight diminished in the
last year because of cataracts, Mall had greatly scaled back his
work but he remained a devoted presence at the commission, his
family and colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee that he headed hoped to finish hearing
applications for amnesty by October, its work will last months
beyond then as it considers the latest raft of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to expose the truth of the apartheid era and impart a
spirit of reconciliation, South Africa offered amnesty to anyone
who was candid and complete in accounting for acts of violence and
could convince the commission that his or her actions were
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of government agents and anti-government activists who
tortured, bombed, killed and otherwise roiled the country during
the liberation struggle have applied.
</P>
<P>
   Many have won amnesty; some have not, and the country itself is
still not of one mind about the ultimate merit of a process that
has answered many questions but offered little justice.
</P>
<P>
   Mall was convinced of the commission's crucial place in the
peaceful transformation of South Africa, his associates said. A
bust of Gandhi adorned his office in Durban and he approached his
work on the amnesty committee in a sober, deliberate manner,
recalled Deborah Quin, an investigator for the committee, which was
based in Durban, where Mall also lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a kind of very wise man, not cautious, but slow to come
to a decision,'' Quin said Saturday in an interview. ``He was very
concerned about hearing all the sides. It was difficult to read in
a hearing which way he was going to go. Some of the panel members
are obvious, but he wasn't at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Born July 19, 1922, in the Indian village of Ghala, about 125
miles from Bombay, he came to South Africa with his family at the
age of 4, his son Enver said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Durban, he went on to study first at the University of
Fort Hare and then at the University of Cape Town, where he earned
his law degree, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, after decades of practicing law, he was named an acting
judge, the first nonwhite to be appointed to the bench. It was one
of a number of signals during that tumultuous period that bigger
changes lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Named a full judge in 1993, as the country prepared for the
historic multiracial 1994 election, he served on the bench a few
more years before being chosen by former President Nelson Mandela
in 1995 to lead the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's amnesty
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought a certain independence of spirit,'' Yasmin Sooka, a
commission member who worked with Mall's committee, said Saturday.
``He was not tainted or compromised.'' Indeed, he was widely
respected among the country's human rights lawyers, she said, and
they saw him as someone who would judge their cases fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his health slipped, he remained dedicated to the work of
the commission, Sooka said, because he believed that it was ``one
of the pillars on which democracy was built in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mall was buried Friday evening. In addition to his son, he is
survived by his wife, Sylvia, and two daughters, Marcina and
Shereen.

   (NYT4) KADUNA, Nigeria -- Aug. 19, 2000 -- NIGERIA-OBASANJO-3 --
In tranquil Abuja, Nigeria, the troubles of the nation that has
long represented both Africa's highest hopes and deepest despair
seem unimaginable. Drive two hours north to Kaduna, however, and
the despair is on stark display. In a city that once had a
cosmopolitan tone and religious integration, riots killed thousands
of residents this year, and neighborhoods reduced to rubble have
become segregated between Muslims and Christians. ``If we want to
get proper peace in Kaduna, we have to divide the state into two,''
says Simeon Achi, 61, Christian community leader, with his son,
Musa, 31, in Kaduna. (Norimitsu Onishi/The New York Times)

-- Faced in eight northern states with the declaration of Shariah

president Olusegun Obasanjo, who took power 15 months ago, has
reacted cautiously and called for a political solution to the
challenge of Islamic extremism. Traders pray outside the main

   (NYT1) ABUJA, Nigeria -- Aug. 19, 2000 -- NIGERIA-OBASANJO-1 --
On the continent with the world's richest natural resources and
poorest people, Nigeria has so much oil that it may eventually rank
second only to Saudi Arabia, but its inhabitants have one of the
lowest standards of living. On a continent riven by cleavages among
ethnic groups, Nigeria has the most, perhaps as many as 400. A
mosque in Abuja, Nigeria, left, faces a Christian church, right.
Tensions between Christians and Muslims have grown recently.

   GORE-FRIEND _ DAYTON _ Vernon Courtney, director of the National
Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center, was in the same dorm as
Al Gore at Harvard in the mid-1960s. The two used to shoot pool and
play ping pong, alternating victories, and also shared an interest
in hunting. Courtney, a young black man from the seaport town of
Hampton, Va., was recruited to attend the Ivy League university. He
recalled Gore as a guy whose ``daily uniform'' then was bib
overalls and who always presented himself as a guy from Tennessee,
downplaying the senator's son in an effort to be one of the guys.
``The thing I find interesting is he comes off so dry now. He
wasn't that way at all. He was pretty gregarious,'' Courtney
recalled. They haven't stayed in contact but after someone told Al
he ran into Courtney, Gore fired off an e-mail to him that said
``Don't forget to vote for me.'' Courtney also knew Tommy Lee
Jones, who wasn't around much because he was wrapped up in drama

Big Al on campus. (Kissell, Dayton Daily News) 15. MOVED.

   FLATRAIN _ Trying to unclog its highways from Miami to Orlando
to Tampa, planners in Florida had proposed a high-speed train that
would reach speeds of 240 mph. But Gov. Jeb Bush killed the $6.3
billion project, which included annual payments from the
Legislature for 20 years, because he was not convinced the train
would have enough riders to justify its cost. Now, a retired
Lakeland businessman, is on the verge of putting the proposal on
the November ballot. Using a provision of the state constitution
that lets referendums be placed on a ballot if their are sufficient
petitioners to do so, fast-train advocate C.C. Dockery is waiting
on the state Supreme Court to rule on his request. Fast trains are
the latest fad among urban planners; turning their use into reality
is a different thing. Metro Atlanta planners also dream of a
high-speed train linking the city with Chattanooga. (Manuel, Cox

   MEXICO-CHIAPAS-1STLD _ From the tropical coast to the Mayan
highlands, the fever for political change _ through ballots, not
bullets _ is sweeping Mexico's Chiapas state. On Sunday, Aug. 20,
the state famous for its armed Zapatista Mayan Indian rebels will
elect a new governor. In the wake of Vicente Fox's historic
opposition victory in last month's presidential election, polls
show that change could be contagious: Even in Indian communities
once under tight control by the ruling party, posters for a Fox
ally are up on dirt-floor homes. Chiapans appear to be slightly
favoring Pablo Salazar, a former ruling party member who is now
representing an alliance that includes Fox's conservative National
Action Party and the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. If
Salazar wins, one of the main reasons for the Zapatistas rising in
protest is eliminated. And those clashes between pro-Zapatistas and
PRI-backed paramilitaries are still continuing. (Ferriss, Cox News

   WEBVAN - ATLANTA _ Lynda Reis, who spends more than $180 a week
on groceries for her family, is convinced she saves money using
Webvan.com. That's because she avoids impulse purchases at the
local grocery store. ``I spend less money per week,'' Reis said
while inspecting an order delivered to her home by the online
grocer. ``I would have bought what I didn't need if I went to the
store.'' The economics of buying groceries online and having them
delivered to the home may make sense for Reis. The question is
whether they will work for Webvan. While the company has generated
a lot of positive buzz and impressed many customers, it is a long
way from making money. (DeGross, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TWINS _ WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
book signings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their

   OLY-SWM-JOSHDAVIS _ Four years ago, Josh Davis had to be the
happiest and luckiest man in Atlanta. Although he didn't win a
single individual medal at the Olympics, he struck gold three times
as a relay swimmer for the United States and left the Games with
more of that precious metal draped around his neck than any male
athlete from any country. Times change, and so has Davis' role. He
still is not the individual star of the U.S. team, but the
27-year-old former Texas Longhorn is its leader, the emotional rock
for a squad that certainly will need one in Sydney, Australia.
These Olympics will be no house party for the U.S. swimmers the way
the Atlanta Games were. The rest of the world has been improving,
and the talented Aussies will be defending their home surf in a
country that's fanatical about the sport. ``Everyone's talking

   OLY-SWM-TEXAS _ At the recent U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials there

Jamie Rauch, Scott Goldblatt and Nate Dusing, all finished in the
top six in the 200 meter freestyle and are eligible to swim on the
U.S.'s 800 meter relay team in Sydney. The 100 meter butterfly was
another Texas affair with Longhorn recruit Ian Crocker beating
Tommy Hannan. If you count Gary Hall, who had a cup of coffee at
Texas, eight of the 24 men selected to the team were either former,
current or incoming Longhorns. And there were a rash of Texas
swimmers who didn't make the team but still turned in impressive
performances, including incoming freshman Brendan Hansen, who
finished third in both the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke. (Maher,

Sydney, Australia next month with a gold medal ? and nothing else

have closed the talent gap. There's as much pressure on Fortner to
carry on a tradition of dominance as on her 12-player superstar

GIANTS DEFENSE, FLAGGING IN PRE-SEASON, MAY BE NEW SCAPEGOAT 
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years now, it has become almost routine to blame whatever is
going wrong with the Giants on the team's offense. But in the 2000
season, as promised, these are the new-look Giants.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's shabby performance in a 27-24 loss to the
Jets, that means there's a fresh place to look when placing blame
after a debacle.
</P>
<P>
   The offense had its share of problems _ the unit committed 11 of
the preposterous 16 Giants penalties in the game. But they moved
the football, scoring three touchdowns. They were 13 yards short of
accumulating 500 yards in offense.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Giants' once-proud defense that appeared in disarray.
From front line to back line, they not only lacked cohesion, but
were mired in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the preseason, but Michael Strahan has registered
half a sack after three games and there has been too little
pressure applied on the opposing quarterback from his mates.
Linebacker Jessie Armstead is playing ably but not dominating. His
new soul mate in the middle, Mike Barrow, debuted for the Giants
Friday and was trapped out of the play repeatedly on draws up the
middle. The secondary played a step behind the Jets' smaller,
quicker receivers and disregarded their coverage assignments, too.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it is only the preseason, but the Jets, led by their
backup quarterback Ray Lucas, ran just 57 plays Friday night and
still gained 446 yards. That's an average of 7.8 yards per play _
10 yards per pass play and 5.7 per rushing play.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Giants, who are without a victory in the
preseason, pointed to the team's reserves for their troubles before
Friday's game, it was the starters who gave up nearly 80 percent of
the yardage and the scoring against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defensive players are still a confident lot, and
they were somewhat defiant after the game, insisting they are still
one of the top defensive teams in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to push the panic button,'' defensive tackle
Keith Hamilton said. ``I still feel good about the defense. It
doesn't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstead added: ``We'll correct this. I guarantee our very first
practice next week will be different.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants look a long way from their form in 1997, when
they were the third-best NFL defense against the run and opposing
offenses averaged 3.4 yards per rushing carry and 4.7 yards per
play over all.
</P>
<P>
   Since defensive end is one of the most pivotal positions on the
field, it is hard not to wonder what has happened to Strahan, who
had 29 sacks in 1997 and 1998 but 5.5 last season. So far this
year, he has not displayed a return to his old form.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan has not been particularly forthcoming about the
drop-off. After Friday's game he told reporters: ``Don't be coming
over here with those questions. You're just trying to tick me
off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strahan had to acknowledge there is a different feel about
this defense than the one that seemed on the rise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely not as comfortable a defense as we were back
in '97,'' he said. ``But we're learning to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel wasn't taking the situation with the same
aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've gotten a pass rush all preseason,'' he
said. ``There's been no pressure on the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrow, meanwhile, conceded the defense looked awful, saying the
Giants could take the video tape of Friday's game and use it as a
training video on ``how not to play the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrow's middling play could be chalked up to his unfamiliarity
with his new teammates. Armstead, however, is counted on for his
stellar play. If he does not excel once the regular season begins,
there will be new questions about the health of his right knee,
which troubled him last season.
</P>
<P>
   In the secondary, right cornerback Jason Sehorn made one mistake
that gave the Jets a touchdown, though he played solidly
thereafter. The left cornerback, Dave Thomas, was picked on
repeatedly by Lucas, who frequently looked to that side of the
field from the moment he started dropping back in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   This could easily be the strategy employed by Giants opponents
for the rest of the year, which means Thomas may need help from the
safeties. But free safety Shaun Williams hasn't played yet because
of a sprained toe and strong safety Sam Garnes was fooled just as
Thomas was on the run fake part of a flea-flicker that became the
second Jets touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, could be a recurring problem for the Giants because
both Garnes and Thomas are strong against the run and less skilled
in pass coverage.
</P>
<P>
   It is just one preseason game, but it gave the Giants evidence
there is plenty to fix _ on the defensive side of the ball, for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating to look at the talent and potential we
have on defense and to see us play that way,'' Sehorn said. ``When
you see all those breakdowns you say, `What were we practicing all
that other stuff for?' We've got a lot of work to do to prove
ourselves again.''

WITH PETTITTE PITCHING ENTIRE GAME, YANKEES TROUNCE ANGELS 9-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte departed Yankee Stadium Friday in the
sixth inning, before the Yankees' collapse, before they blew their
five-run lead in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte saw the 11th inning in his living room, saw Anaheim's
Darin Erstad slug the game-winning home run, and Pettitte became
cognizant of the burden shifting onto his broad shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, the Yankees' starting pitcher Saturday, knew he had to
quickly establish himself _ and the whole team, for that matter _
and quickly exorcise the feelings lingering from Friday's defeat.
The left-hander struck out Erstad with a cut fastball to start the
game, the Yankees struck for seven runs in the first three innings
and ultimately smashed the Angels, 9-1. Pettitte pitched the entire
game and is 15-6, having won his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo lined a two-run homer in the first inning, and David
Justice mashed a pair of home runs, his 33rd and 34th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to forget about yesterday,'' Sojo said. ``We just
had to forget about it and come back today.''
</P>
<P>
   As many of his players fled the Yankees' clubhouse after
Friday's disaster, Torre lingered in his office and identified a
silver lining: Thank goodness, Torre said, that the Yankees had an
afternoon game in about 13 hours, so that they could immediately go
about the business of pushing Anaheim's staggering comeback into
their past.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, who had surrendered the game-tying home run to
Mo Vaughn in the ninth, said the loss bothered him more than any in
his career. Torre passed Tino Martinez in the clubhouse and
Martinez asked the manager how he was feeling, perhaps trying to
decide whether the look on Torre's face betrayed tiredness or the
hangover of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre said before the game he expected they would rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been through this so many times before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had not taken batting practice outdoors for three
days, skipping Wednesday's session because of the hot weather in
Texas, missing Thursday because of overnight travel from Texas, and
missing Friday because of the rain that showered the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was out and the air was pleasantly cool Saturday
morning, and shortly after 11 a.m., the Yankees started departing
their clubhouse and warming up on the field, with Martinez and
Scott Brosius and others playing catch in front of the Yankees'
dugout. It was impossible to tell whether Friday's defeat weighed
on any of them, if they were even thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo had been more concerned about whether or not he was in the
lineup, waiting in front of his locker until the hitting coach
Chris Chambliss posted the batting order on the clubhouse door,
then walking across the room to find his name.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo started at second base, batting second, and after the
Anaheim starter Brian Cooper (4-8) nailed Derek Jeter with a
fastball leading off the first, Sojo drilled a two-run homer into
the left-field stands. The Yankees added a walk, three singles for
two more runs, freeing Pettitte to pitch aggressively. He was
throwing hard, and his fastball had unusually sharp movement, and
Pettitte attacked, striking out four of the first six batters he
faced, breezing through the Anaheim lineup most of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte has compiled a 2.41 earned run average in his last six
starts, and has a chance to win 20 games for the first time since
1996, when he finished 21-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably about as strong as I've felt this late in the
season,'' he said. ``Even in my bullpen work, I feel like
everything is in a real good slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant misplayed one fly ball in the third and forgot how many
outs there were when catching another, helping the Yankees scored
three times on three sacrifice flies. The game was an 8-0 wipeout
after five innings, and already Friday's debacle seemed like just
another forgettable result during the course of the long season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels began to stir in the sixth, putting runners at
second and third with a walk and a double, Pettitte snagged Tim
Salmon's hard grounder through the middle and caught Kevin Stocker
off third base _ Anaheim's fourth major base-running snafu in the
first three games of this series. Sojo dove to stop a grounder by
Vaughn and threw to first to end the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was just window dressing: the home runs by Justice,
Torre clearing his bench and resting some of his regulars. The good
thing, from the perspective of the Yankees, is that they don't play
again until Sunday afternoon, giving them one full day to remember
this crisp victory, and one more day to forget Friday's nightmare.

BUSH AND GORE PLAN AD BLITZES AS 80-DAY ELECTION DRIVE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (DELETES ``Midwestern'' from 3rd graf)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moving on several fronts to capitalize on the
afterglow from their conventions, the presidential contenders plan
next week to open the biggest television advertising blitzes of
their campaigns, in which Gov. George W. Bush will emphasize
education and Vice President Al Gore will trumpet himself as a
champion of ``working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they were preparing for the hectic 80-day
marathon to Election Day and had begun making critical decisions
about where to campaign and where to funnel resources, including an
infusion of nearly $68 million in federal subsidies each.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is seizing the offensive and plans to advertise and
campaign in historically Democratic states. Among the 21 states
chosen for an advertising drive that begins on Monday is West
Virginia, which Republicans have not carried since 1984. The
commercials will also appear in the swing states of Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and in states like Oregon, Washington
and New Mexico, where President Clinton prevailed in 1992 and 1996
but where Bush thinks his chances are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the point at which the campaign pivots,'' said Karl
Rove, Bush's chief strategist. ``Our focus has been preparing for
the conventions. Now we're making major forays onto the turf that
the other guy considers his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials lay out Bush's broad goals for education,
including greater local control of schools, stricter standards and
increased federal spending to promote reading and strengthen
teacher training and math and science.
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials said they would focus largely on the battle
ground states of the Midwest and make particular appeals to women
who seemed enticed by the Republicans. They also said they would
continue to cite Bush's record in Texas as demonstrating his
failure to tackle health care for children, improving the
environment, gun control and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle lines are drawn,'' said Robert Shrum, one of Gore's
leading strategists. ``Al Gore comes out of the convention much
more clearly defined to people. There's a choice on a thematic
dimension: Who's going to stand up and fight for middle-class
families on prescription drugs, a patients' bill of rights and
education?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said they were also working closely with
state Republican Party organizations to develop ambitious programs
to identify potential supporters and encourage them to vote. The
Gore campaign is making such efforts as well, but is more reliant
on unions to help drive turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Democratic convention, polls showed that Bush was
ahead of Gore. The Gore campaign's objective has been to build on
the publicity and good feeling from the convention to help Gore
pull even with Bush by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 and every presidential campaign since, the candidate who
was ahead in the polls after the conventions won the election. But
because there is an open race and both camps seem relatively evenly
matched, Republican and Democratic strategists predict that the
2000 race may be closer to 1980, when President Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan were neck-and-neck in the polls after the convention
_ and Reagan pulled out a victory in the closing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it can be anything but a competitive race,''
said Tom Cole, chief of staff for the Republican National
Committee. ``Our biggest advantage right now is our base unified
quicker than theirs. But that's going to happen at some point for
them. Then we're going to be in a very close race.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Gore and his vice presidential candidate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, Cole added, ``They're not going to go gently into
that good night.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the best
evidence of the competitiveness was in his state, which was
Clinton-Gore territory in the last two elections but now appears to
be a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush has every opportunity to win this election,''
Thompson said. ``To give you an idea, George Bush has already been
here three times and Al Gore has been here four or five times. And
both of them are going to be in Milwaukee next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said now
that the public might be beginning to pay attention to the contest,
Gore should hammer away at a theme he introduced at the convention:
how the policies of a president can touch the lives of ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people weren't watching this _ they were watching
`Survivor' or something else,'' Gephardt said. ``Al Gore should
articulate the stakes in this election and in people's everyday
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion needs to settle for at least several days before
polls can give an accurate picture of how the relative standing of
Gore and Bush might have shifted after the two biggest political
events of the summer: the national party conventions and selection
of running mates.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus in interviews with a variety of strategists
and campaign officials on both sides is that both campaigns did
themselves some good on both counts _ or, at the very least, did
not lose ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, a Democrat, said his initial fears
that Clinton's appearance would siphon attention from Gore had been
allayed. ``This whole issue of contrasting Clinton and Gore _ I
wasn't sure how this would all work out,'' Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to Gore's speech, he added, ``But I will tell
you _ with no disrespect at all to the president _ I thought
halfway through the speech, `Bill who?'''
</P>
<P>
   Though both conventions seemed to be helpful to the nominees, if
anything, strategists in both parties seemed to agree, Bush put on
a slightly better convention than Gore. Several experts said that
was because the Republicans seemed more harmonious and laid out a
broader message of inclusion. By contrast, many strategists said,
the vice president's convention was a bit more uneven and seemed
less successful in reaching beyond the party's core voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush had a better convention week, but not a better speech,''
said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials said they were pleased that during their
convention they had made significant in-roads in presenting Gore as
more than a vice president; as a nominee with a populist streak who
will energetically fight for ``working families'' _ a favorite Gore
phrase _ on a variety of issues, from health care to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   But even loyal Democrats here expressed some distress about Gore
and his difficulty in winning clusters of voters _ like women _ who
are historically inclined to vote Democratic. And they cited the
ball and chain of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that the people of America will not give him a
fair hearing,'' said Raymond Ensher, a delegate from Colorado.
``They continue to associate him, I think unfairly, with the
problems Bill Clinton has had.'' Ensher added: ``What really
worries me are the women. That really worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove, Bush's strategist, noted that Bush had already succeeded
in staking out issues that Bob Dole, the nominee four years ago,
did not dare discuss. ``Can you imagine if Bob Dole had stood up
and said, `I want to reform Social Security,''' he asked. ``The
race would be over. Can you imagine a Republican candidate saying,
`We've got to get rid of so many nuclear bombs?' We did it and got
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slightly better reviews for the Republican
production than the Democratic one, people in both parties said
Gore's choice of Lieberman seemed, at least in the short term, to
be better than Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, the former secretary
of defense, on the Republican side. That is because Lieberman, the
first Jew on a major party ticket, was greeted with euphoria among
Democrats and caused people to take more notice of Gore. The choice
of Cheney underscored Bush's determination to pick a competent No.
2 who would know how to govern. Yet it stirred little excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pick for him,'' Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said
of Lieberman. ``It generated some excitement and interest that
wasn't there. Cheney solidified Bush, but I couldn't really measure
what he's done broader.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback warned, however, that the Lieberman pick could come
back to haunt Gore. If the Democrats attack Bush for their
positions on Social Security privatization and education reform, he
said, Republicans can simply invoke Lieberman's record on those
issues, which is not too far from Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are also looking to the nationally televised
presidential debates beginning in October _ three are tentatively
scheduled _ to provide the last opportunities to scramble the
dynamic. Unless a candidate performs poorly, as Ronald Reagan did
in the first debate against Walter Mondale in 1984, debates usually
do not do much more than reinforce partisan allegiances. (Reagan,
however, improved his performances in later debates and went on to
win in a landslide.)
</P>
<P>
   The closer the race, the more influential the debates will be,
Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it affects only 1 percent that could make a
difference,'' he said, ``because I think the race is going to be
very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sturla, a Democratic state representative in Pennsylvania
who was a delegate here this week, said the debates would be
critical. But in the next breath he wondered aloud whether the
build-up of Gore as an accomplished debater _ and criticism of Bush
as lackluster _ could play right into the Bush strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans, knowing they will get crushed, have lowered
expectations so much that Bush would have to wilt and slither off
the stage,'' Sturla said, ``for his performance to be judged a
surprise and a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the debates, the candidates will mostly convey their
messages through paid commercials. Bush, who did not accept public
money in the primaries so he could exceed the federal spending
limit, has agreed in the general election to join Gore in financing
his campaign with federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign advisers and supporters seem almost preoccupied
over the possibility that the Democrats will begin broadcasting
harsh commercials that try to scare voters away from their
candidate _ all in a drive to gain an edge over Bush. The
Democrats, preferring not to portray the commercials as negative,
say they will not shrink from what they call issue comparisons.
Some Democratic operatives say it seems that the Republicans want
to goad Gore into a slash-and-burn posture so they can turn around
and paint him as mean-spirited, and then attack him right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore campaign will probably go pretty negative,'' said
Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, a Republican. ``It's important
that we respond right away to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers said their hope was that in the speech on
Thursday, the vice president diffused some of the concern that he
was not sufficiently likable, so voters were not more inclined to
warm up to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, for his part, conceded that Bush had a winning
personality that made it easier for his party to put on a moderate
face in Philadelphia. The hope, he said, is that people recognize
that a candidate's beliefs are at least as vital as personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good at public relations,'' Gephardt said of the
Republicans. ``They are good a manufacturing an illusion. They are
expert at it. They may succeed. But I hope they don't.''

 &HT;    The Gainesville Murders: 10 Years Later
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The police warn you before you go in: People
faint when they see these crime-scene pictures. Or get violently
ill. Or go numb with shock.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody sleeps well for months after they look in the albums.
Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can forget the faces of the five students Danny Rolling
murdered on Aug. 24, 25 and 27, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The stoic calm of Christina Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The eerie peace of Christa Hoyt.
</P>
<P>
   The shocked grimace of Manny Taboada.
</P>
<P>
   The dazed disbelief of Sonja Larson.
</P>
<P>
   The pain and defiance of Tracy Paules.
</P>
<P>
   Five kids, just kids. Three of them asleep and waking to stare
up at a monster in a ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   The traces of their short lives are scattered across each of the
8-by-10s:
</P>
<P>
   One photo catches a glimpse of Christa Hoyt's kitchen, a
red-and-white KFC box, one drumstick left, sitting next to a
Dunkin' Donuts box.
</P>
<P>
   Another shows Manny Taboada's and Tracy Paules' apartment, the
living room wall decorated with pictures of Bon Jovi and Paula
Abdul.
</P>
<P>
   In another, Christina Powell's purse is spilled out on the
carpet next to her living room couch. Family pictures, change, a
checkbook, a Bic pen.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary things, juxtaposed against unimaginable violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the cumulative amount of horror'' that haunts people,
says Capt. Sadie Darnell of the Gainesville Police Department, who
was the department's spokesman during the mayhem. Ten years have
gone by, but time hasn't dimmed her bad dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a nightmare about it again, just last night,'' she says.
``For whatever reason, I was thinking about those photos . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   THE FIRST CRIME SCENE: TERRIBLY VIOLENT, 'TERRIBLY SAD'
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, after Rolling was sentenced to death, the photos
were made available to the public but only by appointment and only
at the courthouse with a clerk sitting by.
</P>
<P>
   At first, 50 to 75 people lined up each day to spend 15 minutes
looking at the albums, each filled with approximately 100 photos.
Teachers, criminology students, prison guards, morticians and the
morbidly curious.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks, the binders were loaded into a common, white,
storage box and shipped to the Florida Supreme Court to be
available to justices hearing Rolling's perfunctory appeals over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   When the photos returned to the Alachua courthouse in November
1997, viewers dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, requests are rare. But when they do come, the nightmares
start where the albums do: With a photo of an apartment door.
</P>
<P>
   Flip the first plastic page of one album and there's the
Williamsburg Village apartment of Christina Powell and Sonja
Larson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williamsburg just struck me as terribly sad,'' says Florida
Department of Law Enforcement special agent Ed Dix, who worked the
case for four years from crime scenes to courtroom. ``They're all
sad, but that one hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 17, from Jacksonville, and Larson, 18, from Deerfield
Beach, became friends during summer-session freshman classes when
they shared the same University of Florida dorm. With a third
roommate from Ormond Beach, they rented an apartment for the fall
and settled on No. 113 at Williamsburg, a quasi-colonial style
complex popular with medical students because it's close to Shands
and the VA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The UF freshmen had much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Larson had come from a math and science magnet high school where
she made National Honor Society, played softball and was a manager
for the girls' varsity basketball team. She planned to major in
education and someday open her own daycare.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, also a high school athlete, was the youngest of seven
children. She had graduated from an Episcopal high school, excelled
at Bible study and planned to major in theology.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, 1990, they were busy shopping for move-in stuff at
Wal-Mart. They would make their way through the checkout line
within minutes of a violent Louisiana ex-con named Danny Rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling had arrived by bus from Sarasota five nights before, and
that Friday night, he had made his way out to camp in the woods on
UF property. At Wal-Mart, he bought a $20 tent and shoplifted two
pairs of black gloves, duct tape and a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Did he see Powell and Larson there? No, he told police later.
Not then. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   After shopping, Larson and Powell had dinner at Chili's, then
stopped at a convenience store around 11 p.m. so Larson could call
her mother. Their phone wasn't hooked up yet.
</P>
<P>
   Then they headed back home, intent on getting up early on
Saturday morning. They needed to find jobs and fix up the apartment
before their roommate and Powell's parents arrived on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Larson, wearing a yellow ``Atlanta'' T-shirt with a design of a
dog and the moon, went to sleep in an upstairs bedroom. Powell, in
a yellow tank top, slept downstairs on the living room couch.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling left his campsite, stole a bike and rode to the
Williamsburg apartments. An addicted window peeper, as was Ted
Bundy, Rolling was on the prowl. He stopped at the backyard deck at
apartment 113 and used a large screwdriver to pry open the unlocked
wood door swollen by humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black Isotoner gloves, Rolling took a brown ski mask out
of his hip bag and put it on. The bag also held a Mini-Mag
flashlight, gray duct tape and a 9-millimeter pistol. He crept past
Powell and went upstairs where he found Larson asleep. Rolling
covered her mouth with a 6-inch strip of duct tape as he stabbed
her in the chest near her collarbone. He kept stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went back downstairs, taped Powell's mouth, and when she
awakened, he bound her hands and told her he was going to rape and
kill her. He left the terrified woman for several minutes and went
into the kitchen, where he ate an apple and a banana. Then he raped
and stabbed Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling, the son of a Shreveport, La., cop, used dish soap to
clean the bodies and remove evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a final gruesome act that would become his signature,
he posed the bodies in lewd positions.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's parents, worried because they hadn't heard from their
daughter, arrived on Sunday from Jacksonville. When no one answered
the door, they called police.
</P>
<P>
   All neighbors would remember about No. 113 was the two pretty
brunettes carrying stuff in and hearing George Michael's ``Faith ``
blasting from the apartment early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   SPYING IN THE SHADOWS, WAITING TO STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   Flip another plastic page.
</P>
<P>
   There's a photo of Christa Hoyt's dining room table covered with
pieces of her busy life: A bookstore catalog, black binder, class
schedule, pencils and crumpled paper.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt, 18, wanted to work at an FBI crime lab. The honors student
in chemistry was fascinated by forensic science and worked
full-time as a records clerk for the Alachua County Sheriff's
Office while she went to Santa Fe Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt lived alone in a tree-shaded duplex apartment across from a
trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Rolling had been spying on her for days, watching through
a window as she took a shower.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Aug. 25, as Hoyt was out playing racquetball,
Rolling broke into her apartment and hid behind a bookcase. He
surprised her with a choke hold when she returned home around 11
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After terrorizing and raping her, Rolling forced Hoyt to lie on
her stomach. Then he stabbed her to death. He closed her eyes and
posed her body.
</P>
<P>
   Later, riding a stolen bicycle, Rolling went to a nearby
convenience store for a soda. But when he went to pay, his wallet
was missing. He rushed back to Hoyt's apartment in a panic.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to her bedroom to look for his wallet, he saw that
Hoyt's eyes were open, and he ``freaked.'' He decapitated her, then
smoothed her hair and placed her head on a bookshelf so it would be
the first thing police saw from the bedroom door.
</P>
<P>
   He never found his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   FEAR GRIPS GAINESVILLE: 'NO ONE SLEPT WELL'
</P>
<P>
   The scene of Hoyt's murder was the worst Ed Dix has ever seen.
``It was just beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after her body was found, and Powell's and Larson's murders
were discovered, an army of 600 TV and newspaper reporters
descended on Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie Darnell, the police spokesman, had to tell the world what
had turned Gainesville from a happy campus town to a paranoid armed
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the start of a fall semester for 34,000 students,
priorities switched from bookstore runs to runs to the gun and pawn
shops. Stun guns sold out, and baseball-bat supplies ran low.
Terrified parents either retrieved their kids or retreated with
their kids to fortified Gainesville apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you heard a little creak in the night or heard a little
wind blow, you were up at alert wondering if he was coming through
your window,'' recalls Dix.
</P>
<P>
   Gainesville police chief Wayland Clifton and Sheriff Lu Hindery
combined forces and created a task force that included FDLE, the
FBI and the Florida Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 100 detectives, 50 Florida Highway Troopers in
addition to what is normally here,'' recalls Dix. ``All police
agencies were working seven days a week, split shifts, every
officer was working 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The police
presence was greater than probably any city in the world for that
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no one slept well.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the next victims were found.
</P>
<P>
   TRACY PAULES SCREAMED: 'YOU'RE HIM, AREN'T YOU?'
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Paules, the homecoming queen, liked living with her
platonic pal, Manny Taboada, the football star.
</P>
<P>
   He was 6-feet-2 and 200 pounds, and he made his longtime friend
feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   They were both popular kids, Class of '84, Hialeah's American
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Taboada excelled both on stage, as president of the drama club,
and on the football field, where he played guard. Paules was the
all-American girl: cheerleader, softball player, newspaper editor,
senior class president.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, both worked and went to Miami Dade Community
College before deciding to move to Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Taboada, 23, went to Santa Fe Community College and hoped to
become an architect. Paules, also 23, enrolled at UF intending to
major in law.
</P>
<P>
   Taboada had just gotten a bartending job at Bennigan's near
their apartment. He was late coming home on Monday night, a fact
noted by Paules, who was in her bedroom on the phone, talking to a
friend about what everyone in Gainesville was talking about _ the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   When Taboada got home after 2 a.m., he was exhausted. He said
goodnight to Paules and went to bed wearing a red T-shirt and
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't know was that Rolling was in the woods that
bordered the back of apartment 1203, peeping in their windows.
Rolling had watched Paules for three hours when Taboada came home.
</P>
<P>
   When both were asleep, Rolling used a screwdriver to pry open
the apartment's sliding glass patio doors. Once in the apartment,
he eased past Paules' bedroom, where a light was on. Taboada's room
was dark, his door opened wide enough for his gray and white
Persian cat, Sasha, to come in.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling, in the same black death costume he wore at the previous
murders, pounced on Taboada, plunging the combat knife into his
chest and striking his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhhh, I've been shot,'' Taboada screamed. Although dying on
his waterbed, Taboada fought as Rolling stabbed. ``You bastard!''
Taboada cursed before trying to warn his roommate, ``Ahhhh,
Tracy!''
</P>
<P>
   Paules heard the noise and was in the hallway outside her
bedroom. When she saw Rolling, she jumped back into her room and
slammed the door, which Rolling opened with a kick.
</P>
<P>
   As Rolling wrestled Paules to the bed, she screamed: ``You're
him, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Rolling answered, ``No, lady, I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   After he terrorized and raped her, Rolling had Paules turn over
on her stomach so he wouldn't see her face as he stabbed her in the
back. He did that with each of his female victims. Then he posed
her body in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Police documented it on film, evidence of the most gruesome
murders in Florida's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   THE HAUNTING: FOR SOME, IT NEVER GOES AWAY
</P>
<P>
   The death toll at five, Rolling fled to Tampa and on to Ocala,
where he was arrested Sept. 7 after a botched Winn-Dixie robbery.
Suspecting Rolling of a triple homicide in Louisiana, Shreveport
police traveled to Gainesville to fill cops in on his violent past.
Physical evidence eventually linked Rolling to three of the
Gainesville murders.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, 1994, the day his trial was to begin, he pleaded
guilty to five counts of premeditated murder, three counts of
sexual battery and two counts of burglary/assault. The jury that
sentenced him to death saw just one album of photos. Some details
are too gruesome to ever repeat, even in court.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling spilled his story to his then-fiancee, Sondra London,
who co-authored his book in 1996 but was prohibited from making any
money from ``The Making of A Serial Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the apartment complexes where the students died,
managers throw reporters off the property. The places are rented.
Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Most students at the University of Florida don't know anything
about the murders. They drive by the wall that lists the victims'
names, but they don't know why it's there. Or who Sonja, Christina,
Christa, Manny and Tracy were.
</P>
<P>
   But the police who worked the crime scenes, who live with the
images, know those faces. They know them well. And that's what
makes it so hard to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Snook coordinates the forensics lab work for the Alachua
County Sheriff's Office. Usually, when he works a crime scene, he
doesn't go deeper than what he can see, bag, photograph and dust
for prints.
</P>
<P>
   If he lets a victim's life seep into his, it'll be there
forever. That's what happened to Snook with the student murders.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Sadie Darnell and Ed Dix, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to analyze this one time, and I realized what made
this one different,'' Snook says. ``It's not so much the
gruesomeness of the killings, we see a lot of gruesome things, but
normally, in most cases, you don't get to know the victim as a
person. You don't get to know their family. In this case, with the
length, everything that dragged out, we got to know who these
victims were and got to know their family members, and it got you
away from being analytical. That to me was the biggest
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   On his office wall is a thank-you memorial plaque with photos of
the five students given to him by the families of the victims, who
rewarded police after Rolling's sentencing in 1994 with a luncheon
at Gainesville's upscale Sovereign restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Snook glances up at the plaque.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure what clicks on the crime-scene replay in his mind.
But it's there, he says, and it's always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a horrible thing those last few minutes were for each of
those victims. You think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HEALING: ALWAYS, THEY 'REMEMBER'
</P>
<P>
   Sadie Darnell saw some of her colleagues leave law enforcement
because of the murders. Some journalists did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to deal with the death,'' she says. ``They
didn't want to deal with that constant refrain in your mind of what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell deals with it by ``choosing to be conscious of beautiful
things. I read good books, I watch good, enriching movies. I listen
to classical music, beautiful things like that. I have to remember
there are good things in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonja, Christina, Christa, Tracy and Manny were good things,
beautiful things. Darnell has become a member of their families,
and she continues to speak on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadie is a special kind of person, very efficient, organized,
caring, understanding and intelligent,'' says Sonja Larson's
mother, Ada, who now lives in Boca Raton. ``We have come to love
her dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Darnell and the families will have a memorial service
near the ``Remember'' wall. They recently sandblasted the wall and
covered the panel with a finish that will keep anyone from painting
over it. The city planted five Sabal palms along the median in
their children's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful things. Living things. Lasting things.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep the nightmares away.

 &HT;    GORE CAMPAIGNS IN MIDWEST SWING STATES BOLSTERED BY NEW POLLS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE MARK TWAIN _ Al Gore's presidential campaign found
life on the Mississippi Saturday with word of a new poll suggesting
the vice president may have overtaken Republican rival George W.
Bush in a tight race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll conducted at the end of the Democratic
convention shows the vice president with a 52 percent to 48 percent
lead over Bush in a head-to-head contest, wiping out the double
digit lead the Texas governor scored in the magazine's poll at the
end of the GOP convention two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 806 registered voters showed Gore with a 48 percent
to 42 percent lead over Bush in a four-way contest involving Green
Party candidate and consumer activist Ralph Nader, 3 percent, and
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted last Thursday and Friday after Gore's
acceptance speech, had a margin of error of (+-) 4 percent, meaning
the presidential contest, in Newsweek's most recent assessment, is
virtually a tie _ a major accomplishment for Gore after badly
trailing Bush for months.
</P>
<P>
   After the GOP convention in Philadelphia, the Newsweek poll
showed Bush with a 49-38 percent lead over Gore. And a week ago,
Newsweek gave Bush a 48-38 percent lead over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the poll reached the slow-moving Mark Twain riverboat
shortly after Gore disembarked from Dubuque, Iowa, Saturday for the
second leg of a four-day, 400-mile trip down to Hannibal, Mo.,
through Midwestern states that are crucial to Gore's election
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, wearing jeans, a denim shirt and cowboy boots, paid a
brief visit to the press area on the riverboat to offer an even
briefer assessment of the Newsweek poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction to the Newsweek poll is the same as it has been to
all the polls of the past two years: I really don't think polls
matter,'' Gore said. ``People are now just beginning to pay close
attention to the election.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, with a smile: ``I must admit I'm beginning to
think that the polls have a little more relevancy as we get close
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing significant tightening of this race,'' Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane said. ``This is going to be a very close,
hard-fought race. And what you're seeing is Bush is trying to run,
but he can't hide from the American people on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction to the polls from the Bush
campaign on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, perhaps, was the Newsweek poll's finding that
an increasing number of voters regard Gore as ``personally
likable.'' In the latest poll, 70 percent found him so, up 9
percent from a week earlier. The new poll gave him a 2 percentage
point lead over Bush in this category.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Newsweek poll found that Gore has also wiped out
Bush's lead on such basic Democratic issues as education and Social
Security and replaced it with a commanding lead of his own. In
addition, he has widened his 1 point lead on who is best equipped
to continue the economic expansion of the Clinton years to 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   The post-GOP convention poll had Bush favored to improve
education, 48-39 percent, and saving Social Security, 45-40
percent. But the post-Democratic convention poll showed Gore now
leading 49-35 percent, on education, 51-35 percent on Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Newsweek poll also showed Gore leading 56-30 percent
on the issue of expanding healthcare; 45-39 percent on tax cuts;
58-27 percent on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs for the
elderly; and 42-38 percent on upholding moral values.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane insisted that ``a lot has changed'' since Gore's
acceptance speech at the convention last Thursday, a speech crafted
to reintroduce the vice president as a faithful husband, loving
family man and political champion of average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finally starting to pay attention to the campaign,
and people are finally aware that Al Gore is someone other than
vice president,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's riverbank rallies underscore the point. The crowds at
each have grown steadily, measured in the thousands rather than in
hundreds. And the Mark Twain, a diesel-driven craft designed to
resemble old-fashioned paddle- and steamboats of the 19th century,
has been shadowed by recreational boaters at points along the
Mississippi and often photographed from the houses on the banks of
the river.
</P>
<P>
   Comments from some voters at the rallies suggest Gore was
convincing in asserting in his acceptance speech that he was his
``own man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting his image out,'' said Linda Gavin, a middle-aged
high school physical education teacher from Dubuque. ``He's telling
people what he's all about, not what Clinton was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat trip is taking Gore through five Midwestern states that
President Clinton carried in 1992 and again in 1996, and represent
a total of 61 electoral votes of the 270 needed to win the
presidency: Minnesota, 10; Wisconsin, 11; Illinois, 22; Iowa, 7;
and Missouri, 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction the Midwest goes is the direction the country
goes,'' said Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, four of the states are among the 21 the Bush campaign
announced on Saturday would be part of a new TV ad blitz starting
Monday. It will be the campaign's biggest ad launch so far and
Bush's first for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   His aides declined to say how much Bush _ campaigning in Texas
and New Mexico on Saturday _ spent on the ads, but said they will
focus on education and Bush's leadership.

 &HT;    House of worship now a house divided
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Saturday the rabbi led his congregation in
Sabbath prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the rabbi punched the temple president in the face.
</P>
<P>
   And since that moment last November, animosities simmering for
months at Temple Emanu-El in Palm Beach have boiled over and split
this well-to-do religious community into two infuriated camps.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women who prayed together last year now cross the street
to avoid one another. At least a dozen members disgusted with the
battleground mentality have quit and pledged to drive 70 miles
south to worship with their rabbi at his new Miami Beach temple.
And the factions struggling to control their synagogue's destiny
have wrangled in courthouses, board meetings and the press.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, a house of worship once so united it
raised enough money to entirely rebuild its synagogue has become a
house divided. If there was a flash point, it came the morning one
of the most respected rabbis in the country threw a roundhouse left
to the face of his temple president and knocked him to the floor _
in front of a stunned group of synagogue leaders who represent some
of the most successful and accomplished citizens in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the identity and perhaps even the existence of the
37-year-old temple may be on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer an issue between the rabbi and the
president,'' said Norman Taplin, a longtime temple leader and a
member of one of the founding families. ``It's about the survival
and strength of one of the most prominent synagogues in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   RABBI FELDMAN'S MISSION
</P>
<P>
   At 6-feet-2, Rabbi Leonid Feldman is a striking man with a full
head of dark hair he wears longish in the back. He speaks with a
slight accent from his native Kishinev in the former Soviet Union,
and in conversation he leans slightly forward and his eyes lock
intently on his subject.
</P>
<P>
   As a Russian Jew born behind Stalin's Iron Curtain, his
ambitions should have shriveled at an early age. But Feldman is, if
nothing else, a man of exceptional energy and intellect. And being
thwarted was not in his plans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when he was 23, he applied for a visa to emigrate to
Israel. It was a bold move in its day, and, as the story is told,
retribution was swift: He was fired from his job as a teacher. In
what has become an almost legendary episode among his congregation,
Feldman staged a hunger strike and sent telegrams of protest to
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter. He was
imprisoned for a month before being released and allowed to go to
Israel. In 1980, he came to America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Emanu-El fired its rabbi and started looking for a
replacement. By this point, Feldman was already a nationally
renowned lecturer. Though he was just 35, the synagogue wanted him
so much that when he negotiated for six trips a year to lecture _
in addition to his eight weeks vacation _ the temple agreed. His
sense of self and confidence suited the community perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make one thing clear,'' Feldman told the board of
trustees as they were courting him. ``I want to be a role model for
your sons and daughters, granddaughters and grandsons. Therefore,
I'm going to drive a nice car; I'm going to wear nice clothes; I'm
going to ask for a very nice salary. When some of your brilliant
children and grandchildren are sitting in the sanctuary, looking up
at me, I want them to think, 'I could be a doctor, I could be a
broker, I could be a lawyer, but I want to be a rabbi, just like
Rabbi Feldman.' . . . I want to destroy the image of the eastern
European rabbi who's a poor guy everyone feels sorry for.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the moment Feldman arrived, he began delivering on
his promises of making Emanu-El the diamond in the crown of Jewish
South Florida. He earned a salary that, according to board members,
would eventually top out at between $200,000 and $250,000. He began
bringing in high-profile speakers: vice-presidential candidate Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, Vice President Al Gore, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and
Camelia Sadat, the daughter of assassinated Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Feldman pushed for a fund-raising campaign to rebuild
the temple and add a school. The campaign took three years, raised
$8 million and entirely renovated the temple, replete with
meditation garden and, in season, valet parking for congregants.
The sanctuary itself is long and slightly sloping toward the
pulpit. Mosaics and stained glass windows of Jerusalem line the
walls, and light from a sun roof shines onto the pulpit during
Sabbath morning services. Etched in stone in both Hebrew and
English on the ark containing the Torah are the words: ``Hear O
Israel, the Lord is Our God the Lord is One.''
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue and the new rabbi attracted a veritable Who's Who
of the Jewish American business and philanthropic class. Wealthy
and well-established members like S. Daniel Abraham of Slim-Fast,
the Resnicks, the Bronfmans, the Lauders and hundreds more helped
create what became a tremendous Jewish renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   An island that just two decades before had openly discouraged
Jews from buying homes was giddily likened to Manhattan's Upper
East Side. Between 1988 and 1999, membership almost tripled _ from
300 families to more than 850. When he was hired, Feldman had said:
``People will run to the synagogue, because it will give them a lot
of the things that they cannot get in the country clubs or The
Breakers hotel or wherever else they are going.'' And he was
proving himself right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a magnificent speaker,'' said congregant Patricia
Lovit. ``He was dynamic about everything he did. He inspired me to
the point where I now read the Torah at the drop of a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Feldman never seemed to be without a dozen things to do
at once. And though the size of the congregation grew and grew, the
lay leadership could never agree on an assistant rabbi to help him
with his increasing responsibilities. The strain began to take its
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so overworked that it was really starting to show,''
said Dick Weinstein, Feldman's father-in-law and a member of the
board of trustees. ``Everybody wants the rabbi, and I'm talking
about everybody. He had no life, he had no help. It was wearing him
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the community felt slighted if the rabbi didn't
call after a parent died or make time for their particular woes.
Others felt they were ignored if they were not useful as
fund-raisers or benefactors. Yes, there was a cult of charisma that
followed Feldman, almost everyone who knew him agreed. But if this
``rock star rabbi'' in his fancy European cars didn't have time for
his congregants, what was the point?
</P>
<P>
   TEMPLE ELECTS A PRESIDENT
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the rabbi were growing by the time Stephen
Levin was elected president of Temple Emanu-El's board of trustees
three years ago. At 5-feet-8, Levin is not nearly as imposing a
figure as Feldman, but he harbors an acute sense of power and
simultaneously manages to convey the demeanor of both a salesman
and a CEO. He has succeeded at both because he is able to motivate
people to do what he wants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a conservative Jewish household in Reading, Pa.,
Levin, 54, earned his reputation as a savvy, aggressive businessman
early. After his father became ill, he took over the family's
Coca-Cola distributorship when he was 29, and over the next 10
years branched out, eventually owning 55 Pizza Huts and a
half-dozen other ventures. When he moved to Florida in 1986, he
sold most of his businesses and bought a beverage distribution
company that today employs more than 500 people and does a
quarter-billion in sales a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he built a $9 million, 15,000-square-foot Palm Beach
mansion. The front door opens into a cavernous living room with a
broad view of the backyard pool, a pair of 10-foot statues and then
the Intracoastal. Inside, dozens of Chagalls, Miros and other 20th
century paintings and sculptures are scattered like toys on walls
and tables and on the floor, waiting for wallpaper to be put up so
they can be rehung.
</P>
<P>
   His third wife, Petra, is a former Miss Germany. Married in
June, they end most exchanges with the words ``love you,'' and hold
hands when they speak.
</P>
<P>
   Still in his 40s and eager to network, Levin was a natural
choice for Feldman in 1993 when the rabbi needed a go-getter to
chair the synagogue's ``21st Century Campaign.'' With Feldman
making the spiritual pitch and Levin closing the deals, the pair
was largely responsible for the success of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked well together,'' Feldman said of the collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   And Levin enjoyed the work. Already a member of several civic
boards, he continued to volunteer at the temple after the campaign
was complete. Mostly, he said, he wanted to ensure his community
had a strong, progressive synagogue for his youngest son from his
second marriage to attend. Levin became the synagogue's treasurer,
and in 1998, with the rabbi's blessing, he was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   FACTIONS ARISE
</P>
<P>
   Grumbling about clergy is the rule, not the exception, in
virtually every house of worship. In a place where people are
married, children are confirmed and parents are mourned,
attachments run deep and jealousies fester.
</P>
<P>
   But Temple Emanu-El is not any house of worship. It is a social
beehive filled with philanthropists and captains of industry.
Neurologists and trial lawyers are rank-and-file here. And while
there are plenty of middle class members, there are more than a
fair share of extremely successful members accustomed to getting
things done their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Palm Beach, everybody is a somebody,'' Feldman said last
week. ``And if they are not, then they think they are.''
</P>
<P>
   As the temple began to grow, opinion formed along two lines
about the man who led the prayers. In the pro-Feldman camp were
people thrilled to see the membership multiply and the buildings
expand. In the anti-Feldman camp were those who ruefully watched
the synagogue lose its rarefied air as more and more people came
from the less prestigious south end of the island and eventually
from West Palm Beach and points north and west.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the egos was the issue of how a synagogue on this island
of privilege should conduct itself. This was not, after all,
Brooklyn, some members agitated. It was Palm Beach, and we should
conduct ourselves accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   That was not Feldman's style. When a member complained that the
congregation's traditional dancing in the street with Old Testament
scrolls during the Simchat Torah celebration embarrassed the Jews
of the community, the rabbi handled the situation with
characteristic bluntness:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you one thing. Even the KGB allowed Jews to dance
in the streets once a year in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Feldman refused to congratulate a congregant who was
engaged to a non-Jew, the congregant's aunt called to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is stabbing the Jewish people in the back, and you think
this is harsh on my part?'' Feldman said to the aunt.
``Intermarriage is one of the worst crimes a Jew can commit after 6
million Jews marched into the gas chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late '90s, factions had begun to crystallize. There were
those who had been touched by Feldman personally and spoke of him
in reverent tones. And there were those who felt he was too proud
and had created a synagogue that was more an extension of his ego
than a spiritual Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   For some this was OK. ``For a man like this, you take what you
can and enjoy it,'' said Dr. Jerry Singer, the lone member of the
executive committee to support the rabbi through his departure.
``But others wanted more, always more.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman was not unaware of the split within the synagogue.
Dynamic people challenge sacred cows and invite judgment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, that's why his hero is the Bible's King David.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had weaknesses, and he's not boring. People who are
fascinating have a very powerful . . . what we call in Hebrew . . .
``yetzer ha-tov'' and, simultaneously, ``yetzer ha-rah,'' an
impulse for good and an impulse for bad _ a passion for goodness
and an evil inclination. It's what makes people interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BREAKING POINT
</P>
<P>
   What Stephen Levin found when he took over as president, he
said, was a rabbi who had operated without accountability for the
past decade. At the helm of the synagogue was a man who ``had an
ego the size of this house.'' Feldman was, in Levin's assessment,
``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Levin felt it was his mandate to rein the rabbi
in. To begin with, he asked Feldman to start telling the board
where he was and what he was doing with his time. Levin wanted to
know when he was leaving town and where he was going, and when he
wasn't informed to his satisfaction, he began to insist. If Feldman
began to stew, those around him didn't notice: ``He was not a happy
camper, but he is the kind of guy who keeps things to himself,''
said Weinstein, his father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions grew and built to the breaking point at an executive
board meeting one Sunday morning last November at Levin's home. As
the rabbi sat in one of the living rooms in the south wing of the
house with the 10-member executive committee, the conversation
turned again, to accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated and angry, Feldman threw a piece of paper pertaining
to his schedule onto a glass coffee table in front of the
president. Seated on an ottoman to Feldman's right just two feet
away, Levin picked up the paper, crumpled it and threw it back at
the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't what we're talking about,'' Levin said. The rabbi
stood up next to Levin and threw a roundhouse left into Levin's
face. The temple president said he never saw the punch coming. When
it landed under his right eye, it knocked him to the polished
granite floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' Levin said. ``I couldn't believe it.'' Other
men from the executive committee jumped up and pulled Feldman back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was immediately remorseful,'' said Gladys Jacobson, the
committee's recording secretary, who was there. ``He certainly
didn't come there meaning to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jacobson doesn't excuse Feldman. ``He wasn't
provoked,'' she said firmly. ``Our intentions were to meet inthe
spirit of cooperation. We even chose Steve's home rather than an
office to keep a warmer atmosphere. This was purely to better
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Singer saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an hour, everybody in turn was criticizing his abilities
as a rabbi in addition to criticizing his time away from the
temple,'' Singer said. ``It wasn't that the tone was so harsh, but
it kept going. They would say, 'Rabbi, you know I love you, but you
let me down.' 'Rabbi, you know I respect you, you did my husband's
funeral, but you've lost touch with the congregation.' This is a
guy who put his soul into making this one of the premier synagogues
in the world, and they were tearing him apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended with Feldman apologizing for hitting Levin,
the committee pledging to keep the matter quiet. There was talk of
anger-management classes. Levin promised not to fire the rabbi or
file charges. The next day, the rabbi called each member of the
board and apologized again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have pressed charges,'' Levin said last week,
sitting on the same ottoman where he was hit. ``But I was in a
lose-lose situation. The season was just getting under way, and
where are you going to get another rabbi at the last minute?''
</P>
<P>
   The punch left a bruise under Levin's right eye for two weeks.
Word of the incident spread like an oil leak in the sea. In March,
Feldman announced he was leaving. At a later meeting when some
congregants asked if the board had anything to do with his
departure, Feldman said they did. The remark heated up the already
volatile situation, and Levin found himself the victim of the same
sort of whisper campaign the rabbi had faced: He didn't come to
synagogue enough; he was married to a gentile and shouldn't be
allowed to hold elected office. Perhaps the most consistent opinion
was that he was selfish and mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would I describe him?'' asked Sheldon Bufferd, a
decade-long temple member. ``In a word: dictatorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Things went from contentious to fierce. Hundreds of congregants
signed a petition to vote on Levin's removal, but he refused to
hold a meeting. Levin then fired two executive board members who
supported the rabbi, and the members took him to court. At stake
was the release of a 16-page report detailing the circumstances
leading to Feldman's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, half of the board of trustees met without Levin
or any members of the executive committee present and dismissed
them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dissident executive committee,'' said Bufferd, who
believes Levin must have provoked the rabbi. ``We all have a
breaking point, and this harassment had been going on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Levin's board and the rival trustees intend to hold
meetings a half-hour apart at the temple to debate how to best
carry on. Each side considers the other illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bufferd _ like dozens of other members _ said
he has no intention of leaving the synagogue. And while he has lost
respect for ``the other side,'' he is ``determined I'm not going to
let these people chase me away from my temple.''
</P>
<P>
   NOBODY'S PERFECT
</P>
<P>
   From Miami Beach where he has since moved to lead another
temple, Feldman said last week that he is watching the imbroglio at
the prestigious synagogue with a great deal of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a big piece of my heart and soul in Palm Beach, and I
care very much what will happen there,'' he said. ``I hope and pray
for peace. I did not want the fighting . . . I am trying to
maintain the dignity of the place. Nobody wins. This is a house of
worship. It is a sacred place, and it is the sacred duty of the
rabbi to try and be above the politics and personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he hit Levin and what was _ or was not _ going through
his mind, Feldman said he didn't ``know how much detail he wanted
to get into.'' His 12-year tenure should speak for itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his hero, King David, and about ``yetzer ha-tov''
and ``yetzer ha-rah'' and how they may apply to the situation, he
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting metaphor. An interesting parallel. Nobody
is perfect _ it is one of the things I adore about the Jewish
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heroes, none of them are perfect, and I think that's what
makes it so compelling, because none of us are perfect. I could
relate to somebody like David, somebody like Moses. Even Moses who
is the greatest teacher, he too made mistakes. In fact, he was
punished in the most cruel way in not being allowed by God to enter
the Promised Land . . . We are dynamic creatures and we struggle
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   From his mansion in Palm Beach, Levin has drawn his own
conclusions about his three years as temple president:
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral of the story for me is that I think I'll stick to
community endeavors that don't involve religion.''

 &HT;    House of worship now a house divided
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Saturday the rabbi led his congregation in
Sabbath prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the rabbi punched the temple president in the face.
</P>
<P>
   And since that moment last November, animosities simmering for
months at Temple Emanu-El in Palm Beach have boiled over and split
this well-to-do religious community into two infuriated camps.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women who prayed together last year now cross the street
to avoid one another. At least a dozen members disgusted with the
battleground mentality have quit and pledged to drive 70 miles
south to worship with their rabbi at his new Miami Beach temple.
And the factions struggling to control their synagogue's destiny
have wrangled in courthouses, board meetings and the press.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, a house of worship once so united it
raised enough money to entirely rebuild its synagogue has become a
house divided. If there was a flash point, it came the morning one
of the most respected rabbis in the country threw a roundhouse left
to the face of his temple president and knocked him to the floor _
in front of a stunned group of synagogue leaders who represent some
of the most successful and accomplished citizens in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the identity and perhaps even the existence of the
37-year-old temple may be on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer an issue between the rabbi and the
president,'' said Norman Taplin, a longtime temple leader and a
member of one of the founding families. ``It's about the survival
and strength of one of the most prominent synagogues in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   RABBI FELDMAN'S MISSION
</P>
<P>
   At 6-feet-2, Rabbi Leonid Feldman is a striking man with a full
head of dark hair he wears longish in the back. He speaks with a
slight accent from his native Kishinev in the former Soviet Union,
and in conversation he leans slightly forward and his eyes lock
intently on his subject.
</P>
<P>
   As a Russian Jew born behind Stalin's Iron Curtain, his
ambitions should have shriveled at an early age. But Feldman is, if
nothing else, a man of exceptional energy and intellect. And being
thwarted was not in his plans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when he was 23, he applied for a visa to emigrate to
Israel. It was a bold move in its day, and, as the story is told,
retribution was swift: He was fired from his job as a teacher. In
what has become an almost legendary episode among his congregation,
Feldman staged a hunger strike and sent telegrams of protest to
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter. He was
imprisoned for a month before being released and allowed to go to
Israel. In 1980, he came to America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Emanu-El fired its rabbi and started looking for a
replacement. By this point, Feldman was already a nationally
renowned lecturer. Though he was just 35, the synagogue wanted him
so much that when he negotiated for six trips a year to lecture _
in addition to his eight weeks vacation _ the temple agreed. His
sense of self and confidence suited the community perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make one thing clear,'' Feldman told the board of
trustees as they were courting him. ``I want to be a role model for
your sons and daughters, granddaughters and grandsons. Therefore,
I'm going to drive a nice car; I'm going to wear nice clothes; I'm
going to ask for a very nice salary. When some of your brilliant
children and grandchildren are sitting in the sanctuary, looking up
at me, I want them to think, 'I could be a doctor, I could be a
broker, I could be a lawyer, but I want to be a rabbi, just like
Rabbi Feldman.' . . . I want to destroy the image of the eastern
European rabbi who's a poor guy everyone feels sorry for.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the moment Feldman arrived, he began delivering on
his promises of making Emanu-El the diamond in the crown of Jewish
South Florida. He earned a salary that, according to board members,
would eventually top out at between $200,000 and $250,000. He began
bringing in high-profile speakers: vice-presidential candidate Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, Vice President Al Gore, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and
Camelia Sadat, the daughter of assassinated Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Feldman pushed for a fund-raising campaign to rebuild
the temple and add a school. The campaign took three years, raised
$8 million and entirely renovated the temple, replete with
meditation garden and, in season, valet parking for congregants.

Sabbath morning services. Etched in stone in both Hebrew and
English on the ark containing the Torah are the words: ``Hear O
Israel, the Lord is Our God the Lord is One.''
</P>

   The synagogue and the new rabbi attracted a veritable Who's Who
of the Jewish American business and philanthropic class. Wealthy
and well-established members like S. Daniel Abraham of Slim-Fast,
the Resnicks, the Bronfmans, the Lauders and hundreds more helped
create what became a tremendous Jewish renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   An island that just two decades before had openly discouraged
Jews from buying homes was ghattan's Upper East Side. Between 1988
and 1999, membership almost tripled _ from 300 families to more
than 850. When he was hired, Feldman had said: ``People will run to
the synagogue, because it will give them a lot of the things that
they cannot get in the country clubs or The Breakers hotel or
wherever else they are going.'' And he was proving himself right.

mansion. The front door opens into a cavernous living room with a
broad view of the backyard pool, a pair of 10-foot statues and then

can and enjoy it,'' said Dr. Jerry Singer, the lone member of the
executive committee to support the rabbi through his departure.
``But others wanted more, always more.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman was not unaware of the split within the synagogue.
Dynamic people challenge sacred cows and invite judgment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, that's why his hero is the Bible's King David.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had weaknesses, and he's not boring. People who are
fascinating have a very powerful . . . what we call in Hebrew . . .
``yetzer ha-tov'' and, simultaneously, ``yetzer ha-rah,'' an
impulse for good and an impulse for bad _ a passion for goodness
and an evil inclination. It's what makes people interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BREAKING POINT
</P>
<P>
   What Stephen Levin found when he took over as president, he
said, was a rabbi who had operated without accountability for the
past decade. At the helm of the synagogue was a man who ``had an
ego the size of this house.'' Feldman was, in Levin's assessment,
``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Levin felt it was his mandate to rein the rabbi
in. To begin with, he asked Feldman to start telling the board
where he was and what he was doing with his time. Levin wanted to
know when he was leaving town and where he was going, and when he
wasn't informed to his satisfaction, he began to insist. If Feldman
began to stew, those around him didn't notice: ``He was not a happy
camper, but he is the kind of guy who keeps things to himself,''
said Weinstein, his father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions grew and built to the breaking point at an executive
board meeting one Sunday morning last November at Levin's home. As
the rabbi sat in one of the living rooms in the south wing of the
house with the 10-member executive committee, the conversation
turned again, to accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated and angry, Feldman threw a piece of paper pertaining
to his schedule onto a glass coffee table in front of the
president. Seated on an ottoman to Feldman's right just two feet
away, Levin picked up the paper, crumpled it and threw it back at
the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't what we're talking about,'' Levin said. The rabbi
stood up next to Levin and threw a roundhouse left into Levin's
face. The temple president said he never saw the punch coming. When
it landed under his right eye, it knocked him to the polished
granite floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' Levin said. ``I couldn't believe it.'' Other
men from the executive committee jumped up and pulled Feldman back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was immediately remorseful,'' said Gladys Jacobson, the
committee's recording secretary, who was there. ``He certainly
didn't come there meaning to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jacobson doesn't excuse Feldman. ``He wasn't
provoked,'' she said firmly. ``Our intentions were to meet in the
spirit of cooperation. We even chose Steve's home rather than an
office to keep a warmer atmosphere. This was purely to better
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Singer saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an hour, everybody in turn was criticizing his abilities
as a rabbi in addition to criticizing his time away from the
temple,'' Singer said. ``It wasn't that the tone was so harsh, but
it kept going. They would say, 'Rabbi, you know I love you, but you
let me down.' 'Rabbi, you know I respect you, you did my husband's
funeral, but you've lost touch with the congregation.' This is a
guy who put his soul into making this one of the premier synagogues
in the world, and they were tearing him apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended with Feldman apologizing for hitting Levin,
the committee pledging to keep the matter quiet. There was talk of
anger-management classes. Levin promised not to fire the rabbi or
file charges. The next day, the rabbi called each member of the
board and apologized again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have pressed charges,'' Levin said last week,
sitting on the same ottoman where he was hit. ``But I was in a
lose-lose situation. The season was just getting under way, and
where are you going to get another rabbi at the last minute?''
</P>
<P>
   The punch left a bruise under Levin's right eye for two weeks.
Word of the incident spread like an oil leak in the sea. In March,
Feldman announced he was leaving. At a later meeting when some
congregants asked if the board had anything to do with his
departure, Feldman said they did. The remark heated up the already
volatile situation, and Levin found himself the victim of the same
sort of whisper campaign the rabbi had faced: He didn't come to
synagogue enough; he was married to a gentile and shouldn't be
allowed to hold elected office. Perhaps the most consistent opinion
was that he was selfish and mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would I describe him?'' asked Sheldon Bufferd, a
decade-long temple member. ``In a word: dictatorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Things went from contentious to fierce. Hundreds of congregants
signed a petition to vote on Levin's removal, but he refused to
hold a meeting. Levin then fired two executive board members who
supported the rabbi, and the members took him to court. At stake
was the release of a 16-page report detailing the circumstances
leading to Feldman's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, half of the board of trustees met without Levin
or any members of the executive committee present and dismissed
them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dissident executive committee,'' said Bufferd, who
believes Levin must have provoked the rabbi. ``We all have a
breaking point, and this harassment had been going on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Levin's board and the rival trustees intend to hold
meetings a half-hour apart at the temple to debate how to best
carry on. Each side considers the other illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bufferd _ like dozens of other members _ said
he has no intention of leaving the synagogue. And while he has lost
respect for ``the other side,'' he is ``determined I'm not going to
let these people chase me away from my temple.''
</P>
<P>
   NOBODY'S PERFECT
</P>
<P>
   From Miami Beach where he has since moved to lead another
temple, Feldman said last week that he is watching the imbroglio at
the prestigious synagogue with a great deal of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a big piece of my heart and soul in Palm Beach, and I
care very much what will happen there,'' he said. ``I hope and pray
for peace. I did not want the fighting . . . I am trying to
maintain the dignity of the place. Nobody wins. This is a house of
worship. It is a sacred place, and it is the sacred duty of the
rabbi to try and be above the politics and personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he hit Levin and what was _ or was not _ going through
his mind, Feldman said he didn't ``know how much detail he wanted
to get into.'' His 12-year tenure should speak for itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his hero, King David, and about ``yetzer ha-tov''
and ``yetzer ha-rah'' and how they may apply to the situation, he
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting metaphor. An interesting parallel. Nobody
is perfect _ it is one of the things I adore about the Jewish
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heroes, none of them are perfect, and I think that's what
makes it so compelling, because none of us are perfect. I could
relate to somebody like David, somebody like Moses. Even Moses who
is the greatest teacher, he too made mistakes. In fact, he was
punished in the most cruel way in not being allowed by God to enter
the Promised Land . . . We are dynamic creatures and we struggle
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   From his mansion in Palm Beach, Levin has drawn his own
conclusions about his three years as temple president:
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral of the story for me is that I think I'll stick to
community endeavors that don't involve religion.''

 &HT;    Planned execution draws international criticism on state
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook and Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An international furor is rising over the scheduled
execution Thursday of Georgia prisoner Alexander Williams, who was
17 when he raped and killed a teenage model and now, 15 years
later, is termed ``flagrantly psychotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem focused on some punitive action against a man who
isn't even capable of understanding his own death,'' said Cynthia
Wayne Scott, executive director of the National Mental Health
Association of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva last week, the United Nations Subcommittee on Human
Rights said imposing the death penalty on a prisoner who was under
18 when the crime was committed ``is contrary to customary
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's group and Amnesty International are leading efforts to
persuade the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute
Williams' sentence to life in prison. The Children's Defense Fund,
the Rainbow Coalition, former first lady Rosalynn Carter and the
archbishop of Atlanta also have asked the board to spare Williams'
life.
</P>
<P>
   The board will consider these appeals Tuesday. Williams' legal
appeals have been exhausted, but his attorneys intend to file new
court actions Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The objections to Williams' execution are threefold, and by and
large have been unchallenged:
</P>
<P>
   He was a month short of adulthood when he abducted Aleta Carol
Bunch, 16, from an Augusta mall, raped her, shot her to death,
stole her car and divided up her jewelry and purchases among his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   His court-appointed attorney did not interview members of his
family, which would have revealed Williams' history of emotional
and physical abuse and mental problems. When the attorney put
Williams' mother on the stand in the sentencing phase, he asked her
merely to ``say something nice'' about her son.
</P>
<P>
   PLEA FOR COMPASSION
</P>
<P>
   Court filings contend that Williams, now 32, is insane and
delusional, and is unable to comprehend what awaits him at 7 p.m.
Thursday in the death chamber at the Diagnostic and Classification
Prison near Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   However, Williams wrote a three-page letter to the parole board
on Aug. 9, confessing his guilt for the first time and asking ``the
people of Georgia to show compassion towards me.'' Its lucidity was
clouded only by failed flights of eloquence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes have adjusted from those of headstrong, willful and
wayward youth in the face of impending consequence, to those of
adulthood and the reality of a brief moments span where life was
lost andthe grief it caused,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never my intent to kill anyone . . . My thinking
eventually was irrational and my judgement clouded. But I had since
begun walking the wrong path and so the events that led to the loss
of life unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deepest regrets and most sincere apology to Ms. Aleta
Bunch. May she rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bunch, the victim's mother, was unimpressed. ``I know
Rosalyn Carter wrote, asking for clemency. She ought to take him
home with her,'' she said. ``I don't think a week before he's to be
executed, him saying `I'm sorry' for his arrogance cuts anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections policy forbids discussion of a
prisoner's mental and physical health records. But an appeal
rejected last month, and Williams' disciplinary record, indicate he
is not only deeply disturbed, but dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   He has attacked guards on several occasions, and in 1990 he was
written up for ``causing an injury to a visitor.'' According to
Corrections spokesman Mike Light, when attorney Gary Alexion came
to see Williams, Alexion demanded, over the guards' warnings, that
Williams' handcuffs be removedt. No sooner had that been done than
Williams attacked Alexion. It took four officers to subdue him.
</P>
<P>
   When an unnamed female attorney came to his cell to have him
sign some papers that same year, Williams responded by dropping his
pants and exposing himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court filings, which contained 22 pages of
notes Williams' attorneys said came from his prison psychological
records, initial tests when he entered prison in 1986 showed
``evidence of substantial, generalized psychotic illness, which
tends to make his behavior bizarre and inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in internal medicine, called in to check Williams
when he refused to eat in 1990, reported ``he is under demonic
attack'' and apparently tried to exorcise him. Failing, he noted
that ``if the chaplain is experienced in spiritual warfare, he
should be seeing this man.''
</P>
<P>
   After the attack on his attorney, a psychologist reported that
Williams told her ``the little red man in the attorney's eye had
something to do with it . . . He claims to have started seeing the
little red man after he stopped seeing the green frogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notes indicate that Williams decided Sigourney Weaver was
God, believed that insects had removed his left eye and substituted
a shell, and, in June1999, remained ``psychotic and potentially
dangerous.'' In December, according to the notes, he was diagnosed
as suffering ``chronic paranoid schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes indicate he has been on and off medication to
stabilize his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``What value is there to society to kill a man who has
schizophrenia and is psychotic?'' asked Scott, the mental health
advocate. ``We're going to be in the eye of the world. I hope we
can do better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The international eye appears to be focused primarily through
the London Web site of Amnesty International, which carries a
26-page denunciation of the pending execution.
</P>
<P>
   While presenting a case for Williams on all three major points,
Amnesty appears chiefly concerned with the fact that he was a
juvenile when he killed Bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the United States a ``rogue nation,'' Amnesty says ``it
is clear that outside of the USA, the practice of executing people
for crimes they committed when they were children has almost been
eradicated from the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty argues that Williams' execution would violate
international treaties, citing the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights and ``customary international law.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's lawyers have argued that individuals cannot claim
they have suffered because of violations of international treaties
that are ``contracts between or among independent nations.'' They
also pointed out that the United States did not agree to the
minimum age limitation contained in the fifth paragraph of Article
Six in the ICCPR.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death penalty was reinstated in Georgia in 1973, 23
men have been executed. Of those, only one, Christopher Burger, was
under 18 at the time of his crime. Jerome Bowden was executed in
1986, despite being classified as mentally retarded, which prompted
passage of a law forbidding the execution of a retarded person.
William Henry Hance was suffering hallucinations by the time he was
executed in 1994 for a 1978 murder
</P>
<P>
   Williams' execution would be the first in Georgia in 2 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has accepted death penalty laws, such as
Georgia's, that can be applied to defendants as young as 17.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond County Marshal Steve Smith was one of the sheriff's
detectives who investigated the killing of Aleta Bunch. He said
Williams and his friends _ who later testified against Williams _
freely used the girl's parents' credit cards, taken from her,
beginning the day she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was street smart, `` Smith recalled. ``He was very cocky,
very arrogant. He didn't want to talk to us.'' As a result, the
sole interview with detectives ``didn't last long enough for us to
tell anything about his mental state.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence against Williams was overwhelming, and he was swiftly
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International, defense attorney O.L.
Collins never interviewed Williams' family. ``Collins did not
request a psychiatric evaluation of his client, and did no further
investigation into his psychological history or condition. Neither
did he present any argument for leniency on the basis of Williams'
young age _ which the Supreme Court had described . . . as a
``mitigating factor of great weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins is dead now. Smith, who sat at the prosecution table for
the trial, said he ``did not have a high-profile reputation as a
defense attorney .''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only defense testimony at sentencing was that Alex was a
good kid who liked comic books,'' said Mark Olive, Williams'
present attorney. ``This was a beaten-up kid who was succumbing to
reality-bending schizophrenia. The jurors would not have sentenced
Alex to death if they knew the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, Georgia does not even seek the death penalty on
kids anymore,'' Olive said. ``This execution would be a horrible
footnote to a foregone process.''

 &HT;    Miller's chances for '00 not great
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shannon Miller arrived at the Olympic trials and was
surprised to find out that one of her balance beam skills had been
devalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Miller,'' she said of the back handspring with a
quarter twist. ``It's no longer worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old herself isn't pulling down the high scores she
did in 1996 or 1992, when she won seven Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
   That means national team coordinator Bela Karolyi will be
walking a fine line tonight, when he has the most say in choosing
the Olympic team. Does he go with Miller, who has the biggest name
and reputation but only the seventh-best scores Friday, or a trio
of relative unknowns?
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Elise Ray, the national champion, and two-time
national champ Kristen Maloney will anchor the team. Amy Chow, a
1996 team gold medalist and silver medalist on uneven bars, has
moved up to third place and is also one of Karolyi's favorites.
</P>
<P>
   That's three.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Dantzscher, currently in fourth place, finished third at
nationals but has to overcome a reputation for inconsistency
earlier this year. Vanessa Atler, once one of the country's
strongest gymnasts, has been struggling, but Karolyi likes her
explosiveness. Morgan White, who was seventh at nationals, is now
fifth and Karolyi always speaks highly of her, too. And two-time
Olympian Dominique Dawes is still in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence and experience is one thing,'' said Miller, who is
working on adding difficulty to her routines, ``but you have to be
able to do the stuff, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi said he didn't expect all three remaining members of
Atlanta's Magnificent Seven to make it to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my ultimate dream,'' he said, ``to see a split
participation between the old generation and the new. But the new
generation is extremely strong.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, six women will be on the team, five will compete on
each event and four scores will count.
</P>
<P>
   In Dantzscher's favor is the fact that she's good in vault,
which is expected to be the U.S. team's weakest event. Miller's
best events, uneven bars and balance beam, mirror those of Ray and
Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the chance to be on this team,'' Miller
said, ``and then over the next four weeks really nail down all my
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But time may be running out.

 &HT;    Finding farm where career is left fallow
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FINCHVILLE, Ky. _ Ten years ago Jody Mudd had the world on a
string. He had mounted the crest of a career and all that he could
see around him was good. He had won The Players Championship and
the Tour Championship the same year, two biggest payoffs on the PGA
Tour (only Tom Kite has ever done that) and ranked 5th in earnings.
He was only 30 years old. There was nothing out there to stop him _
but himself.
</P>
<P>
   He developed an affection for the British Open. Links courses
aroused his competitive juices, and in 1989 he finished fifth, in
1990 fourth (at St. Andrews) and in 1991 fifth again. I remember
sitting with him in the Delta Crown Room at Gatwick after one of
those glowing finishes when he said, ``Man, I love this tournament.
I'm going to come back as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   On this side of the pond, though, all was not well. Rank dropped
from fifth to 105th on the American tour. Himself must have taken
charge, for before long it was as if he had vanished from the face
of the earth. By 1995 he played in only nine tournaments, and the
next year four, and never made a dime.
</P>
<P>
   The story got around that he had bought a farm near Louisville,
and was going into breeding and racing thoroughbreds. He came from
Kentucky, born and reared in Louisville, land of the Kentucky
Derby, and interest in race horses goes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But to give up on a career such as Jody Mudd had going? He is
said to have told friends he was ``burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Finchville, we were told, is where he was located. It's the
address listed in the PGA Tour press guide. You see, winning The
Players Championship wins the champion 10 years exemption on the
tour, and whether you play or not, you're still listed among the
actives. Mudd's exemption runs out this year and with the PGA
Championship being played a few miles up the road, near the village
of Eastwood, it seemed fitting to check him out.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Finchville, I never found it. At a real estate
office in Simpsonville, I got directions to Jodie Mudd's farm, down
Buckcreek Road, a blacktop lane across Interstate 64, by broad
spreads of well-tended pastures and substantial houses, coming to a
sign that read: ``For Sale _ 100 acres, Bob Dorgan, agent.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard that Mudd was selling the farm and moving to Florida.
This was confirmation, I supposed. The house on top of the hill
stood silent and looked uninhabited, but a ring of the doorbell and
a lady answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought the house and 26 acres and just moved in last
week,'' said the lady identifying herself as Beth McConnell. ``Jody
told us he was going to Saratoga, but he was back a couple of days
later trying to round up two cows that had been running loose. I
thought he might be at the golf tournament, but he said he was
going to Saratoga.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the high racing season at Saratoga, but late for the
Saratoga sales, which require a substantial cash reserve.
Apparently, the thoroughbred business hadn't turned out well,
though you hear stories of a couple of fillies that won races for
him this summer. Nothing confirmed, but then, little can be
confirmed in Jody Mudd's recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you say he last played golf?'' Mrs. McConnell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``About four years ago, 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she said, ``that was about the time of the divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Conjecture was that isolated farm life wasn't the wife's cup of
tea and she had taken her leave and returned to Atlanta, her home.
A divorce soon followed and Mudd has lived a rather reclusive life
since, with no indication of return to the professional tour. He
has played in a rare regional tournament now and then, finished
second in the Kentucky State Open last year, but reviving a golf
game that has been mothballed for a few years isn't as simple as
pulling the clubs out of the closet and dusting them off.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Mudd comes from a golfing family. Two brothers are
professionals, Tommy and Eddie, who had serious heart surgery
recently. Jody was a star at Georgia Southern, won two U.S.
Publinks championships, and after finishing low amateur at the
Masters in 1982, almost immediately turned pro. Those who recall
the promise of the fine young player coming on the tour find it
distressing that he abandoned the game that came with so much
promise.

 &HT;    Something's in the water at Texas

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At times during the recent U.S. Olympic swimming
trials, there were so many Longhorns in the final it was a wonder
they didn't turn the pool orange. The Three Amigos, seniors Jamie
Rauch, Scott Goldblatt and Nate Dusing, all finished in the top six
in the 200-meter freestyle and are eligible to swim on the United
States' 800 relay team in Sydney, Australia. The 100 butterfly was
another Texas affair with Longhorn recruit Ian Crocker beating
Tommy Hannan.
</P>
<P>
   If you count Gary Hall Jr., who had a cup of coffee at Texas,
eight of the 24 men selected to the team were either former,
current or incoming Longhorns. And there was a rash of Texas
swimmers who didn't make the team but still turned in impressive
performances, including incoming freshman Brendan Hansen, who
finished third in the 100 and 200 breast stroke races.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, under Coach Eddie Reese, has been a swim power. But even
by Texas' standards, something special is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just time for us,'' Dusing said. ``We have all
underachieved until right now. We all came in _ me, Jamie and Scott
_ at the same time with high expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauch added, ``We've been talking about this for three years.
It's been a long time coming. All of us could have gone anywhere.
But we chose a school that would prepare us for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the formula is that Rauch, Goldblatt and Dusing, all
good friends, are finally hitting their form. They arrived heading
one of Reese's most heralded recruiting classes ever, and they've
had a good measure of success since then. All three have been on
three straight NCAA champion 800 relay teams. But it was clear at
the trials that all three had expected more out of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One indication that they and some other Longhorns were ready to
make a jump came in the NCAA championships this year. Although
Reese had won six previous titles at Texas, the last came in 1992.
This year the title was never in doubt. Texas scored an NCAA-record
538 points while second-place Auburn was way back at 385. The total
could rise even higher this year. Rauch, Goldblatt and Dusing will
all return, and being on the Olympic team could really raise their
performance to another level.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas exes are another factor in the equation. Texas is
fortunate to have a pair of former Longhorns, Josh Davis and Neil
Walker, who work out with the team. Although both have impressive
resumes, neither is a prima donna, a star who sets himself apart.
Reese would be hard-pressed to find a better role model to have
around his swimmers than Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 27, is respected enough to be the leader on the men's
U.S. Olympic swim team. The easygoing Walker is a rising star in
the sport. Walker can swim three strokes, the freestyle, backstroke
and butterfly, as well as just about anyone and so can Davis. At
Texas, swimmers don't have to imagine what it takes to be the best,
they can look over in the next lane and see how that person trains,
or watch how he handles himself outside of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   As for his part, Reese always has had a reputation for being
able to spot talent, but it's frequently been for
diamond-in-the-rough swimmers. Yet the 2001 class is loaded with
talent, and Crocker and Hansen were both huge recruits. If they
were football players, the chat rooms wouldn't stop buzzing about
them.
</P>
<P>
   A final piece might be Eddie's brother, Randy. At one time, when
he was coaching a powerhouse at Florida, the Randy vs. Eddie battle
was the highlight of a swim season. Like Eddie, Randy has coached a
ton of top swimmers, but Randy was out of swimming for almost a
decade before deciding to get back in at the club level. He has set
up camp at Circle C, which continues to improve its swimming
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Olympic trials, Eddie took his swimmers over a couple
of times a week to work with Randy. ``We like swimming outdoors.
It's better than looking at the rafters all the time,'' Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   An outdoor facility has been planned for UT for years, but is
still on the drawing boards. Now, the UT swimmers have a de facto
outdoor facility at Circle C.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida, Randy had a reputation for being the more demanding
of the Reese brothers, not bothering to soften workouts with humor,
the way Eddie does. Some of Randy's training techniques are
legendary for their toughness. Yet, going over to Circle C helps
fights one of the biggest enemies for swimmers _ monotony. And
Eddie and Randy even do a little of their Smothers Brothers of
swimming routine to keep their athletes amused while they're
getting advice from not one, but two hugely successful coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see the two sides of the family. We do a lot more
work with paddles and fins with Randy. It helps you feel
stronger,'' Dusing said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy is known for developing 200-meter swimmers, and Texas
excelled at that distance during the trials. One of the methods he
uses is a pulley system, which some at Circle C consider something
of an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got four guys going to the Olympics you can live
with it,'' Dusing said.

 &HT;    Roller coasters serve as gauge for dizziness
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Many NASCAR drivers talk about having a
``roller-coaster'' season, referring to the ups and downs of the
year. Terry Labonte gives the phrase a new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, driver of the No. 5 Chevrolet, spent two days riding
roller coasters at an amusement park on the advice of his
physician. He missed the past two Winston Cup races because of
``dizziness'', which doctors originally thought was the result on a
concussion suffered during a crash at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting a different ear specialist last week, Labonte was
diagnosed with a form of vertigo. He and Jeremy Mayfield, who also
skipped the past two events because of a head-related injury, will
return to action for today's Pepsi 400 at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a relief,'' Labonte said. ``I guess the thing that
bothered me the most was I'd go to the neuro doctors and they'd say
nothing was wrong with me. I'd still be dizzy. I'd go to the ear
doctor and he'd say there was nothing wrong with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally went to (another) ear doctor on Tuesday and he said
`Here is your problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was diagnosed with Benign Paroxymal Positional Vertigo
and underwent therapy during the doctor's visit. To determine
whether there was any remaining dizziness, Labonte traveled to
King's Dominion in northern Virginia on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to see if I could make myself dizzy again by
doing something that would be as close to driving this car as I
could get,'' Labonte said. ``I made everybody dizzy that was with
me, but I didn't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two Winston Cup practice sessions Saturday, Labonte
climbed behind the wheel to motor around the two-mile track. Todd
Bodine, winner of Saturday's Busch race, drove the car during
Friday's time trials. He will be on stand-by today if Labonte's
dizziness returns before or during the race.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield suffered a head injury after crashing in practice the
day before the Brickyard 400. Mayfield also was held out of Watkins
Glen last week for precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been feeling good, no headaches or dizziness,''
Mayfield said. ``My biggest fear when I got to Michigan was . . .
what's going to happen when I get in the car?
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode around (slowly) a few laps to make sure I was all
right. (Then) I went wide open and I felt real good. I can't
express how happy I am to be here.''

 &HT;    Preseason injuries hitting hard
 &HT;    By Ken Seguira
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Any coach worth his whistle can tell you at least this
much about the preseason: The important thing is to try and get
through without too many injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Preseason 2000, though, it might be difficult for any of them
to tell you that, perhaps because they're too busy lighting candles
or rubbing rabbits' feet in hopes that one more anterior cruciate
ligament won't tear or another Achilles' tendon won't snap.
</P>
<P>
   Players are dropping fast. Broncos wide receivers Chris Doering
and Muneer Moore suffered a ruptured Achilles' and a dislocated and
fractured left ankle, respectively, in the same game. The seasons
of Cam Cleeland and Steve Israel both ended in the Saints' first
game. Seattle Seahawks DeShone Myles and Rufus French both tore the
ACLs in their left knees on successive days. (Note to artificial
turf haters: Virtually all of these injuries have come on grass.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to take,'' Saints coach Jim Haslett said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the locals, the Falcons haven't suffered a
single season-ending injury. Perhaps it's karma coming around after
center Todd McClure and running back Gary Downs were lost for the
year on the second day of training camp in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries have felled so many, a decent team could be found
among the ``out for the season'' gang. The wide receivers would be
the Panthers' Patrick Jeffers (ACL) and the Cardinals' Rob Moore
(ACL). On the offensive line is the Jaguars' Leon Searcy (ruptured
quadriceps).
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback is the Browns' Ty Detmer (ruptured Achilles).
There's also Panthers safety Deon Grant (broken hip), Panthers
kicker John Kasay (broken kneecap) and Jaguars safety Carnell Lake
(stress fracture in his left foot). In this group there's one Super
Bowl ring, nine Pro Bowl appearances, 10 conference championship
games, a season scoring leader, a Heisman Trophy winner, five
college all-Americans and three national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Another player for the all-injured squad. One is Packers
seventh-round pick Rondell Mealey, a running back from Louisiana
State. Mealey blew out the anterior cruciate and medial collateral
ligaments in his left knee in the team's first preseason game Aug.
4 and kept playing. After the injury, Mealey left the field under
his own power, came back, ran a pass route, gained 7 yards on a
sweep and then went around right end to score a 15-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ON LEWIS
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's $250,000 fine of Ravens
linebacker Ray Lewis on Thursday for obstructing justice in the
Buckhead slayings investigation makes it clear that the NFL thinks
it has an image problem it wants to correct.
</P>
<P>
   But Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, in a rare interview this
past week, said he didn't think the team or league should be held
responsible for the actions of Rae Carruth, the ex-Panther charged
with murder in the shooting of his pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we could have done. We have won the player
support program award for the NFL for two years in a row. We have a
full-time chaplain. I don't know how I could do any more of it than
I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PACKER PATIENCE
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, who play Miami on Monday, have not been the models
of defensive efficiency thus far. In their first two games, a 37-24
win over the Jets and a 26-20 loss to the Broncos, the Packers have
given up 58 first downs (to their opponents' 40) and are waiting
for their first sack.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Broncos, the Packers gave up 309 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the Packers' firing of defensive coordinator
Emmitt Thomas after last season (now with the Vikings) and hiring
of Denver secondary coach Ed Donatell as a replacement was all for
naught. Worry not, says Packers defensive end Vonnie Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our third defense in three years,'' he said. ``Like
anything, when you're trying to learn something new, it can be
frustrating. When this thing comes together, jells, gets that
chemistry, it's going to be a special defense.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Dave Wannstedt said the quarterback situation is not
completely resolved. If Damon Huard struggles against the Packers
on Monday, they might still consider Jay Fiedler, who injured his
hip and won't be back until the final preseason game, Aug. 24 at
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Denver running back and Georgia product Olandis Gary will split
carries with fellow Denver back and ex-Bulldog Terrell Davis, who
is coming back from an ACL tear, coach Mike Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills are happy with the progress that second-round pick
Travares Tillman, a Georgia Tech product, is making at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of the Jaguars and their fifth-round pick,
Kiwaukee Thomas from Georgia Southern. Despite getting burned two
Fridays ago for a touchdown by the Giants' Amani Toomer (even
worse, a photo of the play got splashed across the Associated Press
photo wire), Thomas has a good shot to be the Jaguars' nickel back.

GUIDE TO AVOIDING FANTASY DRAFT PITFALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY CLAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a 14-year veteran of fantasy football, I've seen it all. I
hope I can help you avoid some of the draft pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is an adequate substitution for information, so if you
haven't been watching preseason games and reading everything NFL
related that you can get you hands on, start now. The rankings on
this page will only help you so much. Plus, there is still plenty
of football to be played and analyzed before the season starts.
\Nsubheds:Root, root for ``your'' team In addition to having all of
the relevant information (who's starting where, who's hurt, etc.),
you have to check your pompons at the draft-room door.
</P>
<P>
   Root for the Cowboys if you must, but be realistic in assessing
their fantasy value. Troy Aikman is considered a great quarterback
for the Super Bowls he has won, not for his statistics. He has
never thrown for 3,500 yards and only once has thrown as many as 20
touchdown passes in a season. \Nsubheds:Injury-prone Be leery of a
big-name player with a history of injuries. Fred Taylor, Brad
Johnson, Mark Brunell and Chris Chandler are only some of the
players who can sparkle when healthy ... and there is the problem.
They tend to miss considerable playing time. If you end up with one
of those players, make sure you have a reliable backup.
\Nsubheds:Who is that guy? And beware of players coming from
nowhere to have monster seasons. Only Dan Marino has more than one
season with more than 40 touchdown passes, and for an encore to
each of his 40-plus seasons, he threw 18 fewer touchdown passes the
following season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 30 or 26 touchdowns isn't bad, but if you were expecting 48
or 44, you were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Kurt Warner could have a huge dropoff this
season and still put up good numbers. Be realistic.
\Nsubheds:Bye-bye players Remember that each team will have an off
week during the season. As you draft your team, keep up with your
players' bye weeks so that you can avoid having three of your four
running backs with the same off week. \Nsubheds:We're No. 2
Everybody knows that playing time is one of the keys to a player
putting up big numbers, but that doesn't mean all backups are bad.
In fact, there are some backups I recommend, particularly at
quarterback and particularly if you can pair the backup as your No.
3 quarterback with the starter as your No. 1 or No. 2 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The best quarterback examples are Kurt Warner/Trent Green, Brad
Johnson/Jeff George, Rob Johnson/Doug Flutie and Brian Griese/Gus
Frerotte.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little dicey at running back because sometimes two
players end up sharing playing time, but the best one-two punches
appear to be Terrell Davis/Olandis Gary, Emmitt Smith/Chris Warren,
Mike Alstott/Warrick Dunn, Stephen Davis/Adrian Murrell and Jerome
Bettis/Richard Huntley.
</P>
<P>
   In all of these cases, if you get the first guy, try to get the
backup late. That way, if the team changes its starter or there is
an injury, you've got somebody to plug in. \Nsubheds:Point
differential Every starting quarterback in the NFL will score
fairly well in fantasy football, but how many tight ends can you
count on to score? Anywhere from two to five, which means that a
lot of teams are going to be playing a stiff at tight end.
</P>
<P>
   A tight end will almost never outscore a quarterback, but that
isn't the point. If your tight end outscore your opponent's tight
end by 50 points, and your opponent's quarterback outscores your
quarterback by 20 points, you're ahead by 30.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for the talent/production gaps, and draft accordingly.

TODD HELTON TAKES RACE FOR .400 IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one will challenge the home-run record this year. Mark
McGwire's knee injury took care of that.
</P>
<P>
   No one will win 30 games. David Wells took care of that with a
post-All-Star Game slump.
</P>
<P>
   No one will hit in 56 consecutive games. Gabe Kapler took care
of that against the Yankees the other day.
</P>
<P>
   But this season still could be one for the record books, because
it might produce the first .400 hitter since Ted Williams in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Not Nomar Garciaparra. The tremendously talented Boston Red Sox
shortstop has fallen off the pace. He went 5-for-14 against the
Rangers last weekend, hitting the ball hard almost every time, but
that's only a .357 average. He was ``down'' to .375 after going
0-for-2 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton, though, might reach the magical number. The
Colorado Rockies first baseman took a .399 average into yesterday's
game against the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be excited,'' said Rockies right fielder Larry
Walker, who batted a league-leading .379 last season. ``The guy has
a chance to do something that hasn't been done in a long time _ hit
.400 and win the MVP. I'm rooting for him. Everybody's rooting for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who's in his third full season in the majors, made the
mark if not likely then at least possible with an incredible
16-game stretch. Beginning with a game against the Phillies on Aug.
4, Helton has gone 32-for-54 (.595), raising his average 29 points
to .399 through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flabbergasted,'' Rockies manager Buddy Bell said. ``This
is a very hard game and he's making it look very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Frye, traded from the Red Sox to the Rockies on July 27,
has played with Garciaparra and Helton this season.
</P>
<P>
   Frye said his former teammate did it with instincts and raw
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not normal,'' Frye said. ``He's a freak. He does things
I've never seen. He can go up there and hit a first pitch slider,
changeup, sinker in, fastball. He doesn't look at video. He doesn't
really go over the pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye's current teammate is the antithesis. Helton keeps books on
pitchers and dissects his swings on video. But that approach also
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the short time I've been here, it's got to the point
where I expect the guy to get a hit every time,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's hot stretch included a remarkable road trip. He went
19-for-29 (.655) in games at Montreal and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy hits like that for that long of a streak on the
road, that proves he's a big-time hitter in any ballpark,'' George
Brett told the ``Denver Post.'' ``What he's doing is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett knows a little something about trying to hit .400. He
challenged the mark 20 years ago, when he got his average up to
.407, but he faded in the last couple of weeks and finished at
.390.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of four serious assaults on .400 since Williams hit
.406 in '41. Williams batted .388 in 1957, an average matched by
Rod Carew in '77. Tony Gwynn hit .394 in '94, his chances at .400
ended by the players' strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Helton has an advantage over the others. He plays his home
games in the best hitters' park in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Helton was batting .439 (93-212) in the high altitude of Coors
Field entering yesterday's game against the Marlins. The Rockies
play 24 of their final 39 games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never thinking about my batting average when I up there,''
Helton said. ``The media makes a bigger deal out of it. I honestly
believe it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, on the other hand, is a believer that it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Walker said. ``Yeah.''
 &LR; subheds:SPOTLIGHT
Bill Kostroun Although he has not had a glittering return, Kent
Mercker of the Angels is happy to be pitching after suffering a
hemorrhage in his brain.
Mercker makes heroic return after hemorrhage
Never has such a mediocre line in the box score looked so good.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Angles pitcher Kent Mercker allowed three runs on five
hits in 32/3 innings against the New York Yankees last weekend, on
the surface nothing to be proud of. But considering his life was in
jeopardy the last time he was on the mound, it was a thing of
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big relief when I walked out after the game,''
Mercker said. ``I picked up my girls \RMadison and Sophia\S and
hugged them. It was a big sigh of relief, like, `Whew, everything's
OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker last pitched against the Rangers on May 11, when he
suddenly experienced a headache so painful that it dropped him to
one knee.
</P>
<P>
   He was rushed to the hospital where, after hours of tests, he
was told a blood vessel had burst in his brain. Blood was
hemorrhaging throughout his head, a life-threatening condition.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed his baseball career was finished, but he began to
think about coming back when further tests showed that a recurrence
was highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker and his wife, Julie, talked it over and decided he
should resume pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, baseball is something I love,'' he said. ``There
are always going to be doubts with me the rest of my life regarding
my head. But you can't let it consume you to where you just sit on
the sofa all day, afraid of things.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mercker returned to Edison Field, three months after
collapsing on the same mound, he received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never viewed pitching as a courageous or heroic thing,''
said Mercker, who pitched against the Yankees again Wednesday in
New York and allowed two runs in five innings. ``But maybe I can
help somebody who has been through the exact same thing and who has
been hesitant to do things. Maybe they'll think, `You know, he did
it, maybe I can do it.' ''
 &LR; subheds:SHORT HOPS
\Nsubheds:Strength from dad Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre had a great day on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who is on the disabled list because of an elbow
injury, had a pain-free session on the mound in the visitors'
bullpen in Philadelphia. But more importantly, he began the day by
having breakfast in New York with his father, Mel, the Yankees'
pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Mel is battling multiple myeloma, a form of cancer that attacks
the blood. Todd spent Sunday night and all day Monday in New York
before rejoining the D'backs in Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to talk, laugh and smile with him _ that was much
more rewarding than throwing off the mound today,'' Stottlemyre
said. ``He's doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's courage in dealing with cancer makes it easier for
Stottlemyre to deal with his own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it, I don't want to say meaningless, because this is
what we do and there is a sense of being accountable to your
teammates, manager, owner,'' Stottlemyre said. ``But he's fighting
for his life, and I'm fighting for my next start. They don't seem
to balance out.'' \Nsubheds:Sosa happy again After ripping manager
Don Baylor for not giving him enough respect earlier this season,
Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa said Don Baylor knew what he was
talking about when he challenged him to be a better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good sometimes that people say something \Rnegative\S
about me because that's good motivation,'' Sosa said. ``I work
harder and get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has lost 15 pounds since spring training, going from 236 to
221, and is playing better in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night and day,'' center fielder Damon Buford said. ``Now
he's the prototypical right fielder who makes all the plays. You
can't ask for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa acknowledged that losing weight has helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was a little bit overweight,'' he said. ``But for the
last three or four years my manager was telling me he didn't want
me to steal bases. He wanted me to drive in runs and be more
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   He has remained productive at the lower weight. He had 18 home
runs in his last 36 games through Friday, taking the major-league
lead with 39. \Nsubheds:Shift doesn't change Thome Even with a
seven-run lead and two outs in the ninth inning, the Oakland A's
still employed a radical shift against Cleveland Indians third
baseman Jim Thome. Three infielders were stationed between first
and second with the third baseman playing shortstop against the
left-handed pull hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams do it and some teams overdo it like the A's,''
Thome said. ``I guess it's a sign of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome's having a fine season, hitting .284 with 30 home runs and
73 runs batted in, but he figures the shift has cost him at least
20 hits this year on balls up the middle. Still, he won't change
his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change the way I hit. The only way I'll hit
the ball to left field is if they pitch me away or I get beat on a
pitch and swing late. And I'm not looking to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year he tried to bunt against the shift, and sent
a dribbler back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grady Little, our bench coach, came up to me after that game
and said, `Jimmy, there's a lot of people who drive all the way
from Sandusky to see you swing the bat. They don't come to see you
lay down a bunt,' '' Thome said. ``I remember that.''
\Nsubheds:Valentine gaining respect Even though the New York Mets
have the second-best record in baseball, are within two games of
the Atlanta Braves in the NL East and are well ahead in the
wild-card standings, manager Bobby Valentine hasn't received so
much as a vote of confidence from co-owner Fred Wilpon, let alone a
new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon said the decision on Valentine and GM Steve Phillips ``is
going to be easy,'' but won't do anything until after the season.''
But the players say there's no reason to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby deserved another contract a long time ago,'' reliever
John Franco said. ``The way he's managed, the way we've won here
the last three years, are you kidding me? The longer it takes, the
harder it's going to be for \RWilpon\S to sign him.`
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Robin Ventura says he's grown to respect Valentine
for the discipline he shows in not playing Mike Piazza every game,
even though Valentine obviously needs as many victories as possible
to earn another contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby is using all different kinds of lineups, not just the
same one,'' Ventura said. ``Any manager could ride Mike's back,
want to win every single game. But we learned last year we need to
keep Mike fresh for the end of the season.'' \Nsubheds:White Sox
look over Hill The Chicago White Sox's pitching problems in the
second half should result in further employment for Ken Hill, who
was released by the Anaheim Angels earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin, Mike Sirotka and Jim Parque have slipped in the
second half. None of them have won back-to-back starts since
Sirotka beat the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox on June 25 and
July 1, respectively. In their last seven starts, Baldwin is 2-1
(and is expected to miss his next start because of a tired arm),
Parque is 3-2 with an earned-run average above 5.00, and Sirotka is
2-4 with a 5.06 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies Jon Garland and Rocky Biddle have been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hill, who threw for the White Sox twice last week and was
expected to be signed to replace one of the rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured some clubs would be interested, but I didn't know,''
he said. ``If not, I figured I'd just go home. But they called.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was 5-7 with a 6.52 ERA with the Angels but worked
five-plus innings in five of his past six starts. Plus, he has
postseason experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have him,'' DH Frank Thomas said. ``This is not
playoff baseball yet. It's a whole other level in the postseason.
It's a little tough on kids, especially when you start throwing
them into pressure situations.''
 &LR; subheds:AROUND THE NL Atlanta Braves left-hander Tom Glavine needs
five victories to join Roger Clemens as the only active pitchers
with five 20-victory seasons. ``It's important,'' Glavine said.
``It's a goal that starting pitchers have every year. You're a
20-game winner, that's a big deal. I've done it four times and five
sounds a whole lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood wants to pitch, but the Chicago Cubs continue to be
cautious with the prized pitcher from Grand Prairie High School who
is coming off ``Tommy John'' surgery. Wood, on the DL with a
strained oblique muscle, declared himself ready to face Randy
Johnson today after throwing in the bullpen Tuesday. But manager
Don Baylor decided to hold him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably the next go-through after that,'' Baylor
said. ``With his velocity, he does generate a lot of torque.
Playing catch is one thing, but once he gets on the mound and airs
it out a couple times in the next week or 10 days, then we'll let
him pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams had 26 RBI on
May 1 last year, when he finished with 142. After missing the first
43 games of this season with a fractured second metatarsal in his
right foot, and also spending time on the DL with a strained right
quadriceps that still is not 100 percent, he got No. 26 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies' new administration went for talent over
signability with the selection of high school pitcher Matt
Harrington with the No. 7 overall pick in the June draft, but it
appears that Harrington will play his next baseball game for
Arizona State. Harrington made it known that he wanted to become
the highest-paid player in the draft, which means the Rockies would
have to pay more than the $5.3 million the Chicago White Sox gave
Stanford outfielder Joe Borchard. They have offered $3.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield (91), Eric Karros (85) and Shawn Green (81) are
driving in runs in bunches for the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the
three players have not had a RBI in the same game since a 7-6
victory over Houston on June 21 at Enron Field. The Dodgers have
played 51 games since then.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Giants left-hander Shawn Estes is thriving at
Pacific Bell Park. He is 7-1 with a 1.80 ERA in nine starts at the
new field, the lowest home ERA in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Astros shortstop Julio Lugo's two-run home run on
Wednesday was the 200th at Enron Field. There were only 110 hit at
the Astrodome last season.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Williams has the only two complete games thrown by the San
Diego Padres staff this season. Not bad, considering he missed two
months following surgery to repair an aneurysm in a blood vessel in
his right armpit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds revived their playoff hopes by sweeping the
Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field last weekend to climb to two games
over .500 and within 41/2 games of the St. Louis Cardinals in the
Central Division, but they went to Milwaukee and were swept. They
scored four runs in 19 innings, and were 1-for-26 with runners in
scoring position. ``We're not getting the job done,'' Ken Griffey
Jr. said. ``We're not getting the big hit.`
 &LR; subheds:AROUND THE AL Chicago White Sox starter Cal Eldred, who
has been on the disabled list since July 15 because of a nerve
condition in his elbow, is playing long toss and is aiming for a
return in September. The Sox hope he can make a minor-league rehab
start on Saturday, and then rejoin the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens could be echoing Joseph Lieberman's ``only in
America'' line. Clemens' contract extension with the New York
Yankees pays him $10.3 million in 2003, even if he opts out of the
deal after two years and becomes a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The early returns on the players the Baltimore Orioles received
in their trading frenzy at the end of July aren't encouraging. Luis
Rivera, considered the most talented of the prospects, hasn't
pitched since being acquired from the Atlanta Braves because of
shoulder tendinitis. The same ailment sidelined Mark Nussbeck, who
came from the St. Louis Cardinals in the Mike Timlin deal. And the
club has discovered that pitcher Leslie Brea, the key player in the
Mike Bordick deal with the New York Mets, could be as old as 26
instead of his listed age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   The eight runs the Boston Red Sox scored against the Rangers on
Thursday lifted them out of the AL cellar in runs scored with 582,
two more than the Minnesota Twins and three more than the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. The last time the Sox finished a season with the fewest
runs scored was 1932, when they were 43-111. This year, they have
remained contenders. ``When the ball starts rolling, I think it can
get contagious,'' first baseman Rico Brogna said. ``The fact that
we haven't hit and we're hanging right in there is a good sign
because this team has good hitters and we will hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Tigers GM Randy Smith's wife, Erin, gave birth to the
couple's second son while Smith was traveling with the team in
Seattle. The baby didn't receive his name _ Shane _ until Smith
returned home the following day. ``That's perfect for a GM, a baby
to be named later,'' assistant GM Steve Lubratich said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada hit 21 of his first 22 home runs while playing
catcher, so he could challenge Yogi Berra's Yankees club record for
the position of 30 homers. Berra did it in 1952 and 1956. But
Posada neither knows nor wants to know the record. ``I'll look it
up when the season is over and I'll see what happens, but, right
now, I'm going to concentrate on what I have to do today,'' Posada
said. ``I'm not worrying about records.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that closer Troy Percival has inflammation of the ulnar
nerve in his pitching elbow and is expected to be out for at least
another two weeks not only is bad news for the Anaheim Angels'
wild-card chances, but it also could impact Percival's contract for
next season. He has a $3.4 million option that vests when he
finishes 40 games. He's currently stuck on 35.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Chicago White Sox had a respectable 17-16 record
in the second half and a comfortable lead over the Cleveland
Indians in the Central Division, manager Jerry Manuel called a
meeting after an 8-2 loss to Baltimore on Monday night. ``It was
just the level of intensity that I think we need to get back to,''
Manuel said. ``We have been somewhat lax and I wanted to remind
them of what's at stake. You're competing to be the best team in
the American League. You need to be at a level of consistency, a
level of expectancy.''
 &LR; subheds:THE WEEK AHEAD After being swept in Oakland last week to
fall out of first in the wild-card standings, the Cleveland Indians
play host to the A's in a three-game series beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners and Chicago White Sox conduct what could be
a playoff preview with three games at Seattle beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the National League, the San Francisco Giants begin a
favorable stretch of games that could allow them to pad their lead
in the West. After three games against Florida beginning tomorrow,

DODGERS BEAT METS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield had an itinerant career before
going to the Los Angeles Dodgers _ against his wishes _ in 1998. He
was never a batboy in Dodger blue and was never a close family
friend of Tommy Lasorda's, and he needed a $5-million bonus to
accept being traded here from the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   His production should make him a hero at Dodger Stadium, but he
is only now reaching the numbers posted by the player he was traded
for, Mike Piazza, who was a Dodgers batboy and is a family friend
of Lasorda's.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, the Mets' catcher, was given a rest on Saturday, and he
watched as Sheffield tied Piazza's season high for home runs in a
Los Angeles uniform in the Dodgers' 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield homered in the third inning, giving the Dodgers a
lead, and again in the eighth for their final run. He knocked in
three runs, providing the margin of victory for Chan Ho Park, who
dominated the Mets with a four-hitter. Rick Reed (7-4) pitched well
for the Mets _ he threw the same number of pitches as Park, 113,
with 3 more strikes, 80 _ but he lost for the second start in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, Piazza was the only Dodger to hit 40 home runs
since the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958. But
Sheffield, who will challenge Piazza for the Most Valuable Player
award this year if his monster season lifts the Dodgers into the
pennant race, reached 40 homers Saturday to tie his record.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sheffield traded home runs with Piazza, who had three
runs batted in as the Mets won the series opener. In Saturday's
game, Sheffield traded homers with another Met he is connected to.
Sheffield and Derek Bell were teammates on the Tampa All-Star team
that advanced to the Little League World Series final in 1980. They
remain close and chatted at length on the field before Friday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases empty in the first inning, Bell rifled a homer to
left off Park (12-8). Sheffield walked in the bottom of that
inning, then came up with one on and one out in the third. It could
have been an even more dangerous situation, but Edgardo Alfonzo
dived to snare a grounder by Mark Grudzielanek just before
Sheffield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Reed threw him a first-pitch curveball, and Sheffield timed it
perfectly, crushing it into the left-field bullpen to give the
Dodgers a 2-1 lead. He second homer came off Pat Mahomes leading
off the eighth. Sheffield should soon break Duke Snider's franchise
mark of 43, set with Brooklyn in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros, the Los Angeles career leader in homers, accounted
for the Dodgers' other run with a bases-empty homer in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, were struggling against Park, who in May
allowed them two hits over seven shutout innings. Three hitters in
the lineup had never faced him before, and though Bell hits him
well (7 for 17 in his career), the rest of the order entered the
game with a .121 average against Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' lineup did not include outfielder Darryl Hamilton, who
has hit well against Park but has experienced soreness in his
arthritic left big toe, which sidelined him for four months.
</P>
<P>
   After Bell's homer, the Mets never advanced a runner past first.
Jay Payton singled to lead off the fifth, but aborted a stolen-base
attempt and was picked off first by catcher Chad Kreuter. Todd
Pratt then singled but was stranded when Mike Bordick fanned and
Reed flied out. Park worked five 1-2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets needed Reed to give them innings, and he did, working
seven strong ones and giving up seven hits and a walk. He left for
a pinch-hitter in the eighth, and Mahomes relieved him. Mahomes
started on Tuesday and had three full days of rest, but he may need
to start again on Tuesday in San Diego if Mike Hampton does not
recover in time from a stress fracture in his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had won Reed's first five starts after he came off the
disabled list on July 17, but they have lost the last two because
of two bad innings. Reed had thrown five shutout innings against
San Francisco before allowing five runs in the sixth, and six of
his seven innings Saturday were scoreless.

RED SOX THUMP RANGERS, PERISHO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Matt Perisho called it bad luck. Manager Johnny Oates
called it an inability to throw strikes consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the results just aren't there.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho gave up seven runs in 32/3 innings yesterday, which is
what Red Sox starter Pedro Martinez allows in a month. In a game
that was probably decided by the end of the first inning and over
by the fourth, Martinez and reliever Bryce Florie pitched a
five-hitter to beat the Rangers, 9-0, at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had come out of his previous start complaining of
shoulder stiffness, but it became apparent rather quickly that he
was fine. The defending Cy Young Award winner pitched seven
innings, gave up three hits, walked none and struck out 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as he's ever been,'' Rangers first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if he had to shower today,'' Oates said of
Martinez. ``If he didn't work up a sweat warming up in the bullpen,
he's probably already dressed and gone home.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Rangers' third consecutive and sixth in their
past seven games. They are 13-23 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be days when there is no end in sight, no
hope, no light at the end of the tunnel,'' Oates said. ``But I
guarantee you, one day we'll look up and see a light at the end of
the tunnel ... and our young pitchers are a very large part of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho, who is 2-6 with a 6.78 earned-run average, may be
included, but he's going to have to get better. Even in his mind it
can't get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated beyond belief,'' Perisho said. ``Everybody has
a good part of the season and everybody has a bad part of the
season. I keep wondering when this is going to stop being the bad
part. I made a lot of good pitches today and didn't get results. I
made some bad pitches and had bad results. I'm kind of baffled
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for yesterday, Perisho said: ``The only way I see it is bad
luck. The focus is there, the game plan is good, and I've been
working on my mechanics trying to pitch inside better. I think I'm
doing that better than I ever have in my career. But I gave up one
hard-hit ball and I ended up giving up seven runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates didn't quite see it that way, but the manager is still not
ready to make a judgment on Perisho or any of the young pitchers.
With the Rangers going nowhere and with no clear alternatives
available, Oates said the experiment with the young pitchers will
go to the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to sit back and watch, whether it's third base,
center field, starting pitching or reliever, for the next six
weeks,'' Oates said. ``That's what I'm going to make my evaluation
on ... who we'll take to spring training next year, who are going
to get the shots. \R Perisho\S is going to pitch. That's the only
way I can make my determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it may not kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   What the manager is thinking is not foremost on Perisho's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to show me some results,'' Perisho said.
``It's my ERA, it's my career. I'm doing the things it takes to get
here and I'm doing the things that it takes to be here. I don't
doubt my ability to pitch here. I just need to get consistent and
pitch the way I'm capable, and it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He has six more weeks to show the manager.

METS PLAYERS SUPPORTING VALENTINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's amazing what winning can do for a ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets began the second half of the season by winning
20 of 25 games, are challenging the Atlanta Braves for the National
League West title and are almost a shoo-in for the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   And because of all that, players are actually coming to the
defense of manager Bobby Valentine, who has had his share of spats
with players. Valentine, along with general manager Steve Phillips,
are in the last year of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Mets owner Fred Wilpon has stated it will be an easy decision
come the end of the year. But just like Dusty Baker's situation in
San Francisco, the longer Valentine remains a possible free agent
at the end of the season, the more speculation will arise as to
Valentine returning to the Los Angeles Dodgers if Davey Johnson is
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mets entered Saturday with a 73-49 mark, 1 games
behind the Braves and 5 games ahead of Arizona in the wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby deserved another contract a long time ago,'' Mets
reliever John Franco said. ``The way he's managed, the way we've
won here the last three years. ... Are you kidding me? The longer
it takes, the harder it's going to be for (Wilpon) to sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets third baseman Robin Ventura, regarded as one of the best
clubhouse influences in baseball, said Valentine's discipline in
resting catcher Mike Piazza, as he did Saturday, is one of the key
moves of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on Piazza's offense every day, Valentine is
trying to keep the MVP candidate from getting worn down in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby is using all different kinds of lineups, not just the
same one,'' Ventura said. ``Any manager could ride Mike's back,
want to win every single game. But we learned last year we need to
keep Mike fresh for the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton's quest: Colorado first baseman Todd Helton could be
playing on the moon or at Coors Field, the run he's making at .400
is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Helton entered Saturday hitting .399, but he doesn't put much
credence in his charge to become the first player to hit .400 since
Ted Williams did it in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's doing now is he's making a name for himself,''
Rockies hitting coach Clint Hurdle said. ``He's getting into that
group of hitters where when other teams come in, he's the first
name that comes up. He's having a signature season.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton should be helped by the schedule. The Rockies play 23 of
their final 41 games at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never thinking about my batting average when I am up
there,'' said Helton, who keeps books on pitchers and watches video
of his at-bats endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Jones joins Brown: When Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones
signed a six-year, $90 million contract last week, Dodgers
right-hander Kevin Brown finally had company atop baseball's
average annual salary list.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' contract pays him $15 million per season, equaling the
average annual value of the seven-year, $105 million deal Brown
agreed to in December 1998. Since the Brown deal, the Dodgers have
been hammered mercilessly about skewing the salary structure of
baseball. But Jones' deal should ease some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (signing) actually takes some of the pressure off,''
Jones said. ``So many times in the past I worried about things off
the field. Now things are really set. I think it takes all the
pressure off me, to be honest with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations are always going to be high when you play for
this team and hit in the middle of the lineup. That's the way it
is. They expect me to go out and drive in 100 and score 100 and
play solid defense.''

 &HT;    Olazabal shoots 63 as course is a feast
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Maybe they won't be able to beat the leader
Tiger Woods today in the final round of the PGA Championship, but
on Saturday they could still beat up Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting fairways with a regularity he barely remembered, Spain's
Jose Maria Olazabal made nine birdies in a sizzling 9-under-par 63
for a new course record in the PGA's third round, tying the lowest
round ever shot in a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, who is 51 and mostly a Senior Tour player now,
rediscovered some putting magic for a 7-under-par 65.
</P>
<P>
   Delighting in greens still softened from rain earlier in the
week and some kinder pin placements, Peachtree City's Franklin
Langham shot another 65 later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has nothing to do with the golf course,'' said
Olazabal, who moved to 9-under-par despite an opening 76 Thursday.
``I think it is the way the players are playing. I don't think you
would see these kind of scores at a regular tournament in this golf
course. . . . Obviously, Tiger is making us work harder and we have
to improve our games (if) we can have a slim chance of beating
him.''
</P>
<P>
   After knocking down the flagstick all day, Olazabal missed
chances for 62 at both the 17th and 18th holes. He ran a birdie
putt under the cup at the 17th from about 15 feet, and at the par-5
18th couldn't go for the green in two ``because I'm not as long as
Tiger off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Elated with his round, Watson said, ``Well, my dad used to say,
`It's pretty good for old folks.' That's what it is. I've hit the
ball better, but I haven't putted much better than I did today,
except when I was 28.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer realistically thinking about a career Grand Slam with
the PGA his missing major, Watson said, ``I still feel as if I can
play with the young kids, but my days are numbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if Woods were not around, Watson could at least dream a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tiger changed his golf swing (in late '97), I think (it
became) the best golf swing out here,'' said Watson. Langham, who
has three second-place finishes on the PGA Tour this year, started
birdie-eagle on the way to a front-nine 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I'm surprised at all to be where I am,''
he said. ``I'm elated. . . . Things are cooking for me and I'm very
thankful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the group behind Olazabal, Langham looked up on the
15th hole and noticed the two-time Masters champion at 8-under for
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Wow, I thought I was playing good,' '' Langham
said.

WOODS REMAINS IN LEAD DESPITE A SLIGHT STUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The field made its run at Tiger Woods on
Saturday, and for once, he did not run away.
</P>
<P>
   The course record was set, and Woods did not do it. When Woods
built a three-shot lead, he could not hold it. And as the PGA
Championship headed toward Sunday's final round, at least a dozen
players had a chance to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a two-under par 70, his worst round of the tournament,
Woods held a slim one-stroke lead at 13 under par (203) over Scott
Dunlap (12 under) and Bob May (12 under) after Saturday's
unpredictable third round at Valhalla Golf Club. J.P. Hayes, who
shot 68, was two strokes off the lead at 11 under par, while Greg
Chalmers was in fifth place at 10 under. Jose Maria Olazabal, who
set the course record with a nine-under-par 63, was tied for sixth
place at nine under par with Stuart Appleby and Thomas Bjorn.
</P>
<P>
   All of those players, and even those farther behind, will enter
Sunday with a chance to win the year's final major. And Saturday's
unexpected story was Woods' inability to take command in his quest
to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three
consecutive major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Valhalla was ripe for the taking, and while many players took
advantage, Woods struggled.
</P>
<P>
   He made a rare and costly double-bogey at No.12, three-putting
from 15 feet, including a missed second putt from less than 2 feet.
Suddenly, the three-shot lead that Woods took to the 12th tee was
gone, because after Woods' double-bogey dropped him to 13 under
par, Dunlap made a birdie at No.12 to tie Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, who shot a two-under par 70 to stay one stroke behind
Woods, showed character while paired in the final group with Woods,
refusing to fold even when he fell three strokes behind. And Dunlap
ended the day with a brilliant bunker shot at 18 to within 3 feet
of the cup that led to a day-ending birdie. Not only did Dunlap
keep his composure, he kept within striking distance of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   So did May, a 31-year-old player who, like Dunlap, has never won
on the PGA Tour. Who expected Woods' closest competition at the PGA
Championship to come from three players who have never won on the
Tour _ Dunlap, May, and Chalmers, along with Hayes, who only has
one tour victory, the 1998 Buick Classic?
</P>
<P>
   You never know in golf, which is why Sunday should be so
interesting. Look at what happened Saturday: When Woods has a
three-shot lead at a major, he usually steps on the opposition's
throats. But when Woods went for the jugular Saturday, he slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all over the course, other players were having a
birdie fest. Roars rang out around the course, as one putt after
another dropped into the cup, and one approach shot after another
flirted with the flagstick. But Woods' putting was inconsistent, as
were his approach shots. And with each chance that Woods
squandered, the field drew closer to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the day's most shocking moment came at No.12, when
Woods lost a three-shot lead with a double-bogey, while Dunlap made
birdie. Woods does not make many double-bogeys in majors anymore.
He never made one at the U.S. Open or at the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, as he reached the 12th tee at 15 under par, while
Dunlap was 12 under par, the momentum changed swiftly. Woods hit a
poor tee shot into the left rough, then his second shot landed
short of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Woods chipped to 15 feet, the gallery was shocked to
see him miss not only his first putt that slid 2 feet past the
hole, but his second putt that darted past the right edge of the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap capitalized by making an 8-foot birdie putt that pulled
him even with Woods at 12 under par. And even after Dunlap bogeyed
the par-3 No.14 to give Woods a one-stroke lead again, Woods
continued to struggle, when he bogeyed No.15 to fall into a tie at
12 under par again. Woods' approach shot at No.15 sailed over the
green into heavy rough, and though he hit a brilliant chip out of
the heavy grass to 10 feet, Woods followed by missing the putt for
par.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap made another bogey at 17, when he missed a 15-foot putt
for par after missing the green on his second shot, but both Woods
and Dunlap birdied the par-5 finishing hole, with Woods two-putting
after reaching the green in two shots, while Dunlap hit a superb
bunker shot on his third shot at 18 that stopped 2 feet from the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   So a tournament that Woods had a chance to take control of is up
for grabs. Woods looked to be in prime position midway through the
round, when Dunlap started to look shaky with his putter. Dunlap
could have tied Woods at No.8, but he missed a 3-foot putt for
birdie. At No.9, Woods made a 15-foot putt for birdie, then Dunlap
missed a 10-foot putt for birdie to fall two strokes behind. And at
No.10, Woods made a 4-footer for birdie to go three strokes ahead,
after Dunlap missed an 8-footer for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you could hear people thinking that Woods was
pulling away, but it did not happen. The double-bogey at No.12
proved that yes, Woods is human, and yes, even for him, it is not
easy to win majors.
</P>
<P>
   So when the final round begins on Sunday, the chasers will know
that they at least have a chance to beat the world's No.1 player.
He is still the man to beat, but at least the day will start with
drama, and it could end with drama.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someone will rise up from the pack to beat him, or
perhaps Woods will do what he usually does _ play his best when the
pressure is the highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy was a good score, considering how bad I felt over
every shot today,'' Woods said. ``I didn't play well, but I manage
my game. At least I've put myself in position to win.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although prospects look good for American Olympic
cyclists - the 13-member team qualified in 27 of 28 positions in
three disciplines and includes the most famous rider in two-time
Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong - all is not well in Bike
Land.
</P>

   With the Olympics less than a month away, there is infighting
with some cyclists blasting their federation for lack of financial
support and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been so disappointing,'' said sprinter Marcelo
Arrue of Woodland Hills. ``You would think U.S. Cycling would put
extra emphasis on treating riders right.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life at USA Cycling, where the dollars are always hard
to come by because Americans don't follow the sport as do the
Europeans and South Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't been made easier by incoming U.S. Olympic
Committee president Norm Blake's intention of equating financial
backing with Olympic success.
</P>
<P>
   The budgets are small, USA Cycling director of athlete
performance Sean Petty said, and with sponsorships hard to come by,
U.S. Cycling had no choice but to cut the athletes' stipend this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spread so thin,'' Petty said. ``My budget is much less
than last year. We made reductions, and one of those was the
elimination of the stipend. It's very, very frustrating in an
Olympic year to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   To a cyclist such as Arrue, that's a lot of money. Last year, in
which he won the Pan American Games and the national championship
in Olympic sprint, he earned between $1,400 and $1,500 a month. He
expected to make at least $2,500 a month but instead makes $1,440
from a special program, plus a one-time $2,500 grant from the U.S.
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He blames a lack of leadership at U.S. Cycling, specifically
officials' lack of trying to get the sport on American television.
</P>
<P>
   Arrue knows for a sport to survive in this country, it needs a
television contract. He suggested four or five times a year could
spark interest. Cycling sprints, in which cyclists go around a
250-meter track between three and eight times, are as glamorous and
TV-friendly as the 100 or 200 meters in track, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this sport hasn't received (attention) from the
media,'' Arrue said. ``The X Games has more attention. I've seen X
Games on TV and people are totally into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty said he was surprised at Arrue's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's reached the top of his field and not necessarily seeing
the fruits,'' Petty said of Arrue. ``Sacrifices are made and
opportunities are there. Is it the level they want? No. Does it
take sacrificing? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   This dissatisfaction won't stop Arrue from giving his all in
Sydney, but he's considering a return to his native Chile, where he
is well known and where cycling is second to soccer in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down there, you're on TV shows,'' he said. ``You're a
celebrity. People notice hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``(USA Cycling's) support has been horrendous. ... This is not
right. This is an Olympic year. This is the first Olympics of the
millennium. We should have much more support.''

CANSECO DEAL PROVES IT'S BOSS' TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees are loaded with part-time
outfielder/designated hitters. Already with David Justice, Luis
Polonia and Glenallen Hill, the Yankees' recent acquisition of Jose
Canseco surprised even manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees claimed Canseco, 36, off waivers Aug. 7 from the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays not because they needed another DH, but
because they didn't want Boston or Toronto to get him. The Devil
Rays had the option of pulling back Canseco after the Yankees
claimed him but decided to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Torre expressed his surprise at the move, Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner offered his own thoughts: ``I support the
decisions made by (general manager) Brian Cashman 100 percent. And
I'm surprised that anyone would be surprised by his
aggressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Now burdened with a roster loaded with players who either can't
play defense or play terrible defense, Torre could do nothing but
bow to The Boss: ``I respect the fact that he's the boss. He can do
whatever he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   You want him, you got him: Chicago White Sox general manager Ron
Schueler was criticized for failing to obtain a veteran starting
pitcher before the trade deadline, instead getting a veteran
catcher (Charles Johnson) and a veteran DH (Harold Baines).
</P>
<P>
   With six rookies on a 12-man pitching staff, some of the veteran
pitchers were feeling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim (Parque), J.B. (James Baldwin) and I basically aren't
allowed to have a bad game,'' Mike Sirotka said. ``It's totally not
an option. It's unusual to have that many (rookies), but from what
I've heard, every team was asking too much from us (in a possible
trade).''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the White Sox got their veteran. They signed ex-Angel Ken
Hill to a minor-league contract. Memo to Sirotka: Be careful what
you ask for ...
</P>
<P>
   Kapler streaks: The Texas Rangers' Gabe Kapler recently set a
club record with a 28-game hitting streak. But Kapler downplayed
the significance of the streak, other than what each hit means for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak is just a novelty,'' Kapler said. ``The important
thing is coming up in a situation when a pitcher is throwing around
Rafael (Palmeiro) and getting a hit and getting the job done. That
is much more important to me than any streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield better: The Angels traded pitcher Kent Bottenfield
to the Philadelphia Phillies on July 30 for outfielder/DH Ron Gant
not only because they needed a bat, but because Bottenfield didn't
pitch like he did last season, when he won 18 games. Bottenfield
was 7-8 with a 5.71 ERA for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But after Bottenfield arrived in Philadelphia, the trainers made
a discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The training staff couldn't believe how tight the capsule in
my shoulder was,'' Bottenfield said after giving up just one run
and three hits in seven innings against the Padres recently. ``I
wasn't able to extend the way I need to. This was the best I've
felt all year.''
</P>
<P>
   A sticky situation: The runway between the Cleveland Indians
clubhouse and their dugout at Jacobs Field has an unusual feature
four baseballs stuck to the ceiling. But it wasn't part of the
design of the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody threw the baseballs with such force they stuck to the
exposed tips of nails in the roof. So who did it?
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be Bartolo Colon,'' said Indians reliever Paul
Shuey, who added that it would take someone throwing about 100 mph
to make a ball stick.
</P>
<P>
   Fond memories: Thursday was Angels manager Mike Scioscia's first
visit to Yankee Stadium since winning the World Series with the
Dodgers in 1981. But the 1981 visit wasn't his first. As a high
school senior in 1976, he was among a group of prospects invited by
the Yankees to work out at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Billy Martin, and I used one of Graig Nettles' bats in
batting practice,'' Scioscia said. ``And five years later we win
the World Series with the Dodgers.''

GORE EMBRACES POPULIST THEMES AS A MEANS OF CRITICIZING BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore assailed Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas on Saturday as a man who has embraced the interests
of corporations at the expense of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery speech he delivered here on the banks of the
Mississippi River, Gore placed Bush squarely on the side of
pharmaceutical companies that he said gouge the elderly with high
drug prices, insurance company ``bean counters'' who overrule
doctors and major polluters who cut corners on environmental
protection measures for the sake of profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for the powerful, we're for the people,'' Gore said
before embarking on the second day of a journey down the
Mississippi aboard the Mark Twain riverboat.
</P>
<P>
   Positioning himself as a populist champion, Gore promised the
elderly new Medicare benefits to help pay for prescription drugs.
``My opponent won't,'' he shouted. ``They give in to the big drug
companies; I fight for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore promised to give doctors more authority over medical
decisions. ``My opponent won't,'' he said. ``They give in to the
big insurance companies that don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would take on polluters who ``cut corners'' for
profits. ``My opponent does not reflect that commitment in what's
been going on in his home state,'' Gore said, a reference to Texas'
low ranking in air and water quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look to the future,'' he said, ``it makes a difference
if you have someone in the Oval Office who is willing to stand up
to the oil companies and the big polluters and say the families of
this country deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was quick to respond. ``It seems like a lot of
finger-pointing from an administration that has failed to act on
these issues,'' said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush. ``In
contrast, Governor Bush has signed into law a patients' bill of
rights for Texans. He has reduced toxic releases more than all
other 49 states combined and he supports reforming Medicare to
include a prescription drug benefit for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Gore delivered one of his clearest and most concise
critiques of Bush. For weeks, Gore had been somewhat circumspect in
his criticism of Bush. At an event in Cleveland before the
Democratic convention, for example, Gore passed up the invitation
to criticize Bush's record on health care. He has left it to others
to tear into Bush's record, perhaps mindful that many voters are
turned off by harsh attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But with some polls showing him at last pulling even, or nudging
ahead of Bush, Gore appeared emboldened Saturday to challenge Bush
with renewed directness and vigor. And many in Saturday's crowd of
several thousand, dominated by teachers and union workers,
delighted in the attacks, waving signs and chanting ``Go, Al, go.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush accused Gore of engaging in class warfare, and
the Bush campaign has argued that Gore _ the son of a senator, the
product of elite private schools and ferociously good at raising
money from corporations _ hardly fits the role of working-class
hero. Much of the Gore family's wealth comes from holdings in the
Occidental Petroleum Corporation, whose founder, Armand Hammer, was
a close friend of Gore's father.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, is
a baker's son, but some of his most reliable contributors have
worked in the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. In this
year's Senate campaign, Lieberman, who according to Connecticut law
is allowed to campaign to keep his Senate seat while also running
as the vice presidential nominee, has collected more money from the
insurance industry _ $197,419 _ than any other senator, according
to the Center for Responsive Politics. He has raised $91,150 from
the pharmaceutical industry, second only to Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, was once director of policy
planning and communications for Pfizer Inc., one of the nation's
largest drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, played down the importance
of those contributions and Lieberman's efforts on behalf of both
industries. ``Who's running for president?'' Lehane asked. ``Al
Gore's at the top of the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore and his aides have only stepped up their populist
rhetoric. ``It's really clear what's going on,'' Lehane said.
``George W. Bush is in the hip pocket of big oil, the prescription
drug companies and the big insurance companies.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: New poll finds Gore leading Bush
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceAl Gore's presidential campaign appeared
<TEXT>
to be bolstered on Saturday by a new poll that found the vice
president may have overtaken Republican rival George W. Bush. The
Newsweek poll, conducted at the end of the Democratic convention,
shows Gore with a 52 percent to 48 percent lead over Bush _ wiping
out the double digit lead Bush scored in a Newsweek poll taken at
the end of the GOP convention two weeks ago. The new poll has a
margin of error of 4 percentage points, which means the
presidential contest could be a virtual tie. If so, Gore has
increased his standings from the earlier poll, which showed Bush
with a 49 to 38 percent lead.
<P>
   Told of the poll results while campaigning on the slow-moving
Mark Twain riverboat down the Mississippi River on Saturday, Gore
seemed low-key, saying ``I really don't think polls matter.'' Then
he added with a smile: ``I must admit I'm beginning to think that
the polls have a little more relevancy as we get close the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH UNVEILS PLAN TO REPAIR INDIAN SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   Bush unveiled a new education plan on Saturday to spend more
than $800 million to repair schools on the country's Indian
reservations. Bush proposed spending the money on 185 schools on
tribal lands, most of them managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
his aides said. His proposal calls for an additional $126 million
to replace the system's worst six schools, they said. The proposed
funding is relatively little _ compared with other education
initiatives that Bush and his rival Al Gore have already made
during the campaign. But the plan allows Bush to sustain his focus
on education _ an issue perhaps more traditionally associated with
Democrats, but one that he has said will be his main topic of
discussion in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AND GORE ARGUE OVER WHO IS THE HARDEST WORKER
</P>
<P>
   While Bush talked about education and Gore discussed the
environment, their campaigns on Saturday skirmished over another
hot topic: which candidate is running harder. Bush spokesman Scott
McClellan started it after a reporter asked why Bush had only one
event Friday and none scheduled for today. McClellan quickly came
up with a list of 22 stops that Bush made in five days following
the GOP convention. That represents 138 electoral votes, McClellan
beamed. Gore's people then weighed in, saying this weekend Gore was
on a four-day 400-mile trip down the Mississippi River and will
follow that with more campaigning. Altogether there will be 20
events in six states, representing 86 electoral votes, over seven
days. ``It is Al Gore who works 24/7 and George W. Bush whose
lightweight schedule is matched only by his lightweight agenda,''
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN OBSERVES THE SABBATH
</P>
<P>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Joseph Lieberman and
his family veered off the campaign trail Saturday to attend
services in La Crosse, Wis., at the only Jewish synagogue within 90
miles. ``After the week we've had, my family and I are thankful,
not just for spiritual reasons, but for physical and psychological
reasons, for a day of rest,'' Lieberman told about 60 worshippers
at the Congregation Sons of Abraham. Lieberman, the first Jew on a
national ticket, has openly observed the Sabbath, which lasts from
sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   GORE CHALLENGES BUSH TO DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Saturday challenged Bush not to ``duck the major
debates'' scheduled by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Bush
on Saturday told The Washington Post that he would ``possibly''
consider beginning face-to-face debates with Gore earlier than the
Oct. 3 debate scheduled by the presidential debates commission, the
traditional sponsor in recent elections. However, Bush hedged on
whether he was willing to participate in that opening forum, which
is scheduled for the John F. Kennedy presidential library in
Boston, a venue Republicans regard as Democratic turf.
</P>
<P>
   NADER SUED BY MASTERCARD
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader has said he is a
corporate victim after MasterCard International Inc., filed a $5
million lawsuit accusing him of trademark infringement. MasterCard
on Wednesday claimed the Green Party's political commercials
infringed upon its $100 million ``Priceless'' ad campaign, which
has run in 48 countries. ``MasterCard should lighten up,'' Nader
said on Thursday, acknowledging the advertisement is a parody.
``They're taking their name `Master' too seriously. This is
America.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE'S SON ARRESTED FOR RECKLESS DRIVING
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's son has a Sept. 13 court date in North Carolina to
face charges of speeding and reckless driving. Albert Gore III, 17,
was arrested and charged on Aug. 12 with driving 97 mph in a 55 mph
zone and reckless driving on a state highway in a rural, sparsely
populated area along the Outer Banks just south of Norfolk, Va.,
said 1st Sgt. A.C. Joyner of the North Carolina Highway Patrol.
Camille Johnston, a spokeswoman for Tipper Gore, said Saturday that
the teen-ager was alone at the time and was heading home to
Washington after a family vacation.

NEW YORK TEAMS WANT TO MAKE IT THERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Start spreading the news, it's going to be a
Yankees-Mets subway World Series.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what New Yorkers will have you believe.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, a subway series came dangerously close to reality,
as the Mets reached the National League Championship Series only to
lose to the Braves and failing to meet the Yankees in the Series.
But this year could be different.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Braves win the NL East, the Mets could do what the
Marlins did in 1997 - beat the Braves in the playoffs as the wild
card and go to the Series.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York Post is quick to point out, Sportsbook.com has
the Yankees as the 8-5 favorite to represent the American League in
the Series. The Mets are the second pick in the National League,
behind the Braves, at 3-1. (The Braves are 2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Sportsbook.com has a Yankees-Mets Series handicapped at 10-1.
Place your bets.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the New York teams have shown they want to win more
than anybody else. And we're not talking about the players, we're
talking about the front offices.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams made numerous moves before the trading deadline in an
effort to improve their chances. Sure, not all the moves are
necessarily good ones. But the intent is there. And when the
players see how badly the front office wants to win, they usually
respond favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees acquired David Justice, Glenallen Hill, Luis Sojo,
Denny Neagle and Jose Vizcaino. The Mets acquired Mike Bordick,
Bubba Trammell and Rick White.
</P>
<P>
   But what will make the difference for both teams is not so much
the newcomers, but the pitchers. For the Yankees, Roger Clemens has
come on strong in the second half. The Yankees won despite him last
year, but this year they need him, both down the stretch and
especially in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question Clemens has been the difference for us in the
second half, and Andy (Pettitte) has quietly done his part too with
15 wins,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Potentially
(domination) is out there. Considering everything, we're still
sitting four games up in the loss column and I feel pretty good
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, a healthy Mike Hampton is vital. Hampton might
miss a start with what he is calling a 10-year-old football injury.
He has a stress fracture to one of his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come out once from a football game (with the same
injury) in high school and they said that's what this looks like it
could be,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton hurt himself swinging the bat and said he needs to be
smarter when dealing with his aches and pains because the team
needs him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to feel like it did, I'll definitely find other
ways to do things when I'm hitting,'' Hampton said. ``I can't take
a chance of getting injured. We're getting down to September, and
this is where the team needs me. I'll do whatever it takes to be
out there every fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the intangibles. The Yankees have been knocked
around by the Mariners and White Sox this season, but come playoff
time, the Yankees will have an edge because of their experience in
big games.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said about the Braves, only the Braves are the
biggest playoff underachievers in decades. And there is MVP
candidate Mike Piazza, who is due to place his stamp in the
baseball postseason and challenge pretty boy Derek Jeter for the
throne in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there are the baseball gods. If they have any pull
at all, they'll make sure Clemens and Piazza - who became enemies
this season when Clemens beaned Piazza - face each other again.

METS' ZEILE USED TO ANONYMITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Zeile is used to being ``the other guy'' when
Mike Piazza is involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers traded both in 1998. Piazza, of course,
got the headlines. The two were reunited this season with the New
York Mets and, while Piazza is making a bid to become the National
League MVP, Zeile is making it difficult not to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   He entered this weekend's series against the Dodgers batting
.295 with 17 home runs and 67 RBI for the Mets, who are leading the
wild-card race. Zeile has never finished a season with a batting
average better than last year's .293.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a great situation,'' Zeile said. ``It's easier to
perform when you're comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile is with his seventh team since the St. Louis Cardinals
traded him during the 1995 season. Rejecting an offer to stay with
Texas when he became a free agent last winter, Zeile knew he would
again be switching positions with Robin Ventura entrenched at third
for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile is pleased with his progress and says change is something
he's grown to accept as part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving to first base has been less of a burden than the
transition from catcher to third base, because I've had 10 years of
experience in the infield,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a secret the Hart High and UCLA product wanted to
return to Southern California. Zeile, 34, had just bought a new
home and his son was starting Little League when the Dodgers traded
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was comfortable in Texas,'' he said. ``But I had a number of
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Being reunited with an old buddy was an added bonus. Piazza is
one of Zeile's closest friends on the team. The pair seek each
other out for conversation during warmups and have lockers near one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a breakdown of dreams for me,'' Zeile said of
leaving the Dodgers. ``Having said that, I think I'm happy to be
back together with Mike and the fact that there have been some
people who have strong voices and are giving me the credit that was
due.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel forgotten by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of reaction by Dodgers fans when he returns to the town
where he hit a career-high 31 home runs in 1997 is something he
expects, though.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first game of the current series at Dodger Stadium,
Piazza drew loud reactions from the crowd each time he came to bat;
the response to Zeile wasn't much different than that for any of
the other Mets player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like it took time for them to forget,'' Zeile said.
``The day (the trade) happened, most people had forgotten because
it was called the Piazza trade. You know most of the people were
just thinking about what happened to Mike. But such is life.''

BUSH, GORE DEBATE WHO WORKS HARDER ON HUSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MESILLA, N.M. _ It may have been one of the less-weighty
initiatives of the presidential race, but aides to George W. Bush
unveiled a count of his campaign stops Saturday, and triggered a
daylong battle over which candidate is busier.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in tightly contested states 11 weeks before the
election, the candidates themselves addressed a range of government
policies. Bush, who plans to focus on education for two weeks,
visited New Mexico, where he unveiled a program to rebuild Native
American schools, saying there had been a ``failure of
responsibility'' to keep the schools in repair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also unveiled two 30-second education ad spots in 21
states, including Maine and New Hampshire, to rebut Democratic
claims that he has been light on policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, focused on the environment during the second
day of his four-day boat trip down the Mississippi River. ``I will
clean up the environment,'' the vice president told supporters in
Dubuque, Iowa. ``My opponent does not reflect that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, aides to Bush were engaged in a somewhat
less urgent project: disseminating their analysis of the campaign
calendars, which they said showed Bush made 22 campaign stops in
five days after his nomination, in contrast to eight campaign stops
in four days by Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a swift rebuttal from exhausted Gore aides, who
pointed out that the vice president flew a red-eye flight on
Thursday night, then campaigned for 12 hours on Friday, a day in
which Bush cut short his one campaign trip to go jogging. They also
disputed the accounting, saying Gore would hold 20 events and visit
six states before the end of his trip. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
called the Bush campaign's statements ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The bickering bordered on comical at times, as each side argued
over how the analysis was framed. Was it a campaign stop when Bush
slowed his train to wave at residents of a small town? Or when Gore
stopped spontaneously to shake hands? Aides scrambled to find out.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the argument lay a fundamental question about the
way the two men campaign. Bush has purposely paced himself, to the
point of appearing complacent at times; Gore, on the other hand, is
notorious for keeping up a frantic pace, to the point of visible
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Texas governor, the pace of his schedule has been a
troublesome issue in the past. When Bush lost the New Hampshire
primary to Senator John S. McCain, some Republicans feared it was
because he lacked the will to campaign hard, or because he assumed
he had already won.
</P>
<P>
   Bush put those fears to rest later in the primary season, and
until Saturday, they had not resurfaced. With the conclusion of the
two parties' conventions, however, both candidates have come under
closer scrutiny, and the Bush campaign, perhaps anticipating its
schedule would eventually be compared with Gore's, tried to take
command of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has not ceded any ground in campaigning across
the United States,'' spokesman Scott McClellan said. ``We're
campaigning in every single state.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, senior Bush adviser Karl Rove
questioned the wisdom of Gore's frenzied schedule, saying Gore
``doesn't look well when he's tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the guy when he's been out there for 20 days, 30 days
and he's running around the countryside,'' Rove said of Gore. ``He
doesn't look good, and people will develop an impression of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides, however, have long viewed his energy as an asset,
and Saturday suggested the issue would come back to haunt Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's boat, the Mark Twain, made six stops along the
Mississippi on Friday, and held events in three towns Saturday,
broadcasting a populist message to middle-class voters in the
nation's heartland. After the trip concludes Monday in Missouri,
Gore will fly to Milwaukee, Chicago and Miami before returning to
Washington Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself seemed energized by the post-convention swing,
buoyed by polls showing he is gaining on, or even besting, Bush. A
Newsweek poll released Saturday has Gore ahead of Bush, 48 percent
to 42 percent. The poll, based on a survey of 806 registered voters
on Aug. 17 and 18, has a margin of error of four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On his boat trip Saturday, Gore hit working-class themes as he
addressed a crowd of about 2,000 supporters in Dubuque, Iowa. He
pledged to increase the minimum wage and to strengthen the right of
workers to organize.
</P>
<P>
   After spending Sunday in Austin, Bush plans to visit a total of
19 states in August, 16 of which President Clinton carried in 1996.
New Mexico was one of the states that voted Democratic in the past,
but which Bush believes he can win this year.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning his push for education, Bush unveiled an $802 million
proposal to repair Native American schools, as well as $126 million
to replace six schools. He also said that as president, he would
``instruct the Bureau of Indian Affairs to help tribes modernize
their schools.''
</P>
<P>
   His ads, which began airing Saturday, also center on education.
One shows a clip of Bush from the Republican convention, in which
he promised to ``teach all our children to read, and renew the
promise of America's public schools.''

ERSTAD SAYS SPASMS ARE NOTHING SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Anaheim Angels lost the player they can least
afford to lose for most of Saturday's game, and probably won't have
him today, either.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Darin Erstad left after three innings Saturday
because of muscle spasms on the left side of his rib cage. It's
something he's dealt with for the past couple of weeks, but it
reached a point Saturday where he had to come out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He said he isn't affected throwing the ball or swinging the bat,
and Friday night's diving catch caused no pain in the area at all.
But when making a routine throw back to the infield after catching
a fly ball in the second inning Saturday, the spasms started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wouldn't go away,'' said Erstad, who finally admitted
to manager Mike Scioscia he wasn't feeling right. ``I tried to use
my head for the first time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time Ersty says something to come out of a game,
usually a bone is sticking out,'' Scioscia said. ``I think Darin's
smart enough to know a half-step backwards sometimes can save three
or four weeks of playing time. Hopefully it's something we're
catching and nipping in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said he's certain it is nothing serious, just a feeling
of tightness in the area. He said it felt more like a cramp than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm moving, it doesn't hurt,'' he said. ``But tying my
shoes or lying in bed is when it's uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   If Erstad is not in the starting lineup today, Scioscia said
he'd use either Orlando Palmeiro or Scott Spiezio in the leadoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Record setter: Tim Salmon hit his 223rd career homer Friday
night, passing Brian Downing to set the Angels' all-time home run
record. But it got lost in all the hoopla surrounding the Angels'
dramatic comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the excitement in the game, I forgot about it
myself,'' Salmon said. ``So many great things happened in the game.
But I don't feel any sense of being upstaged. It was nice to get it
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said it was especially nice to hit the record-breaker off
Roger Clemens and hit it in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the best place you can do it other than doing it at
home,'' Salmon said. ``And Clemens, he's a Hall of Famer.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon also hit his first career homer in Yankee Stadium, off
Scott Sanderson in 1992. And he said he doesn't want to stop at
223.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to add to it, make it harder for Troy (Glaus) or
whoever else might pass it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Debut: Shawn Wooten made his major-league debut Saturday,
catching the entire game and going 0 for 4 at the plate. He flied
out three times (to each outfielder) and lined out to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten said he had a feeling he might get the start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they like to give (backup Matt) Walbeck a start the day
after a night game to give Bengie (Molina) a day off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was ready for the challenge,'' Scioscia said.
``Over the last two years, he's really turned himself into a
player.''

MARTINEZ, RED SOX COAST 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Doctor Feelgood made a house call Saturday in the Fens,
dispensing a giant dose of relief to The Franchise (a.k.a. Pedro
Martinez) and every New Englander whose summer dreams turn on the
master craftsman's health.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after Martinez pulled a Stephen King, frightening
himself and Red Sox fandom by abruptly departing a game with a
stiff right shoulder, he returned to face the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   With his shoulder in question, was he bound for the disabled
list or a shot at postseason glory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell that the people were really worried,'' Martinez
said. ``Even myself, I was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to fret. As spectacular as ever, Martinez (14-4) capitalized
on a sudden, early burst of batting might by his struggling
teammates and shackled the Texas Rangers, 9-0, with a three-hit,
10-strikeout effort through seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Florie pitched two innings to complete the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates really took care of the game early,'' Martinez
said. ``After that, to me, it was just throw strikes and stay
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, it was all good: Martinez, the Sox offense, the
weather, the peanuts, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the Sox loaded the bases with none out in the second
inning and left everyone stranded, a hauntingly familiar omen?
</P>
<P>
   They quickly went on a scoring binge, pushing across three runs
in the third and five more in the fourth, with timely hitting and
uncharacteristic patience at the plate. Jason Varitek drove in four
runs during the outburst and Lou Merloni knocked in three.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that ranks third-lowest in the league in runs and
second in runners left on base, the big innings were nearly as
welcome as Martinez's superb return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we've had our troubles scoring,'' said Merloni, who
is hitting a remarkable .560 (14 for 25) in the six games since he
joined the team. ``But we're not going to quit. Everybody's still
trying as hard as they can to come up with those big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the fifth in the first six games of Boston's
10-game homestand and the team's eighth in its last 11 games,
keeping the Sox in contention for both an American League wild-card
spot and the East division title.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Merloni was thrown out at the plate by a city
block trying to score on Bernard Gilkey's double in the fifth,
cutting short a promising rally.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni's predecessor (Ed Sprague), designated for assignment
Tuesday, has become Ed Who? It was Merloni's third three-hit game
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merloni has done a great job for us,'' Martinez said.
``Sometimes you never know which one is the one who is going to
turn around a team, and he might be the player.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro could make two. With his pinpoint control, overpowering
fastball, and paralyzing changeup, he was, as usual, a study in
excellence and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Ranger, Rusty Greer, reached second base, and he got
there by stealing it after hitting a two-out single in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out six of the first eight Texas batters, and he
was throwing his fastball with as much velocity (94 miles an hour)
or more in the seventh inning as he did in the first. The shutout
was Boston's league-leading 10th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether he was 100 percent physically,'' Varitek
said. ``But he was 100 percent efficient with his pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas hit only five balls beyond the infield off Martinez, and
three of those were outs. Still, Martinez said he felt his shoulder
getting ``heavy'' as he sat in the dugout during Boston's long
rallies in the third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   He said his short-term goal was to pitch longer in the game than
he had in his last outing, when he pulled himself out after giving
up three runs in four innings Monday in a 7-3 win over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pretty much have to get to the spot where you left the
game before and see how it will feel,'' he said. ``After I got
through the fourth inning, I said I am definitely better than the
other time.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams said Martinez was wise to pull himself
from the Tampa Bay game and possibly prevent further harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of that other game was probably the best thing that
happened to him,'' Williams said. ``He sure pitched a heck of a
game for us today.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, all but one Sox starter, Mike Lansing, reached base.
The team had 11 hits and drew eight walks, including one
intentional walk to Nomar Garciaparra. Merloni, Garciaparra, and
Darren Lewis each scored two runs, and no one cared that they left
nine runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after several tight games when the crowd was too edgy
for comfort, most of the 33,222 patrons passed much of the carefree
afternoon perfecting the recently forgotten wave.
</P>
<P>
   And no one seemed to notice when Brian Daubach, looking like a
Blues Brother as he wore sunglasses under a catcher's mask, warmed
up Martinez while Varitek, the catcher, put on his gear after
striking out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of games lately where we've had to battle the
whole way through,'' Daubach said. ``I don't want to say you relax
a little bit, but with a 9-0 lead and Pedro on the mound, you have
a better feeling about how the game is going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a feel-good sensation.

ALL PIECES ARE FITTING FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This keeps up, we'll all be watching the Red Sox in
October on NomarVision.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McDonough had the day off _ the Sox were on national TV _
so there was no one around to spoil a perfect picture on Yawkey Way
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro was healthy, happy, and unhittable again. Lou Merloni, who
had three more hits Saturday, has come back from Japan, transformed
into a samurai warrior. Jason Varitek broke out of a hellacious
slump with two hits and four RBIs. Troy O'Leary was on base four
times, Bernard Gilkey three. Carl Everett had another big hit, then
broke the ice with a couple of reporters. Garciaparra walked twice,
had a hit, and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   The concession lines were short, the bathrooms clean, and the
beer cheap.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it wasn't quite that perfect. But after a 9-0 win over
the Texas Rangers, the Red Sox' fifth win in six games on this
homestand, a team that at times has resembled a collection of
haphazardly assembled spare parts is suddenly taking on the look of
a confident, cohesive unit.
</P>
<P>
   That's what a few wins will do for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning always solves a lot of problems,'' said Sox coach
Tommy Harper. ``The new guys have gotten a chance to contribute.
Everybody knew they had played in the big leagues, we knew 'em from
their stats, but we didn't know them as people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you start to win. Rico Brogna wins a game, Mike Lansing
wins a game, (Rolando) Arrojo pitches well, (Tomo) Ohka pitches
well, and Merloni has given us a spark. The new guys, they have to
be feeling pretty good about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Brogna was hoping would happen after his
bottom-of-the-ninth, game-winning grand slam last Monday night.
He's played sparingly since, but the team has not counted itself
out of a game ever since he parked his slam in the visitors'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it sparked us or not,'' Brogna said, ``but
we've been playing well. That showed me a lot of character, Lansing
hitting that ball off the Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogna was referring to Lansing's game-winning double Thursday
night, when the Sox rallied from a 6-1 deficit to beat the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that was more significant, because we were down five,''
Brogna said. ``Monday night, the game was tied, so the worst-case
scenario if I don't get a hit is we're still playing with a chance
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Thursday, we scored three in the eighth, three in the
ninth. You had Gilkey with his great hustle on the error (when
Royce Clayton double-clutched before Lansing's heroics). I don't
know if it was the grand slam or not, but it got us off to a good
start on this homestand like we had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who hit little when he first came off his suspension
but has 10 hits and five RBIs on the homestand, said he never felt
like he was in the company of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt like a team,'' he said. ``We just didn't get
hits at the times we needed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys have a history of hitting. I've played against
them. They don't surprise me. I know what they can do for a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The win kept the Sox three games behind the Yankees in the AL
East, and they now lead Oakland by .001 in the wild-card race,
after the A's lost Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, 4-3, to the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a better chance this year,'' said Martinez,
who allowed just one Ranger to second base in his three-hit,
no-walk, 10-K declaration that his right shoulder was sound again
after he cut short his exercise Monday night after just four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep pitching like this,'' Martinez said, ``and then
when the rosters expand (Sept. 1), we'll have even more guys to
help us out. If one guy gets banged up, somebody else will come and
pick us up.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, Martinez said, he probably
wouldn't have taken himself out of Monday's game against the Devil
Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then,'' he said, ``I didn't believe in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, when he came off the mound after four innings and
physical therapist Rich Zawacki detected a knot in his shoulder,
Martinez knew better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that by taking myself out,'' he said, ``I was helping
the team more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have helped, of course, by playing some very bad
baseball. Monday night, Mo Vaughn and the Angels come to town, and
this is a much different Mo than the one who limped through a
dreadful homecoming a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a different Sox team than the one that was in
Anaheim a couple of weeks ago, competing against not only the
Angels but also exhaustion because of the ridiculous schedule that
required them to criss-cross the country twice in 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who is 3 for 19 on this homestand, is probably
still tired, which is probably part of the reason he crankily
accused McDonough _ who has a well-earned reputation for being
scrupulously fair _ of being heavy-handed in his coverage of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the other day, `You're tired,' '' Martinez said.
``I could see it, especially in Anaheim. Look at how he plays hard
every day. These guys are going to get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue, Harper said, is more mental than physical. Manager
Jimy Williams, in addition to giving Garciaparra a blow on Friday,
asked Everett to let him know if he wanted one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I never want one,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox center fielder, who has been breaking his silence in
increments since all the turmoil of the last month, his suspension
and shouting match with Williams, was asked if his focus had been
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I still play ball. That's all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett carried the Astros to a division title with inspired
play down the stretch last year. Is this his time now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any particular time,'' he said. ``I just go play.
I go through peaks and valleys, but I want those valleys to be as
small as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are not yet at the mountaintop, and may not get there.
But on this one, even Sean and Nomar would agree: Their compass is
pointed in the right direction.

USC GUARD ROBERTS EXPECTED TO MISS SEASON OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC is experiencing one of its healthiest
training camps in recent memory, but there has been one setback:
Senior left guard Trevor Roberts is not expected to be available
for the Trojans' season opener against Penn State next week.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who suffered a strained foot last week and has not
practiced in more than a week, was still walking around Saturday
with a boot on his injured foot. It would be extremely unlikely he
could recover and practice enough this week to be in game shape.
</P>
<P>
   Without Roberts, USC would start redshirt freshman Lenny
Vandermade, who has also been practicing at center. It would be the
first start of Vandermade's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny has been good. He's not Trevor,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another player Hackett said he is concerned about is tight end
Antoine Harris (strained calf) but Harris insists he will be ready
to play full time.
</P>
<P>
   Easing into form: Defensive end Ryan Nielsen of Simi Valley High
has missed about five practices during training camp, as he returns
from off-season shoulder surgery. But he's optimistic about this
season, especially after dropping nearly 15 pounds since last
year's training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Nielsen weighs 275 pounds and has noticed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot faster,'' Nielsen said. ``It also helps that it's a
year later and I'm recognizing things a lot faster. I'm not (100
percent) right now, but I will be for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen figures to enjoy some freedom this season, because most
teams will try to double-cover preseason All-American Ennis Davis
of Reseda High.

<P>
   ``I'd love for them to forget about me, and worry about him,''
Nielsen said. ``Ennis is a lot quicker this year, and he's got his
body back together. I'm looking forward to playing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of schedule: With two-a-day practices over, Hackett felt
the Trojans are actually doing better than he anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conditioning is a little better than I thought, and our
young players are doing better,'' Hackett said. ``(Strong safety)
Troy Polamalu, (cornerback) Kevin Arbet, (cornerback) Darrell
Rideaux, (linebacker) Kori Dickerson, (offensive lineman) Lenny
Vandermade. Some of the younger guys are a little further ahead
than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Childers OK: X-rays on Friday night revealed that defensive end
Matt Childers fractured a knuckle on his left hand when it was
smashed by a helmet, but the senior said he would start against
Penn State and will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-break: The Trojans took Saturday afternoon off and will not
practice today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to let our bodies rest up,'' Hackett said. ``We have
48 hours to get our legs back.''
</P>
<P>
   They return to practice Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at UC
Irvine, but those sessions are closed to the public.

UNHERALDED GRIMES GROWING ON PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ For most folks, the young-adult years are a
gradual growth process, marked by subtle changes in inseam lengths
and shoe sizes. But others virtually outpace the stock market in
their growth spurts; in a matter of months, their appearance
changes rapidly, as if their bodies are getting time-and-a-half pay
for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   When Patriots rookie defensive end Reggie Grimes was a junior at
Hunter's Lane High School in Nashville, he was 6 feet 4 inches, 220
pounds. He platooned at quarterback, fullback, and defensive end,
showing much promise at all positions.
</P>
<P>
   By his senior year, he weighed in at 245 pounds and had moved to
fullback full-time on offense. But even though he earned All-State
honors at the position (1,388 rushing yards, 23 touchdowns), he
seemed more suited for the defensive side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He signed with the University of Alabama to play running back.
But his body spoke up again. Grimes kept putting on weight, and
Alabama responded, moving him to defensive end before his redshirt
freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his junior year, Grimes was up to 288 pounds, yet he
hadn't lost any of his speed or athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played at running back at 250, and he still ran 4.65 in the
40,'' said Hunter's Lane coach Jerry Pigue. ``And he was clocked at
that time at a college camp he attended prior to his senior year.
He was redshirted as a freshman at Alabama and got up to 270 real
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never concerned about his weight because Reggie was just
a big guy, and you just knew it was going to be hard for him to
hold 220. He tried. He would even run track just to keep his weight
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he played running back, once he broke the line of
scrimmage he just outran everybody. I used to joke that a lot of
people could have caught him but they didn't want to because he was
so big.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that size and quickness that have made Grimes a welcome
addition to the Patriots, who signed him as an undrafted free
agent. Grimes has started two exhibition games in place of Brandon
Mitchell and has nine tackles (tied for third on the team) and two
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-20 loss to the Washington Redskins Aug. 11, Grimes had
four tackles, including a 9-yard sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very diligent,'' said Patriots coach Bill Belichick. ``He
takes coaching well, and you can see some improvement every day.
Those guys that improve every day _ and we have enough days here _
it's kind of hard to hold them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes started every game at Alabama his sophomore season before
breaking his leg Nov. 1 against Louisiana State. He did not
participate in spring practice in 1998 while rehabilitating the
injury and never again assumed a full-time starting role.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he did more than enough to get noticed. As a senior,
Grimes had 27 tackles, 5 sacks, 2 pass breakups, 13 quarterback
hurries, and an interception return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's at the NFL level, Grimes said it matters not that
he didn't get drafted. He knew he would make it if he got invited
to someone's camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lifelong dream, and I'm this close to realizing
the dream,'' said Grimes. ``I feel like if I was to get cut, it's
not going to be because I didn't do everything I could have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say determination has gotten me this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes has never been short on motivation. As a senior, he won
the metro Nashville area's Hume Award, given to the high school
football player with the highest academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite making his reputation in the offensive backfield, Grimes
said he always had a taste for the trenches. In Pop Warner, he
played both sides of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the knack for playing quarterback when I turned 12 and I
started pitching in baseball,'' he said. ``I believe that's when I
developed my arm strength, because I would go to my grandfather's
house and play catch and all of a sudden I could throw (a football)
a lot further than I had been able to.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes became the first freshman at Hunter's Lane to play
varsity football, and by his junior year he was starting at
quarterback. By his senior year, he was too valuable a runner to
keep at quarterback. Pigue gave the QB job to Grimes's younger
brother, Trevor.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes, who now weighs 290 pounds, was not concerned about
putting on weight so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a pretty good amount of weight in a year, but it
really wasn't a struggle or change or anything for me,'' said
Grimes. ``It was just kind of natural.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked hard to keep his weight down, but he was just going
to grow,'' said Pigue. ``He understood, `I've got a chance to get
to the next level if I get to the natural size for this position.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes is perhaps best noted for his interception return for a
38-yard touchdown against Florida in the Southeastern Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if it was hanging up there forever, and I saw it and
it was really a reaction,'' said Grimes. ``Next thing you know, I
was scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   That helped garner the interest of many who may not have noticed
Grimes because he wasn't a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought at the end of the season he was playing as well as
any player I saw in college,'' said Pigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved him to running back full-time as a senior, he
had to take charge, and he did _ in the locker room, the huddles,
everything. That's when I knew he was going to succeed in college
and have a chance at the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes has brought that take-charge demeanor to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard for guys to move ahead of Reggie because he's
continually taking another step up the ladder,'' said Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been real positive. But it's an unusual situation where
you look at a guy who didn't start in college and now he's in a
position where he's receiving considerable playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes said he still has a lot to work on, like footwork and
hand placement. But he is pleased merely to have the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to be playing this much this early,'' he said,
``but I did expect to come in and compete for a job. Everything is
kind of working out for my benefit right now.''

LEE DUCKS PUNCH; ARUM TAKES THE BLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Apparently, the only thing that a jury of Bob Lee's
peers thought was unusual about the former International Boxing
Federation president accepting several thousand dollars in a
Portsmouth, Va., hotel room out of someone's sock was that the cash
didn't come with a W-2 form.
</P>
<P>
   After millions of dollars and countless hours were spent trying
to convince a jury in Newark with videotapes, audiotapes, and sworn
testimony that Lee and his son sold the IBF's ratings, the jurors
deliberated for 15 days and decided Lee wasn't guilty of accepting
a bribe at all. No, they reasoned, he was just guilty of money
laundering, tax fraud, and engaging in interstate travel to aid in
racketeering. So what money was he laundering? His allowance from
Bob Arum?
</P>
<P>
   The federal government contended that Lee had taken at least
$338,000 from various fight managers and promoters _ including some
of the biggest in the game _ in exchange for manipulating his
ratings. The unconvincing evidence of this was 22 days of testimony
by government witness Doug Beavers, the former head of the IBF
ratings committee.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was accompanied by three video and 80 audio tapes
he helped make of Lee accepting cash for favors. That unconvincing
evidence was backed up by promoters such as Arum, Dino Duva, and
Cedric Kushner, who all testified that they had paid Lee's
organization to get their fighters rated.
</P>
<P>
   In Arum's case, he even laundered the cash through a circuitous
route involving a German fight promoter and a fight
manager-turned-bagman named Stan Hoffman, who carried $50,000 from
Arum to Germany so it eventually could end up back in New Jersey in
Lee's hands. Yet these were not bribes, the jurors concluded. What
they said, without speaking, is that they simply believed this is
how business is done in the seedy world of prizefighting, and who
cares?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Arum cares because he may end up paying the biggest
penalty, if not the only one. While the jury was still out, the
Nevada Athletic Commission used Arum's testimony about the $100,000
bribe he paid to get unranked Axel Shultz rated in 1995 to fine him
$125,000 and put him on six months probation during which he cannot
appear in the dressing rooms, at the weigh-ins, or in the ring of
any fights promoted by his company.
</P>
<P>
   While that penalty is small potatoes, somewhere Don King is
cackling. King is Arum's longtime adversary, a man Arum often has
accused of all manner of nefarious deeds. So has the federal
government on four occasions, even naming King as an unindicted
co-conspirator in the Lee case. Yet not once has it gotten a
conviction on King for anything involving boxing's shady dealings,
so Arum is now one up (or is it down?) on his rival in the matter
of boxing convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't never admit to nothing,'' King said recently about
Arum's decision to testify. ``Imagine what would have happened to
me if I got on the witness stand and admitted to such things. I
would have been drawn and quartered. They would have run me up the
yardarm. I would have been made to walk the plank. I would be in
shackles. I didn't do anything. But I guess Bob Arum did.''
</P>
<P>
   In boxing's convoluted logic, he did. He paid bribes, according
to the Nevada Athletic Commission, to a man a federal jury said
accepted no bribes. If that's not the essence of boxing's sad state
today, nothing is.
</P>
<P>
   Arum was contrite when he was first penalized but he became
irate 24 hours later when he learned that Lee had walked.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Arum was fined, his attorney, Judd Burstein, said,
``He wears his admission as a badge of honor.'' Then Lee got off on
27 of the 33 counts against him, and that badge was sticking in
Arum's craw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure out why I'm the only promoter who has gone
before the commission,'' Arum said. ``I think that's despicable
picking out the only promoter who is based in Nevada and throwing
him into this without having taken action against anybody (else). I
am chagrined.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also hot, claiming King should be dragged in on the
rejected testimony of others even though he'd had the common sense
never to admit to anything, a fact that makes one wonder which of
these two guys actually graduated from Harvard Law School in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   What the commission did was hang Arum with his own words. What
the jury did was let Lee walk despite hearing his words and seeing
the result of his deeds, especially that damning moment when
Beavers hauled a wad of bills out of his sock and delivered it to
Lee for a supposedly arranged rating. Obviously this was a jury of
people who don't carry wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, Mr. Arum admits to wrongdoing in which a jury
found that no one was guilty,'' said new Nevada commissioner Flip
Homansky, a longtime commission doctor. ``That part of it doesn't
make sense. I don't believe this verdict will reassure the American
public that all is well in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Really?
</P>
<P>
   Fellow commissioner Luther Mack said he was shocked when he
heard the verdict, forgetting that America has become a country
where no one is guilty of anything regardless of his or her deeds.
It has become a place where all too often the jury system no longer
works. It has become a place where boxing's way of doing business
can thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Don King knew that all along. Apparently Bob Arum forgot it for
a moment and so was penalized for the one thing they seem to hate
in boxing these days: telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's attempt to use majority rule scoring didn't take
long to explode in controversy. The idea is the three judges score
the fight but a master card is also kept in which the high and low
is thrown out and one score is kept. Last week, Vivian Harris
fought Ivan Robinson and won on the cards of all three judges, but
because he was penalized one point for too often having his
mouthpiece knocked out (honest), the master sheet had the fight a
draw. That Robinson is a Philadelphia fighter long rumored to have
friends among the judges on the New Jersey commission only served
to make the decision appear more suspect. ``That's boxing,''
Robinson said. No, that's ridiculous. It's also, in the opinion of
veteran trainer and TV fight analyst Teddy Atlas, something worse.
``It's just another way to steal a fight from a guy,'' Atlas said.
``This is a corrupt business we're in here.'' . . . Showtime has a
major show Oct. 20 in Detroit if Mike Tyson and Andrew Golota meet
as planned. If the final details are worked out, it will be the
kind of fight that creates interest, because between them Tyson and
Golota have rewritten the Marquis of Queensbury rules. Tyson twice
bit Evander Holyfield, hit Orlin Norris after the bell, tried to
break Frans Botha's arm, hit Lou Savarese when the fight already
had been stopped, and has made a living hitting after the bell.
Golota, known as the Foul Pole in boxing circles, hit Riddick Bowe
with so many low blows that he was disqualified in both of their
fights, bit Samson Po'uha in the chest, and head butted Danell
Nicholson. They won't need a referee for that fight. They'll need a
SWAT team . . . The deal has been made for Lennox Lewis to defend
his title against David Tua in November, with Tua earning a minimum
of $3.5 million plus an upside on pay-per-view sales. Tua is 37-1
with 32 KOs, and many believe he has a big puncher's chance despite
his lack of height. A lack of height is not to be confused with a
lack of size. When Tua turned pro eight years ago, he weighed 190.
Today the massive Samoan, who now lives in New Zealand, weighs 243
. . . Speaking of Tua, he had a bad time of it recently when he
took a dealer's Mercedes SUV and stopped at a convenience store in
Auckland to get a pack of gum. When he came out, the car had been
stolen. ``Give the thief credit,'' Tua said. ``He stole it faster
than it took me to knock out John Ruiz, and that was only 19
seconds.'' The car was recovered 90 minutes later . . . King was
circulating a 1983 Ring magazine article in which Arum admitted to
bribing World Boxing Association officials before a fight involving
Ray Mancini and Art Frias. Arum now says that was a
misunderstanding _ it was really a loan. Sure it was . . .
Heavyweight Michael Grant has spoken with Eddie Mustafa Muhammad,
Tommy Brooks, and Atlas about taking over his training. Atlas
already has refused, and veteran trainer Don Turner was told last
week by Jim Thomas, Grant's attorney, that he will remain as head
trainer. Turner is not so sure . . . HBO has a potentially
entertaining show Sept. 2 matching Erik Morales against former
world champion Kevin Kelley for the interim World Boxing Council
featherweight title. Originally, champion Guty Espadas was supposed
to defend his title against Morales but broke his collarbone in
training. On the same card, IBF-IBA junior lightweight champion
Diego Corrales defends his title against somewhat shopworn but
still competitive Angel Manfredy . . . Brazil's first world
champion in 24 years, World Boxing Organization junior lightweight
champion Acelino Freitas, defends his title Sept. 23 vs. an
opponent yet to be named, which is the same as saying somebody not
very formidable. Freitas is 26-0 with 26 KOs, which is why it's
difficult to get volunteers to get in with him . . . Here's Prince
Naseem Hamed's assessment of how the United States has accepted
Lewis, the WBC-IBF heavyweight champion: ``I don't think Lennox has
gotten the credit from the American press, but I think the whole
world knows Lewis is the best heavyweight on earth. He beat
Holyfield twice, the guy that beat Tyson twice. I think he's
getting his credit in America. Everyone knew in America the night
he got robbed against Holyfield when he drew.'' . . . HBO's ``KO
Nation'' series has a good card set for Sept. 9, with heavyweight
prospect Clifford Etienne (17-0, 12 KOs) testing himself for the
North American Boxing Federation title against Orlin Norris (50-6,
27 KOs). The second fight is a rematch between Bronko McKart (42-2,
29 KOs) and Winky Wright (39-3, 24 KOs). In their first meeting, in
1996, Wright won the WBO title on a split decision. McKart has won
14 straight since and wants revenge . . . Aside to the
Massachusetts Boxing Commission's incompetent commissioners: How
could you let a cop with one professional fight get in the ring
with Peter McNeeley, who had 50, and call yourselves protectors of
the public trust? If Gov. Paul Cellucci or his underlings were
paying attention _ which they're not _ they'd clean house and start
over again before there's a tragedy in the ring. When a disaster
occurs, Cellucci will call for reforms, heads will roll, and new
people will be put in charge. But it will be much too late to help
the guy who gets hurt, won't it?

ANGELS' COOPER ROCKED BY YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the New York Yankees had a hangover after watching
the Anaheim Angels rally from a five-run deficit in the ninth
inning Friday night, they didn't show it. In fact, by the time
Saturday's game was over, it was Angels pitcher Brian Cooper whose
head was spinning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees jumped on Cooper for four runs in the first inning
and cruised to a 9-1 victory before 49,491 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Andy Pettitte was the antithesis of Cooper,
throwing a complete-game five-hitter. The only run he allowed came
on Troy Glaus' eighth-inning homer, his 36th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' 9-8, 11-inning win Friday marked only the second
time in Yankees history they lost a game at home which they led by
five runs or more in the ninth inning. The previous time happened
exactly 47 years previously - on Aug. 18, 1953, when the Yankees
took the same 8-3 lead into the ninth but lost to the Washington
Senators 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was making his first start since a stint at Triple-A
Edmonton, where he went to correct his mechanics, but showed he
still has work to do. He gave up eight runs (six earned) and 11
hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting frustrated,'' Cooper admitted. ``I'm going out
there still confident I can get outs. I just can't throw the ball
where I want it to go. It's frustrating having guys set up for a
certain pitch and not being able to throw it where you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Angels have an off-day Thursday, they won't need a
fifth starter until Aug. 29. That means Cooper likely will be
headed back to Edmonton so the Angels can call up a reliever to
give the bullpen a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cooper was far from sharp, he didn't get much help
from his defense, particularly left fielder Ron Gant, who made two
errors - one physical and one mental - in the Yankees' three-run
third inning. In that inning, the Yankees tied a major-league
record with three sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, three.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on second and third and nobody out, Jorge Posada
hit a slicing line drive to Gant in left. Gant got his glove on the
ball but dropped it for an error. Posada reached second and was
credited with a sacrifice fly. Tino Martinez went from second to
third.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius followed with the second sacrifice fly of the
inning, hitting a fly ball to Gant in left for the first out, as
Martinez tagged from third.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger then hit yet another fly ball to left, and this
one drove Gant back to the warning track. But after making the
catch, Gant casually looked over his shoulder and slowly backed
into the wall. Meanwhile, Posada took off from second and raced
home as the relay to the plate came too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no excuses,'' Gant said. ``I thought there were
three outs. Even my son, who's 5 years old, he knows how many outs
there are. It's just a stupid mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 7-0 lead, the game was in Pettitte's hands. He gave up
three hits through seven innings before Glaus' two-out homer to
right-center in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was the Angels' 193rd of the season, setting a
franchise record and tying Glaus with Don Baylor (1979) for the
fourth most in a single season in Angels history. Reggie Jackson
(39 in `82) holds the record and Bobby Bonds (37 in `77) and Leon
Wagner (37 in `62) are tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   It was little consolation for the Angels, who fell to 2-3 on the
current trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug a hole for ourselves,'' Scioscia said. ``We helped them
a little bit, but they just pounded the ball. They kicked our butt.
We'll just have to crumple this one up and throw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees showed the best cure for a hangover is to play well
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fine,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said of his
players. ``When I came in this morning, Tino looked at me and said,
`How do you feel today, skip?` There was a lot of concern on
everybody's faces but you get through it. You hate to lose games
that you should win, but you're going to win some games that you
probably shouldn't. You can't dwell on it, there's too much
baseball to play.''

WEIS OFFENSE MAY BE WORTH WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots are 0 for the past 41 years, so
it is understandable that there is pessimism about them, especially
their offense. Perhaps this will be a year in which the offense
struggles, but keep in mind that there's a history when it comes to
Patriots/Jets offenses that Charlie Weis has had a hand in. The
pattern is that they start slowly, then build to the point where
they can get pretty explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Example 1: The 1998 Jets. Weis, the offensive coordinator, was
in the thick of a quarterback controversy in camp. Glenn Foley was
being pushed by Vinny Testaverde, Foley got hurt, Testaverde
stepped in, and you know the rest. But the Jets started 0-2. The
offense didn't look good. In fact, Curtis Martin started his Jets
career with 116 yards in two games, and in those games, only two
receptions were made by tight ends, as 84 of 99 pass plays were
directed toward Wayne Chrebet or Keyshawn Johnson. But on Sept. 21,
the offense had a breakthrough game against Indianapolis. Weis
spread out the offense, often using three-receiver sets that Martin
ran out of, exploding for 144 yards on 23 carries. The Jets amassed
505 yards (302 rushing), their largest output in 10 years. Leon
Johnson, the third-down back, scored three touchdowns, including an
82-yard screen pass from Testaverde, who made his first start and
tossed four scoring passes. Weis had Johnson run on the Colts'
substitute packages. Martin told his offensive line before the
game, ``Get me to the line of scrimmage and I'll do the rest.'' The
Jets went on to win 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Example 2: The 1996 Patriots. Again, the team started 0-2. Weis
was coaching receivers at the time. The Patriots didn't have
first-rounder Terry Glenn on the field for the opener, a 24-14
drubbing by the Dolphins. ``We got whipped very, very soundly,''
said then-coach Bill Parcells. ``And I know it wasn't our best. I
told the players, if it was, we're in trouble.'' Bledsoe completed
only 50 percent of his passes, Martin ran for only 23 yards, Shawn
Jefferson fumbled twice and was carried off the field with a
concussion. Bledsoe's first shotgun pass was intercepted. In Week 2
vs. Buffalo, the Patriots lost, 17-10, despite starting seven of
their first 11 possessions at their 40 or beyond, a result of
excellent play by the defense of Al Groh and Bill Belichick.
Bledsoe was 21 of 46 for 210 yards and was sacked four times. After
the game Parcells said, ``I think there's something we can build on
here.'' Sure enough, the Patriots squashed the Arizona Cardinals,
31-0, the following week, the big play an emphatic fourth-down
keeper by Bledsoe that kept a scoring drive alive with 41 seconds
remaining in the half. The Patriots went 11-3 the rest of the
season and reached the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Example 3: The 1994 Patriots. A pitiful team and pitiful offense
finally blossomed when Bledsoe led a miraculous come-from-behind
victory over the Vikings, the start of a seven-game win streak that
led to a playoff game against Belichick's Cleveland Browns. Weis
was the tight ends coach during this offensive spurt, in which
Bledsoe first discovered that Ben Coates could get him out of a lot
of bad situations. Coates caught 96 passes that season, an NFL
record for tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Example 4: The 1999 Jets. After going through three
quarterbacks, the Jets settled on Ray Lucas, and the result was a
6-2 second half in which the offense really found itself. Though
Weis had some play-calling duties taken away by Parcells, he was
still running the offense and made it work after a horrendous start
that was due in large part to Testaverde getting injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have to be patient, because it's a new system
we're getting used to and we don't have all of our people in place
yet,'' said Glenn. ``Charlie has a great offense, and once we start
showing everything, I think people will think a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's preseason and we're not showing everything.
We're still trying to get our offensive line in order and trying to
see who's going to start at running back. I think we have the
people in place that could make this work. I know the players are
excited about it, and pretty soon the fans will see.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, of course, is one of the most vital parts of the offense.
He'll be on the field with Troy Brown a lot, the idea being that
defenses won't be able to double-team Glenn much.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Patriots don't have the pieces they had in '96.
Coates was in his prime, as were Martin and Bruce Armstrong, and
the younger offensive linemen such as Dave Wohlabaugh, Todd Rucci,
and Max Lane meshed well with old-timer William Roberts. Lane,
Rucci, and Armstrong often look back to those days and see no
reason why they can't be revisited. When injuries heal and everyone
is playing together again, maybe we'll see the pattern develop
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the fans and the media aren't that confident, but the
players are,'' said Brown. ``I think we can move the ball and be
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis is also known for his trickery, something the Patriots
haven't shown in preseason, except for a perfectly executed reverse
by Brown. There appears to be time to see whether rookie J.R.
Redmond can be the next Martin.
</P>
<P>
   You've waited 41 years; what's another few weeks?

   Two good Boston College stories: quarterbacks Mark Hartsell and
Matt Hasselbeck. Hartsell, who was the starter for Dan Henning for
two years at BC, never got drafted and was cut twice by the
Redskins in training camp. He hadn't played since training camp of
1997, settling in as a salesman for Astra Zenica, a pharmaceutical
firm, and living in Bridgewater with his wife, Jennifer. ``I was at
a national sales meeting,'' said Hartsell, ``and I get a call and
it's (Bears offensive coordinator) Gary Crowton, who had been my
quarterback coach at BC. I hadn't talked to Gary since 1993, though
I'd tried to contact him when he was up in New England interviewing
for the head coaching job. He wondered if I wanted to come to
Chicago for a one-day tryout. I said, `Why not?' '' The
6-foot-5-inch Hartsell weighed about 240 at the time, so Crowton
told him to get his weight down and he'd buy some time. A few weeks
later, said Hartsell, ``I had lost some weight but not all of it
and while I was running the 40-yard dash, I popped my hamstring. I
had to continue the workout with a bad hammy. My leg was dead.'' He
went home feeling he'd never get called back. But he did. He was
invited to camp, signed to a contract, and has performed well
beyond expectations. In the Bears' exhibition opener against the
New York Giants, he was 8 of 9 for 70 yards and a touchdown. ``I
want to make this team more than anything,'' said Hartsell. ``I
love it here. It's funny, it's all about being in the right place
at the right time. We have four very good quarterbacks here, so
it's going to be tough.'' He's whittled his weight to 213 and
thinks he would take a practice squad job if it came down to that.
Hartsell, 26, is trying to live out his dream and hopes to make the
six months away from his wife worth the time lost. ``I couldn't
have done this without Jennifer's support,'' he said. ``I started
doing this in March and I left her behind. And she's been so
supportive.'' The Bears will go with Cade McNown as the starter,
with Jim Miller behind him. Shane Matthews has become major trade
bait and is among the most sought-after quarterbacks in the league.
That could leave Hartsell the No. 3 job. ``I know the longer I'm
around, the better I'll get,'' he said. ``It's a great offense, and
I think I can run it well.'' . . . Story 2: Brett Favre is expected
back for the regular season _ doctors said the tendinitis in his
right elbow will subside _ and the Packers weren't worried anyway
because they feel they may have one of the league's best backups
and rising stars in Hasselbeck. The Packers have resisted trade
offers of No. 1 picks for Hasselbeck, who was the top-rated passer
in the NFL in last year's exhibition season and is on his way to
achieving that distinction again. An interesting story is the
relationship between Hasselbeck and Packers executive Andrew
Brandt. Just two years ago, Brandt was an agent representing
Hasselbeck; now Brandt is negotiating on the other side of the
table. ``It's a little different,'' said Brandt, the Packers' chief
negotiator. ``I used to see Matt about twice a year when I
represented him, and now I see him every day. He's building a house
about two doors down from me, so it's been a nice situation,
especially having the chance to watch him develop into the
quarterback he's becoming. I'm just thrilled to be witnessing that
progress.'' Brandt recalls when the Packers had a dilemma about
whether to put him on their active roster or allow another team to
take him off their practice squad. The Packers chose to activate
him. ``That proved to be quite a decision,'' said Brandt. Because
of Hasselbeck's limited service time, he fits into a certain salary
slot, so there have been no contract hassles yet, but Brandt said
of his contract, ``We sweetened it a little.''

   One of the feel-good stories in NFL camps was that of
30-year-old rookie Gerald Vaughn of the New Orleans Saints. The
6-3, 207-pound safety out of Ole Miss played seven years in the
Canadian Football League before getting his NFL shot. Vaughn still
makes rookie mistakes, but he has caught coach Jim Haslett's eye
and it appears he'll make the team. Vaughn played against Emmitt
Smith when Smith was starring at Florida and against Alvin Harper,
who went to Tennessee. Harper is now out of football, Smith's
career is on the downside, and Vaughn is just beginning . . .
Patriots fifth-round pick Dave Stachelski was on the field
practicing in New Orleans at the end of the week. That's something
he barely did in New England. Stachelski denied that he was
homesick during his time in New England, saying, ``I wanted to be
there and play, but things just didn't work out.'' They sure
didn't. But Stachelski is a pretty talented player, the eighth
tight end to participate in Saints camp. With starter Cam Cleeland
out for most of the year with an injured Achilles' tendon,
Stachelski has a chance of sticking . . . As outrageous as it was
for the Redskins to charge $10 to park and $10 admission, they said
they lost $1.1 million in training camp. The team drew about 3,000
fans per day during the week and up to 7,000 on weekends. The
Redskins also sold souvenirs and food . . . The Redskins have a
plethora of running backs, and after a story surfaced that the Jets
were looking to trade for Skip Hicks to back up Martin, the
Redskins issued a statement saying that he was not available. The
Redskins also have Stephen Davis, Adrian Murrell, and a
terrific-looking runner in Chad Dukes, who at 6-3, 240 can pound
the ball. Dukes is out with a sprained ankle, but if he's let
loose, teams will line up to obtain him . . . Funny how things work
out. When Buddy Ryan was fired as Philadelphia head coach after the
1991 season, Jeff Fisher, the defensive coordinator at the time,
was overlooked because he was only 32. The Eagles instead hired
Rich Kotite . . . It would cost about $385.4 million to refurbish
the Metrodome in Minneapolis. The Vikings need to have it done,
though, if they are to remain in Minneapolis for the foreseeable
future. Gov. Jesse Ventura, the former pro wrestler, is on record
as saying he is not in favor of public money for sports stadiums .
. . There is a little bad blood between Browns teammates Errict
Rhett, the veteran running back, and safety Marquis Smith. The two
have had a few altercations in camp, and last week Smith's
helmet-first tackle opened a four-stitch cut on Rhett's face. Rhett
left his bloody jersey in Smith's locker with a note saying,
``Payback is coming.'' Rhett said, ``I hope he hits the other team
like that instead of me all the time.'' . . . Dallas will go with
kicker Tim Sedar, who as recently as last spring was teaching at
Lucas High in Mansfield, Ohio. Sedar set records at Ashland (Ohio)
University two years ago but didn't get a shot at the pro game. He
kept kicking as he coached football at Lucas High, and it became
evident that he was kicking even better than he had in college. He
got a tryout with the Cowboys and won the job . . . Arena Football
League quarterback alert: The Cowboys have signed Charlie Puleri
after veteran backup Paul Justin came up with a sore elbow . . .
Looking for a defensive end? It's easily the scarcest position out
there. Veteran Neil Smith, former Patriot Ferric Collons, and
former 49ers Roy Barker and Gabe Wilkins are the best of the
remaining lot. The Patriots have even contacted Mike Jones, who
played for them in the mid '90s . . . Look for the Vikings to cut
veteran end Fernando Smith before camp ends . . . Why is it that
kickers drafted in the first round seem to get into trouble? The
trials and tribulations of Raiders draftee Sebastian Janikowski
have been well-chronicled this year, and now we hear that the last
first-round kicker, Russell Erxleben (in 1979, to New Orleans via
Texas), was sentenced to six months in prison for bilking investors
out of $34 million. He was charged with conspiracy securities fraud
. . . Former Patriots tight end Russ Francis, who is running for
Congress in Hawaii, was fined $1,000 for campaign funding
violations . . . The 49ers don't have many veterans left, but the
ones remaining are dropping like flies. Center Chris Dalman's
career might be over because of disk problems in his neck. He may
need surgery.

</P>
<P>
   Though receiver Dane Looker was having a good camp in St. Louis,
the consensus among Rams personnel was that he would have been
released, so they were thrilled when the Patriots came calling,
offering a sixth-round pick (contingent on Looker making the New
England roster). It was an odd move for the Patriots, considering
that scouts have Sean Morey with much better speed in the 40. Morey
and Looker may battle for the final receiver spot, but Morey has
the edge because of his special teams play . . . An evaluation by
NFL scouts of the last five drafts had the Patriots ranked
surprisingly high at 10th. The scouts rated Chris Canty the biggest
bust and Ted Johnson the best hit . . . In his forthcoming book,
``The Final Season,'' Parcells speaks glowingly of Martin and Mike
Holmgren. On Martin: ``He has 6,300 yards for his five-year career,
so he has averaged better than 1,200 yards per season. I'm not
saying he's the best in the league, but I mean this with all my
heart: I'll take him over any back in the league, and you can have
the rest.'' On Holmgren: ``Mike Holmgren is one of the best coaches
in the game. When you play him or one of his teams, whether it's
Green Bay or Seattle, it's a chess match. He has a great knack for
substituting his players. He loves to conceal what he's going to
do. He changes what he does game by game with his personnel
substitutions. His pattern can be erratic, and defensively you just
have to hang with him because sooner or later you will discover
just what he's trying to do. When you're coaching against him, you
hope it's sooner rather than later.'' . . . Charlie Casserly, GM of
the new Houston franchise, gave a thumbs-up to the movie ``The
Replacements,'' based on Washington's 1987 replacement team, which
went 3-0 and helped pave the way for the Redskins to win the Super
Bowl. ``I thought it was the best football movie ever,'' said
Casserly. ``In a four-star system, I'd give it five stars. A lot of
what we went through during that period was on the screen. In one
scene, a (striking) player cracks a window on a bus (carrying the
replacements). That actually happened, except one of our defensive
linemen (Darryl Grant) actually stood in front of the bus and
forced it to stop and then smashed the window.'' . . . Rob Morris
of Brigham Young is the Colts' middle linebacker of the future, but
he has struggled with early assignments and for now he's seen as
backing up veteran Dwight Hollier. ``I'm not at the point where I
want to be yet, but I'm not sure anybody else is, either,'' said
Morris. ``I've just got to keep thinking, keep reacting, keep
studying film. I think it will come.'' . . . There is still much
shock in the scouting world that Alabama defensive lineman Reggie
Grimes has fit in so well with the Patriots. Said one scout, ``Our
team didn't even have him on the board, anywhere. We saw him and
didn't think much of him. Alabama rotated their defensive front,
and there was nothing we saw. If the Patriots are getting benefits,
that's a great scouting job on their part.'' . . . Gilbert Brown,
the often-heavy defensive tackle who has been on the free agent
market, is currently in Green Bay but has not made contact with
Packer officials about playing for them. Brown spent much of the
offseason at a weight reduction clinic at Duke University, but
there is speculation he may have put some weight back on.

PITINO QUIETLY CONFIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It may come as some relief that Celtics coach Rick
Pitino will keep his optimism to himself this season. The promises
are gone. The belief that better times and winning records await
will be whispered privately. The late-season conviction that Boston
can make the playoffs will be kept quiet. The rebuilding plans will
be laid out behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   In this city, which Pitino very publicly chastised for its
negativity, he realizes that the best comments are left unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always very optimistic about things,'' said Pitino. ``Last
year, I was optimistic and it backfired on me. In certain towns, it
works. In this town, I think the best thing to do is go about your
business and not be optimistic. If you are, be it to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the clash of personalities between Pitino and Boston began
before the Celtics posted a disappointing 35-47 record last season.
When he was hired, Pitino had grand plans, plotting postseason
appearances in his third and fourth seasons and
championship-caliber play by his fifth and sixth. Near the end of
his third season last March, Pitino said that if he couldn't turn
it around in 2000-01 and make the playoffs, he would move on. With
a young team he pieced together, Pitino believes it's easier to
replace one part rather than several.
</P>
<P>
   He has no timetable for a turnaround, insisting three straight
losing seasons and mounting criticism do not frustrate him. Still,
the stakes for Pitino will be particularly high this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino does not know what to expect, but he knows what he wants.
Conditioning will be a priority. ``Home invincibility'' will be
preached as the Celtics look for 28-32 wins at the FleetCenter. A
road record better than last year's 9-32 will be a necessity.
Players such as Antoine Walker, Paul Pierce, and Tony Battie will
need to show more benefits of NBA experience and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   These points are obvious. The question, as always, is whether
the Celtics can accomplish the goals they set in the offseason.
Pitino is, well, encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Recent weeks of deal-making were never expected to net top-level
talent, but Pitino likes what he picked up in the free agent market
(point guard Randy Brown) and what he got in return for Danny
Fortson (specifically a 2001 first-round pick and point guard
Robert Pack). He also likes the efforts returning players are
putting into offseason training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to make us win with young talent is
conditioning,'' said Pitino. ``We're not going to do it with
experience. We're not going to do it with knowledge. We're not
going to do it with great execution because we're not old enough
yet. What's going to do it with us is wearing people out and being
physically in great shape and a style of play that causes
turnovers. That's what we have to get back to.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pitino, players expected to fill key roles on the
squad have worked diligently this summer. Battie has received
tutelage from Kiki Vandeweghe, and Walter McCarty has scheduled a
few lessons with the former NBA forward. Battie may be ready for a
breakthrough year and Pitino thinks he will compete hard to start
at center. Vitaly Potapenko has been in the gym every day; Pitino
said he's working ``as if it's a Rocky movie.'' Adrian Griffin has
started running as he rehabilitates his ankle injury. Pierce
foresees a breakout year for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Walker remains an enigma to Pitino, who expects the 24-year-old
former All-Star to work toward the top of his game over the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit to how good he can become,'' said Pitino,
``but I'll reserve my judgment until I see him work out. Antoine's
a bright ballplayer who has to now reach his potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The themes of training camp will be conditioning and
competition. If the players don't arrive fit, preseason workouts
might be torturous and the season won't take shape as expected.
Pitino wants the players rounding into form by early September.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Celtics staff are in constant communication with
the players to make sure that happens. Pitino believes he has the
personnel to put forth a quick, athletic team.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribing to the belief that ``great competition makes a great
camp,'' Pitino hopes the additions of draft pick Jerome Moiso,
Brown, and Pack will help raise the intensity the extra notch
needed to produce a spot in the playoffs. (Keep in mind: The eighth
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference last year went to Milwaukee,
which had a 42-40 record. In the Western Conference, eighth-seeded
Sacramento was 44-38.)
</P>
<P>
   Pitino believes he has ensured the Celtics' future, but it's
uncertain how long he will coach the team. For better or worse,
Boston has invested in first-round picks, believing the 2001 draft
could be one of the best in the past decade. Without salary cap
room any time soon, the brass has no other option than building
through picks.
</P>
<P>
   As Pitino sees it, Pierce is the Celtics' only tradeable
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the only frustrations Pitino lists as coach of the
Celtics came through the draft. After arriving, he didn't luck out
in the 1997 selection process, missing top lottery picks and shots
at Tim Duncan and Keith Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with chairman of the board Paul Gaston, Pitino said
he received support. But after seven losing seasons, Gaston wants a
turnaround. At one point, Pitino asked Gaston if he was
disappointed in the coach's three-year tenure. If so, Pitino said
he was willing to shake Gaston's hand and ``call it a day.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Pitino, Gaston wanted to know if he was
enjoying himself (yes) and if the pressure of the media and fans
was affecting his coaching (no). Pitino recalled that Gaston then
said, ``Well, if that's the case, I want you to stick with it and
turn this thing around and make us a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really going to look at my future,'' said Pitino.
``It's been the only time in my life where I have struggled as a
basketball coach. I don't think there's anything wrong with a coach
struggling. I think that's what builds character.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do on a number of occasions last year was take
the onus off the players and put it on my back. Why would I blow up
the team and start to go in a different direction? It's easier to
replace myself than it is the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blowing up the team at this stage and being a very young
basketball team is not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   With a schedule that features nine home games and six away games
in November, the Celtics must get off to a good start, which means
holding their own on the road. If they don't, the pressure and
criticism will resurface.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win 26 games at home and take care of business on the
road and just be a decent team, you're going to be a playoff
team,'' said Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than six weeks left until training camp, it
sounds like the old optimism is creeping in, quietly.

ALLISON WILL HAVE STRONG HAND IN LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 8-inch scar that runs down his forearm is reminder
enough for Jason Allison that it's time to get back to the ice.
When he pulls on his uniform for the Bruins' first regular-season
game this October, the center will have gone nine months without
putting stick to puck in a game that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about that,'' said Allison, sipping a cup of
coffee last week following a morning workout. ``I'm getting antsy.
I've pretty much had it with this workout stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who might have nodded off while waiting outside the
emergency room during the Bruins' 1999-2000 season, Allison played
his last game Jan. 8. Four days later, he underwent surgery to
repair ligament damage in his left thumb. On Feb. 16, his season
was declared done when his right wrist had to be repaired, an
operation that required a ligament to be transplanted from under
his right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all good _ I don't foresee any problems,'' said Allison,
who is perhaps the biggest key to Boston's hopes for returning to
the playoffs after missing twice in the last four seasons. ``I'll
be ready. And if it gets sore during faceoffs, then I'll have to
make some adjustments. But I'm expecting it to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Allison in the middle, dishing the puck and scoring
goals, the Boston offense went from faltering to fatal. About 90
days after Allison's last game, Ray Bourque was dealt to Colorado,
the official end to the season and a symbolic shift in how the club
will go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first orders of business when the Bruins reconvene
after Labor Day will be coach Pat Burns's selection of a captain.
Don Sweeney, recently signed to a new three-year deal, is the
likeliest candidate. The 12-year veteran is very much respected and
may be the only Bruin who played up to expectations last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain's important, obviously,'' said Allison, ``but
we've got the kind of team that will need five or six guys out
there leading, filling Ray's shoes. We've got to have our core guys
leading. Don Sweeney and Paul Coffey will carry some of that load.
But it's got to be a bunch of us _ me, Byron (Dafoe), Joe
(Thornton), AC (Anson Carter), Kyle (McLaren), even guys like Hal
(Gill) and P.J. (Axelsson). It's not going to be one definitive
person. It's got to be a group thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison likes the leadership role. His draft year, 1993, the
Capitals made him the 17th pick, but he returned to juniors
(London) and had the most prolific season of his career (55 goals,
142 points).
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly making the point that he would never lobby for
captaincy, and responding to the issue only because he was asked,
Allison said being made a captain in juniors brought out the best
in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just feel better on the ice,'' he recalled. ``For me, I
don't know how to describe it, but it makes you feel important _
and it makes you feel the pressure to go out there and do well. You
want to play good every night. And I know from a couple of years
ago (a first-round playoff win over Carolina), the captain's job _
along with other guys _ will be to get the guys on the team
together more. We had a tight bunch of guys that year, and we lost
a little of that. We've got to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   From high up in the press box last season, the Black 'n' Gold
crumbling at his feet, assistant general manager Mike O'Connell
looked down at Boston's ragged, disjointed play and stated, ``We
are not a team.'' It was the most telling admission of the season
by the front office.
</P>
<P>
   The club that convenes at training camp next month will have a
great number of new faces, starting with free agent signees Coffey,
Andrei Kovalenko, and Peter Popovic. Getting back some of that good
team feeling that was a trademark of Bruins teams in the '70s and
'80s, and seemingly so essential to their success, will have to be
one of the missions of the new guy with the ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an NHL captain is a great thing,'' said the 25-year-old
Allison, about the same age now as when Bourque took over the
captaincy. ``But regardless of who it is, I don't think it should
change the idea of leadership much. All of us have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Matt Zultek doesn't figure prominently in
Boston's plans for the upcoming season. But the 6-foot-4-inch,
225-pound left winger would like that to change, and is considering
coming to training camp even if he can't come to contract terms
with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a contract, just to take some of the pressure
off,'' said Zultek, whose agent is Larry Kelly. ``But would I come
without one? Yeah, probably, because the last couple of years have
been disappointing, and I'd like to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Zultek, once a first-round pick of the Kings, has the size and
strength to develop into a power forward. He was hoping to launch
his pro career in last year's training camp, after the Bruins
selected him 56th in the '99 draft, but a bothersome left knee kept
him out of workouts and ultimately led him to the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see . . . tendinitis, bursitis, and a cyst,'' said
Zultek, recounting what was wrong with the knee. ``The cyst was the
big thing. They didn't even know it was there until they went in,
because on the MRI it only showed up as fluid. But when they got in
there, it was the size of a golf ball _ that's what was causing me
so much pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Zultek has a strong shot and impressive speed for a big man. In
junior workouts with the Ottawa 67s, head coach Brian Kilrea would
bet him that he couldn't win footraces against the rest of the
club. Zultek never lost a bet. Over the summer, he has continued to
work diligently on his legs, hoping to improve on his speed from a
dead start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to give him the business,'' said Bruins longtime scout
Bob Tindall, who lives near Zultek in Toronto. ``I tell him, `Hey,
Matt, you could be a millionaire.' Because the league is always
looking for that proverbial power forward, and he's got that size.
He needs to work on his meanness for that to happen. That doesn't
mean he has to be a goon out there. But look at how some of the big
guys out there (example: John LeClair) use their body to their
advantage. He's got to learn some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of each other last week, Joe Sakic and LeClair
learned their salaries for 2000-01. Just prior to an arbitration
hearing, Sakic signed a one-year deal with Colorado for $7.9
million _ about a 13 percent bump from last year. In Philadelphia,
LeClair's figure was set at $7 million (up from $3.9 million) _ the
largest arbitration award in league history. Both forwards remain
on target to become unrestricted free agents next July. Scuttlebutt
around Philly is that LeClair may be dealt before the start of the
season if the sides can't agree on a long-term pact . . . Jeff
``The Not So Artful'' Odgers will be back for more this season,
filling the pugilist's position for the Minnesota Wild. Hard to
believe it was four years ago that Odgers was swapped here from San
Jose when the Bruins finally gave up on Al ``The Planet'' Iafrate .
. . Former Mount St. Charles (Woonsocket, R.I.) blue liner Mathieu
Schneider signed on with the Kings as a free agent, a deal worth $2
million for the upcoming season and perhaps the 2001-02 season.
Look for Schneider to be paired with big-hitting Rob Blake, and
Mattias Norstrom to be bumped over with Jere Karalahti . . . Bruin
short-timer Randy Robitaille, dealt in the hours following the
Atlanta expansion draft in '99, could see first-line duty in
Nashville with franchise center _ and potential superstar _ David
Legwand, perhaps with Vitali Yachmenev on the opposite wing.
Robitaille proved in Providence that he can score (102 points in
'98-99) but has yet to show any consistent touch or determination
in the NHL . . . Former Boston College Eagle Marty McInnis could be
one of the keys to the Ducks finally being more than a Paul
Kariya-Teemu Selanne sideshow act. GM Pierre Gauthier went out this
summer and added free agent German Titov and drafted 26-year-old
Jonas Ronnqvist. The 30-year-old McInnis likely will be with them
on a No. 3 line. It remains unfathomable that a team with the
firepower of Kariya and Selanne missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The assumption around Phoenix is that GM Bobby Smith will be out
of work immediately after Wayne Gretzky's ownership group formally
takes over the Desert Dogs, perhaps before training camp.
Meanwhile, the Great One, whose job title will be director of
hockey operations (perhaps with agent Mike Barnett hired away from
IMG to be GM), is talking openly about his intention to bring in
Claude Lemieux as a free agent _ with the likes of Detroit and
Dallas, among others, also pursuing the 35-year-old Prince of
Nastiness . . . Ex-Boston University defenseman Scott Lachance
didn't get the required $1.3 million qualifying offer from the
Canadiens to keep him in Montreal, allowing him to shop for a new
home as an unrestricted free agent at only age 27 (four years under
the standard trigger date). The 6-1 Lachance, the No. 4 pick
overall in the '91 draft (Islanders), landed last week in
Vancouver, where he'll join a blue line corps that includes Ed
Jovanovski, Mattias Ohlund, Adrian Aucoin, Murray Baron, Jason
Strudwick, and ex-Bruin Greg Hawgood . . . Columbus is the first
NHL franchise to have its practice facility adjacent to its home
rink (Nationwide Arena). The ``Wide'' still isn't complete, but is
sure to receive architectural kudos. The design includes two large
``eye'' windows that provide glimpses of the Columbus skyline . . .
Set your VCR for daytime TV Aug. 31. NHLers Scott Gomez, Jeremy
Roenick, Sheldon Souray, Chris Therien, and Kevin Weekes will be
seen that day on ``One Life to Live.'' No truth to the rumor that
referee Don Koharski declined a cameo role as the manager of a
Dunkin' Donuts.

HELTON WITHIN REACH OF .400 PLATEAU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The question, until he heats up again, is no longer:
Can Nomar do it?
</P>
<P>
   Now it is: Can a football player do it?
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton, the former
University of Tennessee quarterback who was drafted by the Rockies
in 1995 (one year after the Sox took Nomar Garciaparra), took a
.399 batting average into Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, the latest anyone has
hit that high since George Brett was batting .400 on Sept. 20 in
1980. Brett, incidentally, played in just 117 games that season and
had just 449 at-bats, a total Helton will pass by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Garciaparra, Helton bats lefthanded, the same as the last
player in the American League (Ted Williams, 1941) and the last
player in the National League (Bill Terry, Giants, 1930) to hit
.400.
</P>
<P>
   And while many say Garciaparra has a home-field advantage at
Fenway Park, where he was batting .403 entering the weekend, Helton
may have the ultimate home-field advantage in mile-high Coors
Field. Helton, who turns 27 Sunday and is in his third full season
in the big leagues, was hitting .439 (93 for 212) at Coors Field
entering Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot about that from (the national media),'' Helton
told reporters last week. ``It's just something else I have to deal
with, but what am I supposed to do about it? It's a great ballpark.
We've got great fans. I'm supposed to apologize for that? A lot of
guys hit better at home than they do on the road. What about all
the hitters over the years in Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, of course, is turning that argument inside out.
Fenway is supposed to be a boon to lefthanded hitters, but
Garciaparra hit .378 at home last season and has bettered that so
far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field, with its wide-open spaces and altitude
enhancements, is kind to both lefties and righties. Last season,
the Rockies hit .328 at home, .249 on the road. Their opponents hit
.329 at Coors, .271 in their home parks. Colorado's lefthanded
hitters hit .356 at Coors, righties .308.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why Helton, who was hitting .554 (36 for 65) in August to
Garciaparra's .270 (17 for 63), may live up to the ``Toddy
Ballgame'' handle given him by Denver Post columnist Woody Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five of the Rockies' last 45 games are at Coors,
including 10 of their last 13. But to attribute it all to a
home-field advantage is ludicrous. Helton put himself in position
to make this bid with a phenomenal nine-game stretch in which he
went 19 for 29 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Williams is my all-time idol,'' said Paul Ricciarini, the
Houston coordinator of pro scouting who has seen Helton since he
played in the Cape Cod League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't collect autographs, and the only two people I would
ask for one from are Ted Williams and Tiger Woods, so it's tough
for me to be objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Helton is such a marvelous talent and keeps himself under
control so well, shows such great poise at the plate _ just like
Ted. So can he do it? It's mind-boggling to imagine, but gosh darn
it, I'd have to say he has a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the Rockies essentially being out of
contention will work in Helton's favor. Ricciarini believes
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is playing poorly, it's easy to pitch around a guy
like Helton,'' Ricciarini said. ``And with Jeff Cirillo out of the
lineup because he's hurt, it'll be easier to pitch around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also some question of whether he'll put pressure on
himself. I don't see that as a factor. This is a tremendous star in
the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back to the Cape with the kid. He didn't hit many home
runs, but you could see he had all the requirements of a good major
league hitter. There have been a lot of guys who didn't home runs
in the Cape but all made contact, who went on to become power
hitters: Jeff Bagwell, Mo Vaughn, Frank Thomas, Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see that Todd was so athletic, a very instinctive
player, a very mature hitter, a solid guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton was drafted eighth overall in 1995, the same draft that a
kicker from Nebraska, Darin Erstad, went No. 1 overall to the
Angels. Erstad, of course, is taking aim at George Sisler's
all-time hit record of 257, set in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players taken ahead of Helton were Padres catcher Ben
Davis, so far a disappointment; Jose Cruz Jr., who was traded by
the Mariners to the Blue Jays; Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood, who has had
flashes of brilliance between injuries; high schooler Jaime Jones,
a bust for the Marlins; and Cuban pitcher Ariel Prieto, who has
been hurt for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the reputation of being a tough sign, because of the
football thing and the money,'' Ricciarini said. ``But it was a
very astute draft by the Rockies.''
</P>
<P>
   It could become a historic one.
</P>
<P>

   The US Olympic baseball selection committee, which on Wednesday
will announce its picks to represent the country in Sydney next
month, will load its squad with mostly ``4-A'' types: experienced
minor leaguers considered not quite good enough for the big
leagues. Many top prospects won't be going to Australia because
their major league teams intend to call them up in September.
Former big leaguer Tim Raines, who is playing in the independent
Atlantic League, is a good bet to go. Slugger Ozzie Canseco, who
has 37 home runs for his independent league team, is expected to be
passed over. The committee had great interest in Morgan Burkhart _
and wouldn't NBC have loved the story of the Frontier League
legend? _ but got word from Dan Duquette that Burkhart probably
will be back on the big club when rosters expand Sept. 1. The
committee also had interest in Dernell Stenson, but he's out of the
picture for the same reason. Steve Lomasney's name came up early,
but according to one committee source, he was dropped from the list
because the Sox hedged on whether he'd be promoted. Lomasney's
ongoing hamstring problems _ he reaggravated the injury last week
but got back in action Saturday _ also would have made his
selection unlikely. Paxton Crawford was discussed, but the
pitcher's tumble from bed KO'd his chances. Still a long shot is
Pawtucket lefty reliever Tim Young, who was up with the Sox earlier
this season. Young's unusual motion may come in handy against
lefthanded hitters in international play. Former Sox farmhand
Curtis Pride, now playing for the Dodgers' Triple A team in
Albuquerque, was another possibility, but his chances faded. Mark
Texeira, the Georgia Tech star who was terrific on the touring US
national team of college players, was expected to have a great shot
at the Olympic club, but likely will be passed over. His lack of
experience with wooden bats was one concern. The Red Sox, who
drafted Texeira out of high school in 1998, are sure to rue their
inability to sign him. He is rated the best collegiate player in
the country entering his junior year . . . The Sox will send six
players to the Arizona Fall League's Phoenix Desert Dogs, a team
that will be managed by former Padres shortstop Garry Templeton:
Lomasney; pitchers Sunny Kim, Sang Lee, Chris Reitsma, and Casey
Fossum; and catcher/infielder Shea Hillenbrand. Lefthander Fossum
is the supplemental first-round pick out of the 1999 draft who
rewrote the Texas A&AMP;M record book and has 124 strikeouts in 153 1/3
innings with Single A Sarasota. Kim and Lomasney both played in the
Fall League last year . . . Pedro Martinez had a special reason to
notice when Mets outfielder Benny Agbayani caught a high fly, then
handed the baseball to a fan in Shea Stadium last Saturday, not
realizing it was only the second out. Martinez was on the mound for
the Expos a few years ago when teammate Larry Walker pulled the
same stunt in Dodger Stadium on an ESPN Sunday night game . . . You
understand, don't you, that Roger Clemens collects $10.3 million
for 2003 whether or not he pitches that season for the Yankees?
Under the terms of his deal, Clemens will receive a $5 million
signing bonus, paid out over the next two years, and salaries of
$7.8 million for 2001 and 2002. By throwing in the third-year
option, the Yanks can say Clemens's deal averages $10.3 million,
well below the $15 million a year the Dodgers gave Kevin Brown.
Clemens, who is 44 wins short of 300, could decline the option,
still collect the dough, and seek a new contract, with the Yankees
or another club. Remember: It's not about the money . . . Big
league clubs would be wise to make copies of the comments Chipper
Jones made after agreeing to his six-year, $90 million deal with
the Braves, as an example of how to become filthy rich and stay
gracious about it. Said Chipper, ``This kind of money is really
unheard of and it's almost embarrassing to talk about. It's not
where I came from. I came from middle class. We had to work hard
for what we got. To have this given to me is a little
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are a season-high 18 games over .500, which has
reinforced Dusty Baker's status as one of the game's most highly
regarded managers. But don't overlook the talent Baker has at his
disposal. ``J.T. Snow is hitting over .300, is going to knock in
100 runs, and is the best-fielding first baseman in the league,''
one executive said. ``Jeff Kent, the second baseman, is doing
things only Rogers Hornsby has ever done. He's knocked in over 100
runs in each of the last four years. Rich Aurilia, the shortstop,
led the league's shortstops in home runs and RBIs last season and
will come close to that this season. Barry Bonds is the player of
the '90s. Dusty calls the center fielder, Marvin Benard, the
second- or third-best leadoff hitter in the league. Ellis Burks,
you know all about him in Boston. A stud. They have two kids
catching (Bobby Estalella, Doug Mirabelli) who aren't costing them
anything and are going to combine for around 25 home runs and 75
RBIs. Then, look at the pitching. Livan Hernandez, former World
Series MVP. Shawn Estes, 19-game winner in 1997. Russ Ortiz,
18-game winner in '99. Kirk Rueter, 32 games over .500. And the
closer, Robb Nen, who in the last three years has more saves than
anybody except Trevor Hoffman. It ain't all magic there. They've
got some talent.'' . . . The White Sox' Big Three of James Baldwin,
Mike Sirotka, and Jim Parque were 27-12 with a 3.95 ERA before the
All-Star break. They were 6-7, 4.99 after the break, entering the
weekend . . . Former Sox outfielder Damon Buford, who went to the
Cubs for Manny Alexander, has made just two errors in center field,
a typical Gold Glove-caliber performance. But Buford, an everyday
player for the first time in his career, is already expected to be
no better than a backup next season, when the Cubs are planning on
an outfield of Rondell White, top prospect Corey Patterson, and
Sammy Sosa. Buford has a career-high 14 home runs, but he also has
97 whiffs and just 36 RBIs. Sosa, incidentally, now says manager
Don Baylor's criticism of his fielding and base-running actually
helped him, a turnabout from the days when Sluggin' Sammy acted
highly offended by Baylor's remarks. Sosa has slimmed down from 236
pounds in spring training to his current 221. ``It's good sometimes
that people say something (negative) about me because that's good
motivation,'' Sosa said. ``I work harder and get better. Maybe I
was a little bit overweight.'' Said Buford: ``It's night and day.
Now he's the prototypical right fielder who makes all the plays.''
. . . Belle, who has a no-trade clause through the 2001 season and
is owed $30 million by Baltimore for the next three seasons, heard
the loudest booing he's heard all season last Wednesday after he
did not run out a double-play grounder and misplayed a ball off the
right-field fence. As Kenny Rosenthal, who just has left the
Baltimore Sun for The Sporting News, reminds us: ``When Cal
(Ripken) retires, the Orioles become Albert's team. How'd you like
to be in charge of that marketing campaign?'' . . . Not to be
missed: ``Summer of Love,'' Jim Callis's terrific piece on the Cape
Cod League in Baseball America, and also on the publication's Web
site (www.baseballamerica.com). BA is an absolute must-read for the
hard-core fan . . . One major league executive said there have been
more waiver claims than ever this season. Yankees GM Brian Cashman
made 48 claims in one day, according to the executive. Many
baseball people still believe that the Yankees really didn't want
Jose Canseco but claimed him so that neither the Mariners nor White
Sox could take him. Canseco already had gone unclaimed by everybody
else. The danger in claiming players is that if the waiving team
doesn't withdraw waivers, you could get stuck with a player you
really don't want. Two years ago, the Padres claimed lefty Randy
Myers so he wouldn't wind up in Atlanta. Myers pitched 14 1/3
innings for the Padres, got hurt, and hasn't thrown a pitch in the
last two years, while collecting $12.25 million . . . Tampa Bay
rookie Aubrey Huff, who two years ago was still at the University
of Miami but Monday night played in Fenway Park against Martinez:
``That felt really good to get a hit against Pedro, and then I'm
there at second base and behind me is Nomar Garciaparra. I'm
looking around and I'm like, `God, this is really happening.' '' .
. . Two of Massachusetts's top high school prospects recently
returned from Long Beach and the Area Code games, a heavily scouted
competition of the nation's best prep talent. Mike Conroy, a
lefthanded-hitting outfielder from BC High, and John Toffey, a
shortstop and righthanded pitcher from St. Sebastian's, were picked
for the team that represented the Eastern seaboard. Toffey is the
son of Boston sports agent Jack Toffey . . . Bob Kurtz, who served
with distinction for eight years in the Red Sox TV booth, is now in
Minneapolis prepping for the first year of a new NHL franchise, the
Wild. But old habits die hard, and you can bet that Kurtz is
keeping up with the Sox on Sportspages.com . . . Matt Kinney lost
his big-league debut to the Blue Jays, 3-2, Friday night, but the
Twins are high on the 23-year-old righthander from Bangor, Maine,
who went from the Sox to the Twinkies in the deal that brought
Boston Orlando Merced and Greg Swindell. Merced was released
without getting a hit for the Sox, while Swindell left after the
'98 season as a free agent. Kinney, meanwhile, had surgery a year
ago for bone chips in his elbow, but went 6-1 with a 2.71 ERA at
Double A New Britain, then was promoted to Triple A Salt Lake,
where he was 5-2 with a 4.25 ERA. Kinney has been working on a
changeup to go with an above-average slider and a 90-94 m.p.h.
fastball. The Twins think they may have a front-line pitcher in the
making . . . Glenallen Hill had seven home runs in his first 38
at-bats with the Yankees, then hit two more Friday night. Yankee
newcomers David Justice, Hill, and Canseco hit 22 home runs in
their first 216 at-bats. The Bombers hit just 100 home runs in
their first 83 games, but had 55 in their first 35 after the break.

</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MERLONI-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Psychic friends of the world, Lou Merloni has no use
for you. Palm readers and astrologists, go enlighten someone else.
</P>
<P>
   What can you possibly tell the Red Sox utilityman that he
doesn't already know?
</P>
<P>
   That he is currently in a hitting zone, the kind in which a
check swing turns into an RBI bloop double? That happened in the
third inning of a 9-0 shellacking of the Texas Rangers Saturday.
Merloni's popup just over the head of first baseman Rafael Palmeiro
landed in fair territory, scoring Nomar Garciaparra and sending
Troy O'Leary to third.
</P>
<P>
   He also knows that his current stint in Boston is a stroke of
good fortune. One month ago, Merloni was sitting on bench for the
Yokohama BayStars of the Central League in Japan. He was a pinch
hitter, batting .213 in 42 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a good time,'' said Merloni, the Framingham
resident who was released by Yokohama and signed by the Red Sox to
a minor league contract July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my release to get back to America, I just enjoyed
being back in Pawtucket playing again,'' said Merloni, who was
called up to Boston last Monday. ``It gave me a lot of life, just
to have fun playing and trying to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This callup was real unexpected, but I'm just happy to be
playing baseball. It's a change of scenery for me up here in
Boston, but I'm just starting with the same attitude, not trying to
do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   No one even needs to tell Merloni to be superstitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in the clubhouse today and they moved my locker,'' said
Merloni. ``All my stuff was moved, so I came in and I decided it
wasn't time to change anything. So I moved to my other locker and
moved my stuff back.''
</P>
<P>
   Did that have anything to do with the fact that he went 3 for 5
with 3 RBIs and 2 runs Saturday? Merloni's not taking any chances.
Since his callup, he is hitting .560, with three three-hit games;
before this season, he had four three-hit games in 82 career games.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Japanese is probably a little better than what it used to
be, that's for sure,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy Williams. ``But
he's really contributed a lot offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here before, so we all know how he is _ he's a heck
of a teammate. He plays hard. He's a winner. He gives you
everything he's got. And, to say the least, he's really swinging
that bat.''
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's output, Merloni extended his career-high hitting
streak to six games, including five straight multihit games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got lucky today,'' said Merloni. ``I got the check-swing
double and kind of changed up and took a lazy swing up there. I'm
just trying to see the ball, same as before.''
</P>
<P>
   How long this will last is anyone's guess _ psychics included.
Right now, Merloni is merely thrilled that he isn't riding a bench
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He's also pleased that a good hitting stretch isn't going to
waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good aim, that's about it,'' said Merloni. ``I'm
hitting balls and you look up and it's finding the hole somewhere.
Rather than just trying to place anything, I'm just swinging the
bat, looking up, and seeing where it goes.''

MARTINEZ WARMS TO THE TASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He felt pretty good warming up before Saturday's outing
against the Texas Rangers. But, as Pedro Martinez said, ``The
bullpen is not the game. You have to go out and face a few batters
and do it from one inning to the other and, pretty much, get to the
spot where you left the game before.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Red Sox ace couldn't wait to start again, to get back
on the mound at Fenway Park, and, most important, to work out the
stiffness in his right shoulder that had plagued him in his
previous start, last Monday against Tampa Bay, causing him to ask
out after four innings.
</P>
<P>
   While all of Red Sox Nation worried about whether Martinez would
go back on the disabled list, he assured manager Jimy Williams,
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, and team doctor Bill Morgan he was not
likely to miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, before a sellout crowd of 33,222, Martinez put
everyone's fears to rest _ including his own. He went seven innings
in a dominant 9-0 victory over the Rangers, ringing up 10
strikeouts to tie Jim Lonborg (784) for ninth place on the club's
all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell the people were really worried, even myself, I
was concerned, because I threw on the side and this thing happened
from one day to the other,'' said Martinez, who said the stiffness
stemmed from jet lag and dehydration on a long flight home from
Texas. ``To me it's not something I'm used to seeing. It was weird,
and I was concerned, so the first two innings of the game I just
tried to do things perfectly, mechanically, with my arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of testing myself out there in the first three
innings to see how it would go. After I got all that run support, I
figured I didn't have to do any more than what I was doing and just
tried to keep it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who had averaged an anemic 0.8 runs in Martinez's
four losses this season, came through with four in the first three
innings, then added five more in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled Martinez, who improved to 14-4 while lowering his
league-leading ERA to 1.53, to focus on the task at hand _
establish his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pitched the first inning, pretty much, just by throwing
fastballs,'' said Martinez. ``That was also one more test for
myself. I just wanted to make it simple and keep throwing the
fastball and see how good I felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I just started mixing my pitches,'' added
Martinez, who struck out the side in the second on a steady diet of
changeups. ``They were geared for the fastball after the first
inning, so it was a good idea to change things up.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was one pitch that signaled everything was all
right, it was Martinez's money pitch. ``The outside fastball,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on top of the fastball right away,'' Martinez said.
``When I started the game, I kept hitting the outside corner
against the lefties and I never let it go, so it was key pitch on
the (day) for me. I ended my outing by throwing the same pitch: the
outside fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   While it appeared Martinez was back to his dominating self, he
was not quite ready to give himself a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not yet,'' he said. ``I have to keep working. (The arm)
got heavy on me in the innings that were a little longer than
normal, so I'm going to have to keep working and doing the therapy
that I'm doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the fans know that I'm in a state where I know my
body, and I was good enough to go out there and keep doing what I'm
doing. Hopefully, I'll be fine by the end of the season.''

AFTER 65, IT'S NO TIME TO RETIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ His chase for this elusive major championship
goes back to those days when a golden bear provided his fiercest
competition. Now that a young tiger is the game's best, well . . .
maybe it's a stretch to say Tom Watson still is in quest of the PGA
Championship, but he is making his presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks shy of his 51st birthday, Watson needed just 22
putts in a brilliant 7-under-par 65 Saturday in the third round of
the 82d PGA Championship at Valhalla GC. It didn't quite throw him
into the mix of things (he's at 5-under 211 overall, eight shots
behind), but it rekindled some magic and reminded him why this
championship is so special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PGA was certainly my No. 1 goal for many, many years,''
said Watson, who earned victories in the other three legs of the
Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour or so, Watson had a share of the competitive course
record, but by the time he left the interview area, Jose Maria
Olazabal had shattered it with a 63. No surprise, said Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a forgiving golf course,'' he said. ``The fairways are
soft, and on the greens, the ball stops dead.''
</P>
<P>
   There were questions about his past failures at the PGA,
particularly the 1978 edition at Oakmont CC when he squandered a
five-shot lead through 54 holes and lost in a playoff to John
Mahaffey. But Watson shrugged them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dwell on it,'' he said. ``I don't play `What if.' I
don't look back.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a vintage 65 to talk of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't real pretty to look at from a ball-striking
standpoint,'' he said, ``but from the putting standpoint, it was
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a pair of bogeys on the par-3s going out, but a
handful of birdies offset that. Of particular delight, said Watson,
was a 12-footer that he converted on the par-4 sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the stroke of the day,'' he said. ``I have been
having trouble with my left-to-right putts and I made an
adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Which proves that even old golfers can learn knew tricks.
Especially if you remember how to learn, said Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch Tiger,'' he said. ``I always watch the best players,
and he is by far the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods had to be impressed with some of the skill displayed
by Watson. On top of that birdie at the sixth, Watson rolled in a
15-footer at the seventh, then shook off a bogey at the par-3
eighth with a sizzling 7-iron at the par-4 ninth that came to rest
inches from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make those,'' said Watson, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He went through seasons of misery on the putting green, but has
played his way through the troubles.
</P>
<P>
   After making the turn in 2-under 34, Watson turned up the heat
with an incoming 31 that included a near hole-out on the par-4 14th
(he could have kicked in the birdie putt), a 35-footer at the 15th,
and a textbook birdie at the par-5 18th: driver, 4-iron lay-up,
sand wedge to 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes him long for weekly battles with guys half
his age, right? At that suggestion, Watson broke into a big a smile
and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel as if I can play with the young kids,'' he said.
``But, you know, my days are numbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he glanced down at his scorecard, shook his head
approvingly, and said: ``But I still like to compete against
them.''

CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION HAS SOME ON THE OUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ When he saw the list, Greg Kraft couldn't
believe it. He wasn't in the field for the 82d PGA Championship.
Granted, he's not Tiger Woods, and he has no delusions about being
a marquee name. But certainly, he thought, being 72d on the money
list and the winner of some $600,000 this year was good enough to
get into the season's final major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The PGA of America instead turned this major championship
into an invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reserve the right to exempt whomever they like,'' said
Kraft. ``Category 11. But it's hard when they give out exemptions
to guys I've been beating all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and many other players were taken by surprise when they
saw the final list during last week's Buick Open. In past years,
the PGA of America has gone fairly deep into the money list, which
this time included the period from August 1999 to August of this
year. Last year, the 86th name on the list made it, and in 1998 the
picks went into the low 100s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was enough,'' said Kraft. ``It always had been in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for some reason, PGA of America officials stopped the list
at 70, then filled out the rest of the 150-player field with
special exemptions. That total was a staggering 37. Throw in the 25
club pros who are given spots and you have 62 berths that are out
of the players' control.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he wasn't the only player taken by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the most talk I've heard (in a locker room),''
he said. ``It was the only thing they talked about, was who got
into the PGA.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has never won on the PGA Tour, the 36-year-old Kraft
is a consistent performer. Few players work as hard on their game,
and last year that paid off with a 52d-place finish on the money
list ($810,777). He doesn't begrudge the exemptions offered to
players such as Greg Norman (``He'd probably have made it had he
not been injured, and he deserves it'') or Tom Watson, nor would he
quibble with international names such as Bernhard Langer, Padraig
Harrington, or Lee Westwood. But some exemptions baffle him. He's
too respectful to name names, but Kraft is of the opinion that the
PGA of America did an injustice to many middle-of-the-pack PGA Tour
players.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no opinion,'' said Hal Sutton, shaking his head. ``But
they gave (an exemption) to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sensitive issue when players of past glory such as Ben
Crenshaw and Sam Torrance are given spots because they have links
to the PGA of America's crown jewel _ the Ryder Cup _ and then they
shoot high numbers (Crenshaw opened with an 83, Torrance an 82).
Also bothersome is the PGA of America's fascination with world
rankings. Seemingly every half-hour there would be a release saying
that so many of the world's Top 100 players were in the field. Good
gracious, who cares? When Kraft sees players below him on the PGA
money list _ Bill Glasson, Billy Mayfair, and Bob May, for example
_ get in because they have slightly higher world rankings, then
something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Good sense, not computers, should dictate who gets in.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he talked to officials of the PGA of America and the
PGA Tour. He did get into the field as an alternate, for which he
was grateful, though the entire matter ruined his tournament at the
Buick Open last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hitting the ball perfect up there, and when I got the
news I wasn't in, I was so irritated it affected my game and I
didn't play well,'' he said. ``Every little thing bothered me, so I
wasn't going to coe here (Louisville, Ky.) and play the waiting
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went home to Clearwater, Fla., and simmered. He got
a call Tuesday morning and was told that Bobby Nichols had
withdrawn and that he was in. Kraft played nine holes late Tuesday
afternoon, nine more Wednesday, then shot 1-under 71 Thursday. Had
he gotten the call from the PGA of America on Wednesday, he said,
``I wouldn't have come. I was that upset.''
</P>
<P>
   What he would like, he said, is a set of rules that is concise
and easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the Masters,'' said Kraft. ``It's very hard to get into
it, but you know what you have to do to get into that tournament.
In the future, the PGA of America should have some set of
guidelines. There's too much gray area here for them to play with
the rules. Last year it was 86 (on the money list), two years ago
something like 104. This year 70?''
</P>
<P>

   Norman will carry the Olympic torch across Sydney Harbor Bridge
on the morning of the opening ceremonies. It's a nice honor for
him, and he's justified in taking a lot of pride in it, but
unfortunately he's a bit too enamored with this Olympic concept,
lobbying for the inclusion of golf. ``Everybody should be working
to get golf in the Olympics,'' said Norman, who hopefully speaks
for himself. There is already a significant amount of international
golf events _ from the Dunhill Cup, to four World Golf
Championships, to the Ryder Cup, to the Presidents Cup, to the
Walker Cup, to the Solheim Cup, to the PGA Cup, to the World Cup.
Just carry the torch, pass it on, and shush. Let the Olympics be
about synchronized swimming and not golf. Right, Tiger? ``To be
honest with you, I don't think (the Olympics) would be a big
priority in our game,'' said Woods . . . Then again, the Olympics
are about politics, if nothing else, and politics helped ruin this
week's NEC Invitational at Firestone in Akron, Ohio. Somewhat
contrived to begin with, this World Golf Championship event was
made even more so by mindless European Tour officials who changed
the rules in the middle of the game. Originally, 1999 Ryder Cup
members were going to be exempted into the field, along with
Presidents Cup members, but European leaders chose to make examples
of some of their leading talents. Thus, Jesper Parnevik, Sergio
Garcia, Paul Lawrie, and Jean Van de Velde won't be in Akron, even
though they were on last September's Ryder Cup team. European
leaders chose instead to send the top money winners, for all
intents and purposes punishing those aforementioned players because
they play primarily in the US and don't support the European Tour .
. . Lanny Wadkins, when asked if he had time for a question after
Thursday's marathon round in oppressive humidity at the PGA
Championship: ``Man, I don't have time for anything. It's 7:15. On
the Senior Tour we play in four hours, drive a cart, then have a
beer.'' It took Wadkins six hours to complete his first round at
Valhalla. Normally, he could play 36 in that time.

   Things have not been going particularly well for John Daly on
the golf course, so perhaps he'll find success in the recording
studio. That's right, Daly recorded a country song with his two
daughters. The title? ``You Can Lean On Me.'' It is scheduled to be
released later this month, when Daly hosts a fund-raiser in
Toronto. He told reporters, ``My singing's terrible, but it's been
better than my golf game lately.'' . . . Enough of the criticism of
Valhalla. OK, it is not in the same league as the other venues for
this year's majors (Augusta National, Pebble Beach, St. Andrews),
but it's not exactly a cow pasture. Frankly, this nonsense about
making things very, very special simply because it's the year 2000
is quite tiring. Who cares? It's not like the PGA of America has a
habit of playing lousy golf courses. Quite the contrary; its site
list is impressive: Winged Foot, Riviera, Southern Hills,
Inverness, Cherry Hills, Pebble Beach, Oakmont, Oakland Hills. The
problem with Valhalla in 2000 is that it's too soon a return (the
PGA Championship was here in 1996), and the fact that the club is
owned by the PGA of America bothers people greatly. But whether you
like it or not, doing things for the money is not a criticism that
should be directed solely at the PGA of America. ``Everyone wants
to see Winged Foot,'' said Lee Janzen, ``a traditional course with
trees everywhere. But I think this is a fantastic golf course and a
beautiful setting.'' . . . So, if Woods wins the PGA Championship,
what does the PGA of America do with its annual nonsense called the
PGA Grand Slam of Golf? It's supposed to pit the four major winners
against each other, but in this case it would mean Woods (three
wins) vs. Vijay Singh (the Masters). There is an alternate's list
that currently has Ernie Els and Tom Lehman next in line, but
here's my suggestion: Let Woods hit three balls off the tee. Singh,
of course, would hit one. Woods would play all three balls all the
way; it would require him to take roughly 210 swings, but he's
young. And imagine the ratings. Not just one round of Woods, but
three . . . Woods recently had to shoot down the rumor that he was
engaged to his girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda. Last week, a story in a
local newspaper indicated that Woods may have purchased a home in a
swanky neighborhood up the street from Valhalla. ``No, no,'' said
Woods before the reporter could finish his question. ``I heard that
the minute I got off a plane here.''

VFW MOBILIZES TO REVERSE DECLINE IN POLITICAL INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   About a thousand World War II veterans
die every day. The Kansas City-based Veterans of Foreign Wars wants
to make sure its political clout doesn't disappear with them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore will
address the group's national convention in Milwaukee this week, a
ritual for political candidates. But the VFW is finding it harder
to stay relevant after the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the nation's oldest veterans group is launching an
ambitious effort to reach elected officials and encourage members
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veterans issues used to be a sacred cow. Now we're relegated
to a position of just another special-interest group,'' said Steve
Van Buskirk, VFW spokesman. ``We're going to have to learn to play
the game better.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the VFW for the first time is hiring a public
relations firm to organize its annual voter drive. Fleishman
Hillard is dutifully faxing press releases and organizing media
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buskirk said the group plans to spend more money on voter
turnout this year than it has in decades. He said surveys show that
veterans do not vote at a significantly higher rate than the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're appalled by that,'' he said. ``Veterans should realize
that they need to lead the charge to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Another first: The VFW sent a delegation to the Republican and
Democratic conventions. Officials met with party leaders and such
congressional heavyweights as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   This comes eight months after the VFW fell out of the top 25 of
Fortune magazine's annual poll of the most influential lobbying
groups. The VFW is ``no longer in the top echelon,'' the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, the nonpartisan American Legion, has testified at
convention platform committees for years. Bush and Gore both are
scheduled to address the American Legion's convention next month.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas of the American Legion's legislative office said
veterans groups can't assume that politicians will take notice of
their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work a little harder these days,'' Thomas said.
``There might be fewer veterans, but we can still be persuasive.
Our successes haven't come in a vacuum. They happen as a result of
advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this year's platforms were essentially written before
the conventions, the VFW and American Legion helped tweak the
documents on issues such as health care for veterans, military
benefits and national security.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whom VFW members support, Van Buskirk thinks
turnout will improve this year because Sen. John McCain's
presidential candidacy energized many veterans. Hundreds of
veterans flocked to the former POW's rallies, often waving copies
of his biography.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's valor in combat is becoming an anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer politicians have fought in wars or even served in the
military. Bill Clinton was the first president without military
service since Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say politicians still stand to gain points by
embracing veterans groups. Gore, who served in Vietnam, has been
known to wear his Legion cap at veterans events. Bush served in the
Texas Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buskirk said veterans aren't a unified voting bloc, making
it difficult for them to exert influence like the elderly or other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Although many veterans criticized Clinton for avoiding the
draft, he handily defeated decorated World War II veterans in 1992
and 1996. And the groundswell from veterans wasn't enough to carry
McCain past Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As a nonprofit group, the VFW cannot endorse candidates. Van
Buskirk said both Bush and Gore had been attentive to its issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Calore, commander of VFW Post No. 846 in Overland Park said
veterans need to become more sophisticated voters by focusing on
the candidates' political records, not their military backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Calore said he doesn't care if candidates received a draft
deferment or won a chestful of medals, as long as they ``did the
honorable thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the saying goes: What have you done for me lately? It's
more important that we know what they will do to stand by us in the
future,'' Calore said. ``We need to support someone who is right on
the issues.''

SUPPLEMENT STRATEGY? THEY'RE EATING IT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ `Nutritional supplements,'' everything from creatine to
multivitamins, are the latest craze among Olympic athletes who want
to jack up performance without falling afoul of the doping lab. Top
swimmers such as Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres take two dozen
supplements a day. Their teammates, Gary Hall and Anthony Ervin,
eat supplements meant for horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are on the stuff that (Kentucky Derby winner)
Fusaichi Pegasus uses,'' bragged coach Mike Bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Thompson said, is ``to beat the cheaters without
cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, is what ``cheating'' means these days.
Though testosterone, erythropoietin (EPO), and human growth
hormones all are created naturally by the body, their synthetic
versions are banned at the Olympics. So why should creatine, which
helps increase strength, be any different? The purpose behind using
any synthetic substance is the same: to get ``faster, higher,
stronger'' by artificial means. So why is EPO banned and creatine
OK?
</P>
<P>
   It may just be that the International Olympic Committee, usually
a quadrennium behind on the doping front, hasn't gotten around to
creatine yet. And though the US Olympic Committee frowns on
supplements generally, it hasn't banned them. Meanwhile, athletes
and their coaches are cleaning out the shelves at GNC. And the
Sydney organizers are thinking about opening a perfecta window at
the natatorium for the men's 50.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After all the hoopla over the prospect of former major leaguers
playing on the US Olympic baseball team, only one _ 40-year-old Tim
Raines _ has a chance of being on the roster when it's announced
Wednesday. And the selectors are finding that many of the minor
leaguers they want are likely to be called up next month when major
league clubs expand their rosters to 40. The Yanks will need at
least a dozen phenoms in Sydney if they expect to contend for a
medal. The Japanese, whom the US faces in its opener, are bringing
eight pros, including ace Daisuke Matsuzaka. And the South Koreans
are shutting down their pro league to make players available. Not
to mention the Cubans, whose ``amateurs'' have never lost the gold
medal . . . Thorny issue in US Greco-Roman wrestling, where an
arbitrator stepped in to play referee and ultimately created a
reversal that put Matt Lindland on the team instead of Keith
Sieracki. After Sieracki defeated Lindland at the June trials,
Lindland claimed that Sieracki had used an illegal leg move. Though
Lindland lost two appeals, an arbitrator ordered a rematch, which
Lindland won, 8-0. ``We're going to the lawyers with this,'' vowed
Sieracki, who'd been competing in Russia and had only four days'
notice of the rematch. Siding with Sieracki is the USOC, which
argues that field-of-play decisions shouldn't be subject to
arbitration . . . The Romanian women's gymnastics team for Sydney
is much the same as the one that won last year's world
championships: all-around champ Maria Olaru, Simona Amanar, Andreea
Raducan, Andreea Isarescu, and Loredana Boboc, plus Claudia
Presacan. Unlike the Americans, who hold nationals and trials
before picking the team in a back room, the Romanians still use the
old Bela Karolyi pointing method (``You, you, you, you, you, and
you.'').

   The US women's swimming team is its oldest ever. Four
competitors (Torres, Thompson, Amy Van Dyken, and B.J. Bedford) are
27 or older and Torres, at 33, is the oldest ever by five years.
What accounts for the graying of the roster? Money _ and changing
attitudes about how long women can compete. ``It's being accepted
by society and by athletes that your career is not over in high
school,'' said US women's coach Richard Quick. ``Thirty years ago,
your career was over at 16 or 17. Then it was over at the end of
college. Now, women can make a decent living swimming. As long as
the flame of desire burns as brightly in her mid-30s, a woman can
continue to improve.'' The US men's team, youngest since 1988, has
eight teenagers and most are medal contenders. Ian Crocker (17) of
Portland, Maine, has a shot at gold in the 400 medley relay. Erik
Vendt (19) of North Easton figures to win silver in the 400 IM and
has a shot at bronze in the 1,500. Aaron Peirsol (17) is favored
for silver in the 200 backstroke, Pat Calhoun (19) for silver in
the 100 breaststroke, and Ervin (19) for bronze in the 50 freestyle
. . . Why won't Thompson swim the 50 free at the Olympics? ``Jenny
doesn't like the 50,'' said Quick. ``She never has liked it. It's
not her best event.'' And since Thompson is already swimming the
100 free and 100 butterfly and probably all three relays, she has
plenty on her plate. If she wins medals in each, which she should,
Thompson will end her career with 11. If one is gold, she'll break
the record for most by a US woman (5), held by speedskater Bonnie
Blair. Thompson, by the way, is the latest Olympic athlete to bare
some or all for the camera. Her topless pose (with fists artfully
arranged) in the recent Sports Illustrated caused a stir among
moralists who thought it was the wrong message from a role model.
Thompson's reply: I'm proud of my body . . . Now that Vendt is the
first US swimmer to break 15 minutes for the mile, several others
are likely to follow. ``This puts our country at a whole different
psychological level,'' said US men's coach Mark Schubert, who
coaches Vendt at Southern Cal. Most likely to be next is Chris
Thompson, who has gone 15:04 . . . Look for lots of mixing and
matching and subbing on the US relays in Sydney. Thompson, Torres,
and Cristina Teuscher probably will swim in the 800 freestyle medal
race, even though none of them swam in the final of the 200
freestyle at the trials. The reason: all of them are faster than
the 2-3-4 finishers in Indianapolis. That means Samantha Arsenault
of Peabody could end up swimming in the prelims (which still would
get her a medal). Odds are, too, that Hall will swim anchor on the
men's 400 freestyle even though Neil Walker won the 100 at the
trials. Since Hall anchored both 400 relays to gold at both the
Olympics and world meet, he's the obvious choice . . . So, what's
the verdict on bodysuits? ``The jury's still out,'' said Schubert.
Since USA Swimming lifted its ban so close to trials, most swimmers
didn't have enough time to get comfortable in the sharkskin-like
suits and weren't sure which of the multiple versions they should
use. By Sydney, that will change. Said Schubert: ``We'll be a lot
more specific about which suit for which stroke and which suit for
which body type.''

   Nice showing by the US rowing team at the recent world
championships for non-Olympic events in Croatia. The men's
lightweight eight retained its gold medal (with seven new people in
the boat) as did the coxed pair. The men's coxed four and women's
lightweight pair (with Cambridge's Catherine Humblet) won silvers .
. . Sure these aren't the Winter Games? There was a dusting of snow
recently in the Sydney suburbs, and the temperature was so low last
week (a windy 51) that only a few thousand parka-clad spectators
showed up for the Australian track and field trials. No worries,
insist local meteorologists, who predict that the thermometer will
be in the more seasonable 60s during the Games . . . Less than half
of the US men's indoor volleyball team that sagged to ninth in
Atlanta will be back in Sydney. Returning are Lloy Ball, John
Hyden, Mike Lambert, Dan Landry, and Jeff Nygaard. The Americans
are up against the iron: both No. 1 Italy and No. 2 Russia are in
their prelim pool . . . Which airline is bringing the US Olympic
team to Sydney? United, whose ongoing dispute with its pilots has
created scheduling nightmares for weeks. The real problem isn't
getting the 600-plus athletes Down Under. It's getting them to San
Diego, where the processing began last week . . . Who are James
Morrison, Human Nature, Julie Anthony, John Farnham, Olivia
Newton-John, Vanessa Amorosi, and Tina Arena? They'll be the star
entertainers at the opening ceremonies in Sydney. All of them are
Aussies and all except Newton-John are strangers to most of the
planet. The organizers could have gone international but decided to
stick with homegrown products of Oz.

FISH HATCHERY CAB PRODUCE UP TO 20 MILLION SPORT FISH ANNUALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Bill Graham  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   WARSAW, Mo. - Sport fish bound for
Missouri's lakes and ponds now have an $18.6 million computerized
birthplace.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bass, catfish, walleye, muskies and hybrid stripers by the
millions will be produced at the Lost Valley Fish Hatchery by the
Missouri Department of Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The 78 outdoor raising ponds and several indoor holding tanks
comprise the largest fish hatchery in the state, capable of
producing up to 20 million sport fish a year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says manager Dave Waller, it is one of the largest
public hatcheries in the nation -- even the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to greatly increase our capability for sport
fish restoration,'' Waller said. ``We will be shipping fish all
over the state.''
</P>
<P>
   There also will be laboratory services for private
aquaculturists and a visitor center with a 12,000-gallon aquarium.
The hatchery also may be used for research on endangered species,
such freshwater mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Lost Valley, which opened in March, has replaced two small and
outdated hatcheries -- Lewis and Clark at Sugar Lake in southern
Buchanan County and Indian Trail in Dent County. To pay for it, the
Department of Conservation used about $12 million in federal money
from a sport fish restoration fund and $6.6 million from department
funds, Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   The fish will stock new ponds and lakes. Plus, some fish like
walleye and muskie need to be stocked in large reservoirs to ensure
quality fishing, a cornerstone of the state's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   People like to look at fish as well as catch them. So the
Department of Conservation expects to dedicate the hatchery and
open public educational exhibits in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting 75,000 visitors a year here,'' Waller said.
``This is a well-thought-out and functional place.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the size and the technology, however, that make Lost
Valley unique.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Waller's home telephone woke him Tuesday night. It
was the Lost Valley computer system calling, informing him that a
level in a water supply tank was incorrect. Waller called the main
computer back with his laptop computer and then tapped in a command
that fixed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh well water flows constantly through the indoor tanks, and
much of it is recycled back through the system from an outdoor
holding pond. Thousands -- and at times millions -- of young fish
depend on clean water with a steady temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Computers keep the water flowing with programming by Micro-Comm,
a digital control technology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is that this has worked pretty well,'' Waller
said. ``We haven't lost a fish because of it, and it's saved fish
several times.''
</P>
<P>
   Once young walleye are turned loose in places like Longview
Lake, they are on their own to eat or be eaten.
</P>
<P>
   But concentrated in a hatchery, they are pampered. Technicians
have laboratories to monitor water quality and watch for disease
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fish hatchery is essentially a wet feedlot, an underwater
feedlot,'' Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``production room,'' where fish are hatched, looks like a
large factory with multicolored pipes, tanks, control knobs and
gauges.
</P>
<P>
   Gurgling water makes the room sound like a mountain stream.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh water drops from pipes into fish tanks, while old water
drains from the bottom into concrete floor channels covered by
grates.
</P>
<P>
   Peek into one tank, and you see thousands of blackish flathead
catfish fry that were hatched in July in a small egg jar suspended
in a circular aquarium. Now, they are 2 inches long and crowding
the corner of a 150-gallon rectangular tank. Their pellet food is
dropped from an overhead trough at intervals controlled by an
electronic timer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, several thousand 6-inch muskie swim gently against the
current in a circular tank. Keeping them in a circular pattern
helps keep the sharp-toothed predators from hurting one another as
they feed.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid striped bass that will eventually be stocked at the James
A. Reed Memorial Wildlife Area swim madly back and forth in a
10-foot-wide circular tank, like 12,000 underwater rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hybrids never rest,'' Waller said. ``They swim
constantly. I don't know how they grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, rectangular rearing ponds cover much of the Sterett
Creek valley, along with two wastewater control ponds and a 10-acre
lake to hold recirculated water.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is thrilled with the hatchery's size and the fact
that 900,000 gallons of water a day, on average, are pumped from
seven deep wells in the valley just north of Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Water levels in some shallow wells serving nearby rural homes
became low in July. One well went dry.
</P>
<P>
   Ron and Delma Roellig lowered their well pump, and they worry
about having to drill a new well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I think it's a combination of things,'' said Delma
Roellig. ``We've got about 15 more houses out here, there's a
drought, and then they start drawing 650 gallons a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Conservation conducted well tests before
beginning to pump water in March, said mechanical engineer Greg
Mihalevich. Also, the wells were drilled deep to reach a lower
water table than those feeding domestic wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Conservation now is monitoring three test
wells, with assistance from the Missouri Department of Natural
Resources, to see whether the hatchery is affecting water levels.
Test results so far are inconclusive, Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   Truman Lake is nearby, as the hatchery lies in what once was the
Osage River bed. But the well water is much cleaner and healthier
for the fish than surface water, Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   The raising ponds are far cleaner than the wild waters where the
fish will be stocked.
</P>
<P>
   Polypropylene liners make the ponds more like 1/2-acre to 1-acre
tanks. When they are drained, the fish collect in a concrete basin.
Instead of wading in knee-deep mud to collect fish, as they do at
old hatcheries, crews simply walk down concrete steps to the basins
and net the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This beats the old days of sloshing around in the mud,''
Mihalevich said.

BRUINS EXPECT TO BE MUCH-IMPROVED IN THE SECONDARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Jason Bell was a senior at Long Beach
Millikan High, his team lost every game. Little did he know that
when he walked into the UCLA secondary he'd be going from one
no-win situation to another.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Bruins haven't lost every game in the four years Bell
has been a Bruin - far from it. In fact, Bell started at cornerback
during most of their school-record 20-game winning streak. But the
perception is that when the Bruins won it was in spite of their
defense, not because of it.
</P>
<P>
   And last season, when they slumped to 4-7 in a season mired by
suspensions, injuries and inexperience, the secondary was a primary
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference opener, Stanford backup quarterback Joe
Borchard torched the Bruins for five touchdowns and most of the
Cardinal's 442 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   That was their most-embarrassing moment - for a week. That's
when Arizona State's Delvon Flowers, in the final minute, took a
slip-screen pass from third-string quarterback Griffin Goodman and
wove his way 49 yards for the winning touchdown without a Bruin
laying a hand on him.
</P>
<P>
   When the year was done, the Bruins allowed more than 2,700
passing yards for the fifth year in a row and tied a school record
by surrendering 22 touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable optimism of a new season has the Bruins believing
they'll be much better everywhere on defense - even the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played some young guys, I think that's the biggest
thing,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``When you play young,
inexperienced guys they have a tendency to get you beat. I think
we're better back there this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three reasons they think so:
</P>
<P>
   --The return of Bell (heel) and Marques Anderson (suspension
from school), who were the starting cornerbacks two years ago.
Anderson, who gained nearly 15 pounds, has moved to strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   --Ricky Manning, who will start opposite Bell, and Joe Hunter
had 13 starts between them as freshmen last season and will be
better off for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   --The return of defensive coordinator Bob Field. It is the first
time since 1997 that the Bruins aren't implementing a new defensive
system. ``That's very significant,'' Field said. ``It's like
learning a new language - everything's different. It takes time to
get it down. Three years in a row, we were speaking a different
language.''
</P>
<P>
   The one open position is at free safety, where Jason Zdenek, a
seldom-used fifth-year senior from Chaminade High, leads a field of
candidates including track hurdler John Hall; Audie Attar and Jason
Stephens, who have failed auditions in the past; and talented true
freshman Ben Emanuel, whose progress has been slowed by headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand (the skepticism) because of the past,'' Bell
said. ``But we've got a lot of talent and we're taking the right
approach with our confidence and our attitude. I'm surrounded by a
defense now that respects winning. We're practicing like we're
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no group was more, ahem, confident in the first week of
two-a- day practices than the secondary. It wasn't hard to hear
Bell, Hunter and Manning trash-talking when they worked against the
receivers in drills. In a blocking drill, Bell made it a point to
line up against the Bruins' two best receivers, Brian Poli-Dixon
and Freddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable is that this confidence hasn't been beaten out
of them by now.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has started 17 games and has yet to intercept a pass.
Anderson's biggest play came two years ago when he stripped Jeff
Allen a yard short of the goal line to save UCLA's win over
Stanford; of course, Anderson had been badly beaten on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and Manning, meanwhile, always have Borchard.
</P>
<P>
   It all made them easy fodder for handicapped-parking jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this position, you're always going to be criticized - even
Deion Sanders,'' Hunter said of the cornerback position. ``If we
make a mistake, every man, woman and child is going to see it. You
know from day one you're on the hot seat so you just accept it.
You've got to have a certain swagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning says he uses the torchings - on the field and off - to
motivate himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when your body's telling you to stop, I use it to
keep me going,'' he said. ``As a unit, it's one of the best things
that could happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Anderson also say they're motivated by last season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was forced to watch from the Rose Bowl stands,
something he hadn't done since high school. Bell's view was from
the sidelines but no less painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was especially tough watching the defensive backs,'' Bell
said. ``There wasn't a lot of leadership at the position and Coach
Field is so intense. To see it fall apart like that was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot about patience. I also learned to love and
respect the game. Every time I step on the field now I know how
much I miss it, how much it means and what a privilege it is to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? If the secondary really is better, Bell could
finally be walking into a no-lose situation.

SEARCHING FOR TRIPLE CROWN, WOODS CAN'T PULL AWAY FROM FIELD AT
PGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Tiger Woods, the Secretariat of the PGA Tour,
remains in position to clinch golf's version of the Triple Crown
today in a city that helped coin the phase.
</P>
<P>
   But like the red colt known for distancing itself from pursuers,
Woods is discovering that Kentucky is a tough place to bury the
competition on the path to history.
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat squeezed out a two-length victory in the 1973
Kentucky Derby, a narrow escape by his lofty standards. Woods, in
turn, finds himself holding a one-stroke lead over two challengers
heading into today's final round of the PGA Championship at
Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   For a player who has won the past two major championships by a
combined 23 strokes, that hardly qualifies as breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods, who squeezed out a 70 in yesterday's third round to
move to 13 under par for the tournament, said he considers himself
fortunate to remain in control of the leader board after struggling
with his swing on a day when 24 players posted better scores than
he did during a record-setting, birdiefest at Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   ``To shoot 70, as poorly as I struck the golf ball, I thought
that was pretty good,'' said Woods, who leads Scott Dunlap and Bob
May by one shot and has seven players within four strokes heading
into the final round. ``To go into \Rtoday\S with the lead, it was
an added bonus. I hit a couple of shots where I almost hit my right
foot on the way down. That's not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every major championship, you always have one day where you
are not going to hit the ball well. If you can get it around with a
decent score that day, you are going to keep yourself in the
tournament. And that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Woods remained on pace to join Fort Worth legend
Ben Hogan as the only golfers in history to win three major
championships in a season by withstanding his worst nine-hole
stretch in a major (back-nine 37) since the Masters. Woods
rebounded from his first double bogey of the tournament at No. 12,
as well as a bogey at No. 15, to post a closing birdie that pushed
him a stroke ahead of Dunlap and May.
</P>
<P>
   But he yielded ground to several pursuers on a day when Valhalla
played to a scoring average of 71, the lowest ever for a PGA held
at a par-72 venue. Fifty-three players broke par, a third-round
record for the tournament. Included was Jose Maria Olazabal, whose
63 tied the lowest score ever posted in a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, however, said he kept ``getting stuck'' at the top of his
backswing, causing him to push shots off-line. He declared himself
lucky that Dunlap, his playing partner, missed two short birdie
putts during a round of 70 that could have given him the outright
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the better of the two guys in our group, that's for
sure,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, who has never won on the PGA Tour, said matching scores
with the world's top-ranked player gave him a ``pretty big'' boost
in confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the rest of the golfing world, I was wondering how I'd
do,'' said Dunlap, 37. ``I passed the test. If my chances \Rof
winning\S were 1-in-20, I'd say they've gone down to 1-in-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob May, a former Oklahoma State player, saw his stock rise with
a second consecutive 66. May collected seven birdies and one bogey,
moving to 12 under and earning the right to be paired with Woods in
the final round.
</P>
<P>
   May, like Dunlap, is winless on the PGA Tour. In fact, the only
player within three strokes of Woods who has won a tour event is El
Paso resident J.P. Hayes (10 under), winner of the 1998 Buick
Classic. May, 31, said his dubious golfing pedigree is no concern
heading into a matchup with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of pressure on me. I am not supposed to
win,'' May said. ``People don't know me. Hopefully, I will have a
good round, and they'll know me a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, the stretch run beckons in his quest for a ``Triple
Crown.'' Instead of another Sunday coronation march, as Woods
enjoyed by building 54-hole leads of 10 strokes (U.S. Open) and six
strokes (British Open) in the past two majors, he'll have people
nipping at his heels today.
</P>
<P>
   Will that create a greater mental challenge?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Woods said. ``Hopefully, it will make me better.
I have a good chance to win, and I plan to finish on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he has to nose out his pursuers in the final furlong,
just like Secretariat.

PARENTS OF AUTISTIC CHILDREN CALL FOR GREATER STATE AID 
</HEADLINE>
 2 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Finn Bullers  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Melissa Moon worries
that she will have to quit the job she loves or put her son in an
institution.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leslie Gott and her two daughters live with the fear that they
will soon be homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Sneid fights the system to do the best she can by her
son.
</P>
<P>
   The three women _ each struggling to raise a child with autism _
say the social-service network in Kansas has failed to provide
enough money for early treatment for children and help for parents
at a time when the number of diagnosed cases of autism has
skyrocketed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gott, a student, and Moon, an administrative assistant, both
low-income single mothers from Shawnee, Kan., say they are
desperate to find qualified child care.
</P>
<P>
   Sneid, a Leawood, Kan., nurse who stays home to care for her
autistic son, says stories like these are common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a desperate situation,'' she said. ``We are facing a
public health crisis that we have not yet met.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of children diagnosed with autism at the University
of Kansas Medical Center, for example, has grown from four in 1993
to 258 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of persons age 6 to 21 with autism who have been
educated in Kansas has grown from 79 in the 1992-93 school year to
506 this year. In Missouri the numbers have grown from 630 in
1992-93 to 2,073.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide the demand for services has increased 556 percent in
the last decade, reports the U.S. Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some attribute the increases to greater awareness and early
detection. Others say new research has expanded the definition of
autism. Still others blame genetics, early childhood vaccinations
and environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, critics in Kansas say state aid has not kept
pace with the need at a time when research shows early intervention
can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the cost of long-term
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the question becomes, is our care system ready for the
numbers?'' said Marie Bristol-Power with the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development. ``The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri the frustrations are not so much different, even
though the state is years ahead of Kansas in providing aid
specifically for autism programs.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting lists for complicated diagnostic testing and services
are a year long. Social-service experts in Kansas, struggling to
revamp the entire developmental disabilities financing strategy,
acknowledge there are severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's story is a struggle for day care for her 10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble lurks the minute Tyler steps out of his familiar world
and faces stimulation that can trigger an outburst: the cars that
blur by in a stream of color; the neighbor children who get in his
face; the bright sun.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day Tyler will lash out, curse and threaten to run
into the street.
</P>
<P>
   If it happens when Moon, 36, is at work, it is often too much
for Tyler's unskilled teen-age baby sitters. So Moon will get a
call: Tyler is out of control. She must drop everything and take
her son to her office in the chemical division of Lady Baltimore
Foods in Kansas City, Kan. She makes $9.25 an hour, or about
$20,000 a year, and receives Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Without reliable day care, she will have to quit her job.
Without a job, she will have no income. Without income, she fears
she will have to relinquish her parental rights and let the state
take her son.
</P>
<P>
   Last month she held a meeting in her home for a handful of
social-service workers. She sought help in caring for Tyler while
she worked or did other things away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss, Michael Stephens, was at the meeting, too. Stephens
says he does not want to lose a valuable employee but cannot let
Tyler play near industrial chemicals and distract his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had anything to offer,'' Moon said of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Moon said she hoped to help establish a care center in Johnson
County, Kan., for special-needs children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Community Living Opportunities, a network of parents of
developmentally disabled children, has recently purchased a
day-care center in the county. Until special programs and
caregivers can be found, however, the center will not be able to
open its doors to children such as Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   In May the Kansas Governor's Commission on Autism called on Gov.
Bill Graves to spend $3.5 million in the next four years to
establish diagnostic and outreach centers on autism at the
University of Kansas Medical Center and in Fort Hays, Wichita,
Emporia and Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Lew Faust of McPherson, Kan., the father of 9-year-old
Bradley, who is autistic, said the $30 million annual portion of
the state's tobacco settlement could be a source of money.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri the state spends $3.5 million a year to provide
assistance for 1,300 families touched by autism.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with $110,000 in state aid for 40 families nine years
ago, Missouri's Family Support Project for Autism has received
increased appropriations each year to finance five statewide
outreach centers, said Donna Evert of the Department of Mental
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri lawmakers were early to note the growing number of
autistic children and the need to provide separate aid for programs
designed by parents, Evert said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas financing for the broad social-services category _
developmental disabilities _ has increased over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But because Kansas does not specify funds for autism _ and state
lawmakers' insist that is the only way to be fair to everyone _
parents of autistic children say their needs are inadequately
financed.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for services at Johnson County Developmental Supports
is long.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 122 developmentally disabled persons are on its
waiting list for service, and 130 are on a second list for those
who are considered underserved. Developmental Supports helps about
1,000 people with developmental disabilities but does not track the
number of those with autism.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, research shows that with intense early
intervention, up to 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism
before age 5 go on to attend mainstream schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run early intervention can save money, a recent
Pennsylvania study shows.
</P>
<P>
   By spending $65,640 in the first two years of the life of an
autistic child, a state service provider can expect to save up to
$1.7 million in custodial care over the next 43 years of the child.
</P>
<P>
   Autistic children should receive 40 hours of intense
socialization a week compared with the 10-hour average now
available, said Matthew Reese of KU Medical Center's child
development unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gap between what we now know and what the system is
able to provide, and it really leaves parents lost.''

NO COMPLICATIONS IN MCCAIN CANCER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona sailed through five and a
half hours of surgery for two malignant melanomas on Saturday
without complications and with no immediate indication that the
cancer had spread, his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation involved removal of two malignant melanomas from
his left temple and left upper arm along with lymph nodes from his
neck and a portion of his salivary gland.
</P>
<P>
   But only after pathologists look at the lymph node through a
microscope next week can a determination be made about whether it
contains cancerous melanoma cells, Dr. John D. Eckstein, McCain's
personal physician at the Mayo Clinic Hospital, said at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is in wonderful shape and we have a wonderful
report,'' Cindy McCain told reporters. Her husband was cracking
jokes in his hospital room after he awoke from anesthesia, she
said, and ``all my prayers have been answered.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's doctors, though expressing optimism, introduced a note
of caution. Eckstein, a specialist in internal medicine, and the
team of surgeons said it was premature to speculate on future
medical plans.
</P>
<P>
   The pathology tests that will be performed early next week are
crucial because if the cancer is confined to the skin, as
preliminary tests earlier in the week and on Saturday indicated,
McCain's prognosis will be as favorable as it was after the
malignant melanoma was removed from his left shoulder in 1993.
McCain received no therapy beyond surgical removal of the shoulder
melanoma, and doctors have pronounced him cured of it.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary pathological tests indicate a good outlook. Dr.
Michael L. Hinni, a head and neck cancer surgeon who led the team,
said quick tests known as frozen sections showed that ``all
melanoma was removed during the surgery.'' But experts not
connected with McCain's case said that frozen sections can be
unreliable for melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   If pathology tests show that the new melanoma has spread to a
lymph node, McCain will need further treatment such as
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two new melanomas, the one from the left upper arm was
least troublesome because it was caught at cancer's earliest stage,
a type known as ``in situ.'' It can be considered ``a precursor to
a real melanoma'' that rarely if ever, spreads, or metastasizes,
said Dr. Lynn M. Schuchter, a melanoma expert at the University of
Pennsylvania and a member of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology's communications committee.
</P>
<P>
   The temple melanoma obviously was more worrisome because the
surgeons took the extra steps of performing many magnetic resonance
imaging and CAT scans, a specialized type of X-rays, earlier in the
week and removing lymph nodes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The temple melanoma was at least 2.2 millimeters deep as
measured in a biopsy that was performed at the Bethesda Naval
Medical Center on Aug. 4. Such depth is a critical factor in
determining a melanoma patient's prognosis. McCain's temple
melanoma would be classified as type 2 for which textbooks cite
10-year survival figures of about 60 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's surgery involved injecting a blue dye and radioactive
tracer into the melanoma on the temple in a procedure known as a
sentinel lymphoscintigraphy. Later in the operation, the doctors
used a gamma counter to locate the tracer in the first node
draining lymph fluid from the temple, an indication of the path by
which the cancerous melanoma cells would most likely spread. The
doctors also removed a number of additional lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   A sentinel node procedure allows pathologists to slice the node
like a loaf of bread in the laboratory and then use chemical stains
to provide a more comprehensive analysis than can often be
accomplished by examining sections of a dozen or so lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical removal of melanomas is standard therapy, and in the
next phase of McCain's surgery, the doctors took the precaution of
removing a wide area of skin surrounding the melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   In the final step of the operation, the doctors reconstructed
the skin and soft tissue overlying the temple, face and neck.
</P>
<P>
   It will take several days for the swelling and bruising of
McCain's face and neck to subside. He is expected to remain in the
hospital for two or three days.

PARENTS OF AUTISTIC CHILDREN CALL FOR GREATER STATE AID 
</HEADLINE>
 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Finn Bullers  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Autistic children should receive 40
hours of intense socialization a week compared with the 10-hour
average now available, said Matthew Reese of KU Medical Center's
child development unit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's a gap between what we now know and what the system is
able to provide, and it really leaves parents lost.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-lighted room or a windy day is enough to send Leslie
Gott's 10-year-old daughter, Ali, into fits.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day construction at Johnson County Community College,
where Gott, 35, has applied for financial aid to study to become a
social-services counselor, put Ali into spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to handle the unknown, Ali screamed, gouged herself and
bit her mother's forearms. Curious office workers peeked from their
cubicles. All they saw was a beautiful girl hollering at a
frustrated mother.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a door or a harness that can hold Ali, her mother
says. Ali's gross- and fine-motor skills are at the level of a 2
1/2-year-old. She cannot talk and sleeps only a few hours a night.
</P>
<P>
   It is a high-maintenance, no-frills life for Gott, Ali and
Gott's other daughter, Skylar, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Gott is getting all the state aid available to her _ $124.38 a
month in supplemental security income, $600 every three months from
Johnson County Developmental Supports and $238 a month in food
stamps. As an unemployed single mother, however, she says it is a
relief-check-to-relief-check existence.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, she is facing eviction. Her lease has expired,
and she cannot scrape together a security deposit equal to three
months of rent for a new place.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the support services are so finite in what they can
do,'' Gott said. ``Either nobody has funds, or we don't fit the
criteria, or we don't live in the right area.''
</P>
<P>
   Caring for an autistic child, parents say, is a financial,
emotional and physical drain.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents of autistic children in Kansas do not qualify for
Home and Community Based Services//Mental Retardation payments
through the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, even
though three of four autistic persons have some degree of mental
retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Funds available to pay caregivers of autistic children amount to
little more than minimum wage, and they often quit in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Sneid, the Leawood nurse, and her husband, David, a physician,
spend $18,000 a year to supplement the Blue Valley School
District's education of their autistic son, Evan, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kansas does not guarantee a person's right to
developmental disabilities services under state law, there is no
assurance that Evan will get the services his parents think he
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autism is a hidden disability, and because autistics don't
look disfigured or physically handicapped, they aren't treated as
severe cases that need high levels of funding,'' said Faust, of the
governor's commission.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas audit in November showed that each year since the
Developmental Disabilities Reform Act was passed in 1996, an
increasing amount of money had been appropriated for
community-based care.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' the audit reads, ``paying for services for existing
clients is now straining an already limited state budget, and the
number of eligible clients asking for help and not getting served
continues to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gary Daniels, superintendent of Parsons State
Hospital, was appointed chairman of a task force charged with
addressing the needs of people in Kansas who have rare disabilities
that require high-dollar care.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by parents' testimony, Daniels' goal was to broaden
financing eligibility guidelines. But the group has met only twice
since April 1999, and after a Social and Rehabilitation Services
staff reshuffling, it has not been able to issue a single
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the governor's commission concluded that the supports
for parents of autistic children were too few, exclusionary and not
comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Autism, however, is only one part of an overall financing
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people with developmental disabilities continues
to increase as medical science improves and people live longer,
said Jane Rhys, executive director of the Kansas Council on
Developmental Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings in Topeka before the Social and Rehabilitation Services
Transition Oversight Committee are exploring ways to respond. But
to call them solutions may be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   One response, Rhys said, is to change eligibility guidelines so
fewer people qualify for services. Another response is to reshuffle
existing funds so the most profoundly disabled receive the most
state money.
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Rep. Melvin Neufeld of Ingalls, the chairman of
the oversight and social-services budget committees, said the
hearings probably would result in a recommendation this fall for a
2 percent cut in state aid for developmental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be new money,'' Neufeld said.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 2001, Social and Rehabilitation Services has
proposed reducing the aid for developmental disabilities by $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   That puts pressure on parents to make up the difference
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sneid, the stay-at-home mom from Leawood, hopes to secure a
$50,000 grant from the Research Mental Health Foundation in Lee's
Summit to pay for a team to help families care for autistic
children.
</P>
<P>
   With help from the schools, Sneid also has created an early
intervention program. Some 40 families in Johnson County have
visited her home seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
   Autism, says Bristol-Power of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, is the Rosetta stone of developmental
disabilities and should be a top priority. If researchers can
understand autism, she says, they hold the key to unlocking other
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much we don't know,'' Bristol-Power said. ``But
most of America's children are not getting the benefit of what we
do know.''

WATSON PUTTS FOR SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Tom Watson experienced a flashback yesterday
at the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, 50, buried birdie putts in bunches at Valhalla Golf
Club. He shot a 65 and grabbed a short-lived share of the course
record. Watson's mark lasted for exactly 1 hour, 41 minutes ....
the amount of time needed for Jose Maria Olazabal, playing 11
groups behind, to post a 63 that matched the lowest score ever
recorded in a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, however, offered no complaints about being bumped from
the Valhalla record book. He was too busy reveling in the type of
putting performance he has only dreamed about in recent years: 22
putts in 18 holes, with six birdie putts ranging between 10 and 35
feet. Watson also holed a 15-footer to save par at No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't putted much better than I did \Ryesterday\S, except
when I was 28,'' said Watson, who moved to 5-under par for the
tournament. ``My round wasn't much from a ball-striking standpoint.
But from a putting standpoint, it was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said a mid-round decision to take the putter on a
straighter plane in his backswing led to a dramatic turnaround.
Over the final 13 holes, Watson one-putted 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   Although out of the running at the PGA (eight strokes back),
Watson said the confidence he gained yesterday should serve him
well when he defends his title Sept. 22-24 at the Bank One event at
Bent Tree Country Club in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty good for old folks,'' Watson said. ``It'll give
me something to draw on when I get back out on the Senior Tour.''
\Nsubheds:Record-setting rounds
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson and Jose Maria Olazabal were among 53 players who
broke par yesterday, a third-round record for the PGA Championship.
The previous mark was 38, established during the 1995 event.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Valhalla played to a scoring average of 71, a full-stroke
below par. That marked the lowest scoring average in any round for
a PGA held at a par-72 course. The previous mark was 71.9, set at
the 1989 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden run on low numbers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The pins were a lot more accessible than during the first two
rounds,'' Tiger Woods said. ``But I've seen where the pins will be
\Rtomorrow\S. That won't be the case again.'' \Nsubheds:Nicklaus'
historic first
</P>
<P>
   One day after the words were uttered, Jack Nicklaus' comments
about Tiger Woods still strike a chord with Kaye Kessler, a retired
reporter who has known the Golden Bear for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, 76, was a columnist for the now-defunct ``Columbus
Citizen-Journal'' when he published the first account of a
10-year-old phenom in his town: a youngster named Nicklaus, who had
just posted a 51 for nine holes at a Columbus, Ohio course.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century and 18 major championships later, Kessler
listened with slack jaw as Nicklaus, 60, heaped praise on Woods,
24, after playing with him during the first two rounds of the PGA
Championship. Woods, who has won golf's last two major
championships by a combined 23 strokes, can join Fort Worth legend
Ben Hogan as the only professionals to win three major
championships in one season with a victory today at the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, with what he's doing, I think he's a better
player than I ever was,'' Nicklaus said of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler put that sentiment into perspective yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've ever heard Jack say anybody was
better than he was,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' response?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully nice of Jack to say that,'' Woods said. ``But I
think his statement might have been a little different if he was
closer to his prime.'' \Nsubheds:Major factor
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Langham, who has three runner-up finishes on the PGA
Tour this season, posted an impressive round yesterday in his first
appearance at a major championship. Langham shot a 65, climbing to
8 under.
</P>
<P>
   Langham said he has not been intimidated by the trappings in his
first major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to say I'm surprised to be where I am. But I am
elated,'' said Langham, a native of Augusta, Ga. who manned the
scoreboard at the 16th hole at the Masters Tournament during his
days as a junior golfer. ``I came in here hitting the ball well and
expected to play well, major or otherwise.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dunlap, on the crowd support he received while matching
70s with Woods in the third round: ``I heard my name called as much
as Tiger's, which was a neat experience. Not everyone wants the
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, runner-up in the season's first three majors, has
been added to the field for the PGA Grand Slam of Golf, Nov. 21-22
in Kauai, Hawaii. The four-player event usually is limited to the
reigning major champions but a vacancy is available because Woods

   DALLAS _ On a night when Internet history was made, the Dallas
Sidekicks won in the rarest of situations.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's 6-3 victory against the Houston Hotshots in a World
Indoor Soccer League game was the first professional soccer league
game broadcast in streaming video on the internet. It also had no
scoring from Tatu or David Doyle, but Rusty Troy recorded his first
hat trick since 1998 and Nick Stavrou scored five points on two
goals and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been more of an offensive defender,'' Troy said.
``The first one (on a power play) got me going. On the second, I
almost acted like a forward. He (Houston goalkeeper Terry Waldorf)
was giving me the shot, so I slapped it by.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sidekicks (2-1) also played their best defense of the
still-young season. They held the Hotshots 1-1) scoreless in the
second half after having been scored on in each of the season's
first 14 quarters. Tatu and Troy both gave much of the credit to
the Dallas defenders, who controlled the ball for most of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the game today, you don't just play offense or defense and
that's it,'' Tatu said. ``The defense has to move the ball around.
Tonight, they did a great job of coming forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy's second goal, at eight minutes and 15 seconds of the third
quarter, came as a result of Stavrou's third assist and gave Dallas
the lead for good at 4-3. Each player would add an insurance goal
in the closing period.
</P>
<P>
   Tatu led the WISL in scoring last season with 67 points (27
goals, 40 assists) and Doyle was the league MVP after leading in
goals (29).Tatu has three assists this season, but is still looking
for his first goal, while Doyle has two goals and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sidekicks got a scare when goalkeeper Sagu went down and
laid on the turf for about five minutes following a collision with
a Houston player in the second quarter. He did not leave the game,
but did suffer a bruised tibia in his right leg.

CONSISENT PAUS SHARP IN SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's first scrimmage of fall camp didn't match
the first-team offense against the first-team defense, didn't offer
any revelations, and didn't give coach Bob Toledo much to talk
about. He'll have to look at the film.
</P>
<P>
   But the nearly two-hour scrimmage, open to about 2,000 donors
Saturday afternoon at Drake Stadium, also did nothing to dispel the
notion that Cory Paus will open the season as the Bruins' starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Paus completed 7 of 10 passes for 184 yards and one touchdown, a
well-placed ball on a seam route that tight end Gabe Crecion turned
into a 65-yard score. Ryan McCann, who'd hoped to wrest the job
from Paus, wasn't bad either _ completing 6 of 9 for 155 yards, two
touchdowns and one interception. Included was a crisply thrown
18-yard scoring pass to Drew Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who said he would give McCann and Paus seven to 10 days
to compete for the job, could name a starter as early as Monday.
Thus far, Paus has been the more consistent quarterback and Toledo
emphasized Saturday that was what he was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to say is everything is not depending on
what they did today,'' the coach said. ``It's not just throwing
passes, it's operating the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-team defense was impressive, forcing the second-team
offense to go three plays and out on its first three series. Also
distinguishing himself were freshman punter Chris Kluwe, whose
booming punts were noticeably higher than those by incumbent Nate
Fikse; reserve defensive tackle Stephen Sua, who had two sacks; and
true freshman Manuel White (Valencia High), who carried six times
for 38 yards.

PERPLEXING DODGERS BEAT METS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Los Angeles Dodgers make it look this
easy, their season becomes that much harder to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Two homers by Gary Sheffield and a complete game by Chan Ho Park
was the way the Dodgers drew it up in spring training. When they
did it Saturday afternoon in a crisp 4-1 victory over the white-hot
New York Mets, it begged the question, ``Why is this team eight
games out with 41 to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is long and complicated, but for one day in front of
a sellout crowd of 53,051 and a national TV audience, the Dodgers
fired on all cylinders. Headed by their front man, Sheffield, whose
39th and 40th homers tied Mike Piazza's L.A.-franchise record, they
had the rare look of a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Park, forced to skip his last start with the flu, came back with
an overpowering fastball and struck out 10. More importantly, he
never lost focus in tight situations and had his most-overpowering
performance since May 13, when he struck out 12 in a 3-1 victory at
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Eric Karros' first home run in three weeks and an
errorless game from the league's second-worst defensive team and
the Dodgers breezed to just their fourth win in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that we're capable of games
like this,'' said Sheffield, who is on a pace to hit 54 homers this
season. ``We just have never had the intensity to play this way all
the time. It's frustrating when you're reminded how good we can be
because we've never been able to keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets came in with 14 victories in their past 18 games and
led 1-0 just two batters into the game - on a home run by Derek
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But New York was playing without Piazza, who caught the night
before and hit a home run in the Mets' 5-3 win. Park allowed a
season-low four hits in his second complete game of the year. He
retired 10 consecutive batters early in the game and 11 of 12 to
close it out.
</P>
<P>
   There was a downside for L.A., however. The National League
West- leading San Francisco Giants defeated Atlanta for the second
straight day to remain eight games ahead of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   With a victory, the Mets could have moved within a half-game of
the Braves in the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter what other teams do,'' said Karros,
who has 28 homers. ``The only thing that matters is winning. There
have been times this year when we have looked as good as any team.
And there have been times when we've looked as bad as any team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was this a big game? Check back in 10 games to see if we've
kept it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers close out the series today with their hottest
pitcher Darren Dreifort, who is going for his seventh consecutive
victory. After that is a three-game series with the slumping
Montreal Expos to close out the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only Dodger who has shown up every day is Sheffield,
whose MVP-type season has been buried under the team's
disappointing performance.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the Dodgers the lead for good in the second when he
drove Rick Reed's first-pitch fastball into the stands in left for
a two-run homer. Two batters later, Karros hit a 2-2 pitch off Reed
(7-4) into the packed left-field stands to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield greeted new pitcher Pat Mahomes in the eighth with his
second homer. As he reached the dugout, the cheers swelled until he
came out for a curtain call. Not only was it his 40th, but he tied
Piazza's club record with his 22nd at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had seen it all with the season Mike had in `97,''
Karros said. ``Sheff is blowing right by him and it's only
August.''

 FORD CHOSE TIRES NOW BEING RECALLED TO REDUCE RISK OF ROLLOVERS,
DOCUMENT SHOWS   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ An internal Ford Motor Co. document obtained by
lawyers suing the automaker and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. shows
that the company considered using tires with higher pressure than
the Firestone tires now subject to a recall, but decided against
them because they increased the risk that Explorer sport utility
vehicles using them would tip over.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone is recalling 6.5 million tires mounted mainly on
Explorers because they are prone to losing their treads at high
speeds. Federal regulators say that they have received more than
750 complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost
all of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles that rolled
over, mostly Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the recall began, Bridgestone has urged consumers to fill
15-inch tires on Explorers to 30 pounds per square inch. Ford has
recommended since the Explorer went on sale that the 15-inch tires
be filled to 26 pounds per square inch, but has said over the last
week that a range of 26 to 30 pounds was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The difference has caught the attention of lawyers who sue
tiremakers because tires are more likely to fail if they are used
at lower pressures. The lower the pressure, the softer the tire,
which means that more of its sidewall is in contact with the road.
This increases the heat of the tire, and can cause the tread to
peel off, particularly if the tire is poorly made.
</P>
<P>
   C. Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who is suing Ford
and Bridgetone/Firestone on behalf of people injured in
tire-related crashes, said in an interview on Monday that the
document showed that the Explorer was an inherently flawed vehicle
that was prone to tipping over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tire pressure is directly related to the handling and
stability issue,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials strongly defend the stability of the Explorer.
Even with the deaths attributed to the tires, the occupants of
Explorers have a 22 percent lower death rate in rollover crashes
than occupants of other mid-sized sport utility vehicles, said
Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of safety data analysis. The overall
death rate for Explorer occupants in all types of crashes is 24
percent lower than the overall rate for other mid-sized sport
utilities, and is comparable to death rates for cars because
Explorer occupants fare well in collisions with other vehicles,
Grush said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials have said that they selected the tire pressure
for the Explorer so as to give it a smooth ride, and have insisted
that a tire pressure of 26 pounds per square inch provided an ample
safety margin against slow leaks that a consumer might not notice.
Tire damage, and ultimately tire failures, are rare unless a tire
is operated at less than 20 pounds per square inch, and become a
significant possibility only in the low or mid-teens of pressure,
said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for North American
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   While hard tires are less likely to fail, they also allow a
motorist to turn more sharply than soft tires do, even at high
speeds. Automakers try to limit how sharply a vehicle can turn,
particularly if it has a high center of gravity as most sport
utility vehicles do, so as to limit the risk that it will roll
over. If a motorist turns sharply any vehicle while traveling very
fast, the vehicle may roll, but the risk is increased for taller
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The internal Ford document says that the company decided against
the use of higher-pressure tires so as to limit so-called cornering
forces, a measure of how hard the front end of the vehicle can be
turned. Ford officials have said that they did not choose a low
tire pressure because of rollover concerns. Brook Lindbert, the
tire and wheel engineering director at General Motors, said that
automakers tried to limit cornering forces mainly through
suspension designs, not tire pressure.

   (For release Sunday, Aug. 27)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; CLOSE TO THE WIND &LR; , by Pete Goss. (Carroll &AMP; Graf, $15.95.)
Competing in a round-the-world single-handed yacht race, the author
ended up rescuing a fellow sailor and battling six-story waves.
Writing in The New York Times Book Review last year, Barbara Lloyd
said, ``You are immersed in his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Another disastrous ocean race, off Australia, is recounted in
 &UR; KNOCKDOWN: The Harrowing True Account of a Yacht Race Turned
Deadly &LR; , by Martin Dugard (Pocket Books, $13.95). This is ``a
melodramatic but nonetheless riveting chronicle,'' Elizabeth
Hightower wrote in 1999, ``a story that simply won't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CERTAIN AGE &LR; , by Tama Janowitz. (Anchor, $13.) The Hamptons,
in New York, are the setting for the tragicomic story of a young
woman of diminished prospects who sees marriage to a wealthy man as
the only thing that can save her. The novel ``offers nimble
commentary on the mating scene and upmarket beach house
architecture,'' Henry Alford wrote last summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SEASON IN THE SUN &LR; , by Roger Kahn. (University of Nebraska,
$12.95.) The author of ``The Boys of Summer'' traveled the nation
in mid-1976, talking baseball with players at various levels, from
small-college teams to World Series champions. ``My only complaint
against `A Season in the Sun' is its length _ there isn't enough of
it,'' Donald Hall said in The New York Times Book Review in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Nebraska Press has also reissued Kahn's  &UR; GOOD
ENOUGH TO DREAM &LR;  ($15.95), about his year as president and part
owner of the low-minor-league Utica Blue Sox. This ``incongruous
owner'' is ``a skilled storyteller who was presented with a
lifetime's supply of colorful characters,'' Bob Ryan wrote in 1985.
Both books have new afterwords by the author.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A RAGE TO LIVE: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton &LR; , by
Mary S. Lovell. (Norton, $19.95.) An eminent, or perhaps notorious,
Victorian, Sir Richard Burton was an explorer, scholar and linguist
who translated the ``Kama Sutra'' and slipped into the forbidden
city of Mecca, in Arab disguise. This is ``an extraordinary
biography,'' James R. Kincaid wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1999. The author shows Isabel Burton to be ``as
resolutely tactless as her husband but also as courageous, defiant
and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHARLOTTE GRAY &LR; , by Sebastian Faulks. (Vintage International,
$14.) This novel follows a Scottish woman's journey into
Nazi-occupied France during World War II to find a missing RAF
pilot. ``What is essentially a love story turns into a sensitive,
powerful reflection on moral anguish in Vichy France,'' Anita Gates
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARADISE, NEW YORK &LR; , by Eileen Pollack. (Temple University,
$17.95.) In a coming-of-age story, a young white woman tries to
save her family's crumbling Catskills resort and falls in love with
the reclusive handyman, who is black. ``Pollack's first novel
succeeds, sometimes too didactically, in taking on such large
themes as racism and bigotry, love and loyalty,'' Ruth Coughlin
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MURDER DUET: A Musical Case &LR; , by Batya Gur, translated by Dalya
Bilu. (Harper Perennial, $14.) The cerebral Israeli policeman
Michael Ohayon returns in the fourth in a series of mysteries, this
time investigating the murders of classical musicians. ``Gur's
introspective detective unravels her complicated plot with his
usual intelligence,'' Marilyn Stasio said in The New York Times
Book Review last year. ``But for pure reading pleasure, nothing
touches the smart discussions on music and art.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A THIRST FOR RAIN &LR; , by Roslyn Carrington. (Kensington, $12.)
The lives of neighbors who share a cramped communal yard intersect
and collide in this first novel, set in the hills of Trinidad
during a four-month drought. ``The stage will be washed clean but
the strains of Carrington's powerful redemption song will linger,''
Anderson Tepper wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOMBSHELL: The Life and Death of Jean Harlow &LR; , by David Stenn.
(Lightning Bug Press, $24.95.) The brief career of a Hollywood
legend who was both sex symbol and comedian is recounted in a
well-documented biography, with a new section of previously
unpublished movie stills. ``Without judgment and without smacking
his lips ... Stenn tells how Harlow's life had run amok even before
she became a star,'' Jeanine Basinger said in The New York Times
Book Review in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hollywood biography by the same author is  &UR; CLARA BOW:
Runnin' Wild &LR;  (Cooper Square, $21.95), which contains a new
filmography. Bow's sex appeal brought her the title of the ``It''
girl, but she was a has-been by the age of 25. ``This is a touching
portrait of a sad and turbulent life,'' Sharon Shervington wrote in
1988.
