<HEADLINE> Duke, Purdue Vie for Women's Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Purdue plays smart basketball, and so  
does Duke. Purdue keeps its composure when things get tight, ditto 
for Duke. Teamwork? There's plenty of that to go around, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The final game in the women's basketball season has come down to  
a pair of remarkably similar teams meeting in the NCAA championship 
game Sunday night. That should come as no surprise because the 
players who make up the heart and soul of both teams all started in 
the same place. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Purdue rode the spectacular play of Ukari Figgs and  
the steady contributions of Stephane White-McCarty to a 77-63 
victory over Louisiana Tech in one semifinal Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Erickson and Michele VanGorp, who once played at Purdue  
with Figgs and White-McCarty, led the way as Duke advanced with an 
81-69 victory over Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, both sides were reluctant to wade into the issue of  
former teammates meeting in the biggest game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just going to approach it like any other game,''  
White-McCarty said. ``We are playing Duke. We are not playing just 
against those two players. We are playing the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson and VanGorp transferred to Duke following the dismissal  
of Lin Dunn as Purdue's coach in 1996. Like their former teammates, 
they have a chance to take their school to its first national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any hard feelings for Purdue,'' VanGorp said.  
``Everyone wants to beat this dead horse. I feel happy for 
Stephanie, I feel happy for Ukari. It's exciting. I'm not going to 
fuel the fire. There's no fire there to fuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams played with plenty of fire Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Erickson scored 22 points and VanGorp 20 as Duke (29-6) followed  
its stunning upset of three-time defending national champion 
Tennessee with an outstanding effort against Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't surprise the Blue Devils, who shot 51 percent  
and defused Georgia's explosive twins, Kelly and Coco Miller, with 
solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we had an emotional letdown at all,'' Duke coach  
Gail Goestenkors said. ``I think the players were ready to play. We 
were very focused. I didn't feel worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke built a 15-point lead early in the second half and used a  
late 16-3 run to rebuild its advantage after Georgia pulled within 
six. They also set a national semifinal record by making nine of 15 
3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have a very good effect defensively,'' Georgia coach  
Andy Landers said. ``They shoot the ball terrifically from the 
3-point line and as we spread ourselves all around the perimeter, 
we leave ourselves vulnerable inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coco Miller led Georgia (27-7) with 18 points, and Tawana  
McDonald added 14. Kelly Miller, who scored 33 points in the 
regional final against Iowa State, scored just 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs scored 18 points in a sensational first half -- 14 in the  
opening 11 1/2 minutes -- and finished with 24 as Purdue (33-1) won its 
31st straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers used runs of 13-2 and 12-2 in building a  
15-point lead in the first half and answered with a 12-0 burst 
after Louisiana Tech (30-3) pulled within three in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always keep our composure,'' Figgs said. ``They made a run  
at us, but we weren't really rattled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty finished strong to get 17 points after a 1-for-7  
opening half and Katie Douglas scored 15. The Boilermakers 
committed only 11 turnovers against a team that had been forcing an 
average of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we went on adrenaline in the second half,'' Douglas  
said. ``We really wanted this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda Wilson's 18 points led Louisiana Tech, which had won 22  
straight since a 71-65 loss to Purdue on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching the championship game, Duke threw out a challenge to  
its men's team to do the same. Duke plays Michigan State tonight in 
the men's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support our men's team totally,'' VanGorp said. ``It's  
right there on our itinerary: men's game.''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Turn Lower; Dow Off 11.37 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices dipped lower in late afternoon as  
investors kept an eye on NATO air strikes in Kosovo while adjusting 
portfolios before the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was down 11.37 at  
9,825.02. The blue-chip index fell 89 points in early trading 
before whittling away most of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were weaker. The Nasdaq composite was  
down 9.77 at 2,425.03, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 
5.04 at 1,284.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market had advanced Thursday partly on relief about  
the military action in Kosovo. But investors were uneasier today. 
Stock prices fell this morning after NATO aircraft and missiles hit 
targets in Yugoslavia, directing much of their fire on Kosovo, 
where fighting continued between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worrying about what could happen over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the people who believed that one or two air strikes in  
Kosovo would solve our problems over there are having second 
thoughts,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``Now many people are concerned with whether or not we will 
have to commit ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the quarter next Wednesday was also affecting  
trading, as institutional investors such as mutual funds buffed up 
their portfolios before having to show them to clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still money in the hands of these money managers that  
has to be spent over the next couple of days,'' said Ricky 
Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in 
Charlotte, N.C. ``That's giving the market a lift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices dropped after rising this morning as investors,  
concerned about the situation in Kosovo, sought the safety of 
Treasurys. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was back up to 
5.58 percent, which is where it closed late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among technology stocks, IBM was up 2 5/8 at 174, while Compaq and  
Dell Computer also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 549.74 million 
shares, down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent,  
Germany's DAX index fell 1.75 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
0.89, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Targets Mail Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Postal authorities are trying to curtail theft  
and consumer fraud with new regulations affecting private 
businesses that accept mail for others. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning April 24, customers who want to rent a private mailbox  
from commercial businesses must show a photo identification and 
verify they live or conduct business at the address listed on their 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	These customers also will be required to write their ``PMB,'' or  
private mail box, number on the second line of their mailing 
address, similar to the way people with post office boxes are 
identified with a ``P.O. Box'' number. The U.S. Postal Service will 
hold mail without a PMB number. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal authorities said the changes target people who rent  
private mailboxes to shield illegal activities, such as credit card 
fraud and narcotics trafficking. Such mailboxes also are used as 
covers for mail order fraud, child pornography rings and schemes to 
swindle the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new regulations clarify addresses for individuals and  
businesses,'' Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth Hunter said. ``A suite 
number or a prestigious avenue can give the perception of a 
corporate executive office of a well-established business. 
Unscrupulous individuals rely on using these addresses to bilk 
American consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customers with preprinted stationery will be given six months  
from the effective date to deplete current supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mansfield, an assistant Queens district attorney in New  
York, said many white-collar crimes involve commercial mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In one common scenario, thieves will rent a box and reroute  
their victims' mail to it after filling out fraudulent 
change-of-address forms. Often, the criminals will rent the box for 
only a month before moving on to another address. However, 30 days 
-- the length of most billing cycles -- are all thieves need to look 
through credit card statements, pension information, home equity 
lines and frequent flier reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``During a 30-day period, someone can find out virtually  
everything there is to know about you,'' Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite postal regulations to verify address changes, people  
still find ways to use the mail for scams. After receiving a change 
of address form, the Postal Service mails a confirmation letter to 
the old address, regardless of the move date, and a second 
confirmation to the new address. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said the Postal Service has sent out information about  
the PMB designation and the other new regulations to companies that 
issue credit cards, the rebate and mail order industry, and law 
enforcement agencies. Postal authorities plan to conduct audits to 
ensure compliance and make sure the regulations are working 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not targeting commercial mail-receiving agencies, we  
are just closing a loophole that allows criminals to take advantage 
of these businesses,'' Hunter said.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Brand ACC Player of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Elton Brand's trip to the Final Four  
became special before he stepped on the court Friday as the 
sophomore received The Associated Press national player of the year 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 270-pound Brand is the third Duke player to win  
the Adolph Rupp Trophy, following Art Heyman in 1963 and Christian 
Laettner in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also the third straight year a player from the Atlantic  
Coast Conference received the nation's top individual honor. North 
Carolina's Antawn Jamison won last year and Wake Forest's Tim 
Duncan took home the honor in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the neat things that I have experienced in coaching is  
to be around great young men who have special qualities. Elton is 
certainly that,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``He is going to 
continue to be a great, great player. He is going to be a lot 
better because there is a lot to this young man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the Final Four on Saturday night against Michigan  
State, Brand has reached double figures in points and rebounds 17 
times, is shooting 62 percent from the field and has blocked 83 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	He received 28 votes from AP member newspapers and radio  
stations. Utah senior guard Andre Miller was runner-up with 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand missed more than half of his freshman season with a broken  
foot, but recovered to dominate the Goodwill Games. That 
performance earned him many preseason honors heading into the 
1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened the season with a 20-point, 15-rebound effort against  
Fairfield and had a 21-point, 21-rebound game against Fresno State 
in the Great Alaska Shootout. Then Brand's numbers began to 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was benched by Krzyzewski on Dec. 12 against Michigan  
because he was out of shape and not living up to his potential. 
After two games of not starting, Brand regrouped and turned his 
season around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really does seem unreal, it's a like a dream come true,''  
Brand said of receiving the AP honor. ``You work so hard and then 
you have your down points, like coach says, with every journey. But 
I wanted to work hard and have success and that's what I did, 
worked harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the only unanimous All-America selection this season, has  
scored in double figures in 36 of 37 games and has 17 double-digit 
rebound games for the nation's best team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had an amazingly consistent year at the highest level,''  
Krzyzewski said. ``Although he really didn't play the minutes at 
times for the stats that he has, he just lifted our team to a 
different level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elton is very deserving of this award and I know how proud he  
is. I want to thank him for taking me on his journey.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Sensing Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In just two months, economic panic  
has given way to euphoria in Brazil as a flurry of good news has 
people believing the worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets are surging, the currency is stronger, inflation  
is lessening and investors are slowly returning. The crisis may not 
be over, but there's a growing sense that Latin America's largest 
economy is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we've seen the worst in Brazil,'' James A. Harmon,  
president and chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, told a group 
of international bankers in Miami on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch agrees. The U.S. investment bank picked Brazil as  
its favorite Latin American equity market for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a dramatic change from a month ago. Brazil's currency, the  
real, was in free fall, investors scurried to pull their money from 
banks, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso went on national 
television to plead for calm. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the low point of a crisis that began with an abrupt  
devaluation of the real on Jan. 13. In three weeks, the currency 
plunged 46 percent, and the government seemed powerless to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the government's challenge is to keep the new-found  
ebullience in check and convince Brazilians that the battle for 
economic stability isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Finance Minister Pedro Malan warned against the  
premature optimism pervading markets and predicted the turbulence 
will persist for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's hard to resist so many positive signs.  
</P>
<P>
	The real, worth only about 48 cents at the end of February, was  
up to 56 cents on Friday. That's still well below the 82 cents the 
real cost at the end of 1998, but a significant improvement 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing $1.82 billion last year, Brazilian stock markets  
are enjoying a new bull run. The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo 
Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, surged 15 percent in the 
first week of March alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation, which was about 2 percent last year but threatened to  
roar back with the devaluation, is way below initial predictions. 
Consumer prices in Sao Paulo rose just 0.8 percent in the past four 
weeks, down from 1.4 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism grew when Brazil signed a new agreement with the  
International Monetary Fund, which underpins a $41.5 billion rescue 
plan. The country hopes to receive $8.6 billion of that money by 
early April. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso has shown his strength in Congress, winning approval for  
a controversial tax on bank transactions that is expected to 
generate $8.5 billion, a year. The tax is a key to Brazil's 
commitment to reducing its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Arminio Fraga, president of Brazil's Central Bank, said foreign  
perception of Brazil has ``improved a lot and will continue 
improving as we move ahead'' with austerity reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga himself has been part of the turnaround. A former  
associate of U.S. billionaire financier George Soros, the 
market-savvy Fraga was essential in persuading foreign bankers to 
maintain credit lines to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet big hurdles remain. Wholesale prices are rising and could  
feed inflation. Unions also are demanding large cost-of-living 
raises, and labor unrest promises to heat up. 
</P>
<P>
	An expected surge in exports hasn't happened, and the $11  
billion trade surplus Brazil promised the IMF looks unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also seems to have no solution for its huge  
domestic debt, which soared with the real's devaluation and grows 
daily, with interest rates running as high as 42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Falls and Drops to Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan can do a double axel with  
her eyes closed. But with her eyes open in the World Figure Skating 
Championships, the tearful Kwan fell on the jump Friday and dropped 
to fourth place after the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if her sparkle and skill come back for Saturday's final,  
she can retain her title only if Maria Butyrskaya of Russia 
falters. Butyrskaya took first place in a routine combining 
precision and allure to the seductive wail of ``St. James 
Infirmary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runner-up Julia Soldatova of Russia and third-place Vanessa  
Gusmeroli of France both said they were surprised to find 
themselves ahead of Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michelle is still the best skater,'' Gusmeroli said.  
</P>
<P>
	If Kwan regains her top form Saturday, even Butyrskaya would be  
hard-pressed to beat her in the long program. But under a new 
scoring system that was introduced this year, in which the 
qualification round counts for 20 percent, Butyrskaya could win the 
title even if she places second behind Kwan in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya has had a tendency to slip at critical times, such as  
falling twice at the Grand Prix finals. But she also can rise to 
the occasion, as at the Russian nationals where she hit seven 
triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan is more consistent, but has off days. She expressed  
confidence Friday that she could win the free skate, but knows that 
ultimately the title is Butyrskaya's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't control my own destiny,'' she said, after crying  
backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan caught a cold en route to Helsinki and said, ``I haven't  
been on all week,'' adding she was still surprised at missing the 
double axel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can close my eyes and do it. This time, I was wide awake and  
couldn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kwan had looked increasingly assured during practices,  
she appeared tentative almost from the beginning Friday. Before 
missing the double axel, she had trouble landing the first part of 
a triple lutz-double toe loop combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Her technical marks ranged from 5.1 to 5.4, but were stronger on  
presentation with mostly 5.8s and 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldatova and Gusmeroli are solid, appealing skaters, but no  
challenges to a top-form Butyrskaya. Tatiana Malinina of Uzbekistan 
is the only skater other than Kwan considered to have much chance 
of knocking Butyrskaya to third in the free program. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina, who beat Butyrskya at the Grand Prix finals two weeks  
ago, was short of her best Friday, finishing fifth in a program 
that was wan but free of major errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan's performance was not the only surprise for the Americans.  
Sarah Hughes ended the short program in ninth place, higher than 
expected for a 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly pleased, Hughes was able to shrug off an anomalous low  
technical mark of 4.4 from the Austrian judge.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier To Visit U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will travel to the  
United States next month for high-level meetings with President 
Clinton and visits to five other American cities, the White House 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's visit is coming at a time of heightened expectations that  
the United States and China may finally be able to reach agreement 
on a package of market-opening trade initiatives that will clear 
the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the discussions between Clinton and Zhu -- the highest  
level talks since Clinton's trip to China last June -- are occurring 
at a time of increased tensions over China's record on human rights 
and allegations of Chinese espionage at government nuclear 
laboratories at Los Alamos, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the trip, the White House said Clinton and Zhu  
would discuss a full range of issues including security, economics 
and human rights. In addition, Zhu and Vice President Al Gore will 
co-chair the second meeting of the U.S.-China Forum on Environment 
and Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu will visit Washington on April 8. According to the schedule  
released by the White House, Zhu will visit Los Angeles on April 
6-7; Denver, April 10-11; Chicago, April 11-12; New York, April 
12-14; and Boston on April 14.

<HEADLINE> Super Lightweight Fight Set for May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Miguel Angel Gonzalez and Konstantin Tszyu  
are finally set again to fight for the WBC super lightweight crown 
-- although where is not yet certain. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Boxing Council said Friday that the fight originally  
scheduled for Nov. 28 now has been set for May 15. A location is 
due to be announced ``in a short period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner is supposed to face former champion Julio Cesar  
Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight between Gonzalez of Mexico and the Russian-born Tszyu  
was first delayed by an injury to Gonzalez, then by Gonzalez's 
court suit to drop promoter Don King. 
</P>
<P>
	That was settled March 4 when King agreed to share promotion of  
Gonzalez's next four fights with Dan Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez's only loss against 42 victories came against Oscar De  
La Hoya. He also had a controversial draw against Chavez a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Tszyu is 21-1-1. He earlier held the IBF junior middleweight  
crown.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Reducing Breeding Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Farmers in the nation's leading  
hog-producing states have drastically reduced the number of sows in 
their herds, the government reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they expected the cutbacks in breeding stock to  
continue through the rest of this year, pointing to a rebound in 
hog prices from the four-decade lows of late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Levitt, a senior livestock analyst with the Alaron Trading  
Group in Chicago, said the government's numbers should translate 
into hog prices around $40 to $50 per hundred pounds this summer, a 
huge recovery from prices as low as $8 per hundredweight in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Hurt, a livestock marketing economist at Purdue University  
in West Lafayette, Ind., said that with production costs hovering 
around $36 to $38 per hundredweight, hog prices should hit the 
break-even point for most farmers by late May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The breeding herd today is most highly correlated with profits  
or losses a year ago. If you want to know when the breeding herd is 
going to get the smallest, look at when the losses were the worst a 
year ago,'' said Herd. ``The breeding herd will continue to shrink 
all the way through this year and reach its minimum probably about 
a year from now in March or June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the smallest supply of pigs will come in the summer or  
fall of 2000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly hogs and pigs report released Friday by the U.S.  
Department of Agriculture showed that U.S. hog numbers totaled 59.9 
million head as of March 1, down 1 percent from a year ago and down 
4 percent from the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hurt said the truly dramatic changes came in the number of  
sows being kept for breeding, where 13 of the nation's leading hog 
states saw reductions from a year earlier. Iowa, the nation's 
leading hog-producing state, saw the number of sows drop 6 percent 
from 1.3 million in March 1998 to 1.22 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin saw the biggest drop, at 19 percent, while Illinois,  
Kansas and Michigan all saw 15 percent decreases in their breeding 
herds. 
</P>
<P>
	Herd said the reduction in sows is farmers' response to  
record-low prices and a glut of hogs heading to market at the end 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are big adjustments and I think that's where you are  
seeing the response,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of pigs bred from December through February stood at  
25.3 million head, down 1 percent from the same period of 1998 but 
9 percent more than 1997. Herd said the sows that produced those 
pigs had already been bred when the low prices hit and farmers 
generally don't sell off pregnant sows. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. farmers intend to farrow 2.88 million sows from March  
through May this year, down 7 percent from the same period of 1998. 
Intended farrowings for June through August, at 2.84 million sows, 
also are 7 percent below 1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Herd said his advice for all hog farmers is to hold steady for  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't make any really huge major decisions until we can see  
the year 2000, especially, the first half of the year, and see if 
this industry can get price recovery,'' he said. ``Don't just throw 
up your hands and get out and don't make any big investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 14.6 million head, Iowa's hog population as of March 1 was up  
4 percent from a year ago. That outdistanced No. 2 North Carolina, 
which reported a hog inventory of 9.5 million, unchanged from a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, however, continued to lead the nation in pig  
production for the December-February quarter, with 4.69 million 
head born during the period, up 2 percent from a year earlier. Iowa 
produced 4.17 million pigs during the period, down 8 percent from a 
year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Auburn's Ellis: AP Coach of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Cliff Ellis capped an unforgettable  
season for Auburn with the biggest personal triumph of his coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, who led the Tigers to a school-record 29 victories and a  
No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, was honored Friday as The 
Associated Press coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is a thrill, just to be in a position to get  
something an award like this,'' he said after accepting his trophy 
at the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I'm going to cherish forever, an honor I accept  
on behalf on the entire Auburn family, the Auburn players and 
everybody else who helped me along the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis received 36 votes for coach of the year, 17 more than  
runner-up Jim O'Brien of Ohio State. He is the first Auburn coach 
to win the award and the second from the SEC in the 1990s, joining 
Eddie Fogler of Vanderbilt in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his arrival at the Southeastern Conference school in  
1994, Auburn had one winning season in six years. The Tigers 
haven't had a losing record under Ellis and began this season with 
17 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this team to come out of nowhere to do what it did is very  
special,'' Ellis said. ``There was no mention of us in the rankings 
before the season and we rose as high as No. 2. It was an amazing 
and incredibly exciting run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A musician, author and ostrich farmer in addition to being a  
coach, Ellis also enjoyed success at Cumberland College, South 
Alabama and Clemson before taking over Auburn's struggling program. 
He has a career record of 444-271 in 24 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn won the SEC regular-season title for the first time since  
1960 and, as the top seed in the South Regional, advanced to the 
round of 16 in the NCAA tournament before losing to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers finished fourth in the final national rankings.  
</P>
<P>
	``It really was an incredible year,'' Ellis said. ``For that  
team to do what it did -- winning so many games at the beginning of 
the season -- and not folding under the pressure is just a tribute 
every one of the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With four starters returning next season, the Tigers should be  
strong again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expectations are going to be higher, but that's what you  
play for,'' he said. ``We're looking to forward to it.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan Fights for World Skating Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan is trying to duplicate  
her winning performances in the 1996 and 1998 World Figure Skating 
Championships. So far, she's a lot closer to her 1997 form. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck in fourth place after a mistake Friday in the short  
program, the American star is faced with the possibility of falling 
short even with a victory in today's free program. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what happened in 1997 in Switzerland, with fellow  
American Tara Lipinski skating off with the title that gave her a 
big boost to the Olympic gold medal the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Russia's Maria Butyrskaya has the advantage over Kwan.  
</P>
<P>
	A fall on the relatively simple double axel in the short program  
dropped Kwan to fourth. An error-free routine, combined with her 
qualifying group victory Wednesday, left Butyrskaya in position to 
complete a Russian sweep of the titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly can win the long, but I don't control my own  
destiny,'' Kwan said. ``It's like I have to rely on others skaters 
now to miss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya has to finish third or worse for Kwan to win. If the  
Russian is second, she takes the title no matter what Kwan does. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan caught a cold on her way to Finland and was forced to take  
antibiotics earlier in the week to improve her condition in time 
for three skates within 75 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I've been crying, so I'm congested again,'' she  
said after her program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been on all week,'' added Kwan, still surprised at  
missing the double axel. ``I can close my eyes and do it. This 
time, I was wide awake and couldn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Julia Soldatova was second, followed by France's  
Vanessa Gusmeroli. Both are solid skaters, but have little hope of 
catching Butyrskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michelle is still the best skater,'' Gusmeroli said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tatiana Malinina of Uzbekistan is the only skater other than  
Kwan considered to have much chance of knocking Butyrskaya to third 
in the free program. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina, who beat Butyrskaya in the Grand Prix finals two weeks  
ago, was fifth Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance, Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov kept  
Russia's title streak alive with a close victory. 
</P>
<P>
	They performed a routine entirely to the rhythm of drums with no  
melody. However their technique and variety of rhythms was enough 
for them to gain a 5-4 decision in a head-to-head match against 
France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Anissina, born in Russia, and Peizerat skated a more  
conventional routine to ``Man in the Iron Mask'' that was 
highlighted by unique lifts, including one where she holds him off 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz finished third.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Russia's Alexei Yagudin won the men's title, and  
compatriots Yelena Berzhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze took the pairs 
championship.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Executes Man Who Killed Inmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A man who killed a fellow prison inmate,  
then fired his lawyers and asked to be executed was put to death by 
injection Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	James David Rich, 26, pleaded guilty to stabbing Paul Gwyn at  
the Eastern Correctional Institution in 1994. Rich was serving a 
life sentence for another murder at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he killed Gwyn because he didn't like an educational  
program at the prison and wanted to be transferred to another one. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last statement, Rich praised God and asked for mercy for  
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich represented himself at his trial, later fired appeals  
lawyers and asked to be executed. However, some of his supporters 
said he was mentally ill and that he sometimes asked that his 
execution not go forward.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Waste Reaches US Waste Dump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Through cheers, jeers and an attempted  
blockade, a big rig loaded with radioactive waste made a historic 
journey today to the nation's first nuclear waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck left Los Alamos National Laboratory in northern New  
Mexico and traveled 270 miles south to the Waste Isolation Pilot 
Plant near Carlsbad, a 7.5 hour trip that followed 25 long years of 
studies, protests and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic -- this is just the culmination of everything I've  
worked for for 25 years,'' said Wendell Weart, a Sandia National 
Laboratories scientist who was instrumental in creating WIPP. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.8 billion facility is designed to gather contaminated  
material from military sites spread across the nation into a single 
depository carved out of ancient salt caverns nearly half a mile 
below ground. 
</P>
<P>
	An appellate court in Washington, D.C., and a federal judge in  
Santa Fe on Wednesday rejected last-ditch appeals from 
environmentalists who sought to scuttle the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver gave a thumbs-up as he left Los Alamos on Thursday  
evening, and a crowd of about 100 people cheered in response. 
</P>
<P>
	But down the road in Santa Fe, a hub of anti-WIPP sentiment,  
dozens of protesters lined the route holding up placards that read 
``Stop Nuke Trucks'' and ``Science or Science Fiction?'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Beems, 42, of Albuquerque, was arrested after he tried  
to block the truck's path by parking his car across the roadway, 
said state Public Safety Secretary Darren White. An advance team of 
officers cleared the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck carried about 600 pounds of waste --  
plutonium-contaminated clothing, gloves, booties, filters, 
coveralls, plastic covers and metal cans. The waste was packed in 
boxes loaded in three specially designed stainless steel 
containers, each about 8 feet wide and 10 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the material was from the lab's manufacture of nuclear  
batteries used in NASA deep space probes, such as the Voyager 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, such shipments will become ``highly routine,'' lab  
spokesman Kevin Roark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``WIPP shipments will go out every week and no one will even  
notice,'' he said. ``There was more fanfare for the first shipment 
because of its historical significance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, about 37,000 shipments will fill WIPP's underground  
storage rooms and become entombed by salt over the next 30 years.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombs Yugoslavia for 2nd Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO aircraft and missiles blasted  
targets in Yugoslavia for a second night, directing much of their 
fire on Kosovo, where fighting raged between Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav forces Thursday continued their offensive on the ground  
in Kosovo against ethnic Albanians. President Slobodan Milosevic 
cut off diplomatic relations with the United States, France, 
Germany and Britain, while Serbian authorities ordered journalists 
from NATO nations out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency said today it feared Serb reprisals  
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority now that foreign 
observers and relief workers have left. 
</P>
<P>
	``With only a handful of independent observers left on the  
ground, we are extremely worried about the plight of Kosovo's 
civilian population, which has already been through a terrible 
ordeal,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials insisted today the barrage won't stop until  
Milosevic agrees to a peace deal in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will end when we have limited (Milosevic's) ability to  
terrorize his people, to ethnically cleanse Kosovo,'' British 
Defense Secretary George Robertson told BBC Television. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no hint from Milosevic that he would back down over  
Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run television in Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic,  
quoted a government official saying the second night of NATO 
attacks caused civilian casualties and targeted schools and 
telecommunications networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO strikes Thursday hit inside Kosovo around its  
provincial capital, Pristina, the northern town of Kosovska 
Mitrovica and the southwestern town of Prizren, media in Yugoslavia 
said. Serbian TV said three missiles hit a police station on a 
military base, injuring one policeman and leaving two others 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Belgrade city official said there was ``heavy activity'' by  
warplanes attacking targets outside the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. 
The official Tanjug news agency reported that an airport in the 
central Serbian city of Nis had been hit and was in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Local television broadcast appeals for blood donors after 10  
explosions rattled Kraljevo, 75 miles south of Belgrade, the 
independent Beta news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montenegro, Yugoslavia's other republic, there were reports  
of explosions at army compounds and barracks, as well as at an 
airport and radar facilities in various towns. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO missile hit Djakovica, near the Kosovo-Albanian border,  
missing an army compound, Tanjug reported. ``The material damage is 
substantial, and there are casualties,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials said all NATO aircraft returned to base safely  
after their attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was evidence of anti-aircraft units firing on allied  
fliers, but there were no reports at this stage that Yugoslav 
fighters had been launched to intercept them,'' Group Capt. Ian 
Travers Smith said after eight British jets returned to base in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleurat Sejeu, spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in  
London, said in an interview with BBC World television that 
Yugoslav MiGs were being used against ethnic Albanians, who make up 
90 percent of Kosovo's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Sejeu said Serbs had rounded up thousands of displaced ethnic  
Albanian civilians in the central Drenica region and were marching 
them toward Pristina. ``Nobody knows what will happen'' to them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A KLA commander, Ramush Hajredinaj, told The Associated Press by  
telephone Thursday that refugees were trapped in Drenica. He didn't 
give any numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 Kosovo Albanians crossed into Albania Thursday, saying  
Serb security forces had swept into their village of Goden, 
detaining men, setting the village on fire, and marching women and 
children across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Selim Ferraj, 37, one of the few males with the group from  
Goden, said he feared the other men were dead. ``I am only alive 
because I knew the Serb commander before,'' said Ferraj, who 
escaped with his wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR estimates that more than 450,000 people have been forced  
from their homes since fighting began in Kosovo more than one year 
ago. Some 260,000 people remain displaced within Kosovo, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Romania, Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said today the country  
is prepared to take in refugees from neighboring Yugoslavia if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug reported that ethnic Albanian rebels had attacked Serb  
police in Djakovica, wounding one. 
</P>
<P>
	In Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, supporters of the Serbs  
took to the streets with rocks and gasoline bombs to attack 
embassies of the United States, Britain and other NATO countries. 
Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Vojislav Seselj, an ultranationalist Serbian deputy premier,  
urged Serbs to attack American interests all over the world, the 
independent Beta news agency reported, according to Studio 99 
television in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's deputy premier, Vuk Draskovic, gave a series of  
television interviews Thursday calling on NATO to stop the bombing, 
although he did not say his country was prepared to accept the 
Kosovo agreement negotiated in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he proposed reopening negotiations on the agreement.  
And he said Yugoslavia would call off its offensive in Kosovo only 
after ethnic Albanians and NATO ceased fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, signed by the ethnic Albanians in Paris, gives the  
province broad autonomy and provides for a NATO force to enforce 
the it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Paris agreement is destroyed now by the bombs,'' Draskovic  
told Britain's Channel 4 News. ``Is that democracy? You are bombing 
us to accept something we don't like to accept, to accept ... the 
dissolution of our state, promoting Kosovo as an independent 
state.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Records Become Issue Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Nevada boxing commissioners are trying to keep  
the personal lives of boxers private. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission argued Friday for a new law that would keep  
almost all information about fighters and promoters given it 
confidential. The commission is concerned that Nevada could lose 
its place as the host of most major fights. 
</P>
<P>
	A press representative, however, called the bill a ``knee-jerk  
reaction'' to the release of Mike Tyson's psychological records and 
said the public that buys tickets or makes bets on fights has a 
right to know about a boxer's mental and physical state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can anyone say with certainty that the public dissemination of  
Mike Tyson's psychological reports caused any substantial harm to 
Mike Tyson?'' asked Kent Lauer, director of the Nevada State Press 
Association. ``I don't think so. In fact, I think the public 
confidence in the commission's decision on Tyson's license was 
bolstered by the release of those reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action in Nevada came on the same day a Maryland judge  
praised the ``remarkable'' progress made by the former heavyweight 
champion, but rejected his request for a reduced sentence. Tyson 
must still serve 60 days in Maryland for violating probation for a 
1992 rape conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, a Nevada Assembly committee decided to delete  
sweeping language keeping most records confidential. But it 
authorized an amendment to keep medical information not relevant to 
an application to box confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved legislation allowing the commission  
to grant a boxing license with restrictions. That also became an 
issue with Tyson when the commission wanted to grant him a license 
to box again -- with certain conditions -- but couldn't add the 
conditions because Nevada law didn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five Nevada athletic commissioners appeared before  
the committee in Carson City to argue that records given the 
commission should not be made public without a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to psychological records, the bill supported by the  
commissioners would have restricted access to medical and criminal 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in no way an effort to keep information from the  
public,'' commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta said. ``I believe it is 
good public policy to have this information open to the public. But 
there are certain circumstances where it affects our ability to 
regulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the release of Tyson's psychological records prior to  
his relicensing hearing in October, commissioners cited no other 
case in which there was a problem over the release of a boxer's 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But commissioner Glenn Carano said that by assuring boxers that  
any information given the commission when it is licensing a fighter 
be kept private it will help the state get more big fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the boxing capital of the world. The Nevada Athletic  
Commission is very highly regarded,'' Carano said. ``It is, 
however, a very competitive industry. We need the confidence of 
everybody we do business with -- that includes the boxers and 
promoters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lauer, however, said that the present system has been in place  
for years and that Nevada has had no problems before. 
</P>
<P>
	``This information has been open for a long time now, and I  
didn't hear the athletic commission testify to any abuses of this 
open information,'' Lauer said. ``All of a sudden because of this 
Mike Tyson episode they want to make everything confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was ordered last September to undergo five days of  
psychological testing by a team of doctors at Massachusetts General 
Hospital before boxing regulators would agree to hear his request 
for a license to replace the one taken from him for biting Evander 
Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to court to try and keep the records closed, but a judge  
ruled that Nevada law made them public documents and they were 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you say that embarrassed Mike Tyson?'' Lauer asked.  
``It didn't. Mike Tyson does a good enough job of embarrassing 
himself in other ways.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Questioned on IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two congressional leaders asked President  
Clinton on Friday why he hasn't extended federal anti-bribery laws 
to the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Tom Bliley, chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and  
Michael Oxley, head of its finance subcommittee, noted that the 
White House was asked almost a month ago by the U.S. Olympic 
Committee to include the IOC under the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	That request came as an independent USOC investigation, headed  
by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, concluded that 
the IOC fostered a ``culture of improper gift-giving'' that led to 
a multimillion-dollar vote-buying scheme in Salt Lake's successful 
quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent events regarding the ethical lapses concerning the  
IOC raise serious questions that must be addressed promptly,'' 
Bliley, R-Va., and Oxley, R-Ohio, wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton ``is still  
reviewing the Mitchell recommendations.'' He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying they were ``shocked and discouraged'' by the revelations  
of cash, scholarships, medical treatment and other inducements for 
IOC members from Salt Lake bidders, the lawmakers asked the 
president what steps he had taken to make such actions illegal and 
make sure other nations did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	They gave Clinton until April 13 to either add the IOC to the  
organizations covered by federal international business bribery 
laws or tell them why he had failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
	They also asked him to list what countries the White House had  
contacted to try to have them adopt similar codes ``so as to make 
bribery of an IOC official illegal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley and Oxley were primary House architects of the foreign  
bribery laws last year and said Clinton could cover the IOC through 
a stroke of a pen on an executive order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fairness, clear rules and objectivity are critical in the  
sporting world,'' their letter said. ``The Olympic spirit reflects 
the highest ideals in this respect, or at least it should. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athletes spend years of hard work in training in order to  
pursue the Olympic dream. Their tireless dedication to excellence 
should not be sullied by corruption, or by acquiescence to 
corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter from the House members was the latest step by federal  
agencies into the Olympic bribery case, the worst scandal in the 
history of the world's biggest sports event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and the FBI are investigating possible  
violations of federal fraud and tax laws, and the Senate Commerce 
Committee has scheduled hearings on the scandal for April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending Senate legislation also would strip the IOC's tax-exempt  
status in the United States, limit the amount of Olympic fees 
sponsors could deduct and place U.S. TV rights fees -- the single 
biggest source of Olympic income -- with the USOC instead of the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC expelled six members last week for accepting bribes and  
started the action on what it described as a series of long-range 
reforms, including a task force to restructure the committee and 
membership.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up Before Report / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors began to 
square positions ahead of a key government report next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department early Wednesday is expected to  
reveal farmer planting intentions for the spring crop, including 
the first concrete estimate of whether producers intend to plant 
more soybeans over corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also found continued support from rumors that the Clinton  
administration is considering a one-time exemption on export bans 
to Iran and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.94 1/2 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.30 a bushel; May oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.20 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 3/4 cent to $4.99 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .05 cent to 65.90 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .25 cent to 71.30 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .35 cent to 43.75 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell 2.10

<HEADLINE> Guerrero Riding Infiniti in Phoenix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- As if to underline what a good fit he's found at  
Cobb Racing, Roberto Guerrero even likes that his team equipped its 
cars with Infiniti engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of 28 cars entered in the MCI WorldCom 200 on Sunday  
are powered by Oldsmobile Auroras. But Guerrero believes the 
Infinitis are catching up in quality, if not in reputation, and he 
supports the idea of diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the good of the series, it's important to have more than  
just one engine,'' Guerrero said Friday at practice for the Indy 
Racing League event. ``The other thing that's exciting is that it 
would be very nice for me to win the first race with an Infiniti.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He already is the first to lead a race with the stepchild power  
plant that team owner Price Cobb believes is good enough to become 
dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero finished fourth last August at Texas Motor Speedway  
after leading the first 22 laps ever by an Infiniti-powered car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nissan used to trounce us all the time,'' said Cobb, who won  
the World Porsche Cup while driving in IMSA's Camel GTP series. ``I 
know where they've been and I know where they're going. I know if I 
latch onto their start, it'll make Cobb Racing look that much 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb says the crew let Guerrero down in Dallas and again on Jan.  
24 in this season's first race, when Guerrero finished 13th after 
running 88 laps with a piece of another car's bodywork caught 
underneath the chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roberto had come from 18th to lead the race and did it  
effortlessly,'' Cobb said. ``I mean, there really was no discussion 
about who was the fastest car on the track. We didn't finish well 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Buhl is the only other driver at Phoenix with an  
Infiniti-equipped G Force. Rookies Jaques Lazier and Scott 
Harrington have Infinitis in their Dallara chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington Motorsports chief mechanic Steve Dunlap said Nissan  
improved its backup support while taking the bugs out of the 
powerplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had good luck with our private tests and mileaged the  
engine out without any difficulty, and when we got down to the 
block it was in great shape,'' Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsepower and durability aside, Guerrero has reason to feel  
confident in Phoenix, where he won the fastest race in the history 
of the irregular, one-mile oval 12 years ago -- averaging 138.020 
mph over 200 miles in a turbocharged CART machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started last,'' he recalled. ``We were 2 1/2 pounds  
underweight after qualifying, so they made us start at the back of 
the pack. We had a few things go wrong throughout the race and 
still went ahead and got my first Indy car win, so that was a very 
special day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in 1987, Guerrero was second in the Indianapolis 500, and  
the next year qualified for his only Indy 500 pole while setting a 
track record of 232.482 mph. But that Memorial Day weekend came to 
an inglorious end when he spun into the wall during the second 
parade lap. 
</P>
<P>
	He also crashed at the Indy 500 in 1993 and 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero entered the Pep Boys IRL with Pagan Racing in 1996, a  
team he left midway through last season. He missed three races 
before catching a ride with Cobb.

<HEADLINE> Sprague Wins Chevy Trucks 150 Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Jack Sprague, who has won more NASCAR Craftsman  
Truck Series races at Phoenix International Raceway than any other 
driver, delivered a record qualifying lap Friday to win the pole 
for the Chevy Trucks 150. 
</P>
<P>
	Last in line to qualify, Sprague exhibited no jitters whatsoever  
in bumping Rick Crawford's Ford from the pole position. The 1997 
series champion drove a Chevrolet Silverado around the one-mile 
oval at 128.402 mph to reclaim the speed standard he lost to Mike 
Bliss in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, the only other driver to better Bliss' old mark of  
127.741, put a Ford F-150 in the No. 2 starting position. His speed 
was 128.105. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss, who won October's series race here from the No. 1  
starting position, failed to challenge for the top spot. He 
qualified 10th, also in a Ford, at 126.796. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Harvick will start third in Saturday's race after posting  
a speed of 127.768. He'll share the second row with Greg Biffle, 
who delivered a lap of 127.669. Both drive Fords. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time series champion Ron Hornaday was fifth in Chevrolet at  
127.438. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-five trucks will start Saturday's 150-mile race.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday's pole run was Sprague's fourth in Phoenix and 13th in  
the series, two shy of Mike Skinner's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Sprague's three previous Phoenix victories also came from  
the No. 1 starting slot, including his last in 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Brand, Ellis Win AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Duke sophomore center Elton Brand  
and Auburn's Cliff Ellis were honored today by The Associated Press 
as college basketball's player and coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the only unanimous All-America selection this season,  
enters the Final Four averaging 17.8 points and 9.6 rebounds for 
the top-ranked Blue Devils, who have won a school-record 31 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Brand has had 17 double-doubles this season, nine  
in the last 15 games and two in the Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament. Brand is shooting 62 percent from the field and he has 
83 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand received 28 votes from AP member newspapers and radio  
stations, while senior guard Andre Miller of Utah was runner-up 
with 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is the third Duke player to win the Adolph Rupp Trophy,  
following Art Heyman in 1963 and Christian Laettner in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis led Auburn to one the best seasons in school history as  
the Tigers finished 29-4, a school record for victories, and 
reached their highest ranking ever, No. 2. Auburn, which finished 
as the Southeastern Conference's regular-season champion, was 
fourth in the final rankings and earned a No. 1 seeding in the NCAA 
tournament, losing to Ohio State in the regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, who has been at Auburn since 1994, has compiled a 444-271  
record in 24 seasons as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He received 36 votes for coach of the year, 17 more than  
runner-up Jim O'Brien of Ohio State. Ellis is the first Auburn 
coach to win the award and the second from the SEC in the 1990s, 
joining Eddie Fogler of Vanderbilt in 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Russia Not To Arm Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Convinced that Russia's angry reaction to the  
NATO attack on the Serbs is geared to a domestic audience, the 
Clinton administration hopes President Boris Yeltsin's suspension 
of ties to the alliance will be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will just have to watch and see what decisions Russia  
makes,'' Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told The 
Associated Press. ``That depends on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin suspended cooperation with NATO to protest the attack.  
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, meanwhile, hinted Russia would try to 
get the U.N. arms embargo against Yugoslavia lifted, which 
President Clinton said would be ``a terrible mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs ``have quite a lot of arms on their own. They made a  
lot of arms in the former Yugoslavia,'' Clinton said. ``I have no 
intention of lifting any of the arms embargo on Serbia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Russia ordered NATO's two top representatives in the  
country to leave. ``We cannot now have any contact with the leaders 
of NATO, including the secretary-general of the alliance, until the 
aggression against Yugoslavia has stopped,'' Ivanov was quoted as 
saying by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also is checking reports the Russians  
already were providing Belgrade with weapons to resist the NATO 
cruise missile and bombing attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are watching that closely with our eyes open,'' said  
another senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
``We have seen nothing definitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia joined with the United States and four European countries  
in framing the proposed settlement for Kosovo that Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic has rejected. But Russia also 
consistently has opposed the use of force against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin on Wednesday called the NATO attack ``naked  
aggression.'' He added that if the fighting spread, Russia reserved 
the right to take measures, ``including those of a military 
character,'' to defend itself and the security of Europe. However, 
he backed off on that threat Thursday, as did Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have different responses at our disposal. Regarding  
military potential, our country is second to no one,'' Primakov 
said on Russia's NTV television. ``But we aren't taking those 
steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials on Thursday also forced a U.N. Security  
Council vote today on the legality of the NATO bombing, but the 
resolution was certain to fail under a veto threat from the United 
States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimitri Simes, president of the private Nixon Center and a  
leading Russian analyst, called the rift with Russia far more 
serious than the situation in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most serious event since the end of the Cold War,  
with far-reaching consequences for the U.S.-Russian relationship, 
for the international environment, for American foreign policy 
interests,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sending a message to Russia that the United States is  
the enemy of the Russian people,'' Simes said. ``In Russia, 
everyone is talking about American aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration made no effort to conceal the rift.  
</P>
<P>
	``As you know,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said,  
``Russia does not agree with our decision to launch military 
strikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said Russian leaders deserved credit for trying to  
accept a Kosovo settlement. ``We are, and will remain, in close 
touch'' she said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Ivanov told reporters ``we aren't calling for  
rupturing relations with the United States. We treasure those 
relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A casualty of the NATO attack was a planned visit here by  
Primakov. En route Tuesday to Washington, he ordered his plane to 
return to Moscow rather than arrive in the United States with the 
bombing under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Russian officials remained, concluded energy and medical  
agreements, including cooperation in fighting tuberculosis, and 
worked on ways to enhance foreign investment in the Russian oil and 
gas industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's economy is weak, and with the encouragement of the  
United States the managing director of the International Monetary 
Fund, Michael Camdessus, is going ahead with a trip to Moscow this 
weekend to discuss Western loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said the disagreement with Russia over using force  
against the Serbs ``is a disagreement that can be managed.''

<HEADLINE> Women's NCAA Final Four Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Last fall, Duke came to San Jose, too.  
Only the Duke that played then and the Duke that will play for the 
national championship are different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke opened its season 1-3, including a 104-74 season-opening  
loss to Connecticut in the Four in the Fall tournament at the San 
Jose Arena last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke followed the loss with a 77-57 victory over Stanford, but  
then lost consecutive games to Virginia Tech and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, all of that was forgotten as the Blue Devils defeated  
Georgia 81-69 in the semifinals back at the San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started 1-3, but the way we played in the ACC, we went 15-1  
and we beat UCLA. I think we just really believed that we were 
going to the Final Four,'' senior guard Hilary Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that it was going to come together, but it was  
frustrating at the beginning of the season,'' she added. ``We lost 
by 30 points right off the bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow guard Nicole Erickson admitted that the team was terrible  
in its first visit to San Jose. The difference? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're healthy right now, and we're in shape,'' she said.  
``Four of our five starters didn't even play in the preseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Center Michele VanGorp said it was more a matter of chemistry.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be a certain time before everybody  
started to feel comfortable with eachother and in a groove,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UKARI'S GAME:* There was one thing that all the Purdue players  
could agree upon after Friday's 77-63 victory over Louisiana Tech: 
It was all about Ukari Figgs. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs, a senior guard, had 24 points and 10 rebounds to advance  
the Boilermakers to the title game against Duke on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ukari doesn't get a lot of the respect that she deserves,''  
guard-forward Katie Douglas said. ``She really deserves it 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Michelle Duhart also heaped on the praise.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ukari, she's incredible,'' Duhart said. ``I didn't know just  
how well she was doing until somebody told me she had 18 points at 
the half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Techsters had no answer for Figgs, admitted coach Leon  
Barmore. He credited her with making the difference for Purdue in a 
tight second half.

	``She made a couple unbelievable shots,'' he said. ``It wasn't  
the person guarding her's fault on a couple of those shots. She 
just knocked them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOUBLE THREAT:* Georgia twin guards Kelly Miller and Coco  
Miller usually mean double trouble for their opponents. Duke 
figured out that it wasn't a matter of control so much as 
containment. 
</P>
<P>
	Coco scored 18 points and had eight rebounds, while Kelly had 13  
points and six rebounds. But it wasn't enough, as the Blue Devils 
beat the Lady Bulldogs 81-69 to advance to the national 
championship game Sunday against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke guard Hilary Howard knew it was going to take some effort,  
especially in light of Kelly's 33-performance against Iowa State in 
the Mideast Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we just wanted them not to go off,'' Howard said. ``We  
knew we couldn't stop them, but we wanted to contain them 
nonetheless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for Georgia is that Coco and Kelly are sophomores,  
which means they still have a couple more years to confound 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have people like that on your basketball team, the  
bar is set, the pace is set,'' coach Andy Landers said. ``In that 
way, they lead us.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHAMIQUE'S DONE:* Chamique Holdsclaw's college career is  
officially over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee star was invited to play in the Women's Basketball  
Coaches Association all-star game on Saturday but declined. She was 
available to play because Tennessee was eliminated from the NCAA 
tournament in the regional finals by Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to my coaches and there wasn't a real need for me to  
play,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I kind of always said when I ended my 
career, I wanted to end it wearing a Tennessee uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw is seeing the Final Four from a different perspective  
this year because she led Tennessee to the national championship in 
each of her first three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	While she'd rather be playing, Holdsclaw is finding the  
experience to be interesting while collecting various player of the 
year and All-America awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here this weekend I have kind of a sad feeling, but I'm just  
blessed to be here, to be able to have a great career, to be here 
with friends and family,'' Holdsclaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this is a time I really never had a chance to enjoy -- just  
to sit back and watch and just enjoy the event.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CREDENTIALS COUNT:* Maybe it was the absence of Tennessee and  
Connecticut, maybe it was the cross-country journey from the East 
Coast. For whatever reason, the number of media credentials issued 
for the Final Four was the lowest in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA said it issued 744 credentials to the news media. The  
record was 780 in Kansas City last year, when Tennessee won its 
third consecutive national championship, and there were 754 issued 
for the 1997 Final Four in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the media contingent this year is much larger than it was  
in the late 1980s. For 1988 Final Four in Tacoma, 271 media 
credentials were issued.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Faults U.N. Oil Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Troubled by the depressed condition of the  
domestic oil and natural gas industry, oil-state lawmakers 
criticized a U.N. humanitarian program that permits Iraq to add 
millions of barrels of oil to an already oversupplied market. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Friday of the House Commerce energy and power  
subcommittee, lawmakers assailed a U.N. policy that allows Iraq to 
sell oil for food and medicine, saying it may be harming American 
producers while not meeting the United States' stated aim of 
removing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power. 
</P>
<P>
	``I for one am suspicious of this program,'' said Rep. Ralph  
Hall of Texas, top Democrat on the subcommittee. ``It appears to be 
born out of an appropriate humane consideration, but may be 
disruptive of worldwide crude oil markets and could spawn a lot of 
abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a State Department official, who came in for sharp  
questioning, defended the policy, saying elimination of the 
oil-for-food program would lead to erosion of support within the 
worldwide community for continued sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sanctions deprive Saddam of the revenue he would otherwise  
use to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction,'' said Bill 
Wood, principal deputy assistant secretary of state. ``It is 
essential that we address the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi 
people. Doing so is right in itself but also crucial to maintaining 
Security Council, regional and other international support for the 
sanctions while we continue our efforts to change the Iraqi 
regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economic sanctions were imposed by the U.N. Security Council in  
1990 to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait. To ease the sanctions' 
devastating effect on the Iraqi people, the United Nations launched 
the oil-for-food program in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	France has called for an end to the oil embargo, prompting the  
administration to counter with a proposal in January that would 
expand the oil-for-food program, which comes up for Security 
Council review in May. Congress has no direct say in whether it 
continues, but some lawmakers are pressuring the administration to 
seek changes or an end to the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, Iraq is allowed to sell up to $10.4 billion  
in oil annually, with the proceeds directed by the United Nations 
for purchases of food, medicine and infrastructure. Iraq, which is 
producing about 2.5 million barrels per day, has not neared the 
$10.4 billion ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials contend that the Iraqi production has a  
negligible impact on U.S. oil prices, which have been in a serious 
slump for well over a year. Yet congressional Republicans note that 
when OPEC recently proposed cutting production by an amount similar 
to Iraq's output, worldwide crude prices rose by nearly $2 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic energy industry has shrunk by some 50,000 jobs in  
the past year or so and producers have closed more than 136,000 
marginal oil wells that individually produce less than 15 barrels 
daily but collectively account for one-fifth of domestic 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's chairman, Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, said he has  
concluded that ``our Iraqi policy is designed to maximize Iraqi 
production at the expense of the marginal producer in the United 
States.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal Forgets Whitewater Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Under questioning by prosecutors, Susan  
McDougal is claiming ignorance or memory lapse about the land deals 
that are central to Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeatedly stating ``I don't recall'' and ``I don't remember,''  
Mrs. McDougal testified in her criminal trial that she had 
forgotten what little she knew in the 1980s about the Whitewater 
real estate dealings involving her husband, James McDougal, 
President Clinton and his wife, and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Her trial recessed Thursday afternoon for the weekend when the  
prosecution had technical difficulties with a video machine while 
showing the jury a tape of an ABC television interview of Mrs. 
McDougal years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense may call two more witnesses next week before  
resting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was indicted on two counts of criminal contempt  
and a count of obstruction of justice for refusing to answer 
federal grand jury questions in the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Before running into technical problems, prosecutors were able to  
show a few minutes of the interview. In one outtake, Mrs. McDougal, 
who had been convicted and sentenced in the Whitewater 
investigation before the interview, was asked what the one thing 
she wanted to say after four years of silence in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joking manner, she said ``that I hate'' the prosecutors  
``and that I want them dead and their children dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has maintained she did not trust Starr and refused  
to answer the grand jury questions because she feared the 
independent counsel would twist her words to implicate the Clintons 
or charge her with perjury if she did not say what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	During two days of questioning by prosecutor Mark Barrett, Mrs.  
McDougal said more than 40 times that she did not recall various 
business deals. She said her former husband, who died in federal 
prison last year, handled most of the financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't someone who studied business ... but generally I  
agreed with Jim,'' she told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was confronted with information she provided to  
accountants in 1986 about McDougal's failed savings and loan. She 
maintained that she knew little about the financial deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to Jim'' and passing along what he said to the  
accountants, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ex-husband had suffered a stroke after federal regulators  
removed him from the S&AMP;L, Madison Guaranty. Accountants were trying 
to track the losses to the institution caused by the McDougals' 
numerous real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal also testified that she didn't remember dealing  
personally with former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker on a proposed 
shopping center, even though the accountants' written summary of 
her 1986 interview said she dealt with Tucker on the project, which 
was never built. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed shopping center was an important part of the 1996  
fraud case against the McDougals and Tucker, each of whom was 
convicted of felonies.

<HEADLINE> Thurmond Seeks Crash Restitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Cindrich's fury grew as she learned  
that legislation was sliding through Congress to pay $40 million to 
the families of those who died when a Marine jet sent an Italian 
gondola plunging to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 20 gondola victims were German - but Germany has  
not yet compensated Cindrich for the death of her husband, Greg, in 
an in-flight collision of military jets two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Her grief and anger inflamed, Cindrich, 28, this week unpacked  
the only thing she has left of her husband from that tragic 
accident -- the tattered flight suit she keeps in Greg's study. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took it out and looked at it and thought, 'Who is going to  
help us?''' Cindrich said in a telephone interview from her home in 
North Charleston, S.C. ``It's a slap in my face if reparations are 
going to be made to the Germans before they are made for my 
husband's death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cindrich's complaint caught the ear of her senator, Republican  
Strom Thurmond, who informed his Senate colleagues this week that 
he will offer legislation that would make the American payment to 
the seven German families contingent on Germany's payment to 
Cindrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a simple matter of fairness,'' said Thurmond, the  
former Senate Armed Services Committee chairman. ``If the United 
States Senate does not look out for the interests of American 
servicemen and women, who will?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Capt. Greg Cindrich, 28, and eight other Americans  
were killed Sept. 13, 1997, when their C-141 transport was hit 
head-on by a German air force jet 60 miles off the coast of 
Namibia. Several investigations determined the German plane had 
been flying at the wrong altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of the nine Americans have filed legal claims with  
the German government, but they have received no compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindrich is also waging a fight for better collision-warning  
systems on Air Force jets, but it was the $40 million amendment, 
sponsored by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., and tucked into a $2.5 
billion spending bill, that especially roused her. 
</P>
<P>
	After she called Thurmond's office to complain, the 96-year-old  
senator approached Robb with legislative language that would make 
the American payment contingent on the German payment to Cindrich 
and the eight other families of the 1997 crash, Thurmond aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb refused to change his measure.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to working with Sen. Thurmond's office  
on bringing some closure, comfort and relief to the families of 
both of these terrible accidents,'' Robb spokesman John DiBiase 
said Friday. ``The problem with Sen. Thurmond's legislation is that 
it sets two groups of victims against each other and we want to 
find a solution that helps both groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Thurmond urged Senate Appropriations Committee  
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, to scuttle Robb's amendment in 
negotiations with the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as the United States government has a responsibility to  
compensate the families of the victims of those who died in Italy, 
the German government has an identical obligation to those American 
families who lost loved ones because of negligence and fault of the 
German Air Force,'' he wrote to Stevens on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A diplomatic source familiar with the situation said the German  
government asked the families of the 1997 crash victims in November 
to specify the amount they are seeking, and the Germans are still 
trying to get details. The official spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the German gondola victims' families, John Arthur  
Eaves Jr., said they are sympathetic to Cindrich and willing to 
intervene with German officials on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized the Thurmond approach as unfair, saying the  
cases aren't comparable because the gondola victims were civilians 
while the 1997 victims were military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wouldn't think that one victim would be vindictive  
enough to want to keep other people from finding a resolution in 
their lives just because she hasn't found a resolution,'' Eaves 
said Friday from his Jackson, Miss., office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Devine, the Washington-based lawyer representing Cindrich  
and the families of four other 1997 crash victims, said his clients 
feel restitution should be paid in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Cindrich and the other claimants aren't being vindictive  
at all,'' Devine said. ``All they're saying is they lost their 
loved ones six months before the gondola victims perished, and they 
think it's only fair that they be compensated by the German 
government before our government rushes to compensate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thurmond, Cindrich has powerful help. An aide said he likely  
will introduce independent legislation to hold up the payment to 
the gondola victims' families if Robb's amendment survives. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindrich, left the single mother of the couple's 4-year-old  
child, Christopher, said the scuffle with Congress and seeing the 
flight suit again has her revisiting her first nightmarish days of 
widowhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings me back to the first three weeks, when all I could  
think of was, `Will they bring his body back?'''

<HEADLINE> CBS To Sever Online Sportsbook Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- In response to concerns raised by  
the NCAA, an Internet company partially owned by CBS will sever 
ties to an online sportsbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to support the NCAA's aggressive  
anti-gambling efforts,'' CBS spokeswoman LeslieAnne Wade said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, NCAA executive director Cedric Dempsey had  
expressed unease over broadcast partner CBS' ties to 
Sportsbook.com, a popular Web site that takes offshore bets on the 
NCAA tournament. With the TV contract running through 2002, Dempsey 
said the NCAA could do little to force the network's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``But as we look toward renewing a contract, or negotiating a  
new one, any relationship to gambling would certainly influence our 
thinking,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade said CBS was unaware of the relationship between Sportsline  
USA, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Internet company that produces 
the CBS Sportsline site and Sportsbook.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportsline USA president Michael Levy confirmed that his company  
leased the Sportsbook.com Web site address -- known as an URL, or 
universal resource locator -- to a gambling operation run by Global 
Internet, a company based in the Caribbean. Although CBS owns a 20 
percent stake in Sportline USA, Levy said he was uncertain whether 
he had informed his corporate partner of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, however, a spokesman for Sportsline USA said the Web  
address would be put up for sale immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey said even though the connection to CBS was distant, the  
NCAA was sensitive to the appearance of impropriety. The 
organization has been rocked by point-shaving and gambling scandals 
in recent years, including the indictment of Northwestern 
basketball players on the eve of last year's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, NCAA officials threw their support behind a  
U.S. Senate bill designed to limit gambling on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The connection between CBS' internet operation and  
Sportsbook.com was first reported Thursday by ESPN. Wade said once 
the network became aware of it, CBS took immediate action. Asked 
for a time frame, she replied, ``It's imminent.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Talks To Begin Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after an embarrassing disclosure about a  
secret offer from Microsoft Corp. to settle its antitrust trial, 
the lead attorney general for the 19 states in the case wasn't 
taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from a private meeting Thursday in Washington to  
discuss upcoming Microsoft negotiations with the other attorneys 
general, Iowa's Tom Miller declined even to confirm that the 
subject of their meeting was, in fact, Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	There was only one problem: Someone else had taped a sign on the  
door, ``Microsoft Meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge facing Miller and the other attorneys general to  
negotiate strictly in confidence will only get worse early next 
week, as both Microsoft and the government weigh the seriousness of 
the approaching talks in one of the most high-profile business 
lawsuits in a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side wants to derail a possible agreement, however  
unlikely. But the Justice Department and the attorneys general 
bitterly resent that Microsoft might tender an overture purely to 
defuse its famously aggressive image, score favor with the judge 
and make the government look obstinate. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alternately declined to confirm even what  
appeared to be painfully obvious -- such as Miller's no-comments 
outside the room with the ``Microsoft Meeting'' sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, just moments later, New Mexico's attorney general openly  
revealed that negotiations with Microsoft will begin in earnest on 
Tuesday. Patricia Madrid, who volunteered that Microsoft had 
supported her opponent in her campaign, also indicated that the 
government will make a counteroffer but didn't disclose details. 
</P>
<P>
	``All settlement talks involve proposals and counterproposals,''  
said Madrid, elected last November after the trial started. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys general met at a downtown hotel this week to  
discuss a four-page proposal Microsoft sent in its opening bid to 
settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Odds of any settlement remain slim. Like the initial versions of  
its software, Microsoft's first proposal was described as less than 
adequate. An industry axiom holds that the company's products are 
unusable until their third generation. 
</P>
<P>
	California Attorney General William Lockyer dismissed  
Microsoft's proposal as ``a minimalist offer'' and called it ``far 
from what anyone in our group would expect to be adequate'' before 
Miller and others urged him not to discuss it further. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has indicated it would consider changing some of its  
most controversial agreements with computer makers and Internet 
providers, such as letting computer companies hide easy access to 
the Internet software bundled with its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft won't accept restrictions on what new features it  
can add to Windows, used to run roughly 90 percent of the world's 
personal computers. The government accuses the company of illegally 
using Windows' dominance to extend its considerable influence into 
new areas of technology and crush fledgling rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft declined Thursday to discuss details of the pending  
negotiations, saying ``all the parties need to treat them as 
confidential'' if they were to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, in a lengthy recess, is tentatively scheduled to  
resume April 12 but may not continue until mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares climbed Thursday to a record high of $180, up  
more than 5 percent. It previously announced a 2-for-1 stock split 
will occur Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The states suing Microsoft are California, Connecticut, Florida,  
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. South Carolina 
dropped out of the case.

<HEADLINE> Ohio State-UConn: Matchup of Guards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The matchup that's providing all the  
laughs at the Final Four involves the two Jims, Calhoun and 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup between the two point guards is a lot more important  
in Saturday's semifinal game between Connecticut and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn's Khalid El-Amin and Ohio State's Scoonie Penn don't know  
each other from way back, the way their coaches do. They do know 
how to run a team, motivate everyone who crosses their path and 
turn 5-foot-10 bodies into catalysts that seem perfectly built for 
the last weekend in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could play basketball at 5-6 or 6-4,'' Calhoun said of his  
star point guard. ``He's a kid with some great ability as far as 
quickness, shooting strength. But the greatest asset for him is his 
character and mind-set. He wants to win every single drill, every 
single scrimmage and every single game he plays in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, there was El-Amin during the shootaround on Friday,  
urging his teammates on in a mock 3-point shooting contest. 
``C'mon, y'all! Two more!'' he shouted, raising his arms in triumph 
when his group won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody looks forward to a matchup with another great guard or  
another great competitive person,'' El-Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, the transfer who followed O'Brien from Boston College,  
shot only 37 percent in the Buckeyes' eight losses this season. He 
is nearly single-handedly responsible for Ohio State's emergence 
from the wreckage of an 8-22 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
	While at BC, Penn played UConn twice and had mediocre games. He  
was 4-for-10 with 12 points in a loss in 1997 and 3-for-9 for 10 
points in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the matchup between Khalid and myself,'' Penn said. ``I  
don't see it as an advantage because I've been hot lately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun has a major decision to make when it comes to guarding  
Penn and Michael Redd, the Buckeyes' leading scorer. Which one 
should defensive stopper Ricky Moore defend? 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun would be crazy to tip his hand, but one scenario has  
Moore, who is 6-2, guarding Redd, who is 6-6. His other option is 
to put the 6-foot-6 Richard Hamilton on Redd. But Hamilton is the 
Huskies' leading scorer, and asking him to shut down the Buckeyes' 
top scoring threat might be too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore held Michigan State point guard Mateen Cleaves to six  
points on 2-for-15 shooting in an 82-68 UConn victory in the Great 
Eight in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 27 years, I've never had anybody -- and I've had some great  
defenders -- that could literally tear the head off a dragon,'' 
Calhoun said. ``He's played kids from 5-6 to 6-8, and he's done an 
incredible job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin is coming off an 0-for-12 catastrophe in the Huskies'  
victory over Gonzaga in the West Regional final. Like any big-game 
shooter, El-Amin didn't need long to wipe the game from his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he walked off the floor, he hugged me for 10 seconds,''  
Calhoun said. ``Never, ever has there been even a hint of him ever 
caring about himself and not the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a lot more to the matchup between Connecticut (32-2) and  
Ohio State (27-8) than the history between Calhoun and O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why O'Brien made it a point to bring up his 18-game  
losing streak to Calhoun during his news conference on Friday. It 
was a deft preemptive strike for O'Brien, who lost 20 of 23 to 
Calhoun while at Boston College. Both are coaching in their first 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know somebody is going to ask about the 18 straight losses  
to Jim Calhoun, so we might as well talk about it right this 
minute,'' said O'Brien, revealing how Calhoun greeted him, Duke 
coach Mike Krzyzewski and Michigan State coach Tom Izzo the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he sees all of us, he sees Tom and he says, `Tom, it's  
nice to see you. Mike, it's nice to see you. Jim, it's REALLY nice 
to see you.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said the relevancy of his streak is ``nonexistent.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who have the ball in their hands the most control  
the game,'' he said. ``You are not going to get here without having 
that kind of player, a guy who controls the ball.''

<HEADLINE> NY Cops Charged in Diallo Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers who shot and killed  
an unarmed black immigrant have been charged with second-degree 
murder in a case that has led to days of protests and hundreds of 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges in a sealed grand jury indictment were confirmed  
Thursday by a source close to the case who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. Spokespersons for police and prosecutors declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea, was  
killed Feb. 4 outside his Bronx home, struck by 19 of the 41 
bullets fired at him. Police said officers Sean Carroll, Kenneth 
Boss, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy were searching for a rape 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officers also face lesser charges, the source said. They  
were assigned paid desk duty during the investigation and have not 
commented publicly. Lawyers said they declined to testify before 
the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Stephen Worth has said the policemen fired  
because they thought Diallo was reaching for a gun. Marvyn 
Kornberg, a lawyer for Carroll, said he had not been notified of 
the indictment but was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``As sure as I was that he was going to be indicted, that's how  
sure I am that he's going to be acquitted,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting has strained relations between the minority  
community and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has been criticized as 
not being sensitive to community concerns. It has also led to 
growing protests, including 13 consecutive days of demonstrations 
outside police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than 800 people arrested for disorderly conduct have  
included politicians, Jewish leaders, groups of seniors and youths 
and notables like National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People President Kweisi Mfume. Oscar-winning actress Susan 
Sarandon was arrested Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton said the demonstrations will go on, despite  
the indictments. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was expected at today's 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact of those demonstrations has mobilized this city in  
a most healthy way,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people cannot rest until the trial is over,'' he added.  
``Reverend Sharpton, the ministers, the rabbis and others are going 
to escalate their protests, which I fully support, until the 
madness ends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting is also under investigation by the Justice  
Department's civil rights division. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, second-degree murder is used in most homicide cases  
and implies a degree of intent to commit a felony. It carries a 
maximum prison sentence of 25 years to life.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Excused in Gay Slaying Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Two men who opposed the death penalty were  
dismissed as potential jurors in the first-degree murder trial of a 
man charged in the beating death of a gay college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen potential jurors were released Thursday from the trial  
of Russell Henderson, who faces the death penalty if convicted in 
the Oct. 6 attack on Matthew Shepard. More candidates were 
questioned today. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements are expected to begin April 6.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, are accused of luring  
Shepard out of a bar, pistol-whipping him and tying him to a fence. 
The University of Wyoming student died a few days later. 
Authorities have said Shepard's sexuality was a factor in the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men face murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery charges.  
McKinney will be tried in August. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has been complaining about his treatment in the county  
jail. His attorneys have alleged that he is being treated more 
harshly than other inmates, that visitation by family members has 
been restricted and that he was denied athletic shoes his father 
attempted to drop off.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Silva Out for Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander Jose  
Silva, struck in the face by a line drive earlier this week, won't 
be able to pitch in game conditions for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva could be ready to pitch 3-4 days after the season begins,  
depending on how quickly the injury heals, so he may not have to go 
on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	One option for Silva to keep his arm in shape might be to throw  
batting practice or practice games from behind a protective screen 
at the Pirate City minor league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a two-week period in which the doctors say he must be  
careful,'' Pirates trainer Kent Biggerstaff said. ``That means what 
they said: He can't do anything that might cause it (the injury) to 
worsen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silva was hit in the right cheekbone by a line drive Wednesday  
while pitching at Pirate City. The Pirates were off that day, but 
Silva pitched so he could stay on his normal throwing schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The right side of Silva's face was badly swollen and his right  
eye was bloodshot Friday before the Pirates' pregame workout, but 
he should be able to throw softly on the sidelines as early as 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva would have been more badly injured if he didn't have a  
steel plate in his face from a 1994 traffic accident, Biggerstaff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any bones that might have been broken were already protected  
by metal,'' Biggerstaff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates probably won't try to rig up a protective face mask  
or shield that might allow Silva to throw without a screen because 
of a prior neck injury. He suffered a fractured jaw, nose and both 
eye orbits in the 1994 auto accident, which sidelined him for all 
but three minor-league games in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva isn't an established pitcher yet in the majors, but he is  
one of the unluckiest. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Pirates' best starting pitcher early last season,  
going 6-3 with a 3.44 ERA in his first 15 starts, until breaking 
his right arm while bunting June 16 in Philadelphia. He missed the 
next three months of the season and was ineffective after returning 
in September, losing his final four decisions as his ERA climbed to 
4.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he returns, Silva is expected to be the No. 4 starter in  
the Pirates' rotation behind Francisco Cordova, Jason Schmidt and 
Pete Schourek. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have a five-man rotation, but may need only four  
starters until late April because they have four off days during 
the first three weeks of the season. Chris Peters or rookie Kris 
Benson, who has an 0.50 ERA this spring, could move into the 
rotation until Silva is ready.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Talks To Begin Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after an embarrassing disclosure about a  
secret offer from Microsoft Corp. to settle its antitrust trial, 
the lead attorney general for the 19 states in the case wasn't 
taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from a private meeting Thursday in Washington to  
discuss upcoming Microsoft negotiations with the other attorneys 
general, Iowa's Tom Miller declined even to confirm that the 
subject of their meeting was, in fact, Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	There was only one problem: Someone else had taped a sign on the  
door, ``Microsoft Meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge facing Miller and the other attorneys general to  
negotiate strictly in confidence will only get worse early next 
week, as both Microsoft and the government weigh the seriousness of 
the approaching talks in one of the most high-profile business 
lawsuits in a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side wants to derail a possible agreement, however  
unlikely. But the Justice Department and the attorneys general 
bitterly resent that Microsoft might tender an overture purely to 
defuse its famously aggressive image, score favor with the judge 
and make the government look obstinate. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alternately declined to confirm even what  
appeared to be painfully obvious -- such as Miller's no-comments 
outside the room with the ``Microsoft Meeting'' sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, just moments later, New Mexico's attorney general openly  
revealed that negotiations with Microsoft will begin in earnest on 
Tuesday. Patricia Madrid, who volunteered that Microsoft had 
supported her opponent in her campaign, also indicated that the 
government will make a counteroffer but didn't disclose details. 
</P>
<P>
	``All settlement talks involve proposals and counterproposals,''  
said Madrid, elected last November after the trial started. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys general met at a downtown hotel this week to  
discuss a four-page proposal Microsoft sent in its opening bid to 
settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Odds of any settlement remain slim. Like the initial versions of  
its software, Microsoft's first proposal was described as less than 
adequate. An industry axiom holds that the company's products are 
unusable until their third generation. 
</P>
<P>
	California Attorney General William Lockyer dismissed  
Microsoft's proposal as ``a minimalist offer'' and called it ``far 
from what anyone in our group would expect to be adequate'' before 
Miller and others urged him not to discuss it further. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has indicated it would consider changing some of its  
most controversial agreements with computer makers and Internet 
providers, such as letting computer companies hide easy access to 
the Internet software bundled with its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft won't accept restrictions on what new features it  
can add to Windows, used to run roughly 90 percent of the world's 
personal computers. The government accuses the company of illegally 
using Windows' dominance to extend its considerable influence into 
new areas of technology and crush fledgling rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft declined Thursday to discuss details of the pending  
negotiations, saying ``all the parties need to treat them as 
confidential'' if they were to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, in a lengthy recess, is tentatively scheduled to  
resume April 12 but may not continue until mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares climbed Thursday to a record high of $180, up  
more than 5 percent. It previously announced a 2-for-1 stock split 
will occur Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The states suing Microsoft are California, Connecticut, Florida,  
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. South Carolina 
dropped out of the case.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 14.15 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices drifted lower in sluggish trading  
Friday, as investors adjusted their holdings before the end of the 
quarter and kept an eye on NATO air strikes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 14.15 at 9,822.24,  
erasing most of an early 89-point loss. The Dow ended the week down 
81.31 points, having succumbed to light profit-taking after 
repeatedly hitting 10,000 in intraday trading last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators declined after a brief rally in  
technology shares lost steam. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 7.19 
to 1,282.80. The Nasdaq composite declined 15.63 to 2,419.17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything seems a little heavy today,'' said Hank Herrmann,  
chief investment officer at Wadell &AMP; Reed in Overland Park, Kan. 
``Bonds rolled over, and the tech world is heavy, and I just think 
it's tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market had advanced Thursday partly on relief about  
the military action in Kosovo. But investors were uneasier Friday. 
Stock prices fell in the morning after NATO aircraft and missiles 
hit targets in Yugoslavia, directing much of their fire on Kosovo, 
where fighting continued between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices also eased amid caution about Kosovo, pushing the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 5.59 percent from 5.58 
percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worrying about what could happen over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the people who believed that one or two air strikes in  
Kosovo would solve our problems over there are having second 
thoughts,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``Now many people are concerned with whether or not we will 
have to commit ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the quarter next Wednesday also affected trading, as  
institutional investors such as mutual funds buffed up their 
portfolios before having to show them to clients. Some analysts 
expect that last-minute window-dressing to send stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still money in the hands of these money managers that  
has to be spent over the next couple of days,'' said Ricky 
Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Among technology stocks, IBM rose 1 1/16 to 172 3/8, while Compaq  
and Dell Computer also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Big losers among the Dow components were Goodyear, down 2 3/16  
to 49 11/16. The Akron, Ohio tire and chemical maker said it will 
expand a Canadian passenger tire plant and increase production 
capacity by 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, another Dow stock, fell 2 3/16 to 80 3/8. But Allied Signal  
rose 2 3/8 to 50 3/8. The company's truck brake systems subsidiary formed 
an alliance with Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. to make a new 
generation of anti-lock breaking systems. Delphi stock eased 1/16 
to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume was moderate at 
851.9 million shares and down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.51 to 602.35, but the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.34 to 718.74. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.93 to 393.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent,  
Germany's DAX index fell 1.75 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
0.89, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Enters Coffee Bar Craze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Forget the morning ``cuppa.''  
</P>
<P>
	Increasing numbers of Britons, forsaking their traditional cup  
of breakfast tea, are lining up at coffee bars to order the likes 
of a semi-skimmed cappuccino with a double shot of espresso. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to cash in on explosive growth in British coffee bars,  
McDonald's Corp. has become the latest U.S. heavyweight to enter 
the market here. 
</P>
<P>
	The hamburger and french fry giant has purchasedAroma Ltd., a  
chain of 23 shops that sell coffee concoctions and sandwiches in a 
lively atmosphere of recorded Caribbean music and bright yellow and 
orange decor. The deal, announced Thursday, is reportedly worth 
between $16 million and $24 million, and marks the first time 
McDonald's has ever invested in anything but a hamburger chain 
outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics are scarce, but the number of tony coffee bars in  
Britain has proliferated in the past three years, particularly in 
London and the more cosmopolitan southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	They appeal to a young, professional crowd, and their popularity  
reflects a change toward a faster-paced lifestyle -- one in which 
people want a good-tasting jolt of caffeine and a cafe setting in 
which to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Britain, tea has always been the big drink. It's a very  
homely drink, much more than coffee. People associate English 
afternoon cream tea with their granny,'' said Sara Jenkins, a 
marketing assistant with Pret A Manger (Europe) Ltd. -- a coffee and 
snack chain of that aims to serve each customer in less than 90 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-steeped cup of tea with milk still has its loyalists, and  
tourists can indulge in the ritual of afternoon tea at London's 
fancier hotels. But coffee bars, which have been around for 
decades, began taking off in the 1990s. Much of the spark for their 
growth has come from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks Coffee Co. blazed a trail across Britain last year,  
when it paid $87 million for a chain of 56 coffee shops founded by 
a pair of expatriates from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Costa Ltd., one of the first British coffee chains, was started  
by two Italian brothers. Aroma was founded in 1991 by a Swiss 
businessman frustrated by his difficulty in finding a good cup of 
coffee at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more European. People like someplace they can just drop  
in and spend 20 minutes or an hour, read the newspaper and have a 
coffee,'' said Lizzie Baldwin, 34, as she and her 12-year-old son, 
Joshua, polished off a pair of cappuccinos at a downtown Aroma shop 
for about $2.25 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
	For some people, the new wave of British coffee bars offers what  
sociologists call the ``third place'' -- a place other than home or 
the workplace where people can meet and relax. Their attraction 
seems especially strong for women, shop owners say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The traditional British pub has been at the center of society  
as a meeting place, but it's a male society. The coffee shop is a 
lot less threatening for women,'' said Andrew Barrett, a director 
with APAX Partners and Co., the former majority owner of Aroma. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's first coffee bars cropped up some 40 years ago, many  
of them run by immigrants from Italy and Greece. Groups of mods, 
the stylish youths who built a 1960s cult around motor scooters and 
amphetamines, gathered at them much as American teen-agers spent 
long evenings at drive-ins and pizza joints. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys to the modern coffee bar's success is the  
customer's feeling that each cup of coffee has been custom-made. At 
Costa Ltd., a chain of 140 shops, employees brew coffee to order 
from imported beans that the company roasts itself, said managing 
director Mike Dowell. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a stiff price of $1.60 to $2.00 for a small cup of black  
coffee, shops in downtown London do a brisk business each weekday 
morning. At some of them, cappuccinos are the most popular hot 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still not like the States. But you do see a few people  
carry take-out coffee, which 10 years ago you wouldn't have seen at 
all,'' Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before purchasing Aroma, McDonald's had bought a stake in only  
one other business outside its traditional fast-food fare -- a 
restaurant chain in Denver called Chipotle Mexican Grill. 
McDonald's expects Aroma to complement its strengths in 
family-style fast food with a more adult-oriented fare, said Eddie 
Bensilum, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to say whether the company plans, like Starbucks, to  
use Britain as a jumping-off point to expand into continental 
Europe. Either way, coffee bars in this country have yet to reach 
their full potential, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks employees still laugh about the day they opened their  
first shop in Manchester, Britain's second-largest city, said Lisa 
Doncaster, a store manager in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first customer came in,'' she said, ``and all he wanted  
was a cup of tea. Which he got, of course.''

	NATO Shoots Down 2 MiGs Over Bosnia  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO forces shot down two Yugoslav  
MiG-29 fighters today as they attempted to strike NATO-led 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. He 
said the pilots of the two MiGs were captured by Stabilization 
Force troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that allied air operations 
were continuing over Yugoslavia. It was not immediately known if 
the MiGs were shot down by allied aircraft or from the ground. 
NATO's goal is to force President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a 
peace deal for Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Serbs Free Dutch Reporter  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Serb authorities freed a Dutch television  
reporter and her cameraman today following a chaotic day in which 
journalists scrambled out of Yugoslavia -- or were forcibly removed 
-- after an expulsion order by Serbia. Catharina Cornely La Porte 
and her Hungarian cameraman, Zoltan Olah, were released after 
Yugoslav President Milosevic intervened, a spokesman for Dutch TV 
station Net 5, said. The government of Yugoslavia said journalists 
can stay, as long as they are objective. But the Serb government 
ordered journalists out, saying they had aided NATO's campaign.

	Russian Demands To End Bombing Fail  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia failed today to muster enough  
support to pass a resolution in the U.N. Security Council demanding 
that NATO stop bombing Yugoslavia. Only three of the council's 15 
members raised their hands in support of the Russian initiative, 
ensuring the measure's defeat even before the United States, 
Britain and France got a chance to veto it, as they did. Russia had 
forced the council to take up its resolution to press its case that 
NATO intervention against its allies in Belgrade was illegal 
because the Security Council hadn't specifically authorized it.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will travel to the  
United States next month for meetings with President Clinton, the 
White House announced today. Zhu's visit is coming at a time of 
heightened expectations that the United States and China may 
finally be able to reach agreement on trade initiatives that will 
clear the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. 
However, the discussions are occurring at a time of increased 
tensions over China's record on human rights and allegations of 
Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear laboratories.

	Rubin Criticizes GOP Tax Plans

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin criticized  
Republicans today for planning to use large parts of expected 
federal surpluses for a tax cut, saying they would squander a 
chance to strengthen the economy and buttress federal retirement 
programs. Rubin spoke a day after the House and Senate approved 
similar GOP-written budgets for fiscal 2000 calling for $778 
billion in tax reductions over the next decade. Rubin did not say 
President Clinton would veto a tax bill that large. But his 
comments underlined the administration's preference to use large 
parts of projected surpluses for more domestic spending and a 
smaller tax cut.

Four averaging 17.8 points and 9.6 rebounds for the top-ranked Blue 
Devils, who have won a school-record 31 consecutive games. Ellis

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 14.15 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices drifted lower in sluggish trading  
Friday, as investors adjusted their holdings before the end of the 
quarter and kept an eye on NATO air strikes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 14.15 at 9,822.24,  
erasing most of an early 89-point loss. The Dow ended the week down 
81.31 points, having succumbed to light profit-taking after 
repeatedly hitting 10,000 in intraday trading last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators declined after a brief rally in  
technology shares lost steam. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 7.19 
to 1,282.80. The Nasdaq composite declined 15.63 to 2,419.17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything seems a little heavy today,'' said Hank Herrmann,  
chief investment officer at Wadell &AMP; Reed in Overland Park, Kan. 
``Bonds rolled over, and the tech world is heavy, and I just think 
it's tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market had advanced Thursday partly on relief about  
the military action in Kosovo. But investors were uneasier Friday. 
Stock prices fell in the morning after NATO aircraft and missiles 
hit targets in Yugoslavia, directing much of their fire on Kosovo, 
where fighting continued between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices also eased amid caution about Kosovo, pushing the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 5.59 percent from 5.58 
percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worrying about what could happen over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the people who believed that one or two air strikes in  
Kosovo would solve our problems over there are having second 
thoughts,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``Now many people are concerned with whether or not we will 
have to commit ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the quarter next Wednesday also affected trading, as  
institutional investors such as mutual funds buffed up their 
portfolios before having to show them to clients. Some analysts 
expect that last-minute window-dressing to send stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still money in the hands of these money managers that  
has to be spent over the next couple of days,'' said Ricky 
Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Among technology stocks, IBM rose 1 1/16 to 172 3/8, while Compaq  
and Dell Computer also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Big losers among the Dow components were Goodyear, down 2 3/16  
to 49 11/16. The Akron, Ohio tire and chemical maker said it will 
expand a Canadian passenger tire plant and increase production 
capacity by 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, another Dow stock, fell 2 3/16 to 80 3/8. But Allied Signal  
rose 2 3/8 to 50 3/8. The company's truck brake systems subsidiary formed 
an alliance with Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. to make a new 
generation of anti-lock breaking systems. Delphi stock eased 1/16 
to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume was moderate at 
851.9 million shares and down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.51 to 602.35, but the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.34 to 718.74. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.93 to 393.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent,  
Germany's DAX index fell 1.75 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
0.89, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Nissho Iwai Retrenching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai Corp. will  
sell its 5.2 percent stake in the package delivery company DHL 
International Ltd. to raise money after what is expected to be a 
huge loss at Nissho Iwai this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissho Iwai also announced today that its president, Masatake  
Kusamichi, will resign to take responsibility for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissho Iwai will sell its DHL stake back to the company for $73  
million, and expects to earn $42 million on the sale. DHL 
International's parent, DHL Worldwide Express, is based in Redwood 
City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fiscal year ending on March 31, Nissho Iwai estimates it  
will lose $669 million, much of it due to poor stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissho Iwai, Japan's sixth largest consolidated trading company,  
is an international wholesaler of everything from lumber to 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiro Yasutake, now Nissho Iwai's managing director, will  
succeed the outgoing president, who will stay with the company as 
an adviser and member of the board of directors.

<HEADLINE> Juice Co. Seeks Address Name Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACO, Maine (AP) -- Fresh Samantha Inc., the fast-growing company  
that makes healthful fruit juices with funky cartoon labels, is 
worried that its not-so-natural sounding address conveys an image 
of smokestacks and chain-link fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the address, 84 Industrial Park Road, is printed on  
every bottle, company officials are hoping the city of Saco, Maine, 
will help them find a more appetizing alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think of us as this all-natural, no preservatives, no  
concentrates company, which we are,'' said Fresh Samantha 
spokeswoman Betta Stothart. ``But we're located on this Industrial 
Park Road, which doesn't sound very attractive and it doesn't 
really apply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, because the city was planning to expand the industrial  
park to Springhill Road, Fresh Samantha suggested that the City 
Council adopt that name. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members rejected that idea, however, citing the costs of  
changing street signs, city maps and letterheads of every company 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Fresh Samantha says it may seek the council's permission to  
name its driveway as a private road and use that as its address. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the suggested names: Fresh Samantha Way and Yumdillishous  
Way, the latter being one of the trademark sayings that appear on 
most Fresh Samantha labels. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials seem receptive. ``As long as it's legal, I don't  
see any problem with it,'' Mayor William Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven years, Fresh Samantha has grown from a seller of bean  
sprouts to a $38 million company, expanding into such markets as 
New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	While no customers have complained about the current address,  
``as our product gets farther away from Maine, people don't have a 
real idea of what we're about as a company,'' Stothart said.

<HEADLINE> Walter Payton Delivers Pep Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISLE, III. (AP) -- An upbeat Walter Payton kept his promise and  
delivered a long-distance motivational speech Thursday, calling 
area business leaders from a Minnesota hotel room near the clinic 
where he receives treatment for a liver disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing good,'' Payton told the audience by telephone. ``My  
weight and energy have come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears Hall of Famer was calling from Rochester,  
Minn., where he is being treated at the Mayo Clinic for a rare 
disease that can be corrected only by a liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his illness was discovered, Payton had agreed to be the  
keynote speaker at an expo here. He had planned to attend the event 
as recently as last week, but said his doctor wanted him to come to 
the clinic for a bone scan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just taking tests,'' Payton said. ``There are a lot of  
things you have to go through before things can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton said he found it awkward making his remarks via telephone  
because he was unable to gauge the response of his audience. As it 
turned out, the audience's reaction was as enthusiastic as Payton's 
pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, individuals shared their favorite memories of  
Payton's NFL career and commended him for his courage in the face 
of a life-threatening condition. In return, the ex-running back 
displayed the winning attitude that led to his success on the 
football field as well as in the corporate board room. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what you do, you can always do it better,'' said  
Payton, whose many business ventures include night clubs and Indy 
race cars. ``Customer satisfaction is as important as prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton also spoke of the importance of family and raising  
children. He said he was particularly impressed with public 
reaction to the news of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's been uplifting,'' he said. ``It's humbling. The  
reason I'm doing so well is because of the prayers that God has 
heard for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That Payton had to speak to them long-distance had a moving  
effect on many who heard his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw teary eyes,'' said Shane Beard, chairman of the expo.  
``Perhaps it was more inspiring with him being where he was -- more 
so than if he were actually here.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Awarded in Mastectomy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When JoAnne Motichka's mastectomy-scarred chest  
graced the cover of The New York Times Magazine, it was, in part, a 
tribute to women who have survived one of life's greatest traumas. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the 45-year-old photographer-artist, known  
professionally as ``Matuschka,'' it was a trauma she didn't have to 
endure. On Friday a jury agreed, awarding her $2.2 million after 
determining that a doctor removed her breast unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the award, she said simply: ``I would rather have  
my breast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the defendant, Dr. Hiram S. Cody, argued that the  
doctor told Matuschka enough for her to make an informed decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the law and the facts, we are very confident that the  
jury's verdict will be overturned on appeal,'' David Richmond said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Matuschka said Dr. Hiram S. Cody found a malignant lump, a  
little smaller than a penny, in her breast. However, she said the 
doctor mistakenly exaggerated her condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said I had intraductal carcinoma and needed a mastectomy  
immediately. There was no discussion of any other treatment 
possibility,'' Matuschka said. 
</P>
<P>
	She underwent a mastectomy in June 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	It was in later conversations with Cody and other doctors that  
Matuschka learned that a lumpectomy, surgery in which only the 
cancerous lump is removed, might have been sufficient, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matuschka's experience turned her into an activist for breast  
cancer awareness. She became famous for her graphic sculptures and 
self-portraits, including the award-winning photograph of her 
surgically mutilated chest that appeared on The New York Times 
Magazine on Aug. 13, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The title of her forthcoming biography, ``You Can't Look Away  
Any More,'' provided the headline over the magazine article.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Questioned on IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two congressional leaders asked President  
Clinton on Friday why he hasn't extended federal anti-bribery laws 
to the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Tom Bliley, chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and  
Michael Oxley, head of its finance subcommittee, noted that the 
White House was asked almost a month ago by the U.S. Olympic 
Committee to include the IOC under the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	That request came as an independent USOC investigation, headed  
by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, concluded that 
the IOC fostered a ``culture of improper gift-giving'' that led to 
a multimillion-dollar vote-buying scheme in Salt Lake's successful 
quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent events regarding the ethical lapses concerning the  
IOC raise serious questions that must be addressed promptly,'' 
Bliley, R-Va., and Oxley, R-Ohio, wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying they were ``shocked and discouraged'' by the revelations  
of cash, scholarships, medical treatment and other inducements for 
IOC members from Salt Lake bidders, the lawmakers asked the 
president what steps he had taken to make such actions illegal and 
make sure other nations did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	They gave Clinton until April 13 to either add the IOC to the  
organizations covered by federal international business bribery 
laws or tell them why he had failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
	They also asked him to list what countries the White House had  
contacted to try to have them adopt similar codes ``so as to make 
bribery of an IOC official illegal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley and Oxley were primary House architects of the foreign  
bribery laws last year and said Clinton could cover the IOC through 
a stroke of a pen on an executive order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fairness, clear rules and objectivity are critical in the  
sporting world,'' their letter said. ``The Olympic spirit reflects 
the highest ideals in this respect, or at least it should. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athletes spend years of hard work in training in order to  
pursue the Olympic dream. Their tireless dedication to excellence 
should not be sullied by corruption, or by acquiescence to 
corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter from the House members was the latest step by federal  
agencies into the Olympic bribery case, the worst scandal in the 
history of the world's biggest sports event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and the FBI are investigating possible  
violations of federal fraud and tax laws, and the Senate Commerce 
Committee has scheduled hearings on the scandal for April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending Senate legislation also would strip the IOC's tax-exempt  
status in the United States, limit the amount of Olympic fees 
sponsors could deduct and place U.S. TV rights fees -- the single 
biggest source of Olympic income -- with the USOC instead of the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC expelled six members last week for accepting bribes and  
started the action on what it described as a series of long-range 
reforms, including a task force to restructure the committee and 
membership.

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw, Peck Earn AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw is leaving Tennessee  
with a lot more in her resume than she expected when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came into Tennessee my freshman year, I said OK,  
hopefully I can play,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I'm going to work hard 
enough to play. Hopefully I can help the team, average 10 points or 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Help the team? Well, Holdsclaw certainly did that. She led  
Tennessee to three national championships and became a first-team 
All-American three times. On Thursday, she became the first woman 
to win The Associated Press player of the year award twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw was an overwhelming choice for the honor in voting by  
AP newspaper and broadcast members nationwide. Purdue's Carolyn 
Peck, who has her team in contention for the national championship 
in just her second season, was named the coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor. It's very exciting,'' Peck said. ``But  
I've got to give credit to my team and my staff. It's been a 
complete team effort the last two years. Any coach who walked into 
the situation I did with the players I had would be blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the most decorated player of her era, also won The AP  
award as a junior last season, when she led Tennessee to a 39-0 
record and its third straight national championship. The Lady Vols 
fell one game short of returning to the Final Four this year, 
losing to Duke in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw, so fluid that she makes the game  
seem effortless, still had an outstanding season. 
</P>
<P>
	She led Tennessee in scoring (21.3) and rebounding (8.1), shot  
52 percent from the field and left thousands of admiring fans 
something to remember by matching her career high of 39 points in 
her final home game, an 89-62 victory over Boston College in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw finished with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, No. 1  
on Tennessee's career list in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been so special,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.  
``She has been a low-maintenance player because she does the right 
things off the floor. She makes good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a joy and an honor to coach Chamique, and I have  
to throw in every once in a while that it has been a challenge,'' 
Summitt said. ``But I like the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for Summitt was to take a great player and help  
make her even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I challenged myself immediately when she signed with  
us,'' Summitt said. ``Because I saw this potential for greatness. I 
don't know if I envisioned three national championships and the 
level of notoriety that Chamique received. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did envision someone very special. So I was very  
challenged because I knew all eyes would be on this player and the 
development of this player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck will join the WNBA's Orlando Miracle as coach and general  
manager when the college season ends, but she has done far more 
than just go through the motions as a lame-duck coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history and  
will take a 32-1 record and 30-game winning streak into the 
national semifinals against Louisiana Tech tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been easy for Peck to coast this season, but  
that's not her style. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask so much of our players,'' she said. ``To feel as a  
staff we were not working as hard as we possibly could would have 
been a disservice to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck counts Summitt among her influences after spending two  
seasons as an assistant at Tennessee. She also spent one year on 
the staff at Kentucky and one season as an assistant to Nell 
Fortner at Purdue. When Fortner left to coach the U.S. national 
team, Peck was promoted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the combination of all of that, plus the staff I have,  
has helped me so much,'' Peck said. ``One thing I've found as a 
head coach, you don't have to feel like you've got to do it all by 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team effort. And I think when our team sees us work as  
a team, they work as a team as well.''

I've got to give credit to my team and my staff. It's been a 
complete team effort the last two years. Any coach who walked into 
the situation I did with the players I had would be blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the most decorated player of her era, also won The AP  
award as a junior last season, when she led Tennessee to a 39-0 
record and its third straight national championship. The Lady Vols 
fell one game short of returning to the Final Four this year, 
losing to Duke in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw, so fluid that she makes the game  
seem effortless, still had an outstanding season. 
</P>
<P>
	She led Tennessee in scoring (21.3) and rebounding (8.1), shot  
52 percent from the field and left thousands of admiring fans 
something to remember by matching her career high of 39 points in 
her final home game, an 89-62 victory over Boston College in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw finished with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, No. 1  
on Tennessee's career list in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been so special,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.  
``She has been a low-maintenance player because she does the right 
things off the floor. She makes good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a joy and an honor to coach Chamique, and I have  
to throw in every once in a while that it has been a challenge,'' 
Summitt said. ``But I like the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for Summitt was to take a great player and help  
make her even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I challenged myself immediately when she signed with  
us,'' Summitt said. ``Because I saw this potential for greatness. I 
don't know if I envisioned three national championships and the 
level of notoriety that Chamique received. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did envision someone very special. So I was very  
challenged because I knew all eyes would be on this player and the 
development of this player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck will join the WNBA's Orlando Miracle as coach and general  
manager when the college season ends, but she has done far more 
than just go through the motions as a lame-duck coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history and  
will take a 32-1 record and 30-game winning streak into the 
national semifinals against Louisiana Tech tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been easy for Peck to coast this season, but  
that's not her style. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask so much of our players,'' she said. ``To feel as a  
staff we were not working as hard as we possibly could would have 
been a disservice to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck counts Summitt among her influences after spending two  
seasons as an assistant at Tennessee. She also spent one year on 
the staff at Kentucky and one season as an assistant to Nell 
Fortner at Purdue. When Fortner left to coach the U.S. national 
team, Peck was promoted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the combination of all of that, plus the staff I have,  
has helped me so much,'' Peck said. ``One thing I've found as a 
head coach, you don't have to feel like you've got to do it all by 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team effort. And I think when our team sees us work as  
a team, they work as a team as well.''

<HEADLINE> China Seeks WTO Membership Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China is holding out the tantalizing prospect  
of opening its huge market to American manufacturers, farmers and 
financial firms in return for membership in the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between the United States and China over WTO  
membership, which have proceeded in fits and starts over the past 
13 years, have intensified in recent weeks even as anger over 
China's human rights record and alleged nuclear espionage have 
risen in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are struggling to complete a deal that could be used  
as the centerpiece for a visit next month by Chinese Premier Zhu 
Rongji. The White House announced Friday that Zhu will hold 
high-level talks with President Clinton on April 8 as part of a 
nine-day visit that will include stops in five other American 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu is anxious to capture the WTO prize that has long eluded  
China. U.S. officials say China's market-opening offers have 
improved considerably since Zhu became personally involved in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is seeking to break down sizable barriers to  
the sale of American exports of everything from wheat to cars to 
compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Clinton administration wants permission for  
American banks, investment houses and insurance companies to expand 
their Chinese operations in order to narrow a U.S. trade deficit 
with China that last year hit a record $57 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
China had made more progress in opening its markets in past month 
than it had in the past three years. But he said the administration 
feels much more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-level team led by U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Bob  
Cassidy is in Beijing and is expected to continue negotiations over 
the weekend. Commerce Secretary William Daley will arrive in 
Beijing on Monday, leading a trade mission that includes top U.S. 
business executives. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is thought likely  
to join the talks either in Beijing or when they move back to 
Washington as officials try to close a deal in the days before 
Zhu's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for a possible breakthrough, Barshefsky and other  
administration officials have been briefing members of Congress on 
the accelerated pace of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	But trade experts said they still believe a WTO deal this year  
would be a long shot, given the current deterioration in 
U.S.-Chinese relations, including recent allegations that Beijing 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been real progress in the negotiations in a number  
of areas,'' said Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the Economic 
Strategy Institute in Washington. ``But the environment is so bad 
right now that it will be a tremendous uphill political struggle to 
sell even a good agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO sets the rules for global trade. China first sought  
membership in 1986 in the WTO's predecessor organization, the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Negotiations for China's 
membership were nearly complete in 1989 when talks were put on hold 
following China's crackdown on the democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
	To gain WTO membership, China must satisfy the United States and  
other economic powers that it will play by global trade rules by 
opening up its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Chinese offers include proposals to cut high tariffs and  
other barriers restricting the sale of U.S.-manufactured goods and 
agriculture products such as wheat and citrus, to allow greater 
foreign ownership in such areas as telecommunications companies and 
to remove tight restrictions on operations by American banks. 
</P>
<P>
	For China, WTO membership would mean protection against  
unilateral trade sanctions imposed by the United States or other 
WTO members as well as the prestige of being at the table when the 
next round of global trade talks begins this coming November in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky said Chinese policy-makers would like WTO membership  
as a way to boost foreign investment, which has slowed dramatically 
in the wake of the Asian economic crisis, and to keep up the 
momentum for reform of outdated state-run enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these factors have combined to engender in China a  
seriousness of purpose that we have never seen before,'' she said 
in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Army Sec.: Hard To Reinstate Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reinstating a fair military draft to fill U.S.  
military ranks would be harder to do than in the past, and an 
unfair one might do more harm than good, Army Secretary Louis 
Caldera says. 
</P>
<P>
	Conscription also might not be practical, given lower manpower  
needs in the post Cold War era, the volunteer tradition that has 
developed since the draft ended 25 years ago and the high cost of 
training recruits, Caldera said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the National Press Club, the Army secretary said  
renewing the draft, which required two years of military service, 
is one possible response to the problems the armed forces are 
having in finding enough recruits to fill its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``By its very nature, the draft communicates that military  
service is everyone's obligation,'' Caldera said. ``And it might 
act as a leveling influence in the ranks and in other society,'' 
bringing together young people from differing backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the draft would have the added benefit of reducing the  
$100 million a year the Army spends in recruiting advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for today's Army,'' Caldera said, ``a draft may simply not  
be fair or practical'' because the armed forces do not need as many 
young people as they did during World War II. During the Vietnam 
War in the 1960s and 1970s only one in 10 of those eligible to 
serve did so, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, with our smaller post-Cold War armed forces, our  
stronger volunteer tradition and our need for longer terms of 
service to get a good return on the high, upfront training costs, 
it would be ever harder to fashion a fair draft,'' Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a draft that was regarded as unfair ``because too few  
are called, might harden feeling against the military and hurt 
rather than help raise the regard in which military service is 
held.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all male U.S. citizens and male aliens between 18 and 25  
years old living in the United States, must register with the 
Selective Service. But the United States has not drafted the 
nation's youth into the military since the Vietnam War ended.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Mrs. Clinton's Support Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New Yorkers aren't as hot on the idea of  
Hillary Rodham Clinton running for Senate as they were a month ago, 
according to a poll released today. 
</P>
<P>
	A Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll conducted  
among registered voters this week found 45 percent saying she 
should run, down from 56 percent last month. Another 49 percent of 
respondents thought she should not run, up from 37 percent in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The results mirror other polls that have found a decrease in  
public enthusiasm for a Senate bid by Mrs. Clinton following a 
spike of support when reports first circulated that she was 
considering a run for retiring U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of Marist poll respondents believed Mrs. Clinton  
would run. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 616 registered voters was conducted March 22-24. It  
has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is not expected to announce her intentions until  
this summer. The most prominent potential Republican contender, New 
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has not announced his plans 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marist poll found a potential matchup between the two  
continues to be close, with 48 percent for Mrs. Clinton and 46 
percent for Giuliani. That was statistically unchanged from a 
Marist poll released March 3 that found Mrs. Clinton with 50 
percent and Giuliani with 46 percent, but a drop-off from the first 
lady's leads of 53-42 in January and 49-38 in February in the same 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute released  
Tuesday found the first lady favored by 50 percent of registered 
voters surveyed to 39 percent for Giuliani. A Quinnipiac poll 
released a month ago had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani 54 percent 
to 36 percent.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Figure Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- There's more prison time in store for  
Whitewater figure David Hale, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pulaski County jury on Thursday convicted Hale of lying to  
regulators about the solvency of his burial insurance company and 
sentenced him to 21 days in prison. He could serve as little as 3 1/2 
days with good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was set for April 5. He had faced up to eight years  
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was convicted of putting $150,000 into the bank account of  
the National Savings Life Insurance Co. to show it was financially 
stable, then withdrawing the money days later and lying about it 
still later. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers said the infraction was a technicality and that  
no one lost money as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The former municipal judge said he would likely appeal, saying  
jurors unfairly considered his Whitewater crimes as part of his 
case. Defense lawyer David Bowden was against the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale pleaded guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and  
served 21 months of a 28-month sentence. He was a key witness 
against then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan McDougal at 
their 1996 fraud trial. All three were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougals were business partners with President Clinton and  
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater land development. Hale had 
once claimed Clinton pressured him to make an illegal loan. Clinton 
denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the insurance case, Hale testified that business dealings  
surrounding the operation of his burial insurance company were 
proper. But he acknowledged a long history of lying about his 
business operations.

<HEADLINE> K One King Eyes Gallery Stakes Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ky. (AP) -- K One King has done all his racing this  
year at Turfway Park rather than face Triple Crown prospects 
elsewhere. After Saturday, he could become a regular shipper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognized his ability a long time ago,'' said trainer Akiko  
Gothard, who likes the colt's chances in Saturday's $750,000 
Gallery Furniture.com Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1 1/8-mile race was known as the Jim Beam Stakes for 17 years  
until Houston furniture dealer Jim McIngvale took over sponsorship 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take him to other tracks for stakes races -- not  
because I didn't have confidence -- but I felt it was better for the 
horse to stay and to have other people come here to compete,'' 
Gothard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes to the Derby ... after the Derby we've got to ship  
him all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	K One King has four wins in six starts. He broke his maiden in  
October at Keeneland, then ran second in an allowance race at 
Churchill Downs and another at Turfway. Since then he's won three 
straight, including a $100,000 stakes on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	K One King is the Turfway oddsmaker's second pick at 3-1. The  
horse to beat is speedster Straight Man, trained by Bob Baffert and 
8-5 on the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight Man is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, who won't see  
the race live. They are in the United Arab Emirates to watch Silver 
Charm, their 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, try to 
repeat in the $5 million Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Gothard was born in Tokyo and has been training horses in  
Kentucky for three decades. She also runs a sales agency that buys 
horses for a predominately Japanese clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshiko Sato owned K One King until Madeleine Paulson, wife of  
Allen Paulson, bought him earlier this month for an a price 
believed to be between $1 million and $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Paulsons have owned many stakes winners, including  
the great Cigar, Mrs. Paulson's interest reinforced Gothard's 
belief that K One King is a legitimate Triple Crown contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knows racing very well, and knows horses,'' Gothard said.  
</P>
<P>
	K One King has shown a preference to lay off the pace and make a  
big stretch run. But along with raw ability, Gothard said the colt 
has the demeanor to be a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse doesn't get excited much about anything,'' she  
said. ``He's a very calm horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to take his temperature all the time because he'd lie  
down in his stall -- he'd be sleeping all the time,'' Gothard said. 
``I wondered if he may have a fever. We now know what he is, so we 
don't worry about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert will be flying back from Dubai to saddle Straight Man,  
who is 2-for-2 and has shown exceptional speed in both races at 
Santa Anita. Turfway often favors speed, although not as much as 
California tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the eight-horse field are Aly's Alley, who has not run  
as well as he did as a 2-year-old; Epic Honor, winner of two 
straight at San Francisco-area tracks; Lethal Instrument, runnerup 
to Straight Man in his last race; Machine to Tower, winner of three 
straight, including the Whirlaway Stakes at Aqueduct; and two Nick 
Zito-trained horses -- The Groom Is Red, 0-for-3 since the Champagne 
Stakes at Belmont Park in October, and Stephen Got Even, winner of 
two straight at Gulfstream Park.

<HEADLINE> Strongest Explosion Ever Observed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It happened a long time ago in a place far,  
far away, but a gamma ray burst detected in January was the most 
powerful explosion ever observed, releasing in just seconds an 
energy wave equal to billions of years of light from thousands of 
suns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of studies published today in the journal Science  
and next month in Nature, a team of international researchers say 
the explosion occurred 9 billion light-years from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Just what caused the explosion is still a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is probably something to do with massive stars,'' said S.  
George Djorgovski, a California Institute of Technology astronomer 
who is co-author of a study in Nature. ``The real truth is, we 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst was detected by Italian and U.S. science  
satellites that sent an alert to a network of ground instruments 
and telescopes. Within seconds, telescopes focused on the area of 
the sky where the burst originated and captured views in visible 
light. Later, more powerful telescopes photographed the explosion's 
afterglow. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert enabled astronomers, for the first time in history, to  
capture optical views of a gamma ray burst event as the detection 
was underway. Analyzing this light helped the scientists determine 
that the burst happened so far away that it took 9 billion years 
for the light to reach Earth. Light travels about 6 trillion miles 
a year in space. 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said an analysis of light and other energy spewing  
from the explosion suggests that for a very brief instant the 
explosion was more luminous and energetic than the whole rest of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the gamma rays were emitted equally in all directions,  
their energy would correspond to 10,000 times the energy emitted by 
our sun over its entire lifetime of about 5 billion years,'' he 
said in an interview. ``Yet the burst last only a few tens of 
seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said there is some evidence the energy was detected  
as a concentrated beam that was pointed at the Earth. A beam would 
give an impression of greater energy in the explosion, just as a 
flashlight beam focused on one spot appears to be brighter than an 
uncovered bulb that scatters the same amount of light in all 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the gamma ray energy were sent out in a beam, said  
Djorgovski, that would reduce the energy estimate only by a factor 
of 10 to 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would still be the most powerful explosion ever observed,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamma ray bursts were discovered in 1967, but the phenomenon  
remains mysterious. The bursts occur randomly across the sky 
several hundred times a year, lasting for only a few milliseconds 
to a few minutes. Because of the short duration, large telescopes 
in the past could not be focused in time to catch optical views. 
The satellite alert system now makes that possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said there have been more than 150 theories proposed  
to explain gamma ray bursts. The two leading ideas, he said, both 
involve massive stars. One theory proposes that the burst occurs 
when two massive stars merge and form a black hole. Another theory 
proposes that the energy eruption comes from a hypersupernova, a 
stellar explosion much larger than that of an ordinary supernova. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is perfectly possible that the source is even stranger and  
more unusual,'' said Djorgovski, ``but the circumstantial evidence 
suggests it involves massive stars.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Must Pay $9.3M Judgment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. must pay $9.3 million  
for failing to adequately promote and merchandise a cuddly European 
comic-book character called Marsupilami, a federal appeals court 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a  
judge's decision that Disney had broken its promise to make 
Marsupilami a star on network television and in store merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsupilami is a yellow and black animal, described as a cross  
between a mouse and a marsupial. It's featured in French-language 
comic books in France, Belgium and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Parent company Marsu in 1990 signed a contract giving Disney  
worldwide rights. The court said Disney spent years failing to meet 
its obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney failed to produce 13 promised half-hour animated films  
starring the character, never asked networks to show such films and 
used inexperienced executives for a poorly planned merchandising 
campaign, the court said in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney lawyer Michael Cardozo did not return a call Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, the California Division of Occupational  
Safety and Health fined Disneyland $12,500 for a Christmas Eve 
accident that killed a tourist waiting to board a cruise ride at 
the Anaheim amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
	The sailing ship Columbia wasn't properly tied off as it docked,  
whipping a 9-pound metal cleat out of the dock and into a crowd. 
Luan Phi Dawson, 33, of Duvall, Wash., was killed. His wife and 
another woman were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	There were ``serious violations'' in training and equipment at  
the ride, the agency said Thursday. The cleat wasn't enough to stop 
the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The park has announced five steps intended to improve safety at  
the ride, including new equipment and employee training.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Carrawell: Ghetto to Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Chris Carrawell plays a smooth game,  
even though it sometimes looks awkward, his bowed legs and high 
dribble producing a clumsy picture on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	But even more surprising is the story of how Carrawell journeyed  
from the ghettos of St. Louis to the quaint campus of Duke, called 
the ``Ivy League of the South.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People said I would be on the first train ride back home,''  
the 6-foot-6 junior forward said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	They couldn't have been more wrong. Carrawell has become one of  
the most valuable members of a team that has won 31 straight games 
and plays Michigan State in the semifinals Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the city, you don't learn the fundamentals,'' Carrawell  
said. ``I didn't learn the fundamentals of the game until I got 
here -- how to pivot correctly, how to ball fake. On the playground 
you just play. Everything is done off the dribble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the only lesson Carrawell missed. Three weeks ago, he  
was approached by a man before the Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament who said he was Carrawell's father. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't talked to him since then,'' Carrawell said. ``I just  
wanted to send a message like, `Don't come around when it gets 
good. Where were you when things were tough growing up in the inner 
city?' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like a thing where I'm mad at him, but it's like, `Be  
a real father, be a real man.''' 
</P>
<P>
	After the surprise meeting, Carrawell had a few rough games.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was like, `OK, I'm all right,' but naturally it's going to  
affect you,'' he said. ``I shook it off a little bit against 
Temple'' in the East Regional finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrawell said he learned other points about being a man on the  
playgrounds of a St. Louis housing project where he grew up. He 
often played for money against much older men. How much older? 
</P>
<P>
	``I could be 11, these guys 25 or 26 -- and that's no  
exaggeration,'' Carrawell said. ``These guys would play against you 
and beat you up. It's very physical, but you learn how to 
compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrawell said he favored UNLV growing up. He and his friends  
hated Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't believe that guys that have 3.0 GPAs could play  
like that. It was one of those things ... we were envious,'' 
Carrawell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Carrawell is making grades, averaging 9.8 points and 4.9  
rebounds, and regarded by the Duke coaches as an invaluable cog. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is one of the most versatile human beings around,''  
assistant coach Quin Snyder said. ``He is playing his `ghetto role' 
now, which is fine, but there is a lot more to Chris than anybody 
realizes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a fun guy to have a conversation with, he's  
unbelievably attentive. He's intelligent, he gets along with people 
from all different walks of life. He adds diversity to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so maybe it's not that great a surprise that one of  
Carrawell's best friends on the Duke team is Chris Burgess, a 
suburban kid from Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kind of jokes around and calls me the surfer guy and I joke  
around and call him the city rat,'' Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
	But once the ball goes up Saturday night, the only thing that  
will matter to both of them is the chance to win a national 
championship.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Demands To End Bombing Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia failed Friday to muster enough  
support to pass a resolution in the U.N. Security Council demanding 
that NATO stop bombing Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of the council's 15 members raised their hands in  
support of the Russian initiative, ensuring the measure's defeat 
even before the United States, Britain and France got a chance to 
veto it, as they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, China and Namibia voted in favor. All other 12 members  
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members of the council, including all five veto-wielding  
states, must vote in favor of a resolution in order for it to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia had forced the council to take up its resolution to press  
its case that NATO intervention against its allies in Belgrade was 
illegal because the Security Council hadn't specifically authorized 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian resolution states that NATO's action constituted a  
``flagrant violation'' of the U.N. Charter as well as a threat to 
international peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
	It demands an immediate halt to the NATO strikes and the urgent  
resumption of negotiations between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Law and lawlessness are in the balance today,'' Russian  
Ambassador Sergey Lavrov warned the council before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Urging the resolution's defeat, the deputy U.S. ambassador,  
Peter Burleigh, said the Russian claim that NATO's actions violated 
the U.N. charter ``turns the truth on its head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.N. charter does not sanction armed assaults upon ethnic  
groups, or imply that the international community should turn a 
blind eye to a growing humanitarian disaster,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia circulated the resolution Thursday to keep its campaign  
against NATO action in the diplomatic spotlight. Moscow, however, 
has offered its allies in Belgrade little tangible support other 
than threats to flout an international arms embargo and provide 
them with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	While several nations have agreed that the council should have  
authorized the intervention, many council members argued that 
intervention was necessary on an exceptional basis because of the 
humanitarian threat posed by the continued Serb offensive in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a council resolution was rejected by a lack of  
`yes' votes was on June 29, 1993, after the United States and 
non-aligned countries sponsored a resolution to exempt 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from an arms embargo on Yugoslavia. Six 
countries voted in favor and nine abstained.

<HEADLINE> Octuplet Family Accepts Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEAGUE CITY, Texas (AP) -- The seven surviving Houston octuplets  
and their parents received a new home Friday, courtesy of Federal 
National Home Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents, Nkem Chukwu and Iyke Louis Udobi, accepted the keys  
to the six-bedroom, 5,384-square-foot house at a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's finer inside than outside,'' Ms. Chukwu said.  
</P>
<P>
	The two-story home southeast of Houston was built in 1992 and is  
appraised at $274,000, according to county real estate records. 
Fannie Mae donated the home to a trust for the family after being 
approached by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The family plans to move in after the four octuplets who are  
still hospitalized are released. Three girls -- Gorom, Chidi and 
Chima -- and their brother, Ikem, are in serious but stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the octuplets -- Ebuka, Echerem and Jioke -- went home  
March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chukwu delivered Ebuka on Dec. 8 and the other seven on Dec.  
20. The eighth baby, Odera, died a week after birth.

<HEADLINE> General Cigar Sells Some Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- General Cigar is selling its lower-priced cigar  
business that includes brands like Tiparillo and White Owl to a 
Swedish company best known in the United States for Red Man chewing 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale announced Friday comes amid a slowdown in the dramatic  
growth of cigar sales during the mid-90s, a period that spawned 
fashionable cigar bars where men and women could savor a stogie 
despite tobacco's health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	General Cigar is selling what it calls its mass-market cigar  
business that also includes the Garcia y Vega and Tijuana Smalls 
brands to Swedish Match AB from Stockholm for $200 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish Match is among the world's biggest cigar makers but  
sells few cigars in the United States where it is better known for 
smokeless tobacco products like Red Man and Timberwolf. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the deal helped shares of both companies. General Cigar  
rose $1 a share, or by 10.5 percent, to $10.50 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, while the U.S. stock of Swedish Match gained 25 
cents a share to $33 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the sale are two General Cigar manufacturing plants  
in Dothan, Ala., and Santiago, Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The hundreds of employees at both plants are expected to  
continue to have jobs after Swedish Match takes control, said Edgar 
M. Cullman Jr., chief executive of General Cigar. 
</P>
<P>
	General Cigar is holding on to its premium cigar business  
including brands like Macanudo, Partagas, Punch and Hoyo de 
Monterrey that accounts for more than half of its overall sales and 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also keeping its Club Macanudo cigar bars in New York and  
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cigars sold in the United States surged 50.8  
percent between 1993 and 1997, including gains of 15.6 percent in 
1996 and 12.5 percent in 1997, according to John Maxwell, analyst 
for Davenport &AMP; Co. in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	But growth slowed to 3.5 percent in 1998, Maxwell said, and  
cigar sales revenue dipped to $1.705 billion from $1.720 billion in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it was just a fad,'' Maxwell said. ``Some cigars that  
were selling for a few bucks are now selling for about 30 cents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Cigar, however, has managed to sell more premium cigars  
even as such sales have fallen precipitously industrywide. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell said the industry sold 21.8 percent fewer premium cigars  
in the U.S. in 1998, but General Cigar sold 4.3 percent more last 
year and was the leader in the U.S. market for premium cigars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to concentrate on the premium cigar business where we  
have the great strength,'' Cullman told reporters and analysts in a 
telephone conference. ``We have been in the business of tobacco for 
long time and we think we know how to make a very good cigar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company sold the mass-market business because it had  
gone as far as it could on its own in getting its cigars on the 
shelves of larger retail chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Cullman conceded that cigar smoking ``has moderated considerably  
over the last 18 months.'' He said there have been ``hundreds of 
new brands'' introduced over the past five years and added ``there 
is an awful lot of product out there trying to find a smoker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that the brand names consumers already know remain  
valuable properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to use proceeds from the sale to reduce debt  
and make investments or buy other premium cigar businesses. Cullman 
said his company would be interested in Cuban cigar companies 
should the U.S. embargo on trade with the Caribbean nation be 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, New York-based General Cigar will  
continue to supply tobacco to Swedish Match for the brands being 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish Match's sales force, meanwhile, will start selling some  
General Cigar premium brands in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by regulators but is expected to  
close by the end of April, the companies said in a joint statement.

<HEADLINE> It's Duke and the Forgotten Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Signs and billboards all over  
Florida proclaim the arrival of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	What we really have here is Duke &AMP; the Forgotten Three.  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils can make their case as  
one of the best college teams ever by winning their third national 
championship this decade. But let's not forget, the Dukies have 
company. Michigan State, Connecticut and Ohio State get a chance, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4) play Duke (36-1) in the national semifinals  
on Saturday, and should not be taken lightly. Mateen Cleaves, 
toughness personified, has never met a pressure shot he didn't want 
to take. Like Magic Johnson 20 years ago, Cleaves needs to win. 
</P>
<P>
	For UConn (32-2), a national title is all Jim Calhoun needs to  
consummate his splendid run as coach of the Huskies. Standing in 
the way is Ohio State, which used a little infusion of BC to help 
it forget all about last year's 8-22 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim O'Brien's best move since going to Boston College and  
playing for Bob Cousy was bringing sensational guard Scoonie Penn 
with him when he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the Final Four teams have been here before, and  
Krzyzewski is making his eighth appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you get there, all bets are off,'' said Calhoun, whose  
teams lost in the regional final in 1990, '95 and '98. ``Now, very 
simply, you've got to make that one more stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some might say that another way to spell Duke is U-N-L-V.  
Krzyzewski has consciously avoided comparisons with -- or even the 
mention of -- the heavily favored 1991 UNLV team that his Blue 
Devils upset in the national semifinal before claiming Coach K's 
first championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never talked to them about the '91 Vegas team,''  
Krzyzewski said. ``Don't believe everything you read in the papers, 
OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Krzyzewski wants to save the talk about Duke's place  
in history for later; Monday night, about midnight or so, at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's for somebody else to decide,'' he said. ``It would be  
really dumb of me to even be thinking of those things right now, 
because we're going to have to play a hell of a game to beat 
Michigan State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What of Duke's 31-game winning streak, the devastating 3-point  
shooting of Trajan Langdon and the inside presence of Elton Brand? 
Well, Michigan State has won 22 in a row, losing by just six points 
(73-67) to Duke in December in the Great Eight. It was one of only 
two times the Blue Devils won by fewer than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're a much different team than they were the first  
time,'' Spartans coach Tom Izzo said. ``I don't mean with personnel 
or anything. Elton Brand didn't play well against us the first 
time, I don't know if it was us or them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane Battier has raised his game a couple of levels and Corey  
Maggette is raising his level a lot,'' he added. ``I think we're a 
different team and I think we're a lot better than we were then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun and O'Brien bring quite a history into their semifinal  
matchup on Saturday. When O'Brien was at Boston College, his teams 
lost 20 of 23 to Calhoun's Huskies during an 11-year span. The 
UConn jinx, as persistent as a New England Nor'easter, ended with 
18 straight losses before O'Brien left Boston College to take over 
the Buckeyes' sinking program in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (27-8) emerged from the wreckage of the Randy Ayers  
era under the leadership of Penn, the BC transfer who sat out last 
season. His matchup with UConn point guard Khalid El-Amin should be 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	Not coincidentally, UConn is 61-6 since El-Amin joined the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's uncanny how similar the point guards are,'' O'Brien said.  
``In their case, Richard Hamilton is the leading scorer, but Khalid 
is the leader. It's the same thing with us. ... Scoonie is the guy 
who makes us go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the way to the Final Four, where guys named Scoonie, Mateen  
and Khalid will try to prove that Duke isn't the only name in town.

<HEADLINE> No New Deal for Giants' J.T. Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Unable to reach a new contract  
agreement, the San Francisco Giants and J.T. Snow broke off talks 
Friday, raising the possibility the first baseman will become a 
free agent after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're locked in on four or five years. We're at three years  
and an option,'' Giants assistant general manager Ned Colletti 
said. ``We're not inclined to go any farther. They're not inclined 
to take any less so for now at least, we're going to put it 
aside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, who earned his fourth career Gold Glove award after  
committing just one error last season, gets $3 million this season, 
the last year of his current pact. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian Sabean and Colletti began talks several  
weeks ago with Snow's agent, Dan Horwits. 
</P>
<P>
	Their latest offer to Snow called for a three-year extension  
worth $16 million plus an option for a fourth year that would have 
been triggered automatically if Snow met certain performance 
clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Horwits insisted on a deal comparable to the $24  
million, four-year deal recently signed by Pittsburgh first baseman 
Kevin Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, 31, came to San Francisco two years ago in a trade with  
California. He hit .281 with a career-high 28 homers in 1997 but 
slumped to .248 with 15 homers last season while battling shoulder 
and wrist injuries for most of the season. He also was concerned 
about his terminally ill mother, who died last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all realize what I went through last year and if I  
had my normal amount of at bats, my numbers would have been right 
there,'' Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Snow abandoned switch-hitting after three straight  
years of hitting below .200 from the right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't make a stink about it,'' Snow said. ``I'm not going to  
make a big uproar. My contract is signed through 1999. I'm just 
going to go out and go about my business the way I always have, 
play every game hard.''

<HEADLINE> Comparison of Fiscal 2000 Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A comparison of the fiscal 2000 budgets proposed by President  
Clinton and House and Senate Republicans. Numbers are as calculated 
by the Congressional Budget Office, and may not add due to 
rounding: 
</P>
<P>
	--OVERALL: For 2000, Clinton would spend $1.79 trillion and raise  
$1.87 trillion in revenue for an $80 billion surplus. The House 
would spend $1.74 trillion and raise $1.88 trillion for a $141 
billion surplus. The Senate would spend $1.74 trillion and raise 
$1.87 trillion for a $135 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	--TAXES: Republicans would cut taxes next year by up to $15  
billion, and by $778 billion over the next decade. Clinton would 
cut taxes by $81 billion through 2009 but raise others -- chiefly on 
tobacco and businesses -- by $178 billion. Next year, he would raise 
some taxes by $15 billion and cut others by $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's tax cuts would be for child care, long-term health  
care, public school construction and other targeted purposes. 
Republicans have made no decisions but say they are considering 
reducing income-tax rates, taxes on some married couples, and other 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	--SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE: Neither side proposes revamping  
either program's revenues or benefits, which many experts say will 
be needed to prepare for the baby boomers' retirements beginning in 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would set aside about $1.65 trillion in Social Security  
surpluses over the next decade for debt reduction, which is 
supposed to strengthen the economy and make it easier for the 
government to raise money to pay benefits. He also would place 
Treasury bonds into the Social Security trust fund, which he says 
would extend the trust fund's solvency for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would leave all $1.8 trillion in Social Security  
surpluses envisioned for the next decade for debt reduction. That 
is more than Clinton, though he would set aside more than them over 
15 years. Both sides say the money would be available should 
bipartisan deals emerge to overhaul either program. 
</P>
<P>
	--DEFENSE AND DOMESTIC PROGRAMS: Clinton would spend $281 billion  
next year for defense, compared to $289 billion by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed $67 billion for education and job training, the  
same as Senate Republicans and $2 billion more than House 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would spend $25 billion for natural resources and  
environment, $3 billion more than Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would spend $27 billion for law enforcement, $3 billion  
more than Republicans.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T: No At Home-Road Runner Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T-controlled At Home, a leading provider of  
high-speed Internet access over cable TV lines, doesn't plan to 
merge with rival Road Runner despite persistent rumors about such a 
deal, a top AT&AMP;T executive said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it happening.'' said Leo Hindery, president and  
CEO of AT&AMP;T Broadband and Internet Services. ``I think there's been 
excessive, inappropriate and undue speculation this last week about 
them coming together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not on the table. It's not being discussed,'' Hindery  
added, responding to a question at a gathering of cable executives 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters later whether such a union would make sense,  
Hindery replied: ``It might.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T recently acquired cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. and  
as a result, TCI's controlling stake in At Home, which also is 
owned by Cox Communications and several other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Road Runner provides high-speed Internet access over cable TV  
lines, too. Its owners include Time Warner and MediaOne -- which on 
Monday entered into a deal to be taken over by Comcast Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Hindery expressed concerns about what he said was an  
increase of racist Web sites on Internet and children's exposure to 
them. He didn't offer a plan to address those concerns but 
suggested policy-makers look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindery, who said he's not a ``proponent of censorship'' noted  
that filtering or blocking technology can shield children from 
sites parents find offensive, but technology, he said, is not 
``foolproof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet breeds some of the most hateful, sexist, racist,  
bigoted, nasty stuff I've ever seen in my life,'' Hindery said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's got to be a way -- I don't know what it is-- that starts  
with some discussions at the policy-maker level here in Washington. 
There has got to be a way to hold people accountable for hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, Hindery told reporters he has no plans to  
jump ship to head up Seagram's entertainment division. ``I have a 
long-term contract with AT&AMP;T. ... I'm with AT&AMP;T.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that Hindery was  
approached for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	As for cable rates, which will be deregulated March 31, Hindery  
said: ``It would also be easy ... to raise our rates to levels that 
put the crucial price/value relationship in peril. But we cannot do 
that. And we must not.''

<HEADLINE> McKellen Takes Lewinsky to Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Ian McKellen, who missed out on an Oscar last  
week for his role in ``Gods and Monsters,'' arrived at the British 
premiere of his movie Thursday night with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at home and didn't have a date,'' explained the  
59-year-old actor. ``She was coming to London and I thought we want 
to give her a good welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair met at a post-Oscars party in Los Angeles, shortly  
after McKellen lost out on the Academy Award for best actor to 
Italian star Roberto Benigni, who won for his role in ``Life is 
Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gods and Monsters'' won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern, whose affair with President  
Clinton led to his impeachment, was in Britain for the second leg 
of a promotional tour for her book ``Monica's Story.''

<HEADLINE> New Browns Practice for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The orange helmets are back.  
</P>
<P>
	With no fanfare, just a barked command from the assistant  
coaches, ``helmets on -- buckle 'em up,'' the Cleveland Browns 
started their first practice in more than three years Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The no-pads workout was the first of five the expansion Browns  
will have at a minicamp which runs through Sunday. The team had a 
morning session Friday and another in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to be out there,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.  
``We've been in the paperwork of writing notebooks, looking at film 
of draft choices. Now to come out and work out with the players -- 
it gets your motor running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the defense in brown jerseys, offense in white and  
quarterbacks in orange, the team worked out in brisk, 90-minute 
sessions at the Browns' indoor practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all the 73 players on the Cleveland roster suited up,  
including defensive lineman John Jurkovic and placekicker Phil 
Dawson, who signed with Cleveland Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stretching session, players broke down into groups --  
linebackers doing agility drills, linemen working on blocking 
techniques, kick returners fielding punts. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, dressed in khaki pants with a Browns windbreaker and  
cap, strolled between groups of players, shouting encouragement and 
occasionally pulling a man aside to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also ran through a few plays as Palmer began trying to  
install Cleveland's basic offense and defense. There were some 
ragged moments with offsides penalties and bobbled snaps, but also 
a sense of excitement as players immediately tried to make good 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Palmer said he wanted the players to ease up a little.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can definitely tell by the number of bodies on the ground  
that the intensity was up,'' said Ty Detmer, who led the first 
offensive unit. ``Guys were flying around, excited to be out there 
and trying to make a good showing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most intense player was Chris Spielman, returning to  
football after sitting out last season to be with his wife after 
she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The middle linebacker cut 
through the line to the ball carrier on two of the offense's first 
four plays and seemed to set the tone for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to be back in my element,'' Spielman said.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Probe Cop Brutality Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno says the Justice  
Department will investigate allegations of police brutality, but 
she defended cops confronted with the split-second decision of 
whether to open fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's comments during her regular weekly news conference came  
in response to questions about the department's investigation into 
a fatal shooting by four New York City police officers and her 
meeting Thursday with several police organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno did not directly address allegations of excessive force and  
poor judgment against the officers who shot and killed an unarmed 
African immigrant last month. 
</P>
<P>
	She did, however, defend police facing unpredictable  
confrontations on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``When to shoot and when not to shoot is one of the most  
difficult decisions in some circumstances that anybody could 
make,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The police groups and Justice Department officials discussed the  
New York case as an example of the need for better relations 
between police and minorities, said Jim Pasco, executive director 
of the national Fraternal Order of Police. 
</P>
<P>
	At her press conference, Reno would not say whether she will go  
to New York to investigate the killing of Amadou Diallo, as civil 
rights leaders have requested. 
</P>
<P>
	She also refused comment on how New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
has handled the case and on the continuing public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has defended the department since the Feb. 4 shooting  
at Diallo's Bronx home. Four white officers looking for a rape 
suspect fired 41 bullets at Diallo, who was black, and hit him 19 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the case said Thursday the officers have been  
charged with second-degree murder. Spokespersons for New York 
police and prosecutors declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Baby Born From Dead Father's Sperm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the first known birth of its kind in the  
United States, a woman in California has had a baby using sperm 
that was extracted from her dead husband as he lay in the morgue. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaby Vernoff, who is in her 20s, gave birth to the girl on March  
17 at an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital. Ms. Vernoff was 
impregnated in July with sperm that been taken from her husband, 
Bruce, 30 hours after he had died suddenly of an allergic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting at the widow's request, fertility specialist Dr. Cappy  
Rothman led a team that went to the coroner's office, made an 
incision in Vernoff's scrotum and extracted the sperm from the 
epididymis, the long coiled tubes behind each testicle where sperm 
cells mature. The sperm was kept frozen for 15 months before Ms. 
Vernoff became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just did it because the family was in so much stress and so  
much grief,'' said Rothman, director of the Center for Reproductive 
Medicine at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernoff, who lived in Los Angeles and was in his early 30s, was  
said to be happily married. The couple had no children. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothman has performed or supervised postmortem sperm extractions  
about a dozen times since 1978, when he took sperm from a man 
killed by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the  
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said he knows of at 
least 45 cases nationwide in which someone had requested that sperm 
be taken from a dead man. But he and Rothman said this is the first 
publicly acknowledged case in the United States in which a birth 
resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Alan DeCherney, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the  
University of California, Los Angeles, said there is at least one 
international precedent: A woman in France gave birth after a 
conception with postmortem sperm two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not unusual for a man to have his sperm frozen if he knows  
he is ill or dying. A British woman became pregnant using sperm 
that had been taken from her comatose, terminally ill husband. But 
taking sperm from a dead man is rarer still. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothman said how long sperm can live in a dead man depends on  
the temperature of the body -- perhaps 12 hours in a warm climate, 
longer in a cool setting. Rothman said Vernoff was in the 
refrigerated morgue and the 30-hour interval is the longest known 
period for removing sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Lewis, a spokesman for Ms. Vernoff and her family, said  
Friday that they won't answer questions because they want to savor 
``this extremely recent, private moment,'' and he refused to give 
details of the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are celebrating the beauty of this life that has been  
given to them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has raised questions among medical ethicists, who  
wonder whether such decisions are motivated on grief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it appropriate to consciously bring a child into this world  
with a dead father?'' asked Alexander M. Capron, professor of law 
and medicine and co-director of the Pacific Center for Health 
Policy and Ethics at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would we want, at the moment that a death occurs, to have  
doctors asking: `Do we harvest eggs? Do we harvest sperm?' This is 
not for the betterment of the human condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Moreno, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at  
the University of Virginia, noted that the procedure allows a child 
to be born without the consent of the father. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this procedure, the man does not have any say at all,  
unless there is an agreement before he died,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Delay Possible on Quiet Plane Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said  
today he is optimistic the European Union will delay an aircraft 
engine rule that has caused much trans-Atlantic acrimony and is 
slated to be voted upon next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rule would crack down on planes with engine  
mufflers known as hush kits. EU officials contend that while 
reducing noise pollution, the kits are ineffective at controlling 
pollution. As a practical matter, the rule's biggest impact would 
be on American airlines and equipment suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from London after a week of meetings with his European  
counterparts, Slater also said he hopes the United States and 
Britain will resume negotiations about unrestricted aviation 
between the countries. Previous talks ended abruptly last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the progress that has been demonstrated with the  
`open skies' agreements with Germany and throughout Europe are 
steps and efforts they've been taking note of,'' Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater said the details of new negotiations may be resolved next  
month when Britain's deputy prime minister, John Prescott, visits 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A Commerce Department official has said the hush-kit rules, with  
final European Union action scheduled Monday, could have a $1 
billion effect on the United States. It would devalue airplanes in 
the U.S. fleet, often resold in Europe, and harm hush-kit makers, 
all of whom are American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Urged on by environmentalists, the EU's European Parliament  
voted in February to adopt a rule prohibiting registration in 
Europe of aircraft outfitted with the hush kits after April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rule would ban hush-kitted aircraft registered elsewhere  
from flying in European skies as of April 1, 2002, unless they were 
operating there before the start of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say the proposed rules are arbitrary, because the  
modified airplanes meet new noise limits, known as Stage 3, 
established by the United Nations' International Civil Aviation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved a bill this month that would ban the  
Concorde, the noisy European supersonic jet, from flying in U.S. 
skies if the hush kit rules are approved. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tour, Slater met with EU Transport Commissioner Neil  
Kinnock; Michael Daerden, the Belgian minister of transport; and 
Jean-Claude Gayssot, French minister of infrastructure, transport 
and housing, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now at a point where we can say we have some positive  
indications that the commission will delay the regulation that's 
before them in order to address some of the serious concerns we've 
put before them,'' Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ella Krucoff, spokeswoman for the European Commission's  
Washington delegation, refused to predict the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to wait until the meeting,'' she said. ``There's no  
way to forecast the meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the potential for talks about a new trans-Atlantic  
aviation agreement contrasts sharply with the situation last 
October, when negotiations over an ``open skies'' deal collapsed 
after only three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current aviation treaty, known as Bermuda II, only two  
U.S. carriers -- American Airlines and United Airlines -- are allowed 
to fly into London's Heathrow Airport. The airport is especially 
popular with business travelers because it offers the most 
connections to international points. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an open skies deal, an unlimited number of carriers could  
serve any U.S. or British airport.

<HEADLINE>  Hershiser Joins Mets for $2 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Mets decided they'd rather have Orel Hershiser than Hideo  
Nomo, and the former Cy Young Award winner decided New York had a 
chance to get into the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old right-hander, who went to spring training with  
Cleveland, agreed Thursday with the Mets on a $2 million, one-year 
contract that gives him the chance to earn $500,000 more in 
performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of the contenders had a chance, but the other  
criteria came into play,'' Hershiser said during a news conference 
in Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the chance to win and to win in New York -- people say  
the greatest city in the world -- was an opportunity that I wanted 
to have,'' he said. ``I enjoy the pressure, I enjoy the spotlight 
and I enjoy the competition. I don't want to go off to some city 
where it's ho-hum, let's go watch the game, I want go some place 
where we're going to get after it and that's what New York is all 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Florida, Philadelphia and the Chicago Cubs also sought  
Hershiser. He would have gotten only a $400,000, one-year contract 
if he had made Cleveland's opening day roster. Indians manager Mike 
Hargrove decided there was no room for him in his team's rotation 
but was willing to keep him as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem we had here all along is that we didn't have an  
open spot for him in the rotation,'' Indians general manager John 
Hart said. ``We were not going to take any of our starters out of 
the rotation. Orel knew that. We addressed it with Orel. We would 
have liked to have had him here as a protection guy, it would have 
been a great fit for us. In reality, Orel got a nice contract with 
a team that has a chance to win and he's going to get the ball 
every five days. So I'm happy for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser made his Mets debut Thursday night pitching two  
shutout innings in New York's 5-0 win against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came one day after the Mets sent Nomo, another  
former Los Angeles Dodgers star, outright to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine appeared to be upset at the  
demotion, saying Wednesday he had told his players not to worry 
about their performance in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed, I guess,'' Valentine said. ``It's  
regretful. I said it wasn't a tryout camp and that they should work 
on things they needed to work on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine softened his tone Thursday but clearly remained upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic,'' he said. ``As down as I was yesterday over  
losing a player that I had a lot of sweat equity in and a guy I was 
pulling for to do well, I'm even higher that than today knowing one 
of the greatest competitors and one of the best pitchers I've ever 
seen is lined up on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three spring appearances, Hershiser was 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA.  
He allowed three runs and 10 hits in 10 innings, striking out four 
and walking three. Last year with San Francisco, Hershiser was 
11-10, with a 4.41 ERA in 34 games covering 202 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser has a 190-133 career record and admits he'd like to  
win at least 10 more to reach 200 and improve his chances of being 
elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award  
with the Dodgers after going 23-8 and setting a major league record 
with 59 consecutive scoreless innings. He also was MVP of the NL 
championship series and the World Series, going 3-0 in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year while playing for the  
Dodgers, was liked by Valentine, but general manager Steve Phillips 
made the decision to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult decision because it involves a player of his  
stature and given what he's done in his career,'' Phillips said. 
``But I've got to make a judgment in what I can do to have us win 
as many games as we can, and this starts the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995 and won 45 games in Los Angeles,  
but struggled last season and was traded to the Mets in June. He 
went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances.	   If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A Norfolk, the team would save 
Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he does report, the Mets will 
probably place Nomo on unconditional release waivers next Wednesday 
and give him only 45 days' termination pay, $719,262.

	Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995 and won 45 games in Los Angeles,  
but struggled last season and was traded to the Mets in June. He 
went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances.	   If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A Norfolk, the team would save 
Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he does report, the Mets will 
probably place Nomo on unconditional release waivers next Wednesday 
and give him only 45 days' termination pay, $719,262.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Finish Week Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today amid  
uncertainty about the Yugoslavian situation as buying was promoted 
by Japanese institutional investors. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 
main index continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 30.95 points,  
or 0.19 percent, closing the week at 16,016.99. On Thursday, the 
index rose 470.57 points, or 3.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.76 yen in the late afternoon, up 0.90 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 118.13 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of today's trading in Tokyo, the dollar stayed in a  
narrow range as Japanese investors adjusted positions ahead of the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. currency shot up late in the afternoon as Japanese  
banks covered their short, or oversold, dollar positions amid 
uncertainty about the situation in Yugoslavia, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO aircraft and missiles blasted targets in Yugoslavia  
Thursday for a second day, directing much of their fire on Kosovo 
where fighting raged between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied leaders said the airstrikes would continue until Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic signs up to an internationally 
supervised peace agreement in Kosovo which has been accepted by 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency is often considered a safe haven in times of  
international turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said another positive factor for the dollar was concern  
that Japanese financial authorities may intervene in the foreign 
exchange market to stem the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 117.97 yen and 118.96 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.78 yen, up from  
128.16 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, there was strong buying interest from  
foreign and individual investors early in the session following an 
overnight 169.55-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
The Dow Jones average closed Thursday at 9,836.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that profit-taking and position  
adjustment among investors ahead of the weekend were capping the 
market's upside. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 532  
million shares, down from Thursday's 663 million shares. Despite 
the Nikkei's advance, retreating issues outnumbered advancers 633 
to 568, with 107 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 11.95 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,267.78. 
The TOPIX posted a 22.34-point, or 1.81 percent, gain the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the new benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.815 percent from Thursday's finish of 
1.880 percent, driving its price up to 99.87 yen from 99.31 yen.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Refinery Explodes in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of people complaining of  
breathing problems flooded into hospitals after an explosion at a 
Chevron oil refinery spewed black smoke over the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast Thursday at the 97-year-old refinery on the edge of  
San Francisco Bay prompted Richmond officials to sound the city's 
sirens, warning residents to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 600 people went to three area hospitals. Some said  
they were nauseous and had a metallic taste in their mouths or 
burning sensation in their throats. Three firefighters were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that obviously is of concern to Chevron.  
We're taking this very seriously,'' said company spokeswoman Dawn 
Soper. ``We'll work hard to ensure anything like this is prevented 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Stanton of the Richmond Fire Department said the smoke  
was considered a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron spokesman Terry Swartz said there were toxins in the  
smoke, but he downplayed the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the question is, is there a health hazard to our employees  
or the community, I don't believe there is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents complained the explosion was just the latest  
health risk from Chevron and other nearby refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast occurred just a month after a fireball engulfed five  
workers at the Tosco Avon refinery in Martinez on Feb. 23, killing 
four and leaving one critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically they need to shut it down or something because the  
majority of these babies are being born with asthma,'' said Angela 
Brawley, who lives near the Chevron refinery. 
</P>
<P>
	The thick, black smoke was visible across the bay in San  
Francisco and Marin County. Firefighters had contained the blaze 
about 5 1/2 hours after it began, though they expected to continue 
fighting hot spots, said Soper. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit where the explosion occurred -- a processing and  
manufacturing site for gasoline and jet fuel -- was shut down 
indefinitely for investigation.

<HEADLINE> New Days for an Old Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual-fund investing has come a long way since  
the days of Naumkeag Steam Cotton, Farr Alpaca and the Lowell 
Bleachery Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Those long-forgotten names were three of the 46 stocks in the  
portfolio when the oldest fund of them all, MFS Investment 
Management Inc.'s Massachusetts Investors Trust, was launched with 
$50,000 of capital in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as it marks its 75th anniversary, the fund is 240,000 times  
its original size, with assets of more than $12 billion invested at 
last report in 143 stocks. It has 54 younger brother and sister 
funds of all descriptions in the Boston-based MFS family, together 
encompassing almost $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	And MFS (the initials originally stood for Massachusetts  
Financial Services), though quite successful, doesn't come close in 
size to some of the competitors that grew up alongside it. The 
biggest fund family, run by Fidelity Investments in Boston, boasts 
assets of $700 billion-plus. 
</P>
<P>
	In its style and strategy, Massachusetts Investors Trust, or MIT  
for short, hasn't changed very much over the decades. It still 
invests with a relatively conservative approach, in the sort of 
well-established companies that Wall Street calls ``blue chips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One stock that appeared in MIT's original portfolio -- General  
Electric Co. -- also shows up in the latest published list of the 
fund's largest holdings, as of Dec. 31, 1998. At its launching, MIT 
owned five GE shares worth around $1,161. Today, the fund's GE 
position, representing 1.7 percent of a $12 billion portfolio, has 
a market value of around $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, what strikes an observer most about a comparison  
between MIT's first portfolio and the stocks it owns today isn't 
the similarities but the differences. They reflect, in microcosm, 
the dramatic ways in which the economy has changed in only two or 
three generations' time. 
</P>
<P>
	MIT's original portfolio contained stocks in three main  
classifications -- railroads and railroad equipment; public 
utilities and ``industrial and miscellaneous.'' In addition, the 
fund owned two stocks in the bank and insurance category: Three 
shares of the Boston Insurance Co. and five shares of Springfield 
Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, financial services makes up the largest stock category in  
the MIT portfolio, accounting for 18.7 percent of assets. The next 
biggest, health care at 14.7 percent, wasn't even considered an 
industry in the early decades of the 20th century. Ditto for 
technology, which represents 10.6 percent of the modern MIT 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Where today MIT holds big positions in Microsoft and IBM, the  
original portfolio contained shares of enterprises like American 
Radiator, National Lead and Baldwin Locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
	For geographical diversity, the original MIT portfolio relied on  
entities like the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co., the 
Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Texas Co., later to be known as 
Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the fund has between 5 percent and 10 percent of its  
money invested in international stocks, though it professes still 
to take a very cautious approach to venturing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Says John D. Laupheimer Jr., the present-day portfolio manager,  
in comments published on MFS's World Wide Web Site at www.mfs.com 
(something else the fund's founders surely never envisioned): ``We 
only invest overseas if we find a company that we believe has the 
quality and growth potential equivalent to those of a U.S. company 
and whose stock is selling at a discount sufficient to compensate 
for currency risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid all the financial progress and upheaval, MIT has amassed a  
strong performance record. Over the past 10 years, according to the 
research firm Lipper Inc., MIT's class A shares have climbed 476.74 
percent, to rank in the top 5 percent of funds tracked by Lipper 
over that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	A Web site interview recently asked, ``What will the next few  
years hold in terms of how MFS invests and how MIT is managed?'' 
Laupheimer replied: ``It is my hope that there will be little 
change.''

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer,  
missed the Philadelphia 76ers' game Friday night against the Boston 
Celtics with a right leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, averaging 28.6 points per game, has a contusion of the  
right quad and is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson injured himself last Friday against the Los Angeles

<HEADLINE> CT Scans Can Check Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Ordinary hospital CT scanners can be  
equipped to snap stop-action pictures of the heart, offering a new 
way of detecting dangerously clogged arteries many years before 
they cause trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatty buildups in the heart's arteries begin in early adulthood,  
but often there is no sign of damage until a heart attack strikes 
in middle age or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	However, these deposits frequently contain calcium that shows up  
on CT scans. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, super-fast CT scanners have been introduced to  
take freeze-frame cross-sectional X-rays of the beating heart. On 
these pictures, fatty deposits show up as white lumps of calcium. 
</P>
<P>
	These specialized machines, called electron beam CT scanners,  
cost about $2 million, and about 50 are installed in hospitals and 
imaging centers across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, researchers say they have figured out a way to rig up the  
much more common CT scanners found in virtually every hospital so 
they will do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, which involves combining a CT scanner with an EKG  
machine, was developed by Dr. Christopher Woodhouse of Mount Sinai 
Hospital in Miami Beach. The technology was further advanced by Dr. 
Jeffrey Carr and others from Wake Forest University, who presented 
their findings Friday at a medical conference in Orlando sponsored 
by the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr compared ordinary CT with electron beam CT in 36 patients.  
He found their power to detect calcium in the heart's coronary 
arteries was virtually identical. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should make a difference'' by allowing calcium scanning  
to become much more routinely available, said Dr. Peter Wilson of 
the long-running Framingham Heart Study in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	During every beat, the heart contracts and squirts blood through  
the arteries. Then it rests and refills before contracting again. 
</P>
<P>
	Super-fast CTs are synchronized with the heart so they take an  
X-ray during the resting stage of every other beat. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 ordinary CT machines are installed in hospitals  
across the country, and they shoot pictures more slowly. These 
machines are used to look at the liver, lungs and virtually every 
other part of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr's group hooked patients up to electrocardiogram machines  
while they underwent CT scans of their hearts. The machine shoots a 
continuous stream of pictures, snapping 400 overlapping images in 
35 seconds. This creates a sort of X-ray movie of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, a computer reads the EKG information to select the  
pictures taken during the resting stage, when the heart is still, 
so doctors can look for traces of calcium. 
</P>
<P>
	In the examples shown by Carr, calcium stood out even more  
clearly in the ordinary CT scanners' pictures than it did in those 
shot with the super-fast scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important breakthrough, but we still need to know  
more'' about how the scans compare with those taken with the 
super-fast machines, said Dr. Ronald M. Lauer of the University of 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Super-fast scans typically cost between $200 and $400. Whether  
ordinary CTs will make this any cheaper is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Carr said the new approach should make calcium scanning  
much more available. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this technology, we will be able to finally do  
population-wide screening,'' offering CT scans routinely to people 
suspected of being at high risk of heart disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors believe that screening this way can find heart  
trouble in time to do something about it. People who have calcium 
buildups might be put on cholesterol-lowering drugs at an early age 
or persuaded to lower their blood pressure or quit smoking.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Enjoying Final Four Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun seems  
so comfortable, so relaxed and in his element at the Final Four, it 
hardly seems possible this is his first. 
</P>
<P>
	Has he practiced this act for the last 27 years? Is it all an  
out-of-character ruse to relax his Huskies before the biggest game 
of their lives -- Saturday's NCAA semifinal against Ohio State? 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the experience of a lifetime. You may not have this  
experience again,'' point guard Khalid El-Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has to remind Calhoun of that.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it is the relief of getting UConn to the round of four  
after three previous failures in regional finals. Or maybe it is 
shedding the tag of the best team in college basketball never to 
get to the Final Four in 20 previous trips to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday, just before a spirited workout at Tropicana Field,  
the UConn players were asked if their coach might be ... too loose? 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, the man wound tighter than a baseball? He is such a  
chronic complainer that Big East Conference officials intentionally 
don't sit anywhere near him come tournament time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I wouldn't say loose and lighthearted,'' El-Amin said.  
``He's definitely enjoyed making it to the Final Four, but he 
really wants to win the Final Four. He really wants to be a 
national champion. I think that's characteristic of a great coach 
or a competitive person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or a coach who's spent a lifetime being reminded that he never  
has been to the finals of the biggest tournament in college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But while they're putting on a happy face in public, one of the  
messages being preached by the Huskies (32-2) is that this is a 
business trip, not a warm-weather weekend getaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Good idea, too. The Huskies would be well advised to do  
something with an opportunity that their fans -- among the most 
loyal and intense in college basketball -- wondered would ever come. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies are expected to reach the national championship game  
Monday against the other expected winner, Duke. It would be a No. 1 
vs. No. 2 showdown of the only two teams to be top-ranked this 
season. Anything less would be a disappointment. And disappointment 
is a word the Huskies are tired of hearing in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have talked about nothing but (UConn making the Final  
Four) since Saturday night when the Huskies defeated Gonzaga,'' 
Maryland coach Gary Williams said. ``Now that they have made it, 
they have to watch that there won't be a letdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There certainly weren't any letdowns in Final Four practices  
that the Huskies assert were as intense as any all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our coaches have a game plan,'' center Jake Voskuhl said.  
``They do know what they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's hourlong session, the competitive El-Amin  
pushed, poked and grabbed Richard Hamilton during a one-on-one 
defensive drill. In another drill, a ball he bounced high above the 
rim from half-court was caught by Edmund Saunders and dunked, 
drawing cheers from the 27,000-plus fans. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin offered the tough practices as evidence the Huskies  
aren't too relaxed. He also insisted they aren't looking past Ohio 
State, which already upset regional No. 1 seed Auburn and St. 
John's. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``We didn't come here to play one game, we came  
here to play two games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:42 p.m. Saturday, they'll play the game Calhoun often  
wondered if his team would ever play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an awful lot of excitement, joy and happiness,''  
Calhoun said. ``Our kids have handled it wonderfully. I think we're 
very focused on what we have to do.''

<HEADLINE> Farmer Accused of Starving Herd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUTLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- The 80 cows in the barn once were John  
Garvin's joy and livelihood. Then, they became his curse. Now, they 
are his ruin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old farmer sits in jail on charges that he starved  
to death 47 cows and neglected dozens of others that were found 
barely alive earlier this month, standing in frozen, ankle-deep 
manure on the barn floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinarians said the animals had been without food for a month  
or more. Many of the dead cows had half-born calves. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of the worst cases of farm animal abuse New York  
authorities can recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine how he slept in the house next to the barn  
with all those cows crying and bellowing and not respond to them. 
It's absolutely heartless,'' said Linda Miles, director of the 
Jefferson County branch of the Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvin's lawyer, David Renzi, said Garvin had fallen into ruin  
after the death in 1995 of his father, who had run the farm since 
1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had this farm thrown on him and financially he just  
couldn't keep it running. He got in over his head. Things started 
breaking. He had severe depression and problems with alcohol. It 
got out of his control,'' Renzi said. ``I don't think he's 
necessarily a cruel person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Garvin's depressed state, Renzi refused to let him be  
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	State troopers acting on an anonymous tip raided Garvin's farm  
75 miles north of Syracuse on March 5. Garvin lived on the farm 
with his 70-year-old mother, Helen Garvin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an awful scene,'' said Trooper John J. Poggi III, who  
had to shoot several of the animals that couldn't be saved. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvin was charged with animal abuse. He has remained in jail  
since his arrest, unable to pay his $7,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had been taking care of cows since he was able to walk,''  
Renzi said. ``His mother said she can't understand what happened. 
He used to love the cows. She tells a story about how he almost got 
into a fight with a farmhand once because the man used an electric 
prod on one of the family cows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Garvin did not return calls for comment. Renzi said she has  
been besieged by threatening and harassing calls from people upset 
over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Garvin had started drinking heavily in the years  
before his father's death. Court records showed he was arrested for 
drunken driving in 1992 and 1995. His drinking worsened after his 
father died, Renzi said. Garvin was arrested twice more for driving 
drunk in December and February. 
</P>
<P>
	As his personal problems mounted, the farm went bankrupt and the  
Garvins found themselves with liens on their house, land and 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank was putting a lot of pressure on him,'' Renzi said.  
``It's not an excuse. It's an explanation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies and SPCA officials visited the Garvin farm  
twice last year to investigate neglect allegations, but no charges 
were filed. On the second visit, deputies found three dead calves. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a farm, animals sometimes die. That's nature's course,''  
Sheriff James Lafferty said. ``There wasn't sufficient evidence of 
any wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garvin promised to improve conditions on his farm and did, at  
least temporarily, Mrs. Miles said. The SPCA offered him help if he 
ever needed it, said Mrs. Miles, who also noted that the state runs 
a hot line for farmers through Cornell University that provides 
counseling and financial advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Renzi said he doesn't know why Garvin didn't seek assistance.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's now asking himself the same question,'' the lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses To Cut Tyson Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was turned down today in his  
bid to have his jail sentence in Maryland reduced from one year to 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means the earliest the former heavyweight champion  
could be released from jail is June. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge setback,'' Tyson lawyer Paul Kemp said.  
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery County Circuit Judge Stephen Johnson, who imposed the  
original sentence last month, said at today's hearing he still 
considers the sentence ``fair and appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the best interest of Mr. Tyson that his current  
treatment be maintained,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who had waived his right to attend the hearing, was  
brought to the Montgomery County courthouse before the hearing 
began. But jailers realized their error and immediately took him 
back. His wife, Monica, was present when the judge announced his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson must still serve 60 days for violating probation for a  
1992 rape conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	He is undergoing counseling, had a change in his antidepressant  
medication and is studying for a high school equivalency diploma in 
the Montgomery County jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson he is serving a one-year sentence after pleading no  
contest to misdemeanor assault charges in connection with a minor 
traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg last August.

<HEADLINE> Hawks' Gray Arrested for DUI, Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Hawks backup guard Ed Gray was charged  
with drug possession and driving under the influence after a state 
trooper stopped him for minor traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The trooper stopped Gray's 1991 BMW about Thursday night near  
downtown Atlanta after noticing that the car's windows were tinted 
darker than state law allows and that his California tags had 
expired, spokesman Gordy Wright of the Georgia Department of Public 
Safety said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the trooper found less than an ounce of marijuana and an  
open container of alcohol in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to drug possession and DUI, Wright said Gray was  
charged with driving with an open container and driving on a 
suspended and revoked license. Blood-alcohol tests were pending on 
the DUI charge, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said the team can't take any  
action against Gray unless he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take these issues extremely seriously,'' he said. ``We met  
with our team this morning and told them we'll support anybody who 
is in our family 100 percent with legal help, counseling, 
whatever's necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if in fact any of our guys are found guilty of a  
misdemeanor or felony, we would take the harshest measure allowed 
by collective bargaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was a first-round draft pick of the Hawks in 1997. He spent  
part of his rookie season on injured reserve after breaking a foot. 
This season, he is averaging 4.5 points per game.

<HEADLINE>  Kwan Falls and Drops to Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan badly hurt her chances  
for keeping the women's title at the World Figure Skating 
Championships when she fell today on a jump in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan went down to the ice on a double axel -- normally a simple  
jump for her -- and had trouble landing the first part of her triple 
lutz-double toe loop combination. She was marked down in technical 
merit from 5.1 to 5.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Her presentation marks, mostly 5.8 and 5.9 with a 5.6, put her  
fourth after the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Maria Butyrskaya took advantage of Kwan's mistakes to  
move into first place with a sultry number to ``St. James Infirmary 
Blues.'' She won the short program with marks between 5.7 and 5.8 
with a solo 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya was rated best by all nine judges.  
</P>
<P>
	Her Russian teammate Julia Soldatova was second and France's  
Vanessa Gusmeroli was third. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kwan to win the title on Saturday she has to take the free  
skating portion -- not impossible for Kwan. However, Butyrskaya has 
to finish third or worse. If the Russian is second, she will take 
the title no matter how well Kwan skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I don't control my own destiny,'' Kwan said of her chances  
of retaining her title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance final later today, the free routine will decide  
the title between champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov 
and the French duo of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan caught a cold on her way to Finland and was forced to take  
antibiotics earlier in the week to improve her condition in time 
for three skates within 75 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I've been crying, so I'm congested'' again, she  
said after her program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although obviously shaken by her performance, she vowed to  
marshal the discipline that she's noted for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the name of the game is to believe in yourself,'' she  
sid. 
</P>
<P>
	She did enough to win her qualification group easily with six  
triples, although she cut another triple down to a double at the 
end of her program. 
</P>
<P>
	However, from the start of the short program Kwan seemed  
tentative. She lost her balance in the air on the opening jump but 
salvaged a one-foot landing and went into the second part slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she barely got off the ice for her double axel and crumbled  
as she landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even her spins and spirals seemed to lack the sparkle had  
highlighted her performances in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan will skate last on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, Alexei Yagudin used his quad to create the difference  
between him and Yevgeny Plushenko to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss took the bronze medal. Weiss  
grazed the ice with his free leg on his quad attempt, not getting 
credit for it. Another American, Tim Goebel, completed the first 
quad salchow-triple toe loop in a world championship and came in 
12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven men completed quads bringing to 14 the number down in this  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin unleashed a flawless quad, not only landing it firmly,  
but with flair. Then he knocked off an array of triples in one of 
the most difficult programs ever done at worlds. The program 
included two taxing triple-triple combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko missed his quad when he needed it the most, although  
he did eight triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians defended their in the first two finals of the  
competition with Yagudin taking the men's event and Yelena 
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharudlidze winning the pairs.

<HEADLINE> Unsafe Rail Crossings To Be Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Three rail unions are urging their members to  
report dangerous railroad crossings in an effort to prevent crashes 
like the one that killed 11 Amtrak passengers last week in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions eventually hope to map all rail crossings they  
consider unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to compile this information and let the political  
leadership in every state and in Washington know where the problem 
spots are located,'' said Charles Little, president of the 
125,000-member United Transportation Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The UTU and the 56,000-member Brotherhood of Locomotive  
Engineers, both based in Cleveland, and the 10,000-member 
Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, based in Mt. Prospect, Ill., 
announced the plan Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Little said the goal is to ``cut through the red tape and find  
quick and sound solutions to these problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people were killed and more than 100 injured March 15 in  
Bourbonnais, Ill., when an Amtrak train crashed into a truck 
carrying steel. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rail Crossing Task Force will have office space at the UTU  
headquarters, and rail workers will be urged to report dangerous 
crossings to the task force through a telephone hot line or e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Krzyzewski Has Final 4 Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- It's natural to assume Duke has  
Final Four experience and won't be fazed by all the hoopla. After 
all, coach Mike Krzyzewski has been to eight of them since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But no player on this powerful Duke team has ever been to the  
Final Four. Same goes for Michigan State, Ohio State and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any nervousness that we may feel, we know the team we're  
playing against is also experiencing it,'' Duke's Shane Battier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (36-1) arrived at the Don CeSar resort on St.  
Petersburg Beach on Thursday afternoon, ready to take on the 
Spartans in the national semifinals Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took it as a regular road trip,'' said Battier, who emerged  
from the team bus with a camcorder while slapping a handful of fans 
high-fives. ``But as soon as we landed it was a pretty electric 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski received the largest hand from about 75 fans, and  
players milled around the hotel lobby signing basketballs and caps. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus ride along Interstate 275 took Duke past Tropicana  
Field, the site of this year's Final Four and the scene of a 
17-point collapse last season against Kentucky in the South 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drove right past it,'' Battier said. ``I got out my  
camcorder and on first feature film I say, `This was the spot we 
didn't take care of business last year but the good Lord has put us 
in a position this year where we can redeem ourselves.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski laughed when told Duke's hotel has housed many famous  
guests, including former Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's a great, great place,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I'm  
sure when I come back sometime with my wife I'll try to figure out 
who was here before me, but right now I'm trying to figure out how 
to stop Mateen Cleaves on a fastbreak more so than who stayed in 
room 602.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the best NCAA tournament record among active coaches,  
Krzyzewski has plenty of insights for his team about the Final Four 
and the experiences surrounding one of the nation's biggest 
sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think until you get into this for about a day, when  
you are around all the stuff, you really get a true feeling of 
it,'' Krzyzewski said of the hoopla. ``Then, when you come out on 
the floor Saturday, that's one of the best days in sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has received enormous hype all season, being billed as one  
of the all-time great teams. That should help them cope with a 
hectic weekend filled with media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them just before we go into something what they going  
to experience for the next 12 to 24 hours,'' Krzyzewski said of his 
players. ``You tell them the truth and they usually handle it the 
right way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Battier, who grew up in Michigan, being in Florida is fun  
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see too much sand growing up, so it's pretty cool to  
come and see girls in bikinis and see the sand,'' Battier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Could that be a distraction?  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things this team has learned to deal with is  
putting distractions behind us and focusing on basketball,'' 
Battier said. ``We'll see the sun (Thursday) but after that we're 
going to be in the hotel watching film, and eating and sleeping 
basketball.''

<HEADLINE> Fisher To Coach San Diego State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Steve Fisher, with one national title and two  
other Final Four appearances on his resume, will be San Diego 
State's new coach, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego State called a news conference for 6:15 p.m. EST today  
to make the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Rick Bay wouldn't comment other than to say,  
``I don't want to take the sizzle from the press conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, an assistant with the NBA's Sacramento Kings, was  
expected to return to Los Angeles for tonight's game against the 
Lakers, a source familiar with the job search, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring caps Bay's month-long search for a successor to Fred  
Trenkle, who resigned following a 4-22 season. Although Trenkle had 
losing records in four of his five years, he had the school's only 
winning season since its last NCAA tournament appearance, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Fisher was 184-82 at Michigan, and had a 20-6  
record in the NCAA tournament. San Diego State has made only three 
NCAA tournament appearances, never winning a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was fired by Michigan on Oct. 10, 1997, shortly after a  
Kansas law firm hired by the university issued a report that called 
into question his role in arranging complimentary tickets for a 
booster. The NCAA accepted the school's self-imposed penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about that incident Thursday night, Bay said:  
``People make their own judgment. Without having confirmed or 
denied that I've talked to Steve, if I would hire a coach, I would 
check everything out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's tenure as Michigan's coach began almost as abruptly,  
when he was promoted on an interim basis on the eve of the 1989 
NCAA tournament after Bill Frieder accepted a job at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan won the national title that year and Fisher had the  
interim label removed about three weeks later. Fisher coached the 
Wolverines to the title game in 1992 and 1993, losing both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher returns to college ball on a six-game winning streak,  
having won his final regular-season game at Michigan in 1997, then 
leading the Wolverines to the NIT title.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Criticizes GOP Tax Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin criticized  
Republicans today for planning to use large parts of expected 
federal surpluses for a tax cut, saying they would squander a 
chance to strengthen the economy and buttress federal retirement 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by a reporter whether GOP tax-cutting plans were  
``going nowhere,'' Rubin responded: ``I know where I think they 
should go. The place where you suggested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin spoke a day after the House and Senate approved similar  
GOP-written budgets for fiscal 2000 calling for $778 billion in tax 
reductions over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin did not say President Clinton would veto a tax bill that  
large. But his comments underlined the administration's preference 
to use large parts of projected surpluses for more domestic 
spending and a far smaller tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not think a tax cut contributes to our economic  
well-being,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the GOP plan would move in the ``precise opposite  
direction'' from needed debt reduction and help for Social Security 
and Medicare, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In competing budget plans, Clinton and Republicans both  
emphasize tax relief, helping Social Security and Medicare, and 
beefing up education and defense spending. But there's a wide chasm 
on major details, and each side insists it does more than the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite intense partisan debate Thursday in Congress, lawmakers  
of both parties were optimistic that some of gaps can be bridged in 
this new era of projected budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody pretty much agrees on where it ought to go,'' said  
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. ``The difference is on how much goes 
where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours after the House passed its version of the GOP  
budget, 221-208, the Senate put the finishing touches Thursday 
night on a similar plan, 55-44. Both votes broke mostly along party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were triumphant, particularly in the House, where  
new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., made passage of the budget his 
first major priority while dealing with a slender 11-seat edge over 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said the GOP prescription actually saves more than  
Clinton proposed over 10 years for Social Security and Medicare, 
which are both in danger of insolvency as baby boomers age, and 
provides an unspecified tax cut of nearly $800 billion -- far more 
than the president's targeted tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the largest surplus in history, which means the  
taxpayers are being overcharged,'' the speaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton was quick to criticize the proposals as ``a series  
of missed opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While this budget marks a reversal from last year's failed  
effort by Republicans to drain the entire surplus for a tax cut, it 
still does not do enough to pay down the debt and strengthen Social 
Security and Medicare,'' the president said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Their exchange mirrored the debate that echoed through both  
sides of the Capitol all day Thursday. House and Senate Republicans 
will meet later this spring to produce a compromise budget, which 
sets tax and spending guidelines that will be filled in later in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the House plan for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1,  
calls for $1.74 trillion in spending and forecasts a surplus of 
$141 billion. The Senate proposal projects spending of $1.74 
trillion and a $135 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to cut taxes next year by up to $15 billion and  
by $778 billion over the next decade. While the budget outlines no 
specifics, Republicans have talked of such relief as eliminating 
the so-called marriage penalty, cutting income tax rates broadly 
and eliminating inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Clinton's budget envisions spending of $1.79  
trillion and would leave an $80 billion surplus. Clinton wants tax 
cuts totaling $81 billion through 2009, but he recommended 
increasing tobacco and other taxes by $178 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Clinton would spend $281 billion next year for  
defense, compared with $289 billion by Republicans. Senate 
Republicans matched Clinton's proposal for education and job 
training, exceeding the House total by $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget had scant support in either house of Congress --  
so little that the House buried it, 426-2, with one lawmaker voting 
present. The Senate rejected it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democratic alternatives were rejected in the House.  
</P>
<P>
	One called for smaller tax cuts than the GOP plan and more money  
for selected domestic programs. Supporters said it also would 
extend the life of Social Security until 2050 and of Medicare until 
2020. It failed on a vote of 250-173. 
</P>
<P>
	The second, crafted by a group of moderate to conservative  
Democrats, set aside more money than any other alternative for debt 
reduction and had the smallest tax cuts. It was rejected, 295-134. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans defeated an effort by Sen. Edward  
Kennedy, D-Mass., to reserve 15 percent of the surplus for 
Medicare, as Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans pushed through a measure directing the Senate  
Finance Committee to consider a Medicare reform plan pushed by Sen. 
John Breaux, D-La., chairman of a Medicare commission that recently 
deadlocked. ``Let's quit talking about Medicare,'' said Senate 
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ''Let's fix it.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs in Chicago Protest Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Prayers for peace and shouts of solidarity filled  
Daley Plaza as 1,000 Serbian-Americans crowded into downtown 
Chicago on Friday to denounce the NATO air attacks on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The noisy demonstrators waved Yugoslavian, Serbian and Kosovar  
flags, held signs with caricatures of President Clinton as Adolf 
Hitler and chanted ``Zivela Srbija!'' -- Long Live Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of NATOs can bomb us. They cannot bomb us enough,''  
bellowed Slavko Panovich, president of the Serbian National Defense 
Council of America, which helped organize the demonstration. ``We 
can endure any bombing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 350,000 ethnic Serbs live in the Chicago area. Many  
of the demonstrators were bused downtown from the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	To the protesters, Serbia and its province of Kosovo are one:  
``Kosovo is Serbia,'' they chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators repeatedly expressed an allegiance to the United  
States but a hatred of what America was doing in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're killing innocent people. It's shameful,'' said Lana  
Denic, 45, of suburban Northbrook. ``I love the United States. I 
love the American people. But I hate Clinton. I hate the 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vesna Mojsic, 14, has lived her entire life in the United States  
but visits relatives in Kosovo every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's horrible. I think Bill Clinton is starting World  
War III, and Americans should open their eyes and see that,'' 
Mojsic said. ``My whole family is back there. I'm just extremely 
worried.''

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Nearly 45 years after his death, Charlie  
Parker is finally being embraced by his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	A bronze sculpture of Parker is to be unveiled Saturday in the  
historic 18th &AMP; Vine District where Parker's saxophone wailed into 
the wee hours as he helped develop bebop in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Musicians, jazz scholars and family members of Parker are also  
gathering this week to pay tribute to Parker during a two-day 
symposium. Parker, who was born in bordering Kansas City, Kan., 
died in New York in 1955 at age 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker's family has said that he did not feel he was well  
received in his hometown until after he became famous elsewhere. 
Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said the tribute is a way to right a wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kansas City has never really opened its heart to Charlie  
Parker, but we're trying to reverse that,'' Cleaver said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Drug Tests Due This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The first drug tests of American Olympic  
athletes by an independent agency are expected this summer, a top 
U.S. Olympic Committee official said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Dick Schultz said Friday the committee  
had heard from nine companies that wanted to do the testing, which 
currently is handled by the Olympic panel and has been criticized 
for a potential lack of objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The list will be pared to 2-3 finalists, with the choice made in  
time for the first tests to be conducted by mid or late summer 
using International Olympic Committee-approved labs in Indianapolis 
and Los Angeles, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the companies also has drug-test connections with the  
NCAA, Schultz said, and chances remain that the USOC program could 
be run in conjunction with the college-sports authority and the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something I feel strongly about and something that we  
have to move on at a good pace,'' he said in a telephone interview 
from his Colorado Springs office. 
</P>
<P>
	A USOC task force recommended last year that the testing of U.S.  
Olympic athletes for banned performance enhancers be removed from 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force, headed by former executive director Baaron  
Pittenger, noted that no other national Olympic committee 
administered its own drug tests and that a change was needed to 
avoid the perception of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult in the international arena to have a high  
degree of credibility when you're running your own program,'' 
Pittenger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the USOC was able to quickly set up an  
independent-testing program within existing rules, but that it 
would take longer to come up with new procedures for handling 
disputes and appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, he said, existing rules will be used, with  
new ``checks and balances'' added for tests involving testosterone 
and other drugs where results are frequently challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said he hoped to report on the status of the legal  
review process and cost of the new program at the USOC board of 
directors meeting in New Orleans next month.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Defend Motive in Cuba Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos denied  
that his team's game Sunday against the Cuban national team would 
lay the groundwork for recruiting future players. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, who was leaving for Havana on Friday, said the goal for  
the game was to seek normalization of relations between the two 
countries and a better standard of living for the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for all of us to open our minds and open our  
hearts to people of other countries. This is a wonderful thing that 
is happening throughout the world,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will play Sunday in Havana. No major league baseball  
team has played in Cuba in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, a wealthy lawyer and a major Democratic contributor,  
has been criticized by several Cuban-American political groups, and 
his team has been the target of demonstrations during spring 
training in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But Angelos said most of the letters and calls he's received  
were positive. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, mostly members of the Cuban-American exile  
community, have complained that the game supports the government of 
Fidel Castro. But the pope's visit to Cuba last year demonstrated 
that the more contact, the better, Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of anything that has ever been done for a  
constructive purpose that didn't generate controversy,'' Angelos 
said. ``Anything that departs from what is customary is going to 
generate a difference of opinion, but it's a worthwhile endeavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore director Barry Levinson is also going to Cuba with the  
Orioles with a documentary film crew.

<HEADLINE> Investors Still Believe in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sitting in a crowded seminar on China's  
economy, businessman David Fries listens carefully for hints that 
the world's most populous nation can fend off the economic turmoil 
that afflicts many of its Asian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is a big one for Fries' company, Lubrizol Corp. of  
Wickliff, Ohio, which has launched two joint ventures in China to 
manufacture and market chemical additives for motor oil and other 
lubricants. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lubrizol, like dozens of other American companies, the vast  
potential market represented by Asia's growing population make it 
the place to be, even if financial trouble and the growing 
political tension between the United States and China could mean a 
rocky ride in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly worries us with the focus on delivery of  
quarterly results,'' said Fries, one of more than 300 business 
people and scholars who gathered at the University of Southern 
California this week for the annual Asia/Pacific Business Outlook 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``But most of the world's people are there, and my impression is  
it's only a matter of time until things will turn around and 
improve,'' said Fries, director of Lubrizol International 
Management Corp., the company's overseas business unit. 
</P>
<P>
	As the second anniversary of the economic crisis nears, American  
companies are again trying to get a greater foothold in Asian 
markets. U.S. investments in Asia rose during 1998 despite Asia's 
crisis. But Americans are more careful about where they put their 
money, with growth shifting from stocks to harder assets like 
factories, real estate and joint ventures for marketing and 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. companies' direct investment in Asia -- money spent to buy  
foreign companies, establish overseas subsidiaries or enter joint 
ventures -- reached $14.9 billion in Asia during 1998. That's up 
more than $1 billion from the $13.8 billion invested during 1997, 
the year the crisis began, according to Department of Commerce 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Americans poured more than $10 billion into a new  
Asian market: the purchase of bad loans portfolios and distressed 
properties, primarily in Japan, Korea and Thailand, during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans were less aggressive in Asian stock markets, but still  
were net buyers. They paid $7.4 billion for securities in Asian 
countries, down from $13.1 billion a year earlier and $16.9 billion 
in 1996, according to the Securities Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest decline in stock investing was in Japan, where  
purchases fell to $3.6 billion in 1998 from $9.5 billion in 1997, 
according to figures compiled by the association, a trade group 
representing 750 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest stock purchases went to countries that have fared  
relatively well through the crisis, such as Singapore, Taiwan and 
China, or those, such as Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand, where the 
crisis drove down prices far enough to create bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in 1997 U.S. investment in Hong Kong stocks fell to  
a net selloff of $139 million. Last year, Americans reversed 
directions and bought $974 million worth of securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selectively, Asia is still a good place to invest,'' said  
Denny F. d'Alelio, vice president for Asian business development at 
TRW Systems &AMP; Information Group. ``What you have to do is go back 
to the basics. You can't take any shortcuts. Do you have what the 
customer wants? Does the customer have the money to buy it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investment growth is likely to continue this year as markets  
recover and more countries are changing laws to encourage foreign 
ownership of businesses -- a dramatic change that could create big 
long-term opportunities for U.S. companies, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere I turn around there are U.S.-based companies buying  
into markets that were previously closed to foreigners,'' said Jack 
Rodman, director of international business for E&AMP;Y Kenneth 
Leventhal Real Estate Group. ``This is a sea change in direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's financial crisis began in July 1997 after Thailand  
devalued its currency. Within days, its neighbors followed suit, 
sending most of the region into deep recession. Underlying reasons 
for the crisis included overvalued currencies, banks overburdened 
by debt and heavy dependence on foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the economic uncertainty are other problems.  
Financial systems in many Asian countries lack ``transparency,'' 
meaning it is difficult to get reliable information about a 
venture's real value and liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, interest among American companies is growing, said  
Baizu Chen, a USC economist specializing in Asia. When the 
professor began teaching the China seminar three years ago, 10 
people attended. A year ago there were 20. This week, about 40 
people crowded into Chen's classroom, while others listened from 
the foyer outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, you have to be cautious,'' said Chen. ``But Asia  
eventually will come back. That's for sure. When it really comes 
back, it will be too late to get in.

	AT&AMP;T: No At Home-Road Runner Merger

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T-controlled At Home, a leading provider of  
high-speed Internet access over cable TV lines, doesn't plan to 
merge with rival Road Runner despite persistent rumors about such a 
deal, a top AT&AMP;T executive said today. Leo Hindery, president and 
CEO of AT&AMP;T Broadband and Internet Services, said: ``It's not on 
the table. It's not being discussed.'' He conceded that such a 
merger might make sense. AT&AMP;T recently acquired cable giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. and as a result, TCI's controlling stake 
in At Home, which also is owned by Cox Communications and several 
other investors. AT&AMP;T shares were at 83 1/16 up 1 3/16.

WTO membership, which have proceeded in fits and starts over the

discovered 43 cases of acute liver failure among Rezulin patients, 
38 of which were probably caused by the medicine, the officials 
told a panel of scientific advisers weighing the drug's safety. Of 
those 43 people, seven had a liver transplant and survived, five 
survived without a transplant and 28 died. Officials did not know

Federal Highway Administration said that the change should reduce 
the chance that a vehicle will smash into or drive under a trailer. 
The agency estimated the change will save more than 100 lives and 
prevent 1,700 injuries in the next decade. Since January 1, 1993, 
the government has required that the bottom edge on all new 
trailers be rimmed with red-and-white reflective tape or with 
so-called reflex reflectors, like the red plastic devices used on 
bicycles.

9,788.94, erasing more than a quarter of the Dow's 169-point climb 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	The market, whose advance Thursday came partly on relief about  
the military action in Kosovo, seemed to have a change of heart 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after NATO aircraft and missiles blasted targets in  
Yugoslavia for a second night, directing much of their fire on 
Kosovo, where fighting continued between Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worried today about what could transgress over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the people who believed that one or two air strikes in  
Kosovo would solve our problems over there are having second 
thoughts,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``Now many people are concerned with whether or not we will 
have to commit ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profit-taking also sent stocks lower. Just last week, the Dow  
traded above 10,000 for the first time, and for the year, the 
blue-chip index is up about 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While stocks fell today, bond prices rose as investors,  
concerned about the situation in Kosovo, sought the safety of U.S. 
Treasurys. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 5.54 
percent from 5.58 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.92 at 1,282.07, and  
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was off 6.67 at 
2,428.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 214.83 million 
shares, down from 262.37 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.75 at 601.11, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.16 at 712.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.7 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nestle Net Profit Up 2.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VEVEY, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss food giant Nestle SA's group  
profit rose 2.6 percent in 1998, beating analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle reported today it earned 4.29 billion Swiss francs, or  
$3.15 billion, up from a revised 4.18 billion francs for 1997. The 
1997 figure was previously reported as 4.0 billion francs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expected net profit of between 3.8 billion francs  
and 4 billion francs, based in part on the company's sales slump 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales amounted to 71.7 billion Swiss francs, or $52.72 billion,  
for 1998 versus 70 billion francs in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle products include Nestle Quik chocolate drinks, Taster's  
Choice coffee, Carnation condensed milk, Libby foods and Alpo pet 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle said it maintained profits by rapidly adapting to last  
year's volatile conditions in many markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit last year was 7.1 billion francs, up slightly  
from a restated 1997 operating profit of 7.057 billion francs, 
which the company reported originally as 6.88 billion francs. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the company expects more volatile business conditions,  
but higher profit and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it had revised 1997 figures due to an  
accounting change which uses the historical value system for 
amortization of tangible fixed assets rather than replacement value 
accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said Nestle used replacement value accounting when  
many countries had high inflation rates. It decided to change back 
to the historical system used by most companies because many 
economies now have much lower rates of inflation.

<HEADLINE> Owens Corning Can't Bar Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A judge has ruled that supposed physiological  
differences between races should not prevent black plaintiffs from 
suing Owens Corning over the health effects of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the company had argued that because blacks score  
consistently lower on tests to determine lung capacity, they should 
have to meet a higher standard to prove asbestos caused lung 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Circuit Judge Joseph H.H. Kaplan on Thursday reversed a  
guideline he wrote in 1992 that established who was eligible to 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, many of them former steelworkers and shipyard  
workers, claim they have diminished lung capacity because of their 
exposure to asbestos contained in fiberglass made by Owens Corning. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the plaintiffs said the company's argument about  
differing lung capacity was based on phony science. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't apply a different standard to the races,'' said  
Peter Nicholl. ``You're talking about the fundamental right to have 
access to the courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Corning stopped manufacturing products containing asbestos  
in 1972. Since then, the company has been hit with hundreds of 
thousands of lawsuits from people who worked with products 
containing asbestos and developed a lung disease called asbestosis. 
The disease shrinks the lungs, among other symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, the company announced a $1.2 billion settlement  
resolving about 176,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Kaplan set guidelines to cope with the 12,000 asbestos  
cases filed in Baltimore's courts. He wrote that predicted lung 
test values ``shall be corrected for race or ethnic origin as 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after hearing testimony from medical experts, Kaplan decided  
there was no reason to use a different medical standard for whites 
and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not convinced of the validity of race correction for this  
purpose,'' Kaplan concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Corning spokeswoman Tricia Ingraham and defense attorney  
Steve Vaccaro declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Corning based its argument largely on a 1991 report by the  
American Thoracic Society, the medical branch of the American Lung 
Association, that found blacks consistently score lower on 
pulmonary function tests. The Lung Association declined to comment 
further on the 1991 report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Paul Epstein, a pulmonary specialist with the University of  
Pennsylvania, testified on the company's behalf that scientific 
data shows whites and blacks have different lung capacities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Stephen Zimmen, a pulmonary specialist in Virginia who  
testified for the plaintiffs, said there are a number of other 
factors more important than race in determining someone's lung 
capacity, such as age, height, gender, socioeconomic conditions and 
nutrition.

<HEADLINE> General Cigar Sells a Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- General Cigar Holdings Inc. is selling its  
mass-market cigar business that includes brands like White Owl and 
Tiparillo to the Swedish cigar maker Swedish Match AB for $200 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the sale announced today are General Cigar  
manufacturing plants in Dothan, Ala., and Santiago, Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	General Cigar officials said the sale will allow the company to  
focus on its larger premium cigar business which includes brands 
like Macanudo, Partagas and Punch. It plans to use proceeds from 
the sale to reduce debts. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, New York-based General Cigar will  
continue to supply tobacco to Swedish Match for the brands being 
sold. The brands being sold also include Garcia y Vega and Tijuana 
Smalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish Match's sales force, meanwhile, will start selling some  
General Cigar premium brands in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish Match said the purchase will complement its existing  
operations in the U.S. cigar business. Swedish Match also makes 
matches and lighters sold in 140 countries. It is based in 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by regulators but is expected to  
close by the end of April, the companies said in a joint statement.

<HEADLINE> Grievance Filed Against Suns Mascot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The NBA Players Association has filed a complaint  
on behalf of Sacramento Kings player Oliver Miller against the 
Phoenix Suns for a skit the team's mascot The Gorilla did making 
fun over Miller's weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``For an obese, black ugly ape to portray a professional  
African-American basketball player was very offensive,'' Miller's 
agent, Jeff Blakely, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Shank, senior vice president for corporate sales for the  
Suns, issued a statement Friday saying the skit ``was one in a long 
line of 18 years worth of parodies of coaches and players performed 
by the premier mascot in all of team sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no malicious intent in what The Gorilla did,'' Shank  
said. ``It was simply spoofing a professional athlete whose 
livelihood is made by his athletic prowess. We are certainly sorry 
if this affected him detrimentally at all, and we wish him well in 
controlling any weight problem he may have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known whether the apology would satisfy Miller, who  
hasn't ruled out a lawsuit, Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
	The skit was performed during a timeout of an Feb. 9 game  
between the Kings and Suns at America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gorilla came onto the court about double his normal girth,  
wearing a Kings' No. 8 jersey with Miller's name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	After several weight-related antics, The Gorilla tumbled to the  
floor, couldn't get up and had to be rolled off the court as the 
crowd roared. Even some of the Kings players laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakely, who witnessed the skit, said Miller was mortified,  
especially because his children and in-laws were in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Oliver during the incident and I could tell it was very  
demoralizing, very demeaning,'' Blakely said. ``It hit him very 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blakely has said that the incident worsened Miller's condition,  
causing him to become even more overweight. Miller, listed at 370 
pounds but probably heavier than that, is on the Kings' injured 
list with back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakely also said it seems odd for a team in the NBA, in which  
most players are black, would have a black gorilla as a mascot. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns forward Cliff Robinson, who is black, said he doesn't see  
The Gorilla, or the Miller skit, as racist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find what he does to be quite funny,'' Robinson said. ``I  
didn't think it (the skit) was racist. At the time, everybody 
laughed.''

<HEADLINE> Brand, Ellis Win AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Duke sophomore center Elton Brand  
and Auburn's Cliff Ellis were honored today by The Associated Press 
as college basketball's player and coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the only unanimous All-America selection this season,  
enters the Final Four averaging 17.8 points and 9.6 rebounds for 
the top-ranked Blue Devils, who have won a school-record 31 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Brand has had 17 double-doubles this season, nine  
in the last 15 games and two in the Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament. Brand is shooting 62 percent from the field and he has 
83 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand received 28 votes from AP member newspapers and radio  
stations, while senior guard Andre Miller of Utah was runner-up 
with 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is the third Duke player to win the Adolph Rupp Trophy,  
following Art Heyman in 1963 and Christian Laettner in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis led Auburn to one the best seasons in school history as  
the Tigers finished 29-4, a school record for victories, and 
reached their highest ranking ever, No. 2. Auburn, which finished 
as the Southeastern Conference's regular-season champion, was 
fourth in the final rankings and earned a No. 1 seeding in the NCAA 
tournament, losing to Ohio State in the regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, who has been at Auburn since 1994, has compiled a 444-271  
record in 24 seasons as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He received 36 votes for coach of the year, 17 more than  
runner-up Jim O'Brien of Ohio State. Ellis is the first Auburn 
coach to win the award and the second from the SEC in the 1990s, 
joining Eddie Fogler of Vanderbilt in 1993.

<HEADLINE> B-2 Bomber Pilots Happy To Be Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOB NOSTER, Mo. (AP) -- The pilots who flew the B-2 stealth  
bombers in Yugoslavia -- their first use in combat -- were happy with 
the jet's performance after traveling for 31 hours straight to 
deliver their payload. 
</P>
<P>
	``This first use of the B-2s in combat has got every heart on  
the base thumping and pride swelling across this entire state and 
across the nation,'' said Gen. Leroy Barnidge, commander of the 
509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base, 50 miles east of Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades after its conception as a highly sophisticated  
stealth bomber, America's B-2 got its first taste of combat this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Four B-2s flew 13 hours -- with several refuelings in the air --  
to reach their targets. They spent a few hours in the target area 
before returning home unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were nervous going in, as you would be on the first time  
a new weapon system is used in combat, just like the F-117 pilots 
were nervous in the Gulf War,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash. ``But 
they're back and it's a great team effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, has  
supported billions of dollars in military spending for the B-2 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	Each bat-winged, radar-evading plane carried 16 one-ton weapons  
for hits on targets such as command bunkers and air-defense 
systems, according to a senior defense official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the B-2 was selected because of its ability to  
attack many targets and its heavy payload. The F-117 Stealth 
bomber, also used in the fighting, carries only two bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a pilot and co-pilot aboard, the B-2 also puts fewer  
crewmen at risk than the B-52, which unleashed cruise missiles from 
launch points outside Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks said the pilots were upbeat and relieved to be back  
safely. One returned from the trip Thursday morning and mowed his 
lawn that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came home and his wife said, `You've got to mow the lawn,'  
and he did,'' Dicks said with a grin. ``I thought that was very 
funny.''

<HEADLINE> Sore Hip Forces Daly Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- John Daly withdrew from The  
Players Championship today because of a sore hip, an exit far less 
dramatic than his one two years ago following an all-night drinking 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's hip has been ailing all year, and he walked with a  
significant limp toward the end of his opening-round 83 on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to the course to tell tournament officials he could not  
continue and left without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Daly withdrew from the Players after a night of  
drinking. He damaged his hotel room and was hospitalized for chest 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
	The former British and PGA Championship winner, Daly has  
finished no higher than 14th in seven events this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he had only two top-10 finishes. His most lasting  
image came at the Greater Vancouver Open, when he burst into tears 
and began shaking during the opening round. He said it was because 
of his battle with alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	His only memorable impression from this tournament: waiting for  
a judge's ruling after he hit a ball onto a folding chair just off 
the eighth green Thursday.

<HEADLINE> NHL Draft Expanded to Two Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- The young stars who will guide the NHL  
into the new century will be unveiled in Calgary in 2000 -- with a 
new twist. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL announced Friday that Calgary was selected ahead of six  
other cities to stage the 2000 entry draft. And with NHL expansion 
swelling membership to 30 teams by then, the event will be held 
over two days for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a lot longer to conduct a draft than it did back at  
the turn of the decade when we had 21 teams,'' said Frank Supovitz, 
NHL vice president of special events. ``It's sheer arithmetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Thrashers begin play in 1999-2000, one year ahead of  
both the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild. The addition of 
the three means 30 franchises will participate in the nine-round 
draft June 24-25, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The first three rounds will be held June 24. The remaining six  
rounds will go the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL also announced it will hold the 2000 expansion draft in  
Calgary the day before the entry draft. That will allow both 
Columbus and Minnesota to stock their rosters with experienced 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's announcement Friday is a big deal considering the top  
hockey officials and prospects will all be gathered in Calgary. The 
economic impact of the draft to the Alberta city is estimated at 
more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual entry draft has turned into a bonanza since its  
humble beginning in 1963, when it was held at the Queen Elizabeth 
Hotel in Montreal and only 21 players were chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	This will mark the second time the draft has been held in  
Alberta. Edmonton staged the '95 event. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's entry draft will be held in Boston on June 26.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Finish Week Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today amid  
uncertainty about the Yugoslavian situation as buying was promoted 
by Japanese institutional investors. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 
main index continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 30.95 points,  
or 0.19 percent, closing the week at 16,016.99. On Thursday, the 
index rose 470.57 points, or 3.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.76 yen in the late afternoon, up 0.90 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 118.13 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of today's trading in Tokyo, the dollar stayed in a  
narrow range as Japanese investors adjusted positions ahead of the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. currency shot up late in the afternoon as Japanese  
banks covered their short, or oversold, dollar positions amid 
uncertainty about the situation in Yugoslavia, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO aircraft and missiles blasted targets in Yugoslavia  
Thursday for a second day, directing much of their fire on Kosovo 
where fighting raged between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied leaders said the airstrikes would continue until Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic signs up to an internationally 
supervised peace agreement in Kosovo which has been accepted by 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency is often considered a safe haven in times of  
international turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said another positive factor for the dollar was concern  
that Japanese financial authorities may intervene in the foreign 
exchange market to stem the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 117.97 yen and 118.96 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.78 yen, up from  
128.16 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, there was strong buying interest from  
foreign and individual investors early in the session following an 
overnight 169.55-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
The Dow Jones average closed Thursday at 9,836.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that profit-taking and position  
adjustment among investors ahead of the weekend were capping the 
market's upside. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 532  
million shares, down from Thursday's 663 million shares. Despite 
the Nikkei's advance, retreating issues outnumbered advancers 633 
to 568, with 107 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 11.95 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,267.78. 
The TOPIX posted a 22.34-point, or 1.81 percent, gain the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the new benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.815 percent from Thursday's finish of 
1.880 percent, driving its price up to 99.87 yen from 99.31 yen.

<HEADLINE> Saint Louis Hires Basketball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Lorenzo Romar has earned a reputation as a top  
recruiter. On Friday, after being introduced as Saint Louis' 
basketball coach, Romar seemed intent on landing a 59-year-old 
recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Charlie Spoonhour this morning,'' Romar said. ``I  
hope that he continues to stay close to this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, who retired March 5, was 122-90 in seven seasons at  
Saint Louis. He led the Billikens to three NCAA tournament 
appearances and one National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was at UCLA (as an assistant coach), I developed a  
relationship with John Wooden,'' Romar said. ``I'd love to be able 
to do the same thing with Charlie Spoonhour. He made this 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, through a combination of his on-court success and  
homespun humor, remains a popular figure in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	In three years as coach at Pepperdine, Romar took a struggling  
program and turned it around. The Wave were 10-18 the year before 
Romar arrived. He went 6-21 his first year, but followed that with 
17-10 and 19-13 seasons. This year's team earned a berth in the 
NIT, losing to Colorado in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	But Saint Louis officials and players seemed equally as  
impressed with Romar's work as an assistant under Jim Harrick at 
UCLA. Romar was credited with helping to recruit players such as 
Toby Bailey, Cameron Dollar and Charles O'Bannon, the core group of 
the 1995 national championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully he can take us to the next level,'' guard Troy  
Robertson, who was part of the search committee, said. ``They say 
that recruiting is 75 percent of your program. His recruiting 
speaks for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported that Romar will earn about  
$400,000 annually, including shoe and television-radio deals. Romar 
reportedly made about $125,000 at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar, 40, played at Cerritos (Calif.) Community College and  
Washington, before beginning his pro basketball career with Golden 
State, where he played from 1980-1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar finished his NBA career with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1984,  
then joined Athletes in Action. He became player/co-coach of 
Athletes in Action in 1989 and continued in that capacity until 
joining Harrick's staff at UCLA in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, to me, is a coach's dream,'' Romar said. ``I said it  
would take something pretty special to make me leave Malibu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saint Louis was 15-16 this season under Spoonhour.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombings Worry Soccer Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Yugoslav soccer players, many of them stars  
for top European clubs, are questioning whether they should play 
during the NATO bombing of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedrag Mijatovic of Real Madrid said that if he had a game in  
the next few days, ``I wouldn't be able to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed he and his compatriots are not calling for a strike  
or boycott but want to draw attention to their country's plight. He 
said each player must decide for himself how to act. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Yugoslav soccer federation was reported to have  
backed a call by Mijatovic, Dragan Stojkovic of Japan's Grampus 
Eight and Dejan Savicevic of Yugoslavia's Red Star, urging Yugoslav 
players in NATO member-nation clubs to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	On returning to Madrid on Thursday following the cancellation of  
Yugoslavia's European qualifier against Croatia because of the 
conflict, Mijatovic said: 
</P>
<P>
	``Together with our federation we have to help our compatriots.  
Right now, I couldn't concentrate on a soccer game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen the bombs fall, I have seen the fear in people,''  
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Any such protest could severely affect clubs across Europe,  
particularly in Spain and Italy, where some 20 Yugoslav players 
play. But on Friday few players appeared determined to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Yugoslavs also star for western European clubs in  
other sports, particularly basketball and handball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm worried for my parents. ... I have not taken any decision.  
I will discuss it with my teammates,'' Dejan Stankovic of the 
Italian soccer team Lazio told a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	In England, Sheffield Wednesday's Dejan Stefanovic was reported  
to be considering a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two Yugoslav handball stars, Nenad Perunicic and  
Goran Stojanovic, who play for Germany's Kiel, said they'd miss the 
German cup final because they are trying to go home to see their 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Yugoslav soccer players who returned to Spain on  
Thursday were open about their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly in life there are priorities. The bombing continues  
and neither I nor my companions are in condition to play soccer,'' 
Tenerife's Slavis Jokanovic told the newspaper El Pais. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to his family in the Yugoslav town of Novi Sad,  
Jokanovic said: ``They are filled with fear. But they know they are 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	``My people have their ideas, in Spain you have yours, which  
come from the United States and, as they are the most powerful, 
they're (considered) right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veljko Paunovic, who plays for Mallorca, was equally critical.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand it. They (NATO) are punishing a country  
that is fighting terrorists just as Spain fights ETA,'' he said, in 
reference to Spain's conflict with the armed Basque separatist 
group that has killed nearly 800 people in its bid for 
independence.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Maintains Military Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As he guides the U.S. role in the NATO  
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, President Clinton is not hunched in a war 
room, surrounded by maps and stern generals in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	His preferred setting is the Oval Office, with foreign policy  
advisers in business suits -- and at least one in uniform -- settled 
back on yellow sofas. He's not drawing ``a line in the sand'' as 
President Bush did with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	With no military experience, Clinton avoids the image of the  
saber-rattling commander-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The style seems to be to bring the two sides together, then  
carry a big stick,'' said John Mueller, a University of Rochester 
political scientist who has written about presidents and war. ``The 
hope is that the threat would be enough. That works fine if they 
capitulate. If they don't, you're left with the dilemma of using 
the stick or looking foolish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the assault two days old, the president had a videotaped  
message beamed into Yugoslavia by satellite and sent on the 
Internet Friday. That tactic -- friendly words for a nation's people 
while military action is focused against its leader -- is one 
Clinton has used before, with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Clinton also had Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright -- whose father was a Czech diplomat in Belgrade prior to 
World War II -- deliver a message in the Serbs' own language. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello. I am glad to have this opportunity to speak directly to  
the people of Serbia at this critical time,'' she said. ``As you 
can see, I remember a little Serbian, albeit with a Czech accent. 
... '' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is the first president in a half-century to lack a  
military background. He seemed uncomfortable about that during his 
first term, even going to the lengths of taking lessons in saluting 
from former National Security Adviser Tony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of his lack of experience and because he is the first  
of the post-World War II, Vietnam-generation presidents, he has 
tended to be more deferential to military points of view than 
others,'' said Ivon Daalder, who served as the National Security 
Council's director of European affairs during Clinton's first term. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not been willing to take on the military, even if it  
was evident that doing so may have served his purposes, foreign 
policy and otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when delivering a sensitive foreign policy message, such as  
his address to the nation from the Oval Office earlier this week, 
Clinton doesn't simply recite the lines his security experts hand 
him. He constantly reworks the texts. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first term, Clinton oversaw U.S. intervention in  
Somalia, where 18 soldiers died, and oversaw the humiliating 
withdrawal of American forces. He sent troops to Haiti in a 
successful mission to reinstate elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, then passed off command to a multinational peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, there were the airstrikes over Bosnia. There were no  
American fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Well into his second term, Clinton is more at ease. Last fall,  
he ordered airstrikes on Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for 
bombings at American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. There have 
been several flare-ups with Iraq, and earlier this year nearly 
daily bombings on Iraqi sites. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander-in-chief, Clinton is ``detail oriented,'' said  
David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council. ``He asks 
a lot of questions and demands a lot of answers. He has made clear 
that he wants to be briefed on any and all important developments. 
He wants to think two or three moves down the chessboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In times like these, aides say, Clinton is a hands-on manager --  
but not so hands-on that he feels he should select bombing targets 
as Lyndon Johnson sometimes did during the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> Peterson Leads Michigan State Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- He's the team's leading scorer. He's  
all-Big Ten. Morris Peterson can do it all for Michigan State. He 
just can't start. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about what's best for the team,'' Peterson said  
Friday. ``We all check our egos at the door. That's what makes us 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4) have won 22 straight games to reach the  
Final Four for the first time in 20 years. But if they want to 
match the national championship of Magic Johnson's 1979 team, 
they'll have to beat top-ranked Duke (36-1) in the semifinals 
Saturday night at Tropicana Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Through their 37 games, the Spartans' bench has averaged 26.5  
points, outscoring the opponents' reserves 982-553. In their 
comeback win over Kentucky in the Midwest Regional, the Spartans 
bench had a 35-27 edge over the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	The key is Peterson, the only sixth man in the Big Ten to earn  
first team all-conference honors. Peterson is averaging 13.5 points 
and is second on the team in rebounding, averaging 5.6 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	So why doesn't he start?  
</P>
<P>
	``Because I think it's what's best for the team,'' coach Tom  
Izzo said before putting the squad through practice. ``He's an 
exceptional player. He can play maybe four positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus, he brings such instant offense to our team. There are  
times we just need that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans' offense frequently shuts down for minutes at a  
time. They needed seven free throws over the final 44 seconds to 
hold off Oklahoma 54-46 to advance to the regional finals. They 
fell behind Kentucky, 17-4, but Peterson, who had 19 points and 10 
rebounds, hit six straight free throws in the final 29 seconds to 
seal a 73-66 comeback win. 
</P>
<P>
	He was selected outstanding player of the Midwest Regional for  
that effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We depend on our bench players,'' said point guard Mateen  
Cleaves, the team's charismatic leader. ``Other teams, they hope 
their bench is going to come in and play well. We depend on ours to 
do that -- to pick us up, to play defense and to score some big 
points for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke beat the Spartans 73-67 in the Great Eight in Chicago. That  
was back in December, but the Blue Devils remember that Peterson 
scored 24 points against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if it's because he's fresher, or if he helps the  
team's flow,'' Duke forward Elton Brand said. ``But he really 
sparks that team. We're going to have to be very aware of him when 
he comes in, because he's a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he has eight players averaging 15 or more minutes a  
game, Izzo is confident his team will be strong to the very end. It 
is one reason the Spartans have won six games by five points or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's why Izzo isn't afraid of Duke.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably been bigger upsets than Michigan State  
against Duke,'' Izzo said. ``But I don't lie to our guys. If they 
don't play their `A' game, there's not many teams that can beat 
Duke. Our job is to see that THEY don't play their `A' game.''

<HEADLINE> Profile of Shepard Slaying Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Like the gay college student he is accused  
of killing, Russell Henderson is a slightly built young man who was 
raised on the dusty high plains of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 10 months apart in age, Henderson and Matthew Shepard wound  
up in the same city, where they frequented some of the same 
nightspots and even had mutual acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	But when their paths crossed back in October, they were heading  
in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard was educated in Europe and  
had big plans for the future, Henderson, at 5-feet-7, 138 pounds, 
was a high school dropout who held unskilled jobs. He had had minor 
scuffles with the law, but no history of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, his buddy Aaron McKinney and Shepard met in a college  
bar last fall. Eighteen hours later, Shepard was found near death, 
tied to a fence, bloodied by a pistol-whipping. Henderson was 
jailed after trying to outrun a police officer and was soon named a 
suspect in Shepard's death. McKinney was arrested soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection continued Friday in Henderson's trial on charges  
of murdering Shepard. McKinney is scheduled to stand trial on 
identical charges in August. Both men could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege Henderson and McKinney, both 21, pretended to be  
homosexuals, lured Shepard out of the Fireside Lounge and took him 
to a remote area east of Laramie and attacked him. They believe 
Henderson and McKinney intended to rob Shepard, but also targeted 
him in part because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's girlfriend is awaiting sentencing after pleading  
guilty Dec. 23 to accessory after the fact to murder. McKinney's 
girlfriend goes on trial in May on an accessory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preview of his defense strategy, attorney Wyatt Skaggs told  
prospective jurors this week that Henderson witnessed the beating 
but did not participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Sept. 24, 1977, Henderson was raised by his mother, Cindy  
Dixon, who often left him in the care of his grandparents and 
aunts. 
</P>
<P>
	Little is known about Henderson's father, and his mother died of  
exposure in January on a two-lane road north of Laramie, several 
hours after she left a bar. Police said it may have been an 
accidental death. 
</P>
<P>
	At school, Henderson blended in with the crowd, just another  
dark-haired, polite young man. One of his childhood loves was 
scouting. He earned 21 merit badges to become an Eagle Scout. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson dropped out of high school and moved out of his  
grandmother's home. He piled up a series of petty offenses, mostly 
traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, Henderson took a night job at Taco Bell, said Tammy  
Shields, his manager at the time. ``He was always on time and, if 
he wasn't he would always call and let us know,'' she said. ``He 
just didn't say much. He went and did everything you told him to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Henderson and McKinney were hired by a roofing  
company, working long hours, said Doc O'Connor, who also owns Doc's 
Western Village apartments and gave McKinney a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russ was a very mellow, mild man,'' O'Connor said. ``He didn't  
talk that much but was very polite and well-mannered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's life took a bad turn shortly after midnight on Oct.  
7 when police responding to a vandalism call spotted Henderson and 
McKinney as they got out of a black pickup and crouched down. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Flint Waters turned on the patrol car's lights and the  
two men bolted in different directions. Waters tackled Henderson a 
half-block away when the young man was by slowed by hedges in a 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Waters found a bloody .357 Magnum in the back of the  
pickup and asked Henderson if it had been fired. According to 
police, Henderson laughed and said, ``I guarantee you won't find 
anyone with a bullet in them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the police eventually found was a badly beaten Shepard, who  
died five days later.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Temperature Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A temperature change of only a few degrees can  
disrupt a community of animals, according to a researcher who 
studied how hot and cold affects the delicate balance of starfish 
and mussels in Oregon's tidal waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Sanford of Oregon State University said his study,  
published today in the journal Science, suggests that if a key 
species in a community of animals is particularly sensitive to 
temperatures, a slight warming or cooling can start a whole cascade 
of rapid changes affecting every animal in an ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said in an interview that he found a 5-degree change in  
temperature is enough to change dramatically the feeding habits of 
the starfish, a five-armed creature that feeds mainly on mussels 
and is common along the Pacific coast of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding, said Sanford, has important implications for  
understanding the effects of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people have assumed that the effects of climate change  
would be gradual,'' the researcher said in an interview. ``But this 
shows that if an important species in a community is highly 
sensitive to temperature, then the effects of a small temperature 
change can happen rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his study, Sanford tracked the feeding patterns of starfish  
kept in the laboratory at different temperatures. He checked his 
results by manipulating the population of starfish and mussels in 
two areas along the Oregon coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford found that a temperature drop of 5 degrees caused the  
starfish to virtually stop feeding on the mussels. This allows the 
mussels to rapidly expand in population. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, when the water temperature was increased by 5  
degrees, Sanford said starfish went on a feeding binge, quickly 
reducing the population of mussels. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, he said, there are dramatic changes in the tidal  
community of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	When mussels are not controlled by starfish, said Sanford, their  
population explodes. The mussels attach themselves to every surface 
in the near-shore tidal zone, crowding out barnacles, algae and 
other organisms. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take away the sea stars, then you go from an ecosystem  
with a diverse population of species to a system where there is 
essentially only one species,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	When starfish eat too much, he said, the reef-like mussel  
communities quickly start falling apart. These reefs, Sanford said, 
are homes for crab, sea cucumbers and worms, all important parts of 
the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures along the Oregon coast are affected by upwelling,  
cold deep waters surging to the surface. The frequency of 
upwellings, said Sanford, is determined by winds that, in turn, are 
affected by global temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	If cold upwellings become less frequent, starfish may eat more  
mussels, said Sanford; if the upwellings happen more often, thus 
cooling the tidal waters, starfish will eat less, allowing the 
mussel population to suddenly explode.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Daschle Forms PAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a change of heart, Senate Minority Leader  
Tom Daschle has formed a political action committee to raise money 
for Democratic congressional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle has advocated banning PACs and used to say it would be  
hypocritical for him to have one. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fund-raising tool that Republicans have used to far  
greater advantage than Democrats. And with the two parties relying 
more heavily than ever on unregulated ``soft-money'' contributions, 
Daschle said he has decided that PACs may be one of the ``cleanest 
and most appropriate'' ways to finance campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This money is fully reported and limited. Soft money is not,''  
Daschle said Friday. ``I've come to the belief that this is the 
best way to do it, which is not a belief I had initially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle's new operation is called DASH PAC, as in Dedicated  
Americans for the Senate and House. Dallas investor Cappy McGarr, a 
longtime Daschle contributor, will be chairman. The committee plans 
to hold its first fund-raiser in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call first reported Daschle's  
new PAC. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers solicit contributions for PACs, then distribute the  
money to colleagues and candidates. That allows contributors 
essentially to give twice to the same candidate, once directly, 
then through a leadership PAC. 
</P>
<P>
	Leadership PACs distributed $10.8 million during the 1998  
campaign, with 72 percent of the money going to GOP candidates, 
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks 
campaign fund raising. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott handed out 
almost $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 senators have them, two-thirds of them Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats need to net just six seats to reclaim control of the  
House in 2000. Regaining control of the Senate, which would make 
Daschle majority leader, is not out of the question. Republicans 
now have a 55-45 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do everything we can to get the majority back  
and elect more people who think like Tom Daschle,'' said Michael 
Meehan, Daschle's political director.

<HEADLINE> Baby Born From Dead Father's Sperm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman has given birth to a baby conceived  
using sperm retrieved from her husband hours after he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaby Vernoff delivered a girl March 17 at a Los Angeles  
hospital, said Dr. Cappy Rothman, a urologist and the director of 
the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothman, who led a team of doctors that extracted the sperm,  
claimed it was the first time such a procedure had led to a birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This opens up a new avenue of opportunities for families of a  
man who has died,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the birth were not provided. Rothman referred  
questions to a family spokeswoman who did not return a call seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Vernoff's husband, Bruce Vernoff, was in his early 30s when  
he died of an allergic reaction. Thirty hours after his death and 
at his wife's request, his sperm was retrieved and frozen. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 months later, the sperm were used to fertilize eggs  
from Mrs. Vernoff. One of the eggs was implanted in her uterus and 
she became pregnant last July. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics  
at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said there were 
at least 45 cases nationwide where someone had requested sperm be 
retrieved from a dead man, but that no births had resulted.

<HEADLINE> CBS To Sever Online Sportsbook Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- In response to concerns raised by  
the NCAA, an Internet company partially owned by CBS will sever 
ties to an online sportsbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to support the NCAA's aggressive  
anti-gambling efforts,'' CBS spokeswoman LeslieAnn Wade said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, NCAA executive director Cedric Dempsey had  
expressed unease over broadcast partner CBS' ties to 
Sportsbook.com, a popular Web site that takes offshore bets on the 
NCAA tournament. With the TV contract running through 2002, Dempsey 
said the NCAA could do little to force the network's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``But as we look toward renewing a contract, or negotiating a  
new one, any relationship to gambling would certainly influence our 
thinking,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade said CBS was unaware of the relationship between Sportsline  
USA, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Internet company that produces 
the CBS Sportsline site and Sportsbook.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportsline USA president Michael Levy confirmed that his company  
leased the Sportsbook.com Web site address -- known as an URL, or 
universal resource locator -- to a gambling operation run by Global 
Internet, a company based in the Caribbean. Although CBS owns a 20 
percent stake in Sportline USA, Levy said he was uncertain whether 
he had informed his corporate partner of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey said even though the connection to CBS was distant, the  
NCAA was sensitive to the appearance of impropriety. The 
organization has been rocked by point-shaving and gambling scandals 
in recent years, including the indictment of Northwestern 
basketball players on the eve of last year's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, NCAA officials threw their support behind a  
U.S. Senate bill designed to limit gambling on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade said once the network became aware of the connection  
between its internet operation and Sportsbook.com, CBS took 
immediate action to sever it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sportsline USA has assured CBS that the URL currently leased  
to Sportsbook.com will be sold,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for a time frame, Wade replied, ``It's imminent.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan Approves Renault Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. on Saturday formally approved  
French automaker Renault SA's offer to purchase a major stake in 
its troubled, debt-laden operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came at a special board meeting Saturday morning,  
said Nissan spokeswoman Kaori Tsuji. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsuji said Renault Chairman Louis Schweitzer and Nissan  
President Yoshikazu Hanawa would hold a press conference in the 
afternoon to announce details of the agreement after signing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have placed the size of Renault's proposed investment in  
Nissan stock at between $5 billion and $6.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports say the stake is likely to be as high as 35 percent,  
which would make Renault the largest shareholder in Nissan, Japan's 
second largest carmaker.

<HEADLINE> Knowing When To Buy and Sell Stock / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the stock market fluctuates and paper profits  
roll in and out, investors may be wondering whether they should 
sell or keep certain shares. Knowing how to pick and choose can be 
a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do not have seasoned tools -- which most people don't --  
in order to gauge the market in good and bad times, it becomes 
important to stick to the fundamentals,'' said A.C. Moore, chief 
investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, 
Calif. ``We like to associate with issues that have an inherent 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	``That value will see an investor through turbulent times.''  
</P>
<P>
	The ``fundamentals,'' which market watchers look for, are the  
basic tenets of a company, like its business objectives, management 
team, products and investment strategies, along with its earnings, 
market share and standing within an industry. In other words: what 
makes it tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Good fundamentals are often reflected in a company's stock  
price, but that's not always the case. Sometimes, a stock can get 
caught up in market frenzy, rising and falling based simply on 
emotion or other factors that have little to do with how a company 
is performing. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market can be a fickle place, as was evidenced  
recently with the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index 
crossed over the milestone 10,000 mark on three separate days last 
week, but in each case retreated before the day was done. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar scenario occurred about nine years ago: The Dow  
briefly crossed a then-record 3,000 twice in mid-July 1990, but 
didn't actually close above that level until mid-April 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Average investors, therefore, should avoid ``timing'' the  
market, or trying to profit from short-term fluctuations in share 
prices. That's something best attempted by professionals using 
sophisticated ``technical'' analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be willing to accept short-term ups and downs if  
you want to be there for the long-term,'' said Larry Elkin, a 
financial consultant from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point, though, it may be prudent, or necessary, to sell  
a stock. You may simply need the money -- so, why not collect a tidy 
profit from a rising issue? Changing investment objectives also 
must be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason to sell is because a company's business has  
deteriorated, and that can be due to changing fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be new management or lower profits because of poor  
sales or economic conditions. A company also may come under 
pressure because of a crippling legal liability, or an entire 
industry may get into trouble due to unfavorable market trends. 
</P>
<P>
	One piece of bad news is often followed by more, so it's  
important for investors to keep current on media and professional 
analysts' reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial advisers say it's usually better to bite the bullet  
and sell if a company is consistently underperforming, and most 
prefer to give a stock at least 12 weeks from the time it was 
purchased before making a move. After all, hefty losses can drag 
down overall performance of a portfolio for years. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Association of Individual Investors,  
when a stock drops 10 percent, investors will need an 11 percent 
gain from another stock to break even. With a 50 percent loss, the 
break-even point rises to a 100 percent gain, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	``When picking stocks, the first thing you need to do is decide  
what your downside loss to aggregate profit is going to be. How 
much can you afford to lose?'' said Hank Madden, who runs a 
financial consulting firm from Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Diversifying can help dilute the losses. Madden advises clients  
to keep between 12 to 15 different stocks in their portfolio, and 
each issue should represent no more than 15 percent of the 
portfolio's value. 
</P>
<P>
	The price-earnings ratio, which is a stock's current market  
price divided by the company's earnings per share for the past 12 
months, should also be watched. A high ratio indicates investors 
are expecting strong future earnings, while a low ratio usually 
means less optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore says many stocks these days have a higher than normal  
price-earnings ratio, which he believes shows the stock is 
overpriced and has room to fall. Ironically, some Internet stocks, 
which have been soaring in price in recent months, actually have no 
price-earnings ratios since the companies have yet to post a 
profit. And that also makes many financial advisers nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore says he's staying away from the Internet bubble,  
preferring ``staple'' companies, like food processors, grocers and 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	And he says he's taking in stride all the recent the ups and  
downs of the Dow and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.

<HEADLINE> Players Championship Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A sore hip and a bad round forced  
John Daly out of The Players Championship on Friday, a far 
different scene than when he withdrew after a drinking binge in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly dropped out before the second round began. He shot an  
11-over-par 83 in the opening round Thursday and appeared headed 
for an early exit either way. 
</P>
<P>
	His left hip has been bothering him since the PGA Tour began its  
swing through Florida earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He first injured his hip at Doral,'' said Daly's agent, John  
Mascatello. ``It flared up again at Honda. He took off Bay Hill 
because he wanted to be rested for TPC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy didn't work, so Daly opted to visit the athletic  
trainer at the University of Arkansas, where he played college 
golf, for further treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mascatello didn't think the injury would force Daly to miss the  
Masters. Still, there was no sense in playing another round when it 
seemed clear he would not make the cut here. 
</P>
<P>
	It was two years ago that Daly withdrew from the Players after  
an all-night drinking session during which he damaged his hotel 
room and was hospitalized for chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
	A former British Open and PGA champion, Daly has finished no  
higher than 14th in seven events this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he had only two top-10 finishes. His most lasting  
image came in the Greater Vancouver Open, when he burst into tears 
and began shaking during the opening round. He said it was a result 
of his continuing battle with alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUVAL HOT STREAK:* Each year, this is one of Bob Duval's  
toughest decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Does he stay near home to watch his son, David, in the Players,  
or does he travel west to play in the Emerald Coast Classic, the 
senior-tour event in Pensacola? 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval decided to travel and was rewarded by shooting a  
career-low, 9-under-par 61 in the first round at the Moors Golf 
Club. The round was one stroke off the senior tour record. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about that, he took me by eight,'' David Duval said after  
a round of 69 left him in second place. ``I don't think the golf 
course is as hard, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dad also has some work to do to catch David Duval's record-tying  
59 in the Bob Hope Classic in January. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JOE'S CADDIE:* Drake Oddy doesn't understand everything the  
Japanese-speaking Joe Ozaki says. 
</P>
<P>
	He does, however, understand the second-round leader's game and  
American golf courses. That's how he landed a part-time gig as 
Ozaki's caddie for tournaments in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once he came over here on tour full-time, he needed someone  
who understood the differences between California, Arizona and 
Florida -- the different grasses and things you run into,'' Oddy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two hooked up in 1993 after Oddy spent about five years on  
Mark Calcavecchia's bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozaki plays between 15 and 20 tournaments in the United States  
each year, enough to ensure he keeps his PGA card. He returns to 
Japan for another 12 or so. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ozaki dropped Oddy for his first few events in the  
United States, opting for a Japanese caddie who helped him to a hot 
streak in the Far East at the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozaki shared the lead in the Players after the first two rounds,  
but ended up finishing 18th. Later in the season, he re-upped with 
Oddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The caddies in Japan are really more willing to go with  
whatever the player says,'' Oddy said. ``If the player says, `It's 
210 yards over water, it's into the wind, is an 8-iron OK?' They'll 
say, OK. I don't say much, unless it's really obvious. But we talk 
a lot about yardages.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOOSE BRUCE:* Maybe Bruce Lietzke has the right idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Every few weeks, he packs up the golf bag, heads to the Dallas  
airport and travels to the upcoming PGA tour site for a couple 
rounds of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	If he happens to play well, he makes a few thousand dollars, but  
he claims that's almost incidental. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's mostly a self-motivational deal,'' said Lietzke,  
who shot a 68 to finish at 5-under, two strokes behind Ozaki. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really play golf to impress other people,'' he said.  
``I try to find out what I'm capable of doing myself. I love 
getting into a position like this, pulling off good shots, getting 
into positions to win tournaments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't won since 1994, but then again, he hasn't been killing  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Lietzke, 47, played in 10 tournaments last year and earned  
$377,000. His best finish was second in the Bob Hope Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The year before, he played in nine events. He hasn't played as  
many as 20 tournaments since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't known to practice too hard.  
</P>
<P>
	``My golf game doesn't seem to change a bit,'' Lietzke said.  
``My swing and my short game are consistent week in, week out. I 
seem to play better when I'm mentally fresh and I'm usually pretty 
mentally fresh.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STEWART-LYNX:* Payne Stewart can get rid of that bag he bought  
at the golf store. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, whose contract with Top-Flite was not renewed this  
year, wound up going to an Edwin Watts golf store to buy a bag. He 
used it when he won at Pebble Beach in February for his first 
victory in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Stewart said he was in no rush to sign a deal.  
Still, it didn't take long. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a three-year contract he signed with Golfsmith  
International Inc., the former PGA and U.S. Open winner began using 
a Lynx golf bag Friday. He should be carrying a newly designed set 
of forged-blade irons in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've enjoyed my greatest success with a traditional  
forged-blade clubhead design,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll continue to use his Mizuno irons until the design on the  
Lynx set is perfected. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing was part of Golfsmith's effort to bring Lynx back  
into the forefront after buying its assets last year following the 
company's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHARK TANKED:* Greg Norman headed the list of notables to miss  
the cut. He shot a 5-over 77 and finished the day at 5-over 149, 
missing the cut by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notables to miss the cut included U.S. Open champion Lee  
Janzen. Tim Herron, who won at Bay Hill last week, also missed, as 
did the player he beat in a playoff, Tom Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Bob Friend aced the par-3 eighth hole to mark the  
second straight day the TPC Stadium Course has given up a 
hole-in-one. Joey Sindelar aced the par-3 17th island hole 
Thursday. ... Fulton Allem got off to a sizzling start, going 
eagle-birdie-eagle-birdie on Nos. 2-5. He shot a 67 and finished at 
1-under. ... For the second straight day, Brian Henninger asked the 
volunteer carrying the score placard to remove his score from the 
display. He shot back-to-back 79s and missed the cut with a score 
of 14-over. ... First-round co-leaders Bob Estes and Brian Watts 
each shot 74 to finish at 2-under.

<HEADLINE> Ford Recalls 945,000 Cars, Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is recalling about 945,000  
cars and trucks to replace potentially defective cruise-control 
cables that could cause the accelerator to stick. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary recall announced Friday affects some 1998 and 1999  
models equipped with optional cruise control. The models are the 
Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles, Ford 
Ranger pickup, Mustang sport coupe, and 1999 Super Duty F-series 
pickup and chassis-cab. 
</P>
<P>
	Chassis-cabs are commonly used for motor homes and commercial  
vehicles. Of the 945,000 vehicles affected, 35,673 are in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is in the process of obtaining cruise-control cables to  
replace the defective ones and does not expect to have them in 
stock before mid-May. Until then, Ford is warning owners not to use 
their cruise-control system; dealers on request will disable the 
system at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said in a statement that in some of the vehicles the  
cruise-control cable could interfere with a pulley and prevent the 
accelerator from returning to idle when the cruise control is 
disengaged. The result is the car could continue to move at the set 
speed and cause an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of that happening, and operation of  
the vehicle is unaffected when the cruise control is off, Ford 
said. The problem was discovered by Ford engineers during a regular 
engineering review, spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest number of recalled vehicles is the Explorer and  
Mountaineer twins -- about 567,000. Ford did not reveal how much it 
expects the recall to cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified by mail  
starting Monday. Customers also can call Ford's customer relations 
number, 800-392-3673, to find out if their vehicle is subject to 
the recall; callers will be asked for the vehicle identification 
number, which can typically be found on the registration, insurance 
certificate or the door pillar. 
</P>
<P>
	The same information also can be obtained at a new Ford Web  
site: www.recall.ford.com.

<HEADLINE> Angelos: No Ulterior Motive in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Owner Peter Angelos again insisted that his  
Baltimore Orioles' exhibition against the Cuban national team in 
Havana on Sunday is not meant to pave the way for future player 
recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said from the outset that there was never an ulterior  
motive -- just a free exchange between the people of the two 
countries,'' Angelos told The (Baltimore) Sun for a story in 
today's editions. ``The notion that this initiative will somehow 
give the Orioles an advantage recruiting Cuban players in the 
future is more born of cynicism than fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No big league baseball team has played in Cuba in 40 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, who was to leave for Havana today, said the goal for  
the game was to seek normalization of relations between the two 
countries and a better standard of living for the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer and major Democratic contributor has been criticized  
by several Cuban-American political groups, and his team has been 
the target of demonstrations during spring training in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla. But Angelos said most of the letters and calls he 
received were positive. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, mostly members of the Cuban-American exile  
community, have registered the complaint that the game supports the 
government of Fidel Castro, he said. But the pope's visit to Cuba 
last year demonstrated that the more contact, the better, Angelos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of anything that has ever been done for a  
constructive purpose that didn't generate controversy,'' Angelos 
said. ``Anything that departs from what is customary is going to 
generate a difference of opinion, but it's a worthwhile endeavor.''

<HEADLINE> Study Links Small Companies, Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When it comes to cooking the books, small  
companies are the biggest culprits, a new study reports. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the financial finagling is small, the damage often  
isn't. Half the companies in the fraud study wound up either 
closing their doors or reorganizing in Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors should watch for red flags, such as a chief executive  
who is also the company founder and has a weak or inexperienced 
board of directors that has an unusually large stake in the 
company's stock, according to the findings released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``fits the profile of a company that may be involved in  
fraudulent financial reporting,'' said John Flaherty, chairman of 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission, which is a consortium of five accounting groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The study comes as the Securities and Exchange Committee is  
considering measures to increase the power and independence of 
corporate audit committees following a series of high-profile 
financial fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 300 cases of fraudulent financial reporting that the SEC  
tackled between 1987 and 1997, and the chief executive was involved 
almost three-quarters of the time, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	In those cases, about 60 percent of the directors were either  
company executives, family members, or had special ties to the 
company that could influence their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors tend not to look at who's on the board of directors  
of the companies they invest in,'' Flaherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because executives, directors and even suppliers were in  
cahoots, the crime was hard for outside accountants to detect. 
Especially because the numbers were carefully doctored over an 
average of two years before regulators caught on. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fraud didn't happen overnight,'' said Alan W. Anderson, a  
senior vice president for the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants, and a member of the committee. ``It wasn't like 
turning on a light switch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the study released Friday found that the biggest problem  
lies in companies with market values under $100 million, the SEC is 
expected to focus on companies valued at more than $200 million 
because they have more investors with more at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bigger risk is with the bigger companies,'' said Flaherty,  
who also is the former general auditor for PepsiCo Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the responsibility, at least for now, falls on  
investors who put their money in small companies to look for 
warning signs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the companies hit by fraud, computer and software  
businesses were in almost one out of every six cases studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Many startup high-tech businesses, which are attracting a  
cultlike following on Wall Street, fit the profile of having a 
founder-CEO, with high stock ownership among board members and top 
executives. Plus, many of them are losing money -- another common 
trait in the study group. 
</P>
<P>
	That's important because the main reasons executives said they  
cooked the books was to avoid posting a loss, or having their stock 
removed from an exchange for failure to meet minimum financial 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong temptation to cheat comes from the pressure many chief  
executives face to meet Wall Street's profit estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer and software companies accounted for 15 percent of the  
fraud cases, other manufacturing an additional 15 percent, followed 
by financial services with 14 percent, and health care and health 
products, 11 percent. The other categories accounted for 8 percent 
or less of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies misstated or misappropriated their financial  
assets by an average of $25 million, though the median was $4.1 
million, but one out of two businesses failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financial reporting fraud is a serious problem and we  
regularly take action against it, regardless of whether it's a 
small company or a big company.'' said SEC spokesman John Heine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted by professors at North Carolina State  
University, University of Tennessee and Kennesaw (Ga.) State 
University. The professors took a random sample of 200 of the 300 
cases in which the Securities and Exchange Commission took action.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier To Visit U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will travel to the  
United States next month for high-level meetings with President 
Clinton and visits to five other American cities, the White House 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's visit is coming at a time of heightened expectations that  
the United States and China may finally be able to reach agreement 
on a package of market-opening trade initiatives that will clear 
the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the discussions between Clinton and Zhu -- the highest  
level talks since Clinton's trip to China last June -- are occurring 
at a time of increased tensions over China's record on human rights 
and allegations of Chinese espionage at government nuclear 
laboratories at Los Alamos, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the trip, the White House said Clinton and Zhu  
would discuss a full range of issues including security, economics 
and human rights. In addition, Zhu and Vice President Al Gore will 
co-chair the second meeting of the U.S.-China Forum on Environment 
and Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu will visit Washington on April 8. According to the schedule  
released by the White House, Zhu will visit Los Angeles on April 
6-7; Denver, April 10-11; Chicago, April 11-12; New York, April 
12-14; and Boston on April 14.

<HEADLINE> Spring Could Be Special for MSU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Beaches around the Tampa Bay area  
are packed with college kids on spring break. Mateen Cleaves and 
some of his Michigan State pals are here, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're not here primarily for sun and fun. They're here to  
win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans arrived at the Final Four on Thursday and got  
comfortable in the team hotel on Sand Key, off the coast of 
Clearwater Beach. That's about a 40-minute drive from Tropicana 
Field, but it might as well be 40 light years away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nice,'' senior guard Thomas Kelley said as he watched  
the sun go down over the Gulf of Mexico. ``You could get used to 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Girls in cutoffs and bikini tops walked by. They smiled,  
obviously aware that these were basketball players. And even if 
they weren't, the dark green T-shirt with ``St. Petersburg, Final 
Four'' on the front would have tipped them off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4), who are in the Final Four for the first  
time in 20 years, play top-ranked Duke (36-1) on Saturday night at 
Tropicana Field. On their way, they won the Big Ten championship, 
the Big Ten tournament and an NCAA regional title. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they know the Blue Devils are a formidable foe. If the  
Spartans are to have a chance, coach Tom Izzo feels Cleaves will 
have to be at his best. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State fell behind Kentucky 17-4 in St. Louis last  
weekend, but a long 3-pointer by Cleaves just before the half got 
the Spartans to within a point and they took control in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt it was important to have someone quarterback  
your team and be somewhat of an extension (of the coach),'' Izzo 
said. ``Once the game starts, even though we can make adjustments, 
there's things a guard does on the floor that I just don't think 
you can do from the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves didn't become an extension of Izzo overnight. Still,  
during his three years of playing for Izzo, they have found a way 
to become friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can call him up at three in the morning,'' Cleaves said. ``I  
can just say, `I can't sleep right now, I need somebody to talk 
to.' And that's the kind of guy he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are active in community affairs in East Lansing. They feed  
the homeless together, visit children in hospitals, and drive out 
to counsel young offenders in a prison near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's helped me grow up as a person,'' Cleaves said.

	NATO Begins More Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American-led NATO forces launched a third  
night of airstrikes against Yugoslavia today, targeting Serb 
military sites with air-launched cruise missiles and U.S. stealth 
fighter jets, the Pentagon said. Belgrade radio said NATO was 
hitting numerous targets in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade's suburbs 
in what appeared to be the strongest attack so far. The NATO attack 
began with cruise-missile-equipped B-52 bombers leading the 
assault. Also in the mix were F-117 stealth fighter jets equipped 
with laser-guided munitions. 

</P>
<P>
	Fighting Rages in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	UNDATED (AP) -- Yugoslav forces were reportedly targeting ethnic  
Albanians today in Kosovo in retaliation for the NATO airstrikes. 
The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said fighting continued throughout 
the province, with reports of more than 30 killed in ``mass 
executions.'' Thousands of ethnic Albanians were also being used as 
human shields, forced to march into a military factory in the 
central town of Srbica, it said. Kosovo refugees told the U.N. 
refugee agency that 20 men were shot to death by Serb forces as 
they evacuated the Kosovo border village of Goden yesterday.

	Anti-NATO Protests Target Embassies  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Protesters opposed to NATO attacks on  
Yugoslavia directed their anger at American sites around Europe 
today, drenching olive branches in red dye and calling President 
Clinton a ``fascist.'' Up to 10,000 people in Bulgaria gathered in 
the nation's capital of Sofia to protest the NATO airstrikes. In 
Greece, a NATO member, 15,000 protesters marched to the U.S. 
Embassy. The U.S. and British embassies in Moscow were also the 
scene of demonstrations. And riot police blocked demonstrators 
trying to reach the American Embassy in Skopje, Macedonia.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian was convicted of  
second-degree murder today for giving an ailing man a lethal 
injection and putting it all on videotape. Kevorkian, 70, could get 
a life term at sentencing April 14 for the death of 52-year-old 
Thomas Youk, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. Prosecutor 
David Gorcyca said he believes sentencing guidelines call for a 
minimum of 10 to 25 years on the murder charge. Kevorkian also was 
convicted of delivery of a controlled substance, which carries up 
to seven years.

today of disobedience in the first test of the denomination's ban 
on same-sex ceremonies and could be defrocked. The jury of 13

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Students Depart for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Within hours after landing on Cuban soil, about  
100 American students hit the ball field, teaming against Cuban 
kids their own age as a kind of warmup to Sunday's exhibition 
between the Baltimore Orioles and a Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great out here,'' said Clarence Collier, 11. ``The kids  
who play baseball here are really challenging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students from the Baltimore-Washington area arrived in  
Havana on Thursday on a plane chartered by Baltimore Orioles owner 
Peter Angelos. With the exception of more than 400 foreign 
correspondents, they will be among the few foreigners to watch the 
exhibition match in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be great. I have loved baseball longer than I  
can remember,'' said Jimmy Petrila, 12, of Washington D.C., whose 
parents paid for his trip. ``And the Orioles are definitely my 
favorite team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Cubans, only those who receive invitations will be  
able to attend, the government confirmed on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it had not been announced yet by Cuba's  
government-controlled media, the news was spreading Thursday 
throughout government workplaces, schools, parks, and along 
Havana's famous seawall, the Malecon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no sale of tickets at the stadium,'' said  
Reinaldo Calviac, director of the International Press Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said invitations probably would go to organizations  
such as schools and sports clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city as baseball-mad as Havana, such invitations will be  
highly coveted. 
</P>
<P>
	The rustic Latinoamericano stadium built in 1946, where Sunday's  
game will be played, holds 50,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time in 40 years that a major league team  
has played in Cuba. Big leaguers used to come to the island 
regularly before the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it is only an exhibition game, Cuban officials are  
downplaying its importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important game, the most interesting games right now  
in Cuba are our playoff games,'' Juan Gomez, coach of the hometown 
favorites, the Industriales, said Wednesday night before his team 
beat Isla de Juventud to earn a spot in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Sunday match between the Orioles and the Cubans is a  
big deal for the American kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our four days here we are going to see some of the most  
exciting things that baseball has to offer,'' Jim Mauro, president 
of the Northwest Washington Little League, said Thursday as the 
kids played on a sandlot near the Plaza of the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, they were already getting a sense of what Sunday's game  
might be like. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids here play a more exciting kind of baseball,'' Petrila  
said. ``In the United States, people swing for the fences. Here 
there are a lot of bunts and stealing. It is a more strategic kind 
of playing, like Ty Cobb in in the 1940s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting last-minute federal approval March 19 to take his  
team to Cuba, Angelos sent word to area schools and recreation 
leagues that he would provide a plane for 100 youths and up to 50 
chaperones. By Sunday, 50 youths had been signed up by parents who 
could afford the $750 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers saved the rest of the seats for students who would  
have trouble affording the fee. Angelos pledged $12,500 and other 
donors chipped in about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While the American youngsters praised their Cuban counterparts,  
the Cubans had kind words for their new friends as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel great to be able to play for the first time  
against the Americans,'' said 11-year-old catcher Jorge Luis Coury, 
who wore his baseball cap backwards. ``They're pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Former Ill. Detectives Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two former Cicero detectives were arrested Friday  
on federal racketeering conspiracy charges for allegedly accepting 
thousands of dollars to fix police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Biziarek, 52, and Darlene Sobczak, 42, were picked up a  
day after a federal grand jury returned a five-count indictment 
charging them with a series of shakedowns. Both defendants pleaded 
innocent and were released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges carry sentences as long as 30 years in prison and  
fines up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Federal law enforcement has zero tolerance for police officers  
who betray their oath and prey upon citizens whom they are sworn to 
protect, whether victims or those accused of crimes,'' U.S. 
Attorney Scott Lassar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents have long been investigating allegations of  
official corruption in Cicero, a gritty blue-collar community of 
factories and semi-trailer parks just west of Chicago. At one time 
it was the heart of Al Capone's bootlegging empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges Biziarek and Sobczak solicited and  
accepted extortion payments totaling at least $13,800 from nine 
people to fix Cicero police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents said they believe the two former officers gained  
as much as $80,000 through corrupt activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Biziarek left the force in 1997; Sobczak in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Closer Rod Beck Pitches Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Rod Beck was up, down and out of the ballpark  
in his first trip back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs closer, who's been sidelined with a protruding  
disc in his lower back, pitched Friday for the first time since 
March 5. He came in at the top of the sixth inning and promptly 
gave up a homer to Steve Finley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little wild,'' Beck said. ``I hadn't been out there in  
(three) weeks, and it's hard to just go out and paint the corners. 
Although I expected to. But expectations are always greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck, who converted 51 of 58 save opportunities last season to  
become only the fifth reliever in the majors to reach 50 saves, 
pitched one inning. He gave up two runs -- all earned -- and three 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He also hit Travis Lee in the shoulder, a toss that led to a  
bench-clearing brawl in the bottom of the sixth. The Diamondbacks 
went on to win 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to put the fastball inside. I wasn't trying  
to hit him,'' Beck said. ``I've got no reason to hit anybody in 
spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said he also was a little wild in a simulated game and  
bullpen workouts earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a wild pitcher,'' he said. ``So that will come.''  
</P>
<P>
	There were no problems with the back, and Beck said he'll be  
fine for opening day. His biggest concern now is getting enough 
work. He'll rest Saturday and pitch again Sunday, going every other 
day for the rest of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll pitch two innings in one game, and the rest will be  
one-inning outings. Bumping one of those up to two would be great, 
Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're running out of time,'' he said, ``and I've got to get in  
what I can get in.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mixed in Quiet Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury securities were little changed Friday  
as investors assessed the escalating tensions in the Balkans and 
several huge corporate bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/16  
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.59 percent from 5.58 percent 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But shorter-maturity Treasuries edged up Friday as uncertainties  
surrounding the third day of NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia 
encouraged some investors to seek the safety of U.S. government 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds also received support as gold fell below $280 a troy  
ounce, a sign that inflation remains tame. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurting Treasury prices was several big corporate-backed bond  
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup, the giant financial services company, led corporate  
sales Friday with $1.5 billion of global bonds. ImperialTobacco 
Group Plc, which manufactures cigarettes under brand names such as 
Embassy, Regal, and Lambert &AMP; Butler, sold $600 million of 10-year 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $16 billion of corporate bonds were sold this week,  
including AT&AMP;T Corp.'s record $8 billion sale. That's the highest 
weekly total since early January. More than $3 billion in new 
corporate bonds is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment banks often sell Treasuries when they underwrite  
corporate debt to protect against losses in case interest rates 
rise before the sales are completed. They usually buy the 
government securities back later. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 1/16, while intermediate Treasury securities rose between 3/32 
and 1/8 point from Thursday, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.21 
point to 1,282.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.50 percent, while  
the discount was unchanged from Thursday at 4.39 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.52 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.36 percent. One-year yields were 4.70 percent, while the

<HEADLINE> Planet Hollywood Co-Founder Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Keith Barish, a co-founder of Planet  
Hollywood International, has resigned as a board member at the 
struggling restaurant chain after selling nearly half of his stock 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	No reason was given when Barish's departure was announced  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barish, who resigned as chairman last year, still owns 12.4  
percent of Planet Hollywood. Before the sale of his 10 million 
shares at $1.75 each, announced earlier this week, he held 22.1 
million shares, or about 25 percent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The California film producer co-founded Planet Hollywood with  
Robert Earl in 1991 and star actors Sylvester Stallone, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl is now the chairman and chief executive officer of the  
company, which raised nearly $200 million in a wildly successful 
initial public offering of stock in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant chain has fallen on troubled times since then,  
losing more than $10 million in the third quarter and about $15 
million in the fourth quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say aggressive expansion and increased competition hurt  
the company.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Juror Ends Public Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After breaking her silence, the forewoman of  
the federal grand jury that investigated the Monica Lewinsky affair 
abruptly announced today she won't speak any more about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Freda Alexander made the announcement through her lawyers, who  
said she made her comments Thursday to several news outlets without 
their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal grand jury process is designed by law to be  
conducted in secret, and grand jurors rarely ever talk about their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	There are indications that U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway  
Johnson, who oversaw the Lewinsky grand jury, might be upset over 
Ms. Alexander's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr met privately with the judge  
about the matter Friday, according to a source familiar with the 
meeting who would not be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander told The Associated Press on Thursday that she  
believed President Clinton behaved badly in his personal life, and 
she would have voted to indict him for perjury if prosecutors had 
asked her to. 
</P>
<P>
	She also expressed sympathy with Clinton and believed his  
personal failings should not have become public or led to his 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was personal and of a civil nature,'' Ms. Alexander said.  
``He didn't do anything that I can see that took away my liberty or 
was a crime against the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander's lawyers, Douglas B. Huron and Richard A. Salzman  
said in a written statement, ``On March 25, 1999, several press and 
TV representatives contacted Freda Alexander. Initially she 
responded to questions about her recently ended grand jury service 
without consulting counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Later that evening Ms. Alexander spoke to counsel about media  
inquiries. With her approval, we are authorized to say that, on our 
advice, she will not be responding to further media inquiries.''

<HEADLINE> NASD Seeks Day-Trading Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the risky practice of day trading gaining  
popularity among Main Street investors, regulators have been 
dismayed by stories of people putting up their student loan money, 
mortgages or retirement savings to finance it. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock Market is  
considering a proposal requiring electronic day-trading firms to 
screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers' board of  
governors voted at a meeting in New York City on Thursday to seek 
comment on the proposal from its member brokerage firms and the 
public. The NASD announced the move in Washington after the 
closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Zarb, NASD's chairman and chief executive officer, said in  
a statement that the action ``affirms our continuing efforts to 
ensure that investors are better protected and better informed 
about the risks involved before engaging in high-risk investment 
activities like day trading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an important step toward making individuals aware of the  
potential risks involved in day trading,'' Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading firms sell training courses and special software  
programs to ordinary investors who want to try the lightning-speed 
practice of day trading, exploiting small price movements in stocks 
to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the enforcement director of the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission said the agency is examining the advertisements 
of day-trading firms to see if they make unrealistic promises to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Enforcement director Richard Walker also said the market  
watchdog agency is inspecting day-trading firms in a joint effort 
with the NASD. There are roughly 100 such firms nationwide, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC would ultimately have to approve the requirements for  
day-trading firms proposed by the NASD. SEC spokesman Christopher 
Ullman declined comment on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt warned in January that day trading  
can be ``highly risky'' for ordinary investors, who should engage 
in it only ``with funds they can afford to lose.'' He expressed 
dismay at stories he had heard of people putting up money for 
education, mortgages or retirement to finance their day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	James H. Lee, chairman and president of the Electronic Traders  
Association, which represents day-trading firms, said Thursday he 
hadn't yet seen the NASD proposal and couldn't directly comment on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he hoped the proposal ``doesn't work to discourage  
firms from discussing any instructions'' in using computer programs 
to day trade. He drew a distinction between such training and 
investment advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most of the 5 million or so ordinary investors who do  
occasional stock trading on the Internet, most day traders use the 
services and computer facilities of the day-trading firms, which 
sell investors training courses, require them to put up large 
amounts of money to open a self-trading account, and charge them 
commissions on each trade. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the number of full-time day traders who operate out of  
these firms is small, about 2,500 to 3,000 nationwide. But the 
recent growing popularity of the practice has raised questions 
about whether the firms are promoting a service that may cause 
people to get in over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators have stepped up their scrutiny and a  
handful, particularly in Massachusetts, have recently filed fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The new NASD proposal would require day-trading firms to apply  
standards of ``suitability'' to potential investors similar to 
those that full-service brokers must apply to their clients. The 
firms would have to determine that the practice would be 
appropriate for an investor's financial situation and investment 
experience before allowing him or her to open a day-trading 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, day-trading firms would have to give potential  
investors a written disclosure statement warning them that day 
trading ``can be extremely risky'' and they should be prepared to 
lose all the money they put into it. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors would be told they should not use their retirement  
savings, second mortgages, education funds or money needed to live. 
They also would be warned to be wary of claims of big profits from 
day trading, which requires in-depth knowledge of the securities 
markets and trading techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Comments on the proposal may be submitted to NASD Regulation by  
e-mail through its Web site at www.nasdr.com.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Tried for Same-Sex Weddings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- Some say he is a disobedient  
rule-breaker, plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Others testifying at the church trial of the Rev. Gregory Dell  
say he was simply trying to serve his parishioners when he presided 
over the ``holy union'' of two Chicago men last September, a month 
after United Methodist leaders banned same-sex ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, I felt like a full human being in the  
United Methodist Church,'' Dr. Terry VandenHoek, a gay member of 
Dell's church, testified this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is the first test of the ban, which was prompted by the  
1998 trial of another United Methodist Church minister who 
performed a same-sex union in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, 53, testified today that he did not feel disobedient.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the contrary, I felt the only way I could be obedient was  
to conduct that service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell said the church had instructed him ``to minister to all the  
people,'' which left him facing a dilemma. ``If I can't be a pastor 
fully to all the people ... you don't want me as a pastor,'' said 
Dell, who took several pauses to collect himself. 
</P>
<P>
	During opening statements at a suburban Chicago church Thursday,  
prosecutors said Dell has made ``a mockery of church law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't just break the law because you disagree with it,''  
the Rev. Stephen Williams told a jury of 13 pastors from northern 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, who has pleaded innocent to the charge of disobedience,  
does not deny he disregarded the same-sex union ban that he admits 
is binding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Larry Pickens, Dell's defense counsel, told jurors that  
the church has a long-standing history of ministers -- including 
founder John Wesley -- who have broken church law in an effort to 
better serve their parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, my brothers and sisters, is a case about what we do when  
a pastoral need and a church law conflict,'' Pickens said, noting 
that a third of Dell's congregation at Broadway United Methodist 
Church in Chicago are gay or lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	A verdict was expected no later than Saturday. If found guilty,  
Dell's 30-year career as a pastor in the Methodist church could 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. It's invigorating. It's draining,'' said Keith  
Eccarius, one of the men who exchanged vows before Dell. ``It's 
probably the most important issue our church has to deal with at 
this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who support the ban agreed on the issue's importance.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are already people who've left the church or are  
planning to because of the advertisement of this trial,'' said the 
Rev. Kent Svendsen, a Methodist pastor from rural Ashton and a 
leader in the church's ``confessing movement,'' which believes gay 
men and lesbians can be converted to heterosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not to exclude or attack people who are  
different, but to help them heal,'' Svendsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell attended Duke University's Divinity School with another  
Methodist minister, the Rev. Jimmy Creech. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Creech's 1998 trial over a same-sex union at his former  
Nebraska church that prompted Methodist leaders to codify a 
``social principle'' that had only advised against blessing 
same-sex unions. Creech, who is attending the trial, was not 
defrocked but is on leave from the church.

<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks Friday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks pinch hit in the eighth inning with two  
outs, and hit a foul pop-up to the first baseman on the first 
pitch. The Padres went on to win 8-2 over the Anaheim Angles. On 
Saturday, Brooks will accompany a Padres split squad for a game 
against San Francisco at Yuma, where the Padres trained from 
1969-93. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* Brooks now has one hit in 14 at-bats. After the  
game, he spent 1 1/2 hours signing autographs for fans. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``Did you hear the fans yelling for the ball to  
go foul?'' manager Bruce Bochy said. ``They're yelling at the first 
baseman to drop it. They just wanted to see him swing the bat one 
more time.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks' Gray Arrested for DUI, Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Hawks reserve guard Ed Gray was charged  
with drug possession and driving under the influence after a state 
trooper stopped him for minor traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The trooper stopped Gray's 1991 BMW about 8 p.m. Thursday near  
downtown Atlanta after noticing that the car's windows were tinted 
darker than state law allows and that his California tags had 
expired, spokesman Gordy Wright of the Georgia Department of Public 
Safety said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the trooper found less than an ounce of marijuana and an  
open container of alcohol in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who was released on bond after spending the night in jail,  
declined to comment prior to the Hawks' game against the Chicago 
Bulls. ``I'm fine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest was the latest in a series of problems that have  
plagued the 6-foot-3 guard since he was drafted in the first round 
by the Hawks in 1997. Last season, Gray was fined $57,000 for 
various transgressions, the most serious being the equivalent of a 
four-game suspension when he failed to show up to be treated for a 
broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
	He started this season as a backup to Steve Smith, but he lost  
that role to Tyrone Corbin because of miserable shooting. Prior to 
Friday's game, Gray had played in only four of the previous 12 
games and was shooting 26.8 percent from the field, averaging 4.5 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to drug possession and DUI, Gray was charged with  
driving with an open container and driving on a suspended and 
revoked license, Wright said. Blood-alcohol tests are pending on 
the DUI charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said the team can't take any  
action against Gray unless he is convicted. A hearing was scheduled 
for April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take these issues extremely seriously,'' Babcock said. ``We  
met with our team this morning and told them we'll support anybody 
who is in our family 100 percent with legal help, counseling, 
whatever's necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if in fact any of our guys are found guilty of a  
misdemeanor or felony, we would take the harshest measure allowed 
by collective bargaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new NBA collective bargaining agreement includes marijuana  
as a banned substance. A player convicted of possession would be 
required to undergo counseling, while harsher penalties such as 
fines and suspensions are allowed for subsequent convictions, 
league spokeswoman Teri Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who played at California, took part in 30 games during his  
rookie season before breaking his foot. He averaged 7.6 points per 
game.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Told To Stay in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered the Pittsburgh  
Penguins to remain at the Civic Arena through 2007 and barred team 
officials from any talks about moving to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz issued a permanent  
injunction prohibiting Penguins co-owner Roger Marino -- or any new 
owners who come out of bankruptcy proceedings -- from trying to take 
the team to any other city. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction prohibits team officials from even discussing a  
possible sale to non-Pittsburgh owners. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 26-page opinion and order issued Thursday, the judge also  
questioned whether Marino ever intended to honor a commitment the 
team made, which called for the Penguins to stay in the arena 
through 2007 in exchange for nearly $13 million in public 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for protection from creditors in U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court just as the NHL season began in October, citing 
debt of as much as $124 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Penguins star Mario Lemieux submitted a plan this month  
to buy the team and rescue it from bankruptcy. Markovitz is 
expected to rule sometime next month on whether the plan paints an 
honest picture of the team's financial position. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Thursday stems from a temporary injunction Markovitz  
issued in November. The Public Auditorium Authority, a city-county 
agency that owns the arena, and SMG, a private firm that operates 
the facility, requested the order. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino and the Penguins asked that it be lifted. Marino's  
attorneys have said the financially troubled team would be more 
valuable if it were allowed to move, bringing more money to 
creditors following a sale. Markovitz said the team's value in the 
city was more important. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Penguins are as much a part of the warp and woof of this  
community as are its other professional sports teams, museums, 
parks, theaters and ethnic neighborhoods,'' the judge wrote in his 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``As important as (the creditors') interests are, they may have  
to give way when the interest of the community at large so 
dictates. In this case, it so dictates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team has said it wanted to lift the injunction and end its  
commitment to the arena in order to gain leverage in negotiating a 
lease with SMG. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins officials say they cannot operate profitably under the  
lease, which forces them to give up between $6 million and $7 
million annually.

<HEADLINE> Fed Gov Sees Minor Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer bug shouldn't  
disrupt the U.S. economy enough to cause a national recession, 
Federal Reserve Board Governor Edward Kelley Jr. says. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could have the same effect as a severe snow storm or last  
year's United Parcel Service strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these instances, the shock to our economic infrastructure  
is transitory in nature, and, critically, the recovery process is 
under way before any adverse `feedback' effects are produced,'' he 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said he expects the millennium bug will cause isolated  
disruptions to commerce, as well as to some public services. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fairness, it must be said that if disruptions that occur  
are not isolated events as I have assumed, but rather spread across 
key sectors of the economy by interacting with each other, ... the 
decline in economic activity would prove to be longer lasting and a 
recession could conceivably ensue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem occurs when computers try to add or subtract  
dates using only the last two digits of the year -- 00 in the case 
of 2000 -- which may confuse them into reading the date as 1900. 
That could cause some to give faulty readings, corrupt the data or 
shut down completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is the most senior member of the Fed board, which is the  
governing body of the nation's central bank, which determines 
interest-rate policy, regulates banks and oversees the nation's 
payments system. It is the lender of last resort in financial 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	He says a small percentage of banks overseen by the Fed are not  
progressing satisfactorily in their Y2K preparations. But he 
expects the industry as a whole to be prepared by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing the Year 2000 computer problem likely will cost private  
companies more than $50 billion, Kelley said. He's revised his 
estimate upward since testifying before Congress last spring, but 
he's not sure how much more it will be. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said the federal government is spending just under $7  
billion on the problem, but he doesn't have a good handle on what 
state and local governments are doing to prepare for the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed economists have identified $3.4 billion earmarked by states,  
``but I'm quite confident that number is too low,'' Kelley told a 
group of business students at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate 
School of Management. And that may be where many of the Y2K 
problems occur, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critical, electronically-driven local systems that could be  
vulnerable include water, traffic, police, health and welfare 
services, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, ``One or two malfunctioning traffic  
signals can cause serious congestion, confusion and delay, and the 
breakdown of traffic management systems could cause near total 
gridlock.''

<HEADLINE> Gasoline futures prices soared Friday on the New York Mercantile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline futures prices soared Friday on the New York Mercantile  
amid expectations that a fire at a California refinery will divert 
supplies away from the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude, heating oil and natural gas futures also jumped. On other  
commodity markets, gold slumped, while wheat rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures rose to the highest level since October after  
Chevron Corp. reported an explosion and fire had shut down a large 
gas-making unit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how long the unit near San Francisco would be  
shut down. But market participants were worried a spate of recent 
production problems in the West might cause producers to divert gas 
to that region to secure better profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast would suffer most under that scenario since it  
relies on gasoline shipped by pipeline from the Gulf Coast to meet 
consumers' daily driving needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has grown more sensitive to supply concerns following  
a decision by major producing nations to further slash output in a 
bid to boost prices. Mexico recently defaulted on several contracts 
to U.S. customers in a bid to achieve its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Further supporting gas prices are inventory figures released  
this week indicating that demand is at record levels even before 
the peak driving season begins. The American Petroleum Institute 
also revised downward by 1 million barrels its estimate of weekly 
gasoline production. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract for May delivery of light, sweet crude rose 50  
cents to $16.17 a barrel; April heating oil rose 1.29 cents to 
42.74 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline rose 2.22 cents to 
50.63 cents a gallon; April natural gas rose 0.02 cent to $1.855 
for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures slumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange after  
Canada's prime minister called on the International Monetary Fund 
to sell part of its reserves to help poor countries pay their 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Chretien joined a growing number of wealthier nations  
calling for IMF gold sales. Chretien, whose country is the world's 
fourth-largest producer, suggested that as much as 10 million 
ounces should be put on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	That could seriously depress gold prices, and market  
participants said the proposal was significant because it likely 
would hurt Canada's mining industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures prices have been languishing below $300 an ounce  
for months, depressed by low inflation in the United States and

<HEADLINE> In Brazil, Panic Turns to Euphoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In just two months, economic panic  
has given way to euphoria in Brazil as a flurry of good news has 
people believing the worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets are surging, the currency is stronger, inflation  
is lessening and investors are slowly returning. The crisis may not 
be over, but there's a growing sense that Latin America's largest 
economy is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we've seen the worst in Brazil,'' James A. Harmon,  
president and chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, told a group 
of international bankers in Miami Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch agrees. The U.S. investment bank picked Brazil as  
its favorite Latin American equity market for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a dramatic change from a month ago. Brazil's currency, the  
real, was in free fall, investors scurried to pull their money from 
banks, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso went on national 
television to plead for calm. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the low point of a crisis that began with an abrupt  
devalution of the real on Jan. 13. In three weeks, the currency 
plunged 46 percent, and the government seemed powerless to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the government's challenge is to keep the new-found  
ebullience in check and convince Brazilians that the battle for 
economic stability isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Finance Minister Pedro Malan warned against the  
premature optimism pervading markets and predicted the turbulence 
will persist for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's hard to resist so many positive signs.  
</P>
<P>
	The real, worth only about 48 cents at the end of February, was  
up to 56 cents on Friday. That's still well below the 82 cents the 
real cost at the end of 1998, but a significant improvement 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing $1.82 billion last year, Brazilian stock markets  
are enjoying a new bull run. The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo 
Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, surged 15 percent in the 
first week of March alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation, which was about 2 percent last year but threatened to  
roar back with the devaluation, is way below initial predictions. 
Consumer prices in Sao Paulo rose just 0.8 percent in the past four 
weeks, down from 1.4 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism grew when Brazil signed a new agreement with the  
International Monetary Fund, which underpins a $41.5 billion rescue 
plan. The country hopes to receive $8.6 billion of that money by 
early April. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso has shown his strength in Congress, winning approval for  
a controversial tax on bank transactions that is expected to 
generate $8.5 billion, a year. The tax is a key to Brazil's 
commitment to reducing its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Arminio Fraga, president of Brazil's Central Bank, said foreign  
perception of Brazil has ``improved a lot and will continue 
improving as we move ahead'' with austerity reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga himself has been part of the turnaround. A former  
associate of U.S. billionaire financier George Soros, the 
market-savvy Fraga was essential in persuading foreign bankers to 
maintain credit lines to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet big hurdles remain. Wholesale prices are rising and could  
feed inflation. Unions also are demanding large cost-of-living 
raises, and labor unrest promises to heat up. 
</P>
<P>
	An expected surge in exports hasn't happened, and the $11  
billion trade surplus Brazil promised the IMF looks unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also seems to have no solution for its huge  
domestic debt, which soared with the real's devaluation and grows 
daily, with interest rates running as high as 42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dems Challenge GOP on Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic leaders are challenging Senate  
Republicans to compromise on legislation to lift barriers between 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies, casting the 
dispute as a major test of bipartisanship in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin and Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., insisted Friday that 
community lending requirements for banks must be included or 
President Clinton will veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want financial modernization enacted this year. This should  
not be a partisan issue,'' Daschle told reporters. He said 
lawmakers must choose ``either a partisan brinksmanship or a 
bipartisan accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin attended to emphasize the administration's opposition to a  
Republican bill in the Senate while supporting the dismantling of 
Depression-era prohibitions against combining banks, insurers and 
brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation proposed by both parties would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Consumer advocates have 
expressed concern that the measures, by allowing banks, brokerage 
firms and insurers to merge and get more deeply into each other's 
businesses, could bring a dangerous concentration of economic power 
in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the legislation, including Wall Street, banks and  
insurers, insist it is needed to keep the U.S. financial industry 
competitive in a fast-changing global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle and Sarbanes, the Senate Banking Committee's senior  
Democrat, formally proposed a bill as an alternative to a GOP 
measure that cleared the committee in a party-line vote early this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Republican bill, pushed by Banking Committee Chairman  
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, banks would not have to get a 
satisfactory community-lending rating from the government to 
conduct new financial activities. The bill also would exempt small 
banks with less than $100 million in assets from the community 
lending laws, which require banks and thrifts to lend to the poor 
and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' bill, as well as a bipartisan measure approved  
recently by the House Banking Committee, 51-8, include the 
requirement for a community-lending rating and have no exemption 
for small banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1977 lending laws have played a valuable role by ``expanding  
access to credit for all communities in our country,'' Sarbanes 
said, adding that they have helped many African Americans and other 
minorities to become home owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has maintained that the government shouldn't dictate to  
banks what people or companies they can do business with -- a view 
that led him to block financial overhaul legislation last fall. The 
blocking maneuver by Gramm and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., came 
after the legislation squeaked through the House by one vote, 
214-213. 
</P>
<P>
	Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for Gramm, said Friday ``he's not  
willing to compromise on the issue of expanding'' the reach of the 
community lending law. Gramm is not pushing for its repeal, 
however, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harlan noted that Gramm plans to meet soon after Congress'  
two-week Easter recess with Daschle, Sarbanes and Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to discuss the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a test,'' Daschle said. ``The Republicans in the House  
have already met that test.''

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Students Depart for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Within hours after landing on Cuban soil, about  
100 American students hit the ball field, teaming against Cuban 
kids their own age as a kind of warmup to Sunday's exhibition 
between the Baltimore Orioles and a Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great out here,'' said Clarence Collier, 11. ``The kids  
who play baseball here are really challenging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students from the Baltimore-Washington area arrived in  
Havana on Thursday on a plane chartered by Baltimore Orioles owner 
Peter Angelos. With the exception of more than 400 foreign 
correspondents, they will be among the few foreigners to watch the 
exhibition match in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be great. I have loved baseball longer than I  
can remember,'' said Jimmy Petrila, 12, of Washington D.C., whose 
parents paid for his trip. ``And the Orioles are definitely my 
favorite team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Cubans, only those who receive invitations will be  
able to attend, the government confirmed on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it had not been announced yet by Cuba's  
government-controlled media, the news was spreading Thursday 
throughout government workplaces, schools, parks, and along 
Havana's famous seawall, the Malecon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no sale of tickets at the stadium,'' said  
Reinaldo Calviac, director of the International Press Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said invitations probably would go to organizations  
such as schools and sports clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city as baseball-mad as Havana, such invitations will be  
highly coveted. 
</P>
<P>
	The rustic Latinoamericano stadium built in 1946, where Sunday's  
game will be played, holds 50,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time in 40 years that a major league team  
has played in Cuba. Big leaguers used to come to the island 
regularly before the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it is only an exhibition game, Cuban officials are  
downplaying its importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important game, the most interesting games right now  
in Cuba are our playoff games,'' Juan Gomez, coach of the hometown 
favorites, the Industriales, said Wednesday night before his team 
beat Isla de Juventud to earn a spot in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Sunday match between the Orioles and the Cubans is a  
big deal for the American kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our four days here we are going to see some of the most  
exciting things that baseball has to offer,'' Jim Mauro, president 
of the Northwest Washington Little League, said Thursday as the 
kids played on a sandlot near the Plaza of the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, they were already getting a sense of what Sunday's game  
might be like. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids here play a more exciting kind of baseball,'' Petrila  
said. ``In the United States, people swing for the fences. Here 
there are a lot of bunts and stealing. It is a more strategic kind 
of playing, like Ty Cobb in in the 1940s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting last-minute federal approval March 19 to take his  
team to Cuba, Angelos sent word to area schools and recreation 
leagues that he would provide a plane for 100 youths and up to 50 
chaperones. By Sunday, 50 youths had been signed up by parents who 
could afford the $750 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers saved the rest of the seats for students who would  
have trouble affording the fee. Angelos pledged $12,500 and other 
donors chipped in about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While the American youngsters praised their Cuban counterparts,  
the Cubans had kind words for their new friends as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel great to be able to play for the first time  
against the Americans,'' said 11-year-old catcher Jorge Luis Coury, 
who wore his baseball cap backwards. ``They're pretty good.''

<HEADLINE>  NATO Launches First Daylight Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO aircraft and missiles blasted  
targets in Yugoslavia for a second night, directing much of their 
fire on Kosovo, where fighting raged between Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians. Today, NATO forces launched their first daylight attack 
on Yugoslavia, state and independent media said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air raid sirens wailed at midafternoon in Belgrade and several  
other cities, and targets were hit in three suburbs of the capital, 
according to the official Tanjug news agency and independent Studio 
B television. People in the city center said they did not 
immediately see evidence of the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials called the previous two nights of attacks a  
successful start to forcing President Slobodan Milosevic to agree 
to a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not going to be one knockout blow, but day after day,  
if he does not stop his genocidal attacks on the Kosovo people, we 
will take larger and larger lumps out of his military force,'' 
British Defense Secretary George Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's army maintained its defiant tone, claiming it  
inflicted ``substantial damage'' against an ``overpoweringly 
stronger enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first round of airstrikes Wednesday killed at least 11  
people and injured dozens, Serbian officials said. A Yugoslav army 
division said one person was killed and three were wounded in 
airstrikes Thursday night near the Montenegrin town of Rozaje. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav forces continued their offensive on the ground Thursday  
against ethnic Albanians. International monitors and relief 
officials forced to leave Kosovo because of the bombing said they 
feared Serb forces were burning villages and killing ethnic 
Albanians or forcing them to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian sources reported persistent gunfire overnight in  
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, and an ethnic Albanian human rights 
group said a political figure and a union leader were killed in the 
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency said Kosovo refugees who crossed into  
Albania claim that 20 men were shot to death by Serb forces 
evacuating the village of Goden in southwest Kosovo on Thursday. It 
said it was unable to verify the account. 
</P>
<P>
	``With only a handful of independent observers left on the  
ground, we are extremely worried about the plight of Kosovo's 
civilian population, which has already been through a terrible 
ordeal,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	William Walker, the U.S. head of the 1,400-member monitoring  
mission that left Kosovo this week, also said the situation was 
deteriorating. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe decided today to reduce Walker's mission created last year 
to monitor a failed peace agreement down to 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia failed today to muster enough support to pass a  
resolution in the U.N. Security Council demanding NATO stop bombing 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said today that allied aircraft had flown 400  
sorties against Yugoslavia in the first two days of air operations 
and had struck 50 targets, all air defense and related facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb damage assessments are still being assembled, said Air  
Commodore David Wilby, briefing reporters at NATO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making steady headway just as we had anticipated,'' NATO  
commander Gen. Wesley Clark said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``We've 
done severe damage to a number of targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials have said all planes returned safely.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton appealed directly to the Serbian people today  
for support, saying Milosevic has imperiled their future and forced 
their ``sons to keep fighting a senseless conflict that you did not 
ask for and that he could have prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no hint from Milosevic that he would back down over  
Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia. He cut off diplomatic 
relations with the United States, France, Germany and Britain, 
while Serbian authorities ordered journalists from NATO nations out 
of the country. Scores did so, but some were trying to return today 
after conciliatory statements from Yugoslav officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav army statement said the Thursday night bombing  
targeted military barracks, military airports, air defense systems, 
communications centers and command posts. It lacked specifics on 
any damage caused and claimed Yugoslav forces retaliated 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an unfair airborne battle, acting against an overpoweringly  
stronger enemy, according to reports available, substantial damage 
was inflicted on the enemy,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilby denied that NATO had attacked Yugoslav military barracks.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment ... our only target is the integrated air  
defense system and facilities associated with that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes Thursday hit inside Kosovo around Pristina, Kosovska  
Mitrovica and the southwestern town of Prizren, media in Yugoslavia 
said. Serbian TV said three missiles hit a police station on a 
military base, injuring one policeman and leaving two others 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Belgrade city official said there was ``heavy activity'' by  
warplanes attacking targets outside the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. 
The official Tanjug news agency said an airport in the central 
Serbian city of Nis had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montenegro, Yugoslavia's other republic, there were reports  
of explosions at army compounds and barracks, as well as at an 
airport and radar facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO missile hit Djakovica, near the Kosovo-Albanian border,  
missing an army compound, Tanjug reported. ``The material damage is 
substantial, and there are casualties,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug reported that ethnic Albanian rebels had attacked Serb  
police in Djakovica, wounding one. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleurat Sejeu, spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in  
London, told BBC World television that Yugoslav MiGs were being 
used against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Sejeu said Serbs had rounded up thousands of displaced ethnic  
Albanian civilians in the central Drenica region and were marching 
them toward Pristina. ``Nobody knows what will happen'' to them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 Kosovo Albanians crossed into Albania on Thursday,  
saying Serb security forces had swept into the village of Goden, 
detaining men, setting the village on fire, and marching women and 
children across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Selim Ferraj, 37, one of the few males with the group from  
Goden, said he feared the other men were dead. ``I am only alive 
because I knew the Serb commander before,'' said Ferraj, who 
escaped with his wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict has claimed more than 2,000 lives in the past year.  
UNHCR estimates that more than 450,000 people have been forced from 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile said today that Romania  
plans to accept up to 4,000 refugees from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after appearing to waver on the NATO strikes, Italian  
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said today that Italy will stand 
firm with alliance -- but also push to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and British Prime Minister  
Tony Blair reiterated their support, and Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright denied that NATO solidarity was at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there is the will to continue,'' she said on ``Today.''  
``It's my sense that the coalition is very strong and united.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a freeze on all relations with NATO, Russia today  
told NATO's top diplomatic official and its senior military 
representative in Moscow to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials have said they were willing to resume peace  
talks. But they reject an agreement the ethnic Albanians signed 
last month in France, saying it was forced on them by the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders say Milosevic has bluffed before and they demand  
that he either sign the agreement and halt violence in Kosovo or 
face further attacks.

after conciliatory statements from Yugoslav officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav army statement said the Thursday night bombing  
targeted military barracks, military airports, air defense systems, 
communications centers and command posts. It lacked specifics on 
any damage caused and claimed Yugoslav forces retaliated 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an unfair airborne battle, acting against an overpoweringly  
stronger enemy, according to reports available, substantial damage 
was inflicted on the enemy,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilby denied that NATO had attacked Yugoslav military barracks.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment ... our only target is the integrated air  
defense system and facilities associated with that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes Thursday hit inside Kosovo around Pristina, Kosovska  
Mitrovica and the southwestern town of Prizren, media in Yugoslavia 
said. Serbian TV said three missiles hit a police station on a 
military base, injuring one policeman and leaving two others 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Belgrade city official said there was ``heavy activity'' by  
warplanes attacking targets outside the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. 
The official Tanjug news agency said an airport in the central 
Serbian city of Nis had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montenegro, Yugoslavia's other republic, there were reports  
of explosions at army compounds and barracks, as well as at an 
airport and radar facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO missile hit Djakovica, near the Kosovo-Albanian border,  
missing an army compound, Tanjug reported. ``The material damage is 
substantial, and there are casualties,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug reported that ethnic Albanian rebels had attacked Serb  
police in Djakovica, wounding one. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleurat Sejeu, spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in  
London, told BBC World television that Yugoslav MiGs were being 
used against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Sejeu said Serbs had rounded up thousands of displaced ethnic  
Albanian civilians in the central Drenica region and were marching 
them toward Pristina. ``Nobody knows what will happen'' to them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 Kosovo Albanians crossed into Albania on Thursday,  
saying Serb security forces had swept into the village of Goden, 
detaining men, setting the village on fire, and marching women and 
children across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Selim Ferraj, 37, one of the few males with the group from  
Goden, said he feared the other men were dead. ``I am only alive 
because I knew the Serb commander before,'' said Ferraj, who 
escaped with his wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict has claimed more than 2,000 lives in the past year.  
UNHCR estimates that more than 450,000 people have been forced from 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile said today that Romania  
plans to accept up to 4,000 refugees from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after appearing to waver on the NATO strikes, Italian  
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said today that Italy will stand 
firm with alliance -- but also push to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and British Prime Minister  
Tony Blair reiterated their support, and Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright denied that NATO solidarity was at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there is the will to continue,'' she said on ``Today.''  
``It's my sense that the coalition is very strong and united.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a freeze on all relations with NATO, Russia today  
told NATO's top diplomatic official and its senior military 
representative in Moscow to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials have said they were willing to resume peace  
talks. But they reject an agreement the ethnic Albanians signed 
last month in France, saying it was forced on them by the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders say Milosevic has bluffed before and they demand  
that he either sign the agreement and halt violence in Kosovo or 
face further attacks.

<HEADLINE> Showtime Plans Holocaust Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For too many, the Holocaust languishes somewhere  
between old news and ancient history. And as for young people -- 
well, what could be the relevance of anything that happened before 
rock music or TV? 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Hannah Stern sets other priorities ahead of her  
heritage. An all-too-typical 16-year-old kid in New Rochelle, N.Y., 
she feels put upon when her parents insist she drop everything to 
celebrate the Jewish holiday Passover. 
</P>
<P>
	She begs to skip the Seder: ``It's a waste of time.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going because it's important,'' says her mom.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why,'' Hannah counters, ``is it important?''  
</P>
<P>
	The answer to that question reveals itself for young and old in  
``The Devil's Arithmetic,'' a Showtime original film. Showtime is 
making a major point of the film's for-all-ages appeal. So do 
Dustin Hoffman and Mimi Rogers, who as executive producers were 
driving forces in making the film. It premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. 
EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Jane Yolen's 1988 novel of the same title, ``The  
Devil's Arithmetic'' thrusts unsuspecting Hannah back in time, to a 
place where Seders and Judaism were deemed capital offenses -- 
German-occupied Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	There she finds a renewed sense of family, while encountering  
the horrors of her family's past. She is literally absorbed in a 
chapter of history that, from the comfortable distance of the 
1990s, she had never cared to explore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Devil's Arithmetic'' wants its audience -- especially  
youngsters -- to care. And how could they fail to, after sharing 
Hannah's reality check? 
</P>
<P>
	In no way does it water down its depiction of Nazi-waged  
genocide. But this beautifully made film knows when to speak in 
hushed tones. Even for young viewers, it should prove disturbing, 
but not traumatizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the child has to be old enough to have some frame of  
reference,'' Rogers said, ``and to be able to ask coherent 
questions about the film afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially for kids, the Holocaust can seem too horrible to be  
true. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think taking the journey with a contemporary teen and  
seeing it through her eyes makes it real, makes it understandable 
for young people,'' said Rogers, who, supplementing her producer's 
role, appears in a cameo as Hannah's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannah is played by Kirsten Dunst, the 16-year-old actress whose  
previous films include ``Little Women'' and ``Wag the Dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had read the book before,'' Kirsten said. ``So as soon as I  
found out they wanted me to play this role, of course I wanted to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film also stars Brittany Murphy (``David and Lisa'') as  
Rivkah, a Polish girl in 1941 who befriends Hannah, certain that 
they're cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	And Louise Fletcher, best known for her Oscar-winning  
performance in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' is Hannah's 
Aunt Eva, at whose home the Seder takes place. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't understand what it was like in the camp,'' she  
gently tells Hannah. ``This experience is so far from your world.'' 
But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
	Scenes of Hannah's collision with the past were filmed last fall  
near Vilnius, Lithuania, on a muddy, desolate site designed to 
resemble Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day we pulled up to the concentration camp, I was,  
like, shocked,'' Kirsten said. ``I couldn't hold back my tears. 
Even when you see it for yourself, you can't imagine how it must 
have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Deitch, the film's director, found the shoot no less  
jolting. 
</P>
<P>
	Her projects include the Oprah Winfrey TV film ``The Women of  
Brewster Place'' -- and numerous episodes of ``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Though I had directed my share of scenes involving murders and  
people getting beat up, I had never done anything that involved 
this degree of evil,'' Deitch said. ``I was a little unprepared for 
what it would be like. 
</P>
<P>
	``For instance, in the hanging scene, when two of the girls  
watching hug each other, suddenly I think, 'The Nazis would never 
let them do that,' and I'm yelling at the guard, 'Go over there and 
break those two girls up. Hurry up! Pull 'em apart!''' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary doing certain scenes,'' Kirsten agreed. ``When we  
were walking to the gas chamber, sometimes it would feel too 
real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never fear. At the end of the film, Hannah returns home. A  
fateful link between then and now, she will always remember what 
she went through. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kirsten Dunst will remember, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel proud to help tell the story,'' she said. ``We just  
have to keep making movies about the Holocaust so that people never 
forget about it.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mich. OKs Detroit School Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- State lawmakers have approved a  
controversial plan that allows the Detroit mayor to appoint a new 
board to revamp the city's embattled schools, home to 180,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Engler could sign the bill as early as today, his  
spokesman said. Engler has cited poor test scores, high dropout 
rates and crumbling buildings as signs that Detroit Public Schools 
needed help. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district had a dropout rate of 26.4 percent in 1997,  
and the four-year graduation rate is a dismal 29.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform proposal is similar to what has been done in Chicago,  
Cleveland and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposal sparked weeks of debate and caused deep  
divisions in Detroit, where hundreds of parents spoke out in 
protest. Many were outraged that a white governor and mostly white 
Legislature would try to oust a school board elected by a city that 
is 75 percent black. Mayor Dennis Archer is black. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 31-7 in the state Senate on Thursday, gives  
Archer 30 days to appoint six Detroit residents to a reform board 
to oversee city schools. Archer said the plan offers a ``fresh 
start'' and ``brighter future'' for students. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the current school board members are eligible for the  
reform board. State Superintendent Art Ellis, who was hired by the 
State Board of Education, will hold the board's seventh spot as 
Engler's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the reform board is in place for at least five years,  
Detroit residents will be allowed to vote on whether the reform 
board should remain. 
</P>
<P>
	The present school board will be retained as an unpaid advisory  
body.

<HEADLINE> French Tunnel Death Toll Hits 35 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Firefighters searched among the charred  
remains of cars and tractor-trailers Friday for victims of a 
catastrophic fire -- a blaze that killed at least 35 people in a 
seven-mile tunnel under Western Europe's highest peak. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze in the Mont Blanc tunnel, which broke out Wednesday on  
a Belgian truck carrying flour and margarine, was not extinguished 
until Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpine tunnel is a major route connecting France and Italy,  
used daily by up to 4,000 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the French side, Philippe Pathous, fire chief for the  
Haute-Savoie region, said as many as 40 people may have died. On 
the Italian side, tunnel director Francesco Colombo put the toll at 
35. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors was the driver of the Belgian truck, Gilbert  
Degraves. Driving from France to Italy, he said he was alerted to 
the fire when oncoming vehicles flashed their headlights about four 
miles into the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke billowed from his truck. He stopped, checked underneath  
and ``it exploded,'' Degraves, a truck driver for 25 years, told 
RTL radio. ``It was a ball of fire for about 30 seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims were found in or around their vehicles. Only  
a few had been able to reach the 17 heat-resistant bunkers lining 
the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first fatal fire in the tunnel, which was the longest  
in the world when President Charles de Gaulle opened it in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire raised immediate questions about the emergency systems  
in the tunnel, which is equipped with ventilation equipment as well 
as the 17 bunkers, each of which can hold dozens of people. 
However, the bunkers are designed to resist heat and toxic fumes 
for only about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other safety measures, drivers in the two-lane tunnel can  
pull out every 1,000 feet in case of breakdowns or if they need to 
turn around. Tunnel officials also can send messages to drivers 
through an emergency broadcast system. 
</P>
<P>
	The tunnel operator, Mont Blanc Tunnel and Highway, said about  
20 tractor-trailer trucks and 11 cars were destroyed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was truly a dramatic spectacle, and an apocalyptic  
situation,'' Pathous told a news conference at the French entrance. 
``There will be a problem identifying the bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the tunnel reached at least 1,832 degrees at one  
point, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were still in the tunnel Friday evening, left in  
place so investigators could better conduct their inquiry into the 
causes of the fire. It wasn't known when they would be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 firefighters from France, Italy and Switzerland  
battled toxic fumes and searing temperatures for two days to tame 
the blaze. For the first time Friday, they managed to penetrate the 
length of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a spray mist, they cooled it down to 158 degrees, then to  
122 degrees. Smoke rose from their protective gear as they emerged 
from forays into the tunnel. They declined to speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds blowing through the passage sent toxic fumes from Italy to  
France, forcing rescuers to focus on the Italian side. The stench 
of burning rubber and acrid fumes hung in the mountain air. 
</P>
<P>
	The burning flour in the Belgian truck thickened the smoke in  
the tunnel immediately, Colombo said on the Italian side. 
</P>
<P>
	Many felt the tunnel's safety measures were not enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time now,'' said the mayor of Chamonix, Michel  
Charlet, ``it has been said that the Mont Blanc tunnel is no longer 
suited'' to heavy truck traffic. He appealed for a ban on heavy 
trucks in the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from his hospital bed, Chamonix fire chief Christian  
Comte said he spent five hours in the tunnel Wednesday, looking for 
his men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smoke was very dense and the temperatures were soaring,  
but I knew that I had to go help them,'' he said from the 
Sallanches Hospital, where he was recovering from smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone, Comte said he  
worked his way along the wall of the tunnel until he came to a 
group of six firefighters -- all lying on the ground with their 
jackets over their heads, motionless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they were all dead,'' he said. He helped them all  
leave, but one died later. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the victims was Pierlucio Tinazi, a 33-year-old Italian  
tunnel employee. He saved 10 people, Italian officials told a news 
conference, making repeated trips on his motorcycle before 
succumbing to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider him a real hero,'' Colombo said. ``He did his duty  
and we are very grateful to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colombo said an Italian family of four from a nearby village was  
also killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other Italians died. Among the French victims were the  
firefighter and a couple from Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days of searing heat, smoke and flame took its toll on the  
tunnel's structure. Police said the ceiling had collapsed for a 
length of about 100 yards over the fire. French Transport Minister 
Jean-Claude Gayssot said the tunnel would remain closed for several 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Mets Place Nomo on Release Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Mets placed Hideo Nomo  
on unconditional release waivers Friday after the right-hander 
reported to Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	If Nomo isn't claimed before waivers expire Tuesday, the Mets  
will release him and give him only 45 days termination pay, 
$719,262, instead of his full salary of $2,925,000. Nomo would then 
be a free agent and could sign with any team. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year while playing for the  
Dodgers, won 45 games in Los Angeles, but struggled last season and 
was traded to the Mets in June. He went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 
games with New York and was ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with 
a 7.62 ERA in four appearances.

	Killings of Albanians Reported  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite NATO air attacks, Serb  
forces have executed scores of Kosovo Albanians and shelled 
numerous villages as fighting raged today throughout the province, 
ethnic Albanian sources said. The dead reportedly include a 
prominent lawyer and his two sons who were arrested on the first 
day of the NATO attacks, which President Clinton says are to weaken 
Yugoslav President Milosevic's capability to wage war on ethnic 
Albanians.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two Yugoslav MiG fighters were shot  
down by NATO jets in Bosnia, thwarting an attempted attack on 
NATO-led peacekeeping forces, alliance and U.S. officials said. 
Peacekeepers were searching for the pilots, a NATO spokesman said. 
The confrontation outside Yugoslav territory was a dangerous 
broadening of the showdown between the Western alliance and 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo. The air-to-air 
combat came as Yugoslav media reported that NATO forces launched 
their first daylight attack on Yugoslavia.

	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- After 25 years of lawsuits, studies and  
protests, the nation's first nuclear dump -- deep beneath the New 
Mexico desert -- received its first truckload of radioactive waste 
today. The truck left Los Alamos National Laboratory and traveled 
270 miles south to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad. 
Ultimately, up to 6.2 million cubic feet of waste generated since 
the dawn of the atomic age will be entombed over the next 30 years 
in the salt beds nearly a half-mile below ground.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Ordinary hospital CT scanners can be  
equipped to snap stop-action pictures of the heart, offering a new 
way of detecting dangerously clogged arteries many years before 
they cause trouble. Fatty buildups in the heart's arteries begin in 
early adulthood, but often there is no sign of damage until a heart 
attack strikes in middle age or beyond. However, these deposits 
frequently contain calcium that shows up on CT scans.

bars, McDonald's has become the latest U.S. heavyweight to enter

<HEADLINE> Fidelity to Frequent Callers: Stop! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fidelity Investments has told 30,000 frequent  
callers to quit reaching out and touching its telephone 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 5,000 customers who call often for fund balances,  
stock quotes or other information got letters from Fidelity telling 
them to use its Web site or automated phone system instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who continue making calls will be routed to special  
representatives who won't give them answers, but will direct them 
to the routine information. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Fidelity sent letters to another 25,000 customers -- a  
total of only half of one percent of its 6 million retail 
customers. Fidelity, the world's largest mutual fund company, has a 
total of 15 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some frequent callers were miffed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Offensive and insulting,'' Michael Fischler, a professor at  
Plymouth State College in New Hampshire, told The Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is really clear: Don't bother us. You're annoying  
us. Get in line, or we don't want your business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one Fidelity watcher applauded the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very smart,'' said David O'Leary, president of  
N.H.-based Alpha Equity Research, said today. ``The more they can 
drive their customers to the Internet, the more they reduce their 
costs, and the more they limit their regulatory exposure because of 
people making mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The people who call often -- sometimes every hour -- are just  
lazy, retired or have nothing else to do, said O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are people who are just behind the curve in terms of  
using technology,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many customers simply need instruction on how to use Fidelity's  
automated telephone system or Web site, said Anne Crowley, Fidelity 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people, once they've been shown it, said, 'This was  
great,''' Crowley said, noting Fidelity spends at least $500 
million every year updating its technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers who received the letter will still be able to talk to  
a phone representative to ask more complicated questions about 
their accounts, said Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
	She wouldn't say how frequently a customer had to call to make  
the cutoff list, but she said the company was careful to screen out 
customers who needed extra help for more complex transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Few have complained.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've only heard from 34 customers who registered  
complaints,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity receives 680,000 telephone calls a day, 77 percent of  
which are handled by automated systems, said Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had a phone representative answer that 77 percent of  
calls, people would be waiting on hold forever, or it would be 
prohibitively costly and raise the customers' costs,'' Crowley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone call fielded by a human being costs $13; an automated  
phone call costs only $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The average Fidelity mutual fund customer calls 4 or 5 times a  
year, she said. The average brokerage customer calls 15 times a 
year.

<HEADLINE> Will Refinery Blasts Raise Gas Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gas prices surged in California following  
last month's deadly explosion at a Tosco refinery, and analysts say 
Thursday's fire at a Chevron plant may well send them higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to go up a lot,'' said Michael Mayer, a  
securities analyst who follows Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in the explosion Thursday afternoon at the  
Chevron plant in Richmond, which sent a huge pillar of black smoke 
across the Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Chevron plant said the refinery would remain  
open, while the unit where the fiery explosion occurred was shut 
down indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The refinery can produce up to 240,000 gallons of crude oil  
daily, said Chevron spokeswoman Dawn Soper. She would not say how 
the unit's closure would impact production there. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I couldn't speculate on anything regarding  
pricing,'' Soper said. With refineries in El Segundo and elsewhere, 
``we don't expect what happened today to have a significant affect 
on our customers including those at the pump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But production already is crippled in the state, with at least  
three other refineries operating at less than 100 percent capacity, 
said Jay McKeeman, executive vice president of the California 
Independent Oil Marketers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Various refinery shutdowns in California mean about 250,000 to  
300,000 gallons a day are cut out of the state's normal daily 
supply of 2 million gallons, according to Chevron spokesman Jack 
Coffey. Tosco's Avon plant alone usually produces 160,000 gallons a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is one in a continuing series of problems,''  
McKeeman said. ``California is a huge petroleum consumer entity, 
(buying) 13 billion gallons of gasoline a year. It needs a lot of 
refining capacity a year to meet that demand. Anytime there's a 
glitch in the system you get a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 23, the day of the blast at the Tosco Avon refinery that  
killed four workers and left another man critically injured, prices 
shot up 16 cents -- to $1.18 a gallon on the West Coast -- before 
sliding back down to about $1.02 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for regular gasoline were about $1.30 a gallon or more in  
the San Francisco Bay area this week, compared to about $1.12 on 
the West Coast overall, according to the U.S. Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	California motorists face unique concerns when buying gas  
because laws require it to be specially formulated and most of what 
they purchase is produced in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't immediately get access to other supplies of fuel,''  
McKeeman said. ``It's going to cost more; there's delays in getting 
conforming fuel in the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much supply could be affected is an open question,  
McKeeman said. The refineries experiencing various problems -- which 
also include an Arco facility in the Los Angeles area and an Exxon 
site in Benicia -- account for as much as half of the state's fuel 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's true that close to half of the refining capacity in  
the state is at risk, yeah, there's a very definite problem of 
supply shortages,'' McKeeman said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Boys Charged Over Distress Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Two 12-year-old boys have been charged  
with making false distress-at-sea calls from their school bus in a 
prank that set off a urgent search of Long Island Sound by the 
Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys made four calls over two days this week, using a  
hand-held VHF radio. They reported their boat had crashed into 
rocks and was taking on water near Bridgeport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard dispatched two 41-foot boats, which spent  
several hours searching for the boys. A helicopter was set to take 
off when the boys reported that they were safely ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is dangerous business,'' said John D. Strauser, Coast  
Guard chief warrant officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to respond. Even when we think there is a possibility  
they're not being truthful, we're going to respond the same as the 
fire department and police department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strauser said the prank cost taxpayers about $16,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The boys' names were not released because they are juveniles.

<HEADLINE> Von Ert Wins U.S. Snowboard Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUDLOW, Vt. (AP) -- Olympic snowboard teammates Sondra Van Ert of  
Ketchum, Idaho, took control on the second run Friday to overtake 
Rosey Fletcher of Anchorage, Alaska, and win the giant slalom for 
her ninth U.S. championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher and the semi-ageless Van Ert, who turned 35 on March 9,  
flip-flopped their results from Thursday's slalom, which was won 
handily by Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Ert, who won three World Cup races this winter and a bronze  
medal in giant slalom in the world snowboard championships, had a 
winning time of 2 minutes, 42.30 seconds. Fletcher was silver 
medalist in 2:42.48 and Lisa Kosglow of Boise, Idaho, was third in 
2:42.94. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I get to play for another year,'' Van Ert giggled as she  
discussed possibly continuing until the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake 
City. She graduated from the University of Utah after retiring from 
World Cup skiing in the mid-1980s. She became hooked on 
snowboarding while recuperating from knee surgery and watching kids 
having fun riding 'boards in Sun Valley, near her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was third in the first run, but I was two seconds back of  
Rosey,'' Van Ert said, ``so I had nothing to lose on my second run. 
I tried to ride aggressively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher was disappointed in letting another title slip away but  
she brightened as she noted her younger sister, Beth, finished 
ninth and Friday was her last race of the season. ``I haven't been 
home since Christmas,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's event, Canadians Mark Fawcett and Jasey Jay  
Anderson finished 1-2 with Peter Thorndike of Meredith, N.H., in 
third place. Fawcett dominated the race, posting the fastest time 
on each run to finish in 2:29.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Although racers and coaches heaped praise on course crews for  
keeping the run together despite the softening conditions, the 
mushy snow created big gaps in time among the riders. 
</P>
<P>
	``True, but it would've been worse if these guys hadn't done  
such a good job preparing the course,'' Fawcett said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Broadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose broadly Friday as investors  
sought a safe haven while the U.S.-led NATO bombing in Yugoslavia 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0769, down from $1.0826. During the  
trading day, the euro fell to $1.0715, its lowest level since the 
launch of the new currency in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.26 Japanese yen,  
up from 118.13. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (foreign exchange) market feels the longer the conflict in  
Kosovo involving NATO, this is a negative for euroland,'' said 
Jeffrey Yu, a senior foreign exchange dealer at Sanwa Bank, 
referring to the 11 nations using the new currency. ``It's a sell 
Europe and buy something else (market). For the time being it's buy 
the dollar, buy North America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4806 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4716, and 1.5142 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5078. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6218, down from $1.6234. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8162 German 
marks, up from 1.8067; 6.0901 French francs, up from 6.0606; and 
1,798.56 Italian lire, up from 1,788.91.

	MONROE, N.C. (AP) -- Randy Travis has made quite a name for  
himself in Nashville. Now, he has succeeded in clearing the name he 
made for himself in Marshville. 
</P>
<P>
	At the country singer's request, Gov. Jim Hunt issued a pardon  
Thursday clearing Travis' criminal record as a youth. Hunt said 
Travis, 39, has since earned a name for ``responsible civic 
behavior and community service.'' 
</P>

arrests for weapons offenses, burglary and larceny.

	After winning a talent contest in 1977 and pairing with manager  
Lib Hatcher, now his wife, Travis managed to break into big-time 
country music. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Appeals to Serbian People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed directly to the  
Serb people Friday for support in NATO's struggle against Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. ``He has jeopardized Kosovo's future 
and brought you more war,'' Clinton said in a satellite-beamed 
message he labeled ``the plain truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Yugoslav authorities tightly controlling the media in  
Belgrade, administration officials said the purpose of Clinton's 
broadcast, and a similar one by Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright in the local Serbo-Croatian language, was to explain to 
the Serb people why NATO bombers had attacked their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no such thing as a free press and opposing views in  
Serbia now,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	But by sounding the theme that Milosevic was to blame for the  
bloodshed, Clinton and Albright appeared to be trying to unsettle 
Milosevic's rule and turn his people against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could have kept Kosovo and Serbia and given you peace,''  
Clinton said. ``Right now, he's forcing your sons to keep fighting 
a senseless conflict that you did not ask for and that he could 
have prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Striking at the Serbs' national pride, Clinton told those able  
to receive his videotaped broadcast that ``President Milosevic has 
spoken often of Serbia's standing in the world, but by his every 
action he has diminished your country's standing, exposed you to 
violence and instability, and isolated you from the rest of 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how many people heard Clinton's message, which  
was carried by Radio Free Europe, Voice of America and World Net, 
the television enterprise run by the U.S. Information Agency, as 
well as over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart conceded that Milosevic was  
unlikely to allow state television to broadcast Clinton's message. 
``But we do believe through a variety of sources, including the 
Internet, that the message will get through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, meanwhile, said the  
administration was ``extremely alarmed'' about reports of 
atrocities against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo and was 
``putting a great deal of resources and efforts into checking these 
out as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any evidence will be turned over to an international war crimes  
tribunal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who learned Serbo-Croatian as a child when her father  
served as a Czech diplomat in Belgrade, told the Serbs: ``Americans 
do not hate Serbs. Like me, they remember when we were allies 
against fascism. Like you, Americans want to live in peace with 
their neighbors and the wider world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the United States and its allies ``could not sit idly  
by while security forces were used to commit atrocities against 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With NATO warplanes raking Serb targets with bombs and cruise  
missiles, ethnic Serb demonstrators charged the U.S. Embassy in 
neighboring Macedonia on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Christopher Hill and other Americans were not  
injured. But on Friday, the State Department authorized the 
departure from Skopje of nonessential personnel and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has warned Milosevic not to expand the  
conflict in Kosovo to Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials confirmed that the Serbs' sweep through the  
villages of Kosovo was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that there is intensified fighting. It remains  
localized ... but there is fighting,'' Lockhart said. ``This is not 
surprising to us. This is something that started before the allied 
operation began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme military commander, said a  
third day of airstrikes would be focused on further reducing 
Yugoslavia's formidable air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied fighter planes on Friday shot down two Yugoslav jets over  
Bosnia. Rubin said the Yugoslavs were ``moving against'' troops 
maintaining peace accords in the country where Serbs, Croats and 
Muslims had fought a war for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said on NBC that the 19-nation NATO alliance was united  
in supporting the assault. This conflicted with reports that Italy 
wanted to reopen negotiations and that Greece was skeptical of the 
operation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Serbs Torn Between Loyalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After NATO's air assaults began on Yugoslavia,  
17-year-old Vladimir Vukovic called his former girlfriend's home in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I'm sorry for being here,'' Vukovic said, his  
voice shaking with emotion. ``I'm sorry I can't be there to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vukovic escaped Sarajevo under fire from Bosnian troops about  
two years ago, and said he is familiar with war. But the guilt of 
living in the country that is now bombing his homeland seemed to 
overwhelm the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should be there to help my people who have never seen war,''  
he said Thursday. In the United States, he said he is limited to 
protesting NATO actions -- and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Vukovic, a high school student who came to Chicago with his  
parents, echoed the conflicted feelings of a half-dozen Serbs 
gathered outside St. Steven Decani Free Serbian Orthodox Church on 
the city's northwest side. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Jankovic, 47, an American citizen who has owned a  
construction business in Chicago for 12 years, said he considers 
the United States his country but is angered by what he contends is 
foolish interference by President Clinton in a centuries-old 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``You Americans don't understand our history,'' he said.  
``Kosovo is like our Jerusalem. Serbs have been fighting for Kosovo 
for 500 years. They will never stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feared the conflict would grow into another world  
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not Bill Clinton's or NATO's business,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jankovic and others in the group felt no bitterness toward their

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Appeals to Serbian People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed directly to the  
Serb people Friday for support in NATO's struggle against Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. ``He has jeopardized Kosovo's future 
and brought you more war,'' Clinton said in a satellite-beamed 
message he labeled ``the plain truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Yugoslav authorities tightly controlling the media in  
Belgrade, administration officials said the purpose of Clinton's 
broadcast, and a similar one by Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright in the local Serbo-Croatian language, was to explain to 
the Serb people why NATO bombers had attacked their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no such thing as a free press and opposing views in  
Serbia now,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	But by sounding the theme that Milosevic was to blame for the  
bloodshed, Clinton and Albright appeared to be trying to unsettle 
Milosevic's rule and turn his people against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could have kept Kosovo and Serbia and given you peace,''  
Clinton said. ``Right now, he's forcing your sons to keep fighting 
a senseless conflict that you did not ask for and that he could 
have prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Striking at the Serbs' national pride, Clinton told those able  
to receive his videotaped broadcast that ``President Milosevic has 
spoken often of Serbia's standing in the world, but by his every 
action he has diminished your country's standing, exposed you to 
violence and instability, and isolated you from the rest of 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how many people heard Clinton's message, which  
was carried by Radio Free Europe, Voice of America and World Net, 
the television enterprise run by the U.S. Information Agency, as 
well as over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart conceded that Milosevic was  
unlikely to allow state television to broadcast Clinton's message. 
``But we do believe through a variety of sources, including the 
Internet, that the message will get through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, meanwhile, said the  
administration was ``extremely alarmed'' about reports of 
atrocities against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo and was 
``putting a great deal of resources and efforts into checking these 
out as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any evidence will be turned over to an international war crimes  
tribunal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who learned Serbo-Croatian as a child when her father  
served as a Czech diplomat in Belgrade, told the Serbs: ``Americans 
do not hate Serbs. Like me, they remember when we were allies 
against fascism. Like you, Americans want to live in peace with 
their neighbors and the wider world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the United States and its allies ``could not sit idly  
by while security forces were used to commit atrocities against 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With NATO warplanes raking Serb targets with bombs and cruise  
missiles, ethnic Serb demonstrators charged the U.S. Embassy in 
neighboring Macedonia on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Christopher Hill and other Americans were not  
injured. But on Friday, the State Department authorized the 
departure from Skopje of nonessential personnel and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has warned Milosevic not to expand the  
conflict in Kosovo to Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials confirmed that the Serbs' sweep through the  
villages of Kosovo was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that there is intensified fighting. It remains  
localized ... but there is fighting,'' Lockhart said. ``This is not 
surprising to us. This is something that started before the allied 
operation began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme military commander, said a  
third day of airstrikes would be focused on further reducing 
Yugoslavia's formidable air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied fighter planes on Friday shot down two Yugoslav jets over  
Bosnia. Rubin said the Yugoslavs were ``moving against'' troops 
maintaining peace accords in the country where Serbs, Croats and 
Muslims had fought a war for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said on NBC that the 19-nation NATO alliance was united  
in supporting the assault. This conflicted with reports that Italy 
wanted to reopen negotiations and that Greece was skeptical of the 
operation.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Guilty of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian made a video of himself  
killing a man and dared prosecutors to charge him. Then he ordered 
jurors to convict him if they looked at him and saw a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	They did.  
</P>
<P>
	Now after participating in what he says are more than 130  
suicides over nine years, the 70-year-old crusader for assisted 
suicide and euthanasia faces the possibility of spending the rest 
of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury convicted Kevorkian of second-degree murder Friday in  
the Sept. 17 death of 52-year-old Thomas Youk, who suffered from 
Lou Gehrig's disease, rejecting Kevorkian's argument that ``there 
are certain acts that by sheer common sense are not crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Gorcyca said state guidelines call for a  
minimum of 10 to 25 years. Kevorkian's defense attorney said he 
would ask for no prison time. Kevorkian was also convicted of 
delivery of a controlled substance, which has a maximum penalty of 
seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian escaped a first-degree murder conviction, which would  
have sent him to prison for life without possibility of parole. He 
told The Oakland Press of Pontiac that the verdict wasn't rational. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manslaughter, I could understand how they would arrive at  
that. But murder? This? They must have been an astonishingly cruel 
jury,'' he said. ``I got what I wanted -- a conviction. Why? That 
proves how corrupt the society is, and how malevolent are those who 
run it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the retired pathologist's first murder trial. In four  
previous felony trials on assisted suicide charges, his defense 
relied on evidence of the pain and suffering by people who died 
with his help. The earlier trials resulted in three acquittals and 
one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, that defense wasn't allowed.  
</P>
<P>
	And this time, prosecutors had the tape that Kevorkian gave to  
CBS's ``60 Minutes'' of himself injecting Youk with a fatal dose of 
drugs. In past cases, Kevorkian has said his clients used his 
homemade devices to control the carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that killed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian baited the prosecutors on ``60 minutes.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to force them to act,'' he said. ``They must charge  
me. Because if they do not, that means they don't think it was a 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, they didn't, said prosecutor John Skrzynski. ``If Jack  
Kevorkian had not videotaped this, no one would have ever known it 
happened,'' he said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Kevorkian has even begged and sometimes taunted me into  
prosecuting him,'' Gorcyca said. ``Today a jury of his peers 
granted him his ultimate wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To convict on second-degree murder, the jury only had to agree  
Kevorkian either intended to kill or do great bodily harm, or 
created a high risk of death or great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who served as his own attorney during the swift  
trial, showed no reaction as the verdicts were read after 12 hours 
of jury deliberations. He remained free on bond after agreeing to 
do nothing unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
	``No assisted suicide. No injection. No anything,'' Judge  
Jessica Cooper told him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing is scheduled for April 14.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney David Gorosh said he would pursue an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Kevorkian is certainly no murderer,'' said Gorosh, who  
resumed his role Friday morning after Kevorkian withdrew as his own 
attorney. ``We believe it's certainly unjust to equate an act of 
compassion to an act of murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian won the right to represent himself despite the  
misgivings of the judge, who asked him: ``Do you understand you 
could spend the rest of your life in prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' he responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian sometimes stumbled in his efforts to serve as his own  
lawyer. He called no witnesses after the judge refused to let him 
call Youk's widow and brother, who supported Kevorkian, to the 
stand. Prosecutors had argued that their testimony was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Skrzynski likened Kevorkian to ``a medical  
hitman in the night'' and asked jurors not to let him make a 
political statement with Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian told jurors that he acted out of compassion, and that  
he was merely doing his duty as a physician to relieve Youk's 
suffering. He compared himself to civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks 
and Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain acts that by sheer common sense are not  
crimes,'' he told jurors. ``Just look at me. ... Honestly now, do 
you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer? ... If you do, then you 
must convict. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then, take the harsh judgment of history, and the harsher  
judgment of your children and grandchildren if they ever come to 
need that precious choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's only prior conviction was in November, on  
misdemeanor charges related to a scuffle with police outside a 
hospital where he and an associate were dropping off a body.

<HEADLINE> Fouls Worry Ga. Coach Against Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Everywhere Georgia coach Andy Landers  
looks, he sees people in striped shirts. Every sound he hears 
resembles a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of his team's game against Duke in the national  
semifinals, Landers was dealing Thursday with a serious referee 
obsession. Like most coaches, he was concerned about his team's 
penchant for getting into foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get up on people and play aggressive, as we do, we  
have to be careful there,'' Landers said. ``We fouled the person at 
McDonalds this morning that was serving us Coke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landers' team has struggled with foul trouble at times this  
season. The Lady Bulldogs have averaged 20.4 fouls per game, as 
opposed to 18.9 by their opponents. And Georgia has had players 
foul out 24 times -- including eight times by freshman center Tawana 
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important for our basketball team to stay out of  
foul trouble,'' he said. ``When you dribble-drive the way Duke 
does, when you have the inside people that Duke has, there's the 
potential to have fouls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Gail Goestenkors also thinks fouls will be a key to  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both teams are probably going to try to get the ball  
inside early on and try to get somebody in foul trouble,'' she 
said. ``We are both very, very aggressive on the defensive end of 
the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bigger concern for Goestenkors is whether her team can stop  
Kelly and Coco Miller. The identical twins, who average a combined 
37 points a game in the Georgia backcourt, present a double 
challenge for Duke in tonight's first semifinal game at the Women's 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the twins is an incredible experience,'' Goestenkors  
said. ``It's an exciting brand of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly averaged 18.6 points a game this season for the Lady  
Bulldogs, and Coco averaged 18.4. They swapped the team lead for 
scoring six times this season, with Kelly overtaking her sister by 
scoring a career-high 33 points in Georgia's 89-71 win over Iowa 
State in the Mideast Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our personalities are very similar,'' Kelly said.  
``And we've played together for so long I think that helps a lot on 
the court. We love to play together. We are really close. I think 
it definitely has strengthened the bond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 sophomore sisters started playing basketball as 4  
year olds in Rochester, Minn. They are considered the best twins in 
women's basketball since Pam and Paula McGee played at Southern 
California in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Landers has coached three sets of twins, and tries to downplay  
the novelty of coaching such similar players. When asked for 
humorous anecdotes about the twins, such as cases of mistaken 
identity, he is at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to burst your bubble. I can't tell you a lot of  
funny stories because we've worked hard at treating them as 
individuals,'' he said. ``While they look alike, they're not alike. 
Do they have a lot of common bonds? Yes. But I hope everybody on 
our team does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coco is a slightly better outside shooter. Kelly has more  
rebounds, steals and assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way that they move is very different,'' Landers said.  
``You can just look across the floor and know who it is, who is 
running or dribbling or shooting.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A man wanted for questioning in  
the slaying of a Brazilian man at the Waldorf Astoria in New York 
turned himself in to police Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcio Scherer, 27, was the last person seen with Joao Saboia  
before the 56-year-old was found dead on March 13. Police 
questioned Scherer for an hour, in the presence of his two lawyers, 
federal police spokeswomen Jocelia Pisoni said by telephone from 
Porto Alegre 700 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	A local judge ordered Scherer jailed until the investigation is  
completed, Pisoni said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York police had wanted to talk to Scherer, who left the  
United States shortly after the murder, but have so far declined to 
call him a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Saboia had stopped in New York on his way to Atlantic City,  
where he was well known for his high-priced gambling. He often 
carried a lot of cash, and police told his family that about 
$50,000 was missing from his room, his nephew said.

	GUADALAJARA (AP) -- Religious leaders said Friday they were  
delighted at reports the Vatican will canonize a Mexican nun who 
founded a religious order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican said Friday it had officially attributed a miracle  
to Sister Maria de Jesus Sacramentado Venegas, which clears her 
path to sainthood, Vatican Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Venegas, founder of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,  
was born in the western state of Jalisco in 1868 and died in the 
state capital, Guadalajara, in 1959. She was known locally as Madre 
Naty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news is a great honor to religious people in Jalisco, and  
to its Catholic Church,'' said Jose Trinidad Gonzalez, assistant 
bishop of Guadalajara. Venegas would become Mexico's second saint, 
after 19th-century Franciscan monk Saint Felipe de Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez said thousands of Mexicans will lead a pilgrimage to  
the Vatican on May 21, 2000, the day scheduled for the canonization 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	He said other Mexicans chosen for sainthood could include Juan  
Diego, an Indian thought to have been visited by the Virgin Mary, 
as well as father Jose Maria del Yermo and Bishop Cristobal 
Magayanes.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Vendors left their sidewalk stands and took  
to the streets Friday to protest the arrest of a powerful leader of 
a vendors' organization on suspicion of leading a turf battle 
earlier this week with a rival group. 
</P>
<P>
	About one hundred vendors blocked a street outside the Mexico  
City prosecutor's office, demanding Silvia Rico's release. She will 
be either charged or released within two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rico was arrested after she was implicated in a pitched battle  
between two rival groups of vendors outside the city's main square 
in which three people suffered gunshot wounds earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The vendors have engaged in frequent clashes with police over  
the last two years. The administration of leftist Mayor Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas has vowed to clear some streets of stands, which were long 
tolerated because of the political clout of the vendors' groups and 
bribes they paid.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A merger of Mexico's top two financial groups

between Bancomer and Banamex-Accival was in the works, despite 
repeated denials by company officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Sanchez Ugarte, head of the Federal Competition  
Commission, said neither financial group has submitted a formal 
request for a merger, but that considering their market positions, 
the antitrust agency would carefully evaluate such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that under current market conditions, it would be  
very difficult for the commission to approve a merger of this 
kind,'' Sanchez Ugarte told foreign correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two banks were to merge, the resulting entity would  
control about half the Mexican market.

institutions have the intention of starting preliminary merger 
talks.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Diabetes Drug Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- The controversial drug Rezulin is credited  
with helping thousands battle diabetes, but it also can cause 
sudden and lethal liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	A scientific panel has decided in frustration that just how  
risky Rezulin really is remains a mystery, but it advised imposing 
new restrictions on the drug in hopes that only diabetics who need 
Rezulin most will chance using it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to be used, ever, as a first-line drug for  
diabetes,'' Dr. Jules Hirsch of Rockefeller University said as 
fellow advisers to the Food and Drug Administration pushed for new 
curbs on Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was widely cheered  
when it hit the market in 1997, because it is the only drug sold 
that resensitizes the body to insulin, the underlying problem of 
Type II or adult-onset diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors contend it is invaluable for certain patients, and  
750,000 Americans now use it. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the drug can damage patients' livers, the FDA on  
Friday gathered its advisory panel for a highly unusual public 
reassessment of Rezulin's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said 43 patients have suffered acute liver failure after  
taking Rezulin for several months and the drug probably caused 38 
of the cases. Twenty-eight died, seven survived only with liver 
transplants and five recovered without transplants. The FDA has not 
determined what happened to the other three. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA epidemiologist, Dr. David Graham, contended that the 43  
cases may represent only 10 percent of all Rezulin patients with 
liver failure, because the government seldom learns of all drug 
side effects. Thus, Graham argued that Rezulin may have caused up 
to 400 cases of liver failure instead of just the 38 he can prove. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk increases the longer diabetics use the drug, Graham  
said. He created a model that estimated that risk at one in 1,800 
people who use Rezulin for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite repeated FDA warnings that patients' livers should  
be tested monthly for early damage signs, so they can stop the drug 
in hopes their livers will heal, one study suggests less than half 
of doctors do so. In addition, testing didn't help a handful of 
patients whose fatal liver damage occurred just weeks after they 
passed a liver test. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturer Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Inc.,  
vehemently denied that Rezulin's risk is so high. It contends that 
about one in 45,000 Rezulin users will develop liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people have used Rezulin for six months to a year,  
the company said. So, it said, if the risk were as high as the FDA 
contends, an epidemic of liver failure would have resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the epidemic?'' asked Dr. Gerald Faich, a Parke-Davis  
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA's Graham conceded he knows of no patient who died after  
taking Rezulin for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten diabetes specialists begged the FDA's advisers not to ban  
Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	``No drug is 100 percent safe,'' said Dr. Steven Edelman of the  
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Diego, noting that 
uncontrolled diabetes causes blindness, kidney damage, heart 
disease and stroke. ``But diabetes is a serious disease'' that 
kills 400 Americans a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA advisers were frustrated that no one can prove which  
risk estimate is accurate. So they recommended restrictions on the 
drug until doctors get a better grasp of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel decided that Rezulin should never be used as a lone  
therapy, as it now is sold, but only in combination with older 
treatments, and it should only be prescribed for patients who 
cannot adequately control their disease with other, less risky 
therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``abysmal'' that so few doctors conduct proper liver  
tests, the FDA panel said. It insisted that Parke-Davis explicitly 
warn patients about the liver risks so they'll know to demand tests 
for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA isn't bound by its advisers' decisions, but usually  
follows them.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese negotiators are intensifying  
efforts to achieve a breakthrough in trade relations despite 
tensions over human rights and allegations of nuclear espionage by 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said Friday that negotiators have made  
significant progress toward opening China's huge market for 
American manufacturers, farmers and financial firms, something the 
administration says is critical to narrow a trade gap with China 
that hit a record $57 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for China agreeing to open its markets, the United  
States would lift its objections to China's membership in the World 
Trade Organization, an economic prize the Asian nation has been 
seeking for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between the United States and China over WTO  
membership have intensified in recent weeks even as anger over 
China's human rights record and alleged nuclear espionage have 
risen in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are struggling to complete a deal that could be used  
as the centerpiece for a Washington visit next month by Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji. The White House announced Friday that Zhu will 
hold high-level talks with President Clinton on April 8 as part of 
a nine-day visit that will include stops in five other American 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu is eager to obtain WTO membership for China, and U.S.  
officials say China's market-opening offers have improved 
considerably since Zhu became personally involved in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is seeking to break down sizable barriers to  
the sale of American exports of everything from wheat to cars to 
compact discs. The Clinton administration also wants permission for 
American banks, investment houses and insurance companies to expand 
their Chinese operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has made more progress in the last month than it had in  
the last three years,'' said one American trade official involved 
in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	But this official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a  
lot of ground still must be covered to achieve a deal acceptable to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-level team in Beijing, led by U.S. Assistant Trade  
Representative Bob Cassidy, is expected to continue negotiations 
over the weekend. Commerce Secretary William Daley will arrive 
there Monday, leading a trade mission that includes top U.S. 
business executives. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is thought likely  
to join the talks either in Beijing or when they move back to 
Washington as officials try to close a deal in the days before 
Zhu's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	But trade experts said they still believe a WTO deal this year  
would be a long shot, given the current deterioration in 
U.S.-Chinese relations, including recent allegations that Beijing 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
Friday that the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission's annual session in Geneva will introduce a resolution 
next month accusing China of wholesale violations of the human 
rights of its people. ``China's human rights record has 
deteriorated sharply,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been real progress in the negotiations in a number  
of areas,'' said Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the Economic 
Strategy Institute in Washington. ``But the environment is so bad 
right now that it will be a tremendous uphill political struggle to 
sell even a good agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO sets the rules for global trade. China first sought  
membership in 1986 in the WTO's predecessor organization, the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Negotiations for China's 
membership were nearly complete in 1989 when talks were put on hold 
following China's crackdown on the democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
	To gain WTO membership, China must satisfy the United States and  
other economic powers that it will play by global trade rules by 
opening up its economy. Without U.S. approval, China's membership 
cannot go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Chinese offers include proposals to cut high tariffs and  
other barriers restricting the sale of U.S.-manufactured goods and 
agriculture products such as wheat and citrus, to allow greater 
foreign ownership in such areas as telecommunications companies and 
to remove tight restrictions on operations by American banks. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO membership for China would mean protection against  
unilateral trade sanctions imposed by the United States or other 
WTO members as well as the prestige of being at the table when the 
next round of global trade talks begins this coming November in 
Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Hacker Pleads Guilty in Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Mitnick, a computer vandal whose  
exploits made him the FBI's most wanted hacker, pleaded guilty 
Friday to computer and wire fraud charges in a deal that could make 
him a free man in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick, who admitted causing millions of dollars in damage to  
companies whose computer systems he penetrated, pleaded guilty to 
five felony counts in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a deal with prosecutors, Mitnick, 35, will be sentenced to  
three years, 10 months in prison but will be credited for time 
served, meaning he will be eligible for release in mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if he doesn't behave he'll be in longer,'' said David  
Schindler, a federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick has been in prison since his arrest in North Carolina in  
1995. He was sentenced to 14 months for breaking an earlier 
supervised release, plus additional time for stealing telephone 
access codes. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence forbade him from using computers for three years  
after his release. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Mitnick caused companies and institutions  
millions of dollars by stealing their software and altering 
computer information. Victims included such companies as Motorola, 
Novell, Nokia and Sun Microsystems, and the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick sometimes gained access to computers by impersonating  
employees of the company in order to obtain codes and passwords, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	His exploits made him a legend to other hackers. He was accused  
of breaking into a North American Air Defense Command computer, 
although the allegation was never proven. In 1989, he admitted 
hacking into the computers of Digital and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick was sentenced to a year in prison after being arrested  
for those crimes. He disappeared while on probation in 1992. He was 
tracked to North Carolina and arrested again in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A Web site dedicated to freeing Mitnick counts -- to the second --  
the time he has spent in jail.

<HEADLINE> Hospital: Carson Recovering Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Johnny Carson is doing well a week  
after quadruple bypass surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing fine,'' said Lindi Funston of Saint John's Health  
Center. ``He probably will not go home until after the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors expect the 73-year-old former ``Tonight Show'' host to  
recover fully. He underwent surgery March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about published reports that Carson had a heart attack,  
the spokeswoman said she didn't know. Carson Productions spokesman 
Jeff Sotzing wouldn't discuss Carson's health. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Marsalis May Work With NY Orchestra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Philharmonic's musical director is  
one step closer to his goal of working with jazz great Wynton 
Marsalis on an original composition. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Masur first spoke to Marsalis about a collaboration five  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard something he composed for his band and what he did  
with improvisation and thought he was someone who might be 
refreshing to work with the Philharmonic. I wanted him to have a 
composition for himself and for us together,'' he said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He refused the first time. After two and a half years he  
called me back and said, `Maybe I can do it now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Philharmonic is collaborating with the Lincoln Center Jazz  
Orchestra, directed by Marsalis, for ``Uptown Blues: Ellington at 
100.'' The concert will be televised on PBS on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Next December, the premiere of Marsalis' ``All Rise'' will be  
played by the Philharmonic, Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and 
Morgan State University Choir.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Backs Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Last year, millionaire Ron Unz spent  
$750,000 of his own money to promote a ballot measure aimed at 
virtually eliminating bilingual education in California schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Silicon Valley entrepreneur is dipping into his deep  
pockets again, this time to promote a ballot proposal intended to 
undermine the influence of major donors on state politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really think the campaigns in California have been much too  
much dominated by special interests, the powerful and wealthy 
corporations,'' Unz said Thursday as he submitted four initiatives 
to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Unz, a Republican who ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor  
in 1994, is teaming up with Tony Miller, a former Democratic 
candidate for secretary of state and lieutenant governor, to 
promote the proposals to limit campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
	All the initiatives contain the same campaign-related  
provisions, including limits on donations to state and local 
candidates, a ban on contributions from corporations and partial 
public financing for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The per-election donation limits would be $5,000 for statewide  
candidates and $3,000 for candidates for the Legislature and local 
offices. There are currently no limits on contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other key provisions would toughen donation disclosure  
provisions by, among other things, requiring that contributions of 
$1,000 or more to campaigns that raise at least $25,000 a year be 
disclosed within 24 hours on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many people who have said they very much  
support the proposal except for one or two elements,'' Unz said. 
``I don't know if they are sincere or not but we are calling their 
bluff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on which of the four initiatives they promote, they'll  
need to collect signatures from up to 670,816 voters to get it on 
the March 2000 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for both major political parties wouldn't take a  
position on the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP spokesman Chris Bertelli said Republican leaders were ``not  
closing the door on any of them, but we need to see stuff in 
writing ... before we can say what we are for and not for.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz Legend Honored by Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Nearly 45 years after his death, Charlie  
Parker is finally being embraced by his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	A bronze sculpture of Parker is to be unveiled Saturday in the  
historic 18th &AMP; Vine District where Parker's saxophone wailed into 
the wee hours as he helped develop bebop in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Musicians, jazz scholars and family members of Parker are also  
gathering this week to pay tribute to Parker during a two-day 
symposium. Parker, who was born in bordering Kansas City, Kan., 
died in New York in 1955 at age 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker's family has said that he did not feel he was well  
received in his hometown until after he became famous elsewhere. 
Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said the tribute is a way to right a wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kansas City has never really opened its heart to Charlie  
Parker, but we're trying to reverse that,'' Cleaver said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> New Browns Practice for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The orange helmets are back.  
</P>
<P>
	With no fanfare, just a barked command from the assistant  
coaches, ``helmets on -- buckle 'em up,'' the Cleveland Browns 
started their first practice in more than three years Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The no-pads workout was the first of five the expansion Browns  
will have at a minicamp which runs through Sunday. The team had a 
morning session Friday and another in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to be out there,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.  
``We've been in the paperwork of writing notebooks, looking at film 
of draft choices. Now to come out and work out with the players -- 
it gets your motor running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the defense in brown jerseys, offense in white and  
quarterbacks in orange, the team worked out in brisk, 90-minute 
sessions at the Browns' indoor practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all the 73 players on the Cleveland roster suited up,  
including defensive lineman John Jurkovic and placekicker Phil 
Dawson, who signed with Cleveland Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stretching session, players broke down into groups --  
linebackers doing agility drills, linemen working on blocking 
techniques, kick returners fielding punts. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, dressed in khaki pants with a Browns windbreaker and  
cap, strolled between groups of players, shouting encouragement and 
occasionally pulling a man aside to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also ran through a few plays as Palmer began trying to  
install Cleveland's basic offense and defense. There were some 
ragged moments with offsides penalties and bobbled snaps, but also 
a sense of excitement as players immediately tried to make good 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Palmer said he wanted the players to ease up a little.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can definitely tell by the number of bodies on the ground  
that the intensity was up,'' said Ty Detmer, who led the first 
offensive unit. ``Guys were flying around, excited to be out there 
and trying to make a good showing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most intense player was Chris Spielman, returning to  
football after sitting out last season to be with his wife after 
she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The middle linebacker cut 
through the line to the ball carrier on two of the offense's first 
four plays and seemed to set the tone for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to be back in my element,'' Spielman said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Shaped by POW Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John McCain endured 5 1/2 years of captivity,  
beatings that broke bones and months in solitary confinement. When 
he emerged from a Vietnam prisoner of war camp, he was a hero. Yet 
still he worried how his father would react to his confession under 
duress. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. Sidney McCain Jr., who bombed the city where his son was  
imprisoned, already knew from naval intelligence sources that his 
offspring had confessed to crimes against the people of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first meeting, father and son embraced.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of you,'' the older man said. ``You did the best you  
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 25 five years later, tears well in McCain's eyes as he  
slowly repeats those words -- ``I'm proud of you'' -- his voice 
hushed. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The searing story of his POW experience is central to McCain's  
presidential campaign. The Arizona senator's war record sets him 
apart from the rest of a crowded GOP field. Name one other 
true-blue hero in the bunch, his advisers challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	They are shipping videotaped biographies across the country and  
urging their candidate to share his war story more freely. When 
California Republicans gathered for a recent convention, McCain 
aides had the biography playing 24 hours a day on one channel in 
the delegates' hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is writing a book about his father and grandfather (both  
were Navy admirals) and his POW experience. It is due out in 
September, a few months before the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving from speech to speech, McCain calls back to Washington  
and asks his staff, ``How many veterans have called?'' They're 
signing up in droves, Senator. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of interviews during his first big campaign swing,  
McCain squeezed out memories of his time in captivity and discussed 
how they shaped the politician he became -- and the president he 
wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy brat, he was a troublemaker at the Naval Academy. He  
flouted authority. He now discusses his youthful indiscretions with 
a dose of pride, flashing an ain't-I-cute smirk when he tells GOP 
crowds that he finished fifth from the bottom in a class of 894. 
</P>
<P>
	He was shot down during a bombing mission over Hanoi in 1967,  
dragged from a lake by Hanoi residents and taken to prison 
critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	He was told he could return to the United States but refused to  
leave until Americans captured before him were released. He feared 
the Vietnamese wanted to release the admiral's kid as a propaganda 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting the deal kept him in jail until the war ended and made  
him a war hero. Yet McCain admits that he nearly accepted the 
communists' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agonized over that decision for a long period of time, but I  
kept coming around to it being a public relations ploy,'' McCain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Christmas, McCain's father would visit U.S. troops at the  
South Vietnam border and wander off alone -- a few feet into enemy 
territory. He would stand and stare toward the northern horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's campaign is forming a group of veterans called ``the  
Warriors,'' led by war buddies who plan to march on Iowa and New 
Hampshire to help him. His staff has identified 150,000 veterans in 
New Hampshire as potential supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be the very best president,'' said retired Air Force  
Col. George ``Bud'' Day, a trial lawyer in Fort Walton, Fla., who 
was McCain's commander in prison. ``It's got a lot to do with the 
war. John went into a POW camp a young man and came out of there 
basically a seasoned cold man who learned an awful lot about how 
brutal life can be and how wonderful men can be and how wonderful 
this country is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	After McCain refused to return home, the beatings and abuse  
began. His jailers wanted him to confess to crimes against North 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	One jailer, a man whom the U.S. prisoners only knew by the  
vulgar nickname they gave him, woke McCain every morning and 
yelled, ``Bow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain never would, and paid the price. ``I started every day  
with a beating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling the tormentor one day on the campaign trail, McCain  
spit out the five-letter nickname between clenched teeth. ``If I 
saw him on the street today. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't finish his sentence. With his hands suddenly balled  
into fists, he didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole's heroism in World War II did little to boost his  
fortunes as 1996 GOP nominee, but advisers believe McCain's case is 
more relevant. McCain's war story burnishes his carefully 
cultivated image as a maverick; advisers say it helps explain why 
he withstood political pressure and bucked his party in ill-fated 
missions to reform campaign finance laws and crack down on the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes to his tenacity and grit,'' said McCain pollster  
Bill McInturff. Most politicians say they'll cut pork-barrel 
spending, but people don't believe them, he said. ``When John 
McCain says that, people say, 'Given his history, if he says he'll 
stand up and not back down, I believe it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has an interesting shtick for his campaign. Unique,'' said  
Scott Reed, who ran Dole's unsuccessful bid. ``I think most 
Americans know somebody who was in Vietnam or whose life was 
touched by Vietnam and can relate a lot easier than to World War II 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain puts it this way: ``It's given me a greater sense of  
confidence that I know the difference between right and wrong, that 
I can look at an issue and determine a position and stick to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	His lowest moment came after a beating left him with a broken  
arm. ``I was at the end of my rope, mentally and physically,'' 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed the confession.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember every detail. It's vivid. The shame and  
disappointment,'' he said. ``But I knew I had to bounce right back. 
The guys who didn't ended up like Pavlov's dog -- walking around 
doing whatever they were told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though McCain is praised for resisting the Vietnamese, doubts  
linger in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still wonder if I did everything I could, if I could have  
done more to resist,'' McCain said, yanking at his collar. ``There 
were guys who did better, who were tougher. Those are the guys I 
really admire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain says the POW experience showed him the best and worst in  
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in a way the best time in my life,'' he said, strange  
as it sounds. ``Funny times. Acts of bravery. Great friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being held captive ``crystallizes you down to the essence of  
your being. Those who are good become their very best. Those who 
were weak become their very worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks it made him become his best: A House member, a senator  
and perhaps a president.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Americans in Majors Angered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While baseball's leadership prepared to head to Havana for  
Sunday's Baltimore Orioles game, some major leaguers of Cuban 
descent expressed anger with the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the idea of Fidel Castro getting all the  
publicity,'' Fernando Vina, the Milwaukee Brewers' All-Star second 
baseman, said in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mets coach Cookie Rojas was short and to the point: ``I  
don't agree with it. That's all I'm going to say,'' he said in 
Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco Giants pitcher Osvaldo Fernandez, who escaped Cuba  
in 1995, had mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the Cuban people, I want this to happen for them so they  
can see what a big-league team looks like, and what organized 
baseball looks like, and because it might open doors for a lot of 
players there. But for the system, the government, no I don't 
really care for it,'' said Fernandez, who hasn't pitched for the 
Giants since July 1997 because of elbow problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins owner John Henry, whose team has the largest  
Cuban-American fan base in the majors, has been the most vocal 
opponent in baseball -- even taking part in fan protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major problem here is ignorance,'' he said. ``People are  
not aware of the depth of oppression in Cuba. If they were, no one 
would support this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, who purchased his team in January, said the only reason  
Orioles owner Peter Angelos wanted to play Sunday's exhibition game 
against Cuba's national team was to expose the Orioles to Cuban 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has shown he doesn't care what we think. He sure didn't ask  
us what we think,'' Henry said. ``He's interested in getting a 
competitive advantage -- to get the Orioles' name plastered across 
Cuba so the next Cuban baseball player who defects will head for 
Baltimore. ... A lot of people in baseball believe this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the Florida Marlins should be the team playing a  
game in Cuba, if the game in Cuba were the right thing to do. But 
it's not right thing to do,'' Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, the  
latest Cuban star player to join a major league team, has declined 
comment on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not too fond of the idea,'' said Milwaukee Brewers  
outfielder Alex Ochoa, whose mother was five months' pregnant with 
him when she fled Cuba in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing what my parents went through makes it hard for me to  
like the idea that we're going to let Fidel Castro get that 
attention,'' Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't totally agree with the situation, with Fidel Castro in  
the stands, that will be hard to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, a Florida native,  
also opposes the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a good idea for several reasons,'' he said.  
``Why get it started? If I had a vote, I'd vote no.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Waste Arrives at N.M. Dump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- After 25 years of lawsuits, studies and  
protests, the nation's first nuclear dump -- a network of chambers 
carved out of the salt beds deep beneath the New Mexico desert -- 
received its first truckload of radioactive waste Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 100 people who live in Carlsbad, 25 miles from  
the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, cheered the truck and held up 
cardboard signs reading, ``Welcome finally'' and ``It's about 
time!'' as the rig rolled through before daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the 270-mile, 7 1/2-hour trip, the truck faced a  
scattering of protesters yelling ``Poison! Poison!'' along with two 
young women who sat down in the road and a man who tried to block 
the highway with his car. 
</P>
<P>
	The first load of waste came from Los Alamos National Laboratory  
in the New Mexico city that was the birthplace of the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, up to 6.2 million cubic feet of waste generated  
since the dawn of the atomic age will be entombed over the next 30 
years in the salt beds nearly a half-mile below ground. The waste 
consists of such items as clothing, tools and rags contaminated 
with plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, the United States has had no permanent resting place  
for weapons-related plutonium waste. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the waste has been piling up at 23 weapons  
installations around the country such as Rocky Flats near Denver 
and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, where it is kept 
mostly in 55-gallon drums on above-ground concrete pads, underneath 
bubble structures or in earthen mounds. 
</P>
<P>
	These corroding drums must be periodically repackaged, and some  
fear the waste is vulnerable to hazards such as tornadoes or 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of the first shipment of waste at WIPP marked more  
than two decades of effort to open the $1.8 billion repository, 
first proposed in 1974. The first truckload will be placed 
underground by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic -- this is just the culmination of everything I've  
worked for for 25 years,'' said Wendell Weart, a Sandia National 
Laboratories scientist who was instrumental in creating the 
repository. 
</P>
<P>
	WIPP is not designed for the thousands of tons of high-level  
waste stored at nuclear power plants across the country. Yucca 
Mountain in Nevada is being studied as a long-term burial place for 
that waste. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals court in Washington and a federal judge in Santa Fe  
on Wednesday rejected last-ditch appeals from environmentalists who 
sought to stop the transfer of the waste to WIPP. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, a crowd of about 100 people cheered and the  
driver gave a thumbs-up as the load rolled out of Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, its departure delayed by heavy fog. 
</P>
<P>
	But down the road in Santa Fe, a hub of anti-WIPP sentiment,  
dozens of protesters lined the route, holding up placards that read 
``Stop Nuke Trucks'' and ``Science or Science Fiction?'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Beems, 42, of Albuquerque, parked his car across the  
middle of the road with lighted flares around it. He was arrested 
on charges of obstructing the road and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The two young women who sat down on the interstate south of  
Santa Fe moved when asked to do so by state police. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-wheeler carrying three huge steel containers bearing the  
black-and-yellow radiation symbol passed through WIPP's white metal 
gates at 3:36 a.m. to the cheers of about 500 employees and 
dignitaries. WIPP employees waved American flags and jumped up and 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a doubt it would happen -- I just didn't know  
when,'' said Shari Cullum, who works in the WIPP accounting 
department. ``I had a big lump in my throat. This is cool.''

<HEADLINE> Dubai Win Would Boost Silver Charm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Silver Charm can get closer  
to Cigar by winning the $5 million Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	A second straight victory in the 1 1/4-mile race Sunday night at  
Nad al-Sheba Racecourse would be worth $3 million and boost him 
into No. 2 on the career earnings list with $9,803,066. Cigar is 
No. 1 with $9,999,815, with Skip Away second at $9,616,368 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm is looking real good,'' trainer Bob Baffert said.  
``I expect him to run a good race and I expect him to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, however, will not attend the race. While owners Bob and  
Beverly Lewis remain behind, Baffert was to fly by Concorde to the 
United States for Kentucky Derby hopeful Straight Man's start in a 
Kentucky Derby prep Saturday at Turfway Park in Kentucky. Straight 
Man also is owned by the Lewises. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner, is one of three  
U.S. horses in the World Cup. The other two are Victory Gallop, 
winner of the 1998 Belmont Stakes, and Malek, a Chilean-bred who 
was fourth in this race last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm was the 2-1 favorite by British bookmaker William  
Hill. Betting is illegal in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the eight starters are owned by members of Dubai's  
ruling Al Maktoum family. The other is British-owned and trained 
Running Stag, whose last four starts were in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maktoum horses, making their debuts in the race on the dirt,  
are English Derby winner High-Rise, Daylami, Central Park and 
Almutawakel. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, who will again be ridden by Gary Stevens, won his  
1999 debut, but has finished third in both his last two starts, 
including the Santa Anita Handicap March 6. Stevens takes the blame 
for that performance, saying he worked the big gray horse too fast 
the week of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert has a shot at becoming the first trainer to win three  
straight Kentucky Derbies. He won with Silver Charm, then with Real 
Quiet last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight Man is one three colts that are possible starters for  
Baffert in the May 1 Derby. Prime Timber is considered his top 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only horse I'm worried about is Worldly Manner,'' Baffert  
said. ``If he wins the Kentucky Derby, I think I might set up shop 
in Dubai.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner is a Godolphin prospect for the Derby, which  
would be his first start this year. He will prepare for the Derby 
in some trial races at Nad al-Sheba. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubai Crown Prince Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said  
Friday that his family's decision to race in Kentucky would not 
lower racing standards in Britain, where Godolphin's horses have 
been a fixture at top races. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky venture raised concerns about the sheik's long-term  
commitment to British racing. But Sheik Mohammed, who threatened to 
withdraw from English racing a couple years ago unless the purses 
improve, said England feels like a second home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not quitting the races in Europe. I want to improve  
racing and don't want to see Great Britain lagging behind in 
racing,'' Sheik Mohammed said. The way to improve it, he said, is 
to ``do something about the prize money.''

<HEADLINE> Dems Challenge GOP on Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic leaders are challenging Senate  
Republicans to compromise on legislation to lift barriers between 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies, casting the 
dispute as a major test of bipartisanship in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin and Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., insisted Friday that 
community lending requirements for banks must be included or 
President Clinton will veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want financial modernization enacted this year. This should  
not be a partisan issue,'' Daschle told reporters. He said 
lawmakers must choose ``either a partisan brinksmanship or a 
bipartisan accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin attended to emphasize the administration's opposition to a  
Republican bill in the Senate while supporting the dismantling of 
Depression-era prohibitions against combining banks, insurers and 
brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation proposed by both parties would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Consumer advocates have 
expressed concern that the measures, by allowing banks, brokerage 
firms and insurers to merge and get more deeply into each other's 
businesses, could bring a dangerous concentration of economic power 
in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the legislation, including Wall Street, banks and  
insurers, insist it is needed to keep the U.S. financial industry 
competitive in a fast-changing global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle and Sarbanes, the Senate Banking Committee's senior  
Democrat, formally proposed a bill as an alternative to a GOP 
measure that cleared the committee in a party-line vote early this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Republican bill, pushed by Banking Committee Chairman  
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, banks would not have to get a 
satisfactory community-lending rating from the government to 
conduct new financial activities. The bill also would exempt small 
banks with less than $100 million in assets from the community 
lending laws, which require banks and thrifts to lend to the poor 
and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' bill, as well as a bipartisan measure approved  
recently by the House Banking Committee, 51-8, include the 
requirement for a community-lending rating and have no exemption 
for small banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1977 lending laws have played a valuable role by ``expanding  
access to credit for all communities in our country,'' Sarbanes 
said, adding that they have helped many African Americans and other 
minorities to become home owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has maintained that the government shouldn't dictate to  
banks what people or companies they can do business with -- a view 
that led him to block financial overhaul legislation last fall. The 
blocking maneuver by Gramm and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., came 
after the legislation squeaked through the House by one vote, 
214-213. 
</P>
<P>
	Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for Gramm, said Friday ``he's not  
willing to compromise on the issue of expanding'' the reach of the 
community lending law. Gramm is not pushing for its repeal, 
however, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harlan noted that Gramm plans to meet soon after Congress'  
two-week Easter recess with Daschle, Sarbanes and Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to discuss the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a test,'' Daschle said. ``The Republicans in the House  
have already met that test.''

<P>
	FORT WORTH (AP) -- Bobby Labonte is driving despite pain, but he  
insists it's not because he's a tough guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask my wife,'' Labonte said with a grin. ``I'm not very tough.  
I'm definitely not one of those tough Texans people talk about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his protestations, the 34-year-old Winston Cup star gave  
more evidence Friday that he is indeed tough as nails. He took part 
in both practice sessions and then qualified second to pole-winner 
Kenny Irwin in time trials for Sunday's Primestar 500 at Texas 
Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who fractured the tip of his right shoulderblade in a  
crash last Friday during a practice session for the Busch Series 
race, drove the first 45 laps in the Winston Cup race in Darlington 
last Sunday before giving way to relief driver Matt Kenseth. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Joe Gibbs, former coach of the Washington Redskins,  
knows something about toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that it takes real mental toughness to work  
your way through the kind of pain that you have from that type of 
injury,'' Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte spent four days this week working with trainers from the  
Carolina Panthers, rehabilitating the shoulder. He also had a 
special cast built to alleviate some of the pounding he takes in 
the team's Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is I can lean back in the seat and it feels pretty  
good,'' Labonte said. ``The biggest problem I had last week was 
shifting, but once you get on the track, that's not a big deal. The 
biggest problem I have now is extending the arm to get it in 
reverse. But, hopefully, we don't need to do that very often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth will stand by again on Sunday, although Labonte said he  
would like to stay in the car to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``You came to work this morning because you wanted to and I came  
to work this morning because I wanted to. I like what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CRASH CRUSH:* Despite major changes to the Texas track, the  
1 1/2-mile oval has seen a demolition derby so far for the Busch 
Series, which will race Saturday in the Coca-Cola 300. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven crashes in practice on Thursday, there were five  
more incidents on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Raines was transported by ambulance to a Fort Worth  
hospital for examination and observation after sustaining a 
concussion in a crash on Friday in turn two on the 1 1/2-mile oval. He 
was later released. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a one-car smashup by Brad Loney, who was treated  
at the track for a bruised rib and elbow, and another involving 
defending series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kenseth, who was 
last year's runnerup and is the current leader in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was coming around turn four when a car slowed down to enter  
the pits,'' said Kenseth, who is coming off a victory last Saturday 
in Darlington. ``Dale swerved to the right to avoid the car and ran 
into me. Our car should be fine for the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt said, ``The car in front of me just slowed down and I  
tried to miss him. Then I hit the other car. My car is going to be 
fine. We'll be back out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so his older brother, Kerry, who crashed on Thursday and was  
replaced in the car on Friday by Stanton Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the ChannelLock Chevrolet said the driver change  
``is a decision by the owner, and it is not the result of an 
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Busch Series drivers involved in crashes on Friday were  
Joe Buford, who came away with a bruised knee, and Mark Green, who 
was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Cup drivers, who began practice on Friday, were  
considerably easier on equipment. The only accident of the day for 
the senior circuit came when Ken Bouchard hit the wall during his 
qualifying attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard had to be cut out of the car and was flown by  
helicopter to a Dallas Hospital, where he was reported awake and 
alert after suffering a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRACK SUCCESS:* Jeff Gordon has a chance in Sunday's race to  
cut the number of tracks where he has yet to win to just two. 
</P>
<P>
	If it's anything like the first two Winston Cup races at Texas  
Motor Speedway, it won't be easy for the two-time defending series 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has finished 30th and 31st on the 1 1/2-mile Texas oval.  
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a tough place for us, and we've had some bad  
luck, too,'' Gordon said. ``But, with the changes in the track, I 
don't see why we can't have a good weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to the offseason reconfiguring and repaving of  
the track, which was widened in several places and had the 
transitions from the turns to the speedways made smoother. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has won at 17 of the 20 tracks where NASCAR's top series  
has run since he began his Winston Cup career in 1993. Besides 
Texas, the only other places where he has not visited victory 
circle are Las Vegas and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll start ninth in Sunday's race.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MILESTONE:* Michael Waltrip, who got his first ride in 1985,  
will make his 400th career start on Sunday. The younger brother of 
three-time series champion Darrell Waltrip remains winless in 
Winston Cup competition.

<HEADLINE> It's Duke and the Forgotten Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Signs and billboards all over  
Florida proclaim the arrival of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	What we really have here is Duke &AMP; the Forgotten Three.  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils can make their case as  
one of the best college teams ever by winning their third national 
championship this decade. But let's not forget, the Dukies have 
company. Michigan State, Connecticut and Ohio State get a chance, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4) play Duke (36-1) in the national semifinals  
on Saturday, and should not be taken lightly. Mateen Cleaves, 
toughness personified, has never met a pressure shot he didn't want 
to take. Like Magic Johnson 20 years ago, Cleaves needs to win. 
</P>
<P>
	For UConn (32-2), a national title is all Jim Calhoun needs to  
consummate his splendid run as coach of the Huskies. Standing in 
the way is Ohio State, which used a little infusion of BC to help 
it forget all about last year's 8-22 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim O'Brien's best move since going to Boston College and  
playing for Bob Cousy was bringing sensational guard Scoonie Penn 
with him when he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the Final Four teams have been here before, and  
Krzyzewski is making his eighth appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you get there, all bets are off,'' said Calhoun, whose  
teams lost in the regional final in 1990, '95 and '98. ``Now, very 
simply, you've got to make that one more stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some might say that another way to spell Duke is U-N-L-V.  
Krzyzewski has consciously avoided comparisons with -- or even the 
mention of -- the heavily favored 1991 UNLV team that his Blue 
Devils upset in the national semifinal before claiming Coach K's 
first championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never talked to them about the '91 Vegas team,''  
Krzyzewski said. ``Don't believe everything you read in the papers, 
OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Krzyzewski wants to save the talk about Duke's place  
in history for later; Monday night, about midnight or so, at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's for somebody else to decide,'' he said. ``It would be  
really dumb of me to even be thinking of those things right now, 
because we're going to have to play a hell of a game to beat 
Michigan State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What of Duke's 31-game winning streak, the devastating 3-point  
shooting of Trajan Langdon and the inside presence of Elton Brand? 
Well, Michigan State has won 22 in a row, losing by just six points 
(73-67) to Duke in December in the Great Eight. It was one of only 
two times the Blue Devils won by fewer than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're a much different team than they were the first  
time,'' Spartans coach Tom Izzo said. ``I don't mean with personnel 
or anything. Elton Brand didn't play well against us the first 
time, I don't know if it was us or them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane Battier has raised his game a couple of levels and Corey  
Maggette is raising his level a lot,'' he added. ``I think we're a 
different team and I think we're a lot better than we were then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun and O'Brien bring quite a history into their semifinal  
matchup on Saturday. When O'Brien was at Boston College, his teams 
lost 20 of 23 to Calhoun's Huskies during an 11-year span. The 
UConn jinx, as persistent as a New England Nor'easter, ended with 
18 straight losses before O'Brien left Boston College to take over 
the Buckeyes' sinking program in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (27-8) emerged from the wreckage of the Randy Ayers  
era under the leadership of Penn, the BC transfer who sat out last 
season. His matchup with UConn point guard Khalid El-Amin should be 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	Not coincidentally, UConn is 61-6 since El-Amin joined the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's uncanny how similar the point guards are,'' O'Brien said.  
``In their case, Richard Hamilton is the leading scorer, but Khalid 
is the leader. It's the same thing with us. ... Scoonie is the guy 
who makes us go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the way to the Final Four, where guys named Scoonie, Mateen  
and Khalid will try to prove that Duke isn't the only name in town.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Records Become Issue Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's psychological records became an  
issue again Friday when Nevada boxing commissioners argued for a 
new law that would keep almost all information about fighters and 
promoters given to the commission confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners contended they needed the bill to keep the  
personal lives of boxers private and so Las Vegas can retain its 
place as the host of most major fights. 
</P>
<P>
	A press representative, however, called the bill a ``knee-jerk  
reaction'' to the release of Tyson's psychological records and said 
the public that buys tickets or makes bets on fights has a right to 
know about a boxer's mental and physical state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can anyone say with certainty that the public dissemination of  
Mike Tyson's psychological reports caused any substantial harm to 
Mike Tyson?'' asked Kent Lauer, director of the Nevada State Press 
Association. ``I don't think so. In fact, I think the public 
confidence in the commission's decision on Tyson's license was 
bolstered by the release of those reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action in Nevada came on the same day a Maryland judge  
praised the ``remarkable'' progress made by the former heavyweight 
champion, but rejected his request for a reduced sentence. Tyson 
must still serve 60 days in Maryland for violating probation for a 
1992 rape conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, a Nevada Assembly committee decided to delete  
sweeping language keeping most records confidential. But it 
authorized an amendment to keep medical information not relevant to 
an application to box confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved legislation allowing the commission  
to grant a boxing license with restrictions. That also became an 
issue with Tyson when the commission wanted to grant him a license 
to box again -- with certain conditions -- but couldn't add the 
conditions because Nevada law didn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five Nevada athletic commissioners appeared before  
the committee in Carson City to argue that records given the 
commission should not be made public without a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to psychological records, the bill supported by the  
commissioners would have restricted access to medical and criminal 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in no way an effort to keep information from the  
public,'' commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta said. ``I believe it is 
good public policy to have this information open to the public. But 
there are certain circumstances where it affects our ability to 
regulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the release of Tyson's psychological records prior to  
his relicensing hearing in October, commissioners cited no other 
case in which there was a problem over the release of a boxer's 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But commissioner Glenn Carano said that by assuring boxers that  
any information given the commission when it is licensing a fighter 
be kept private it will help the state get more big fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the boxing capital of the world. The Nevada Athletic  
Commission is very highly regarded,'' Carano said. ``It is, 
however, a very competitive industry. We need the confidence of 
everybody we do business with -- that includes the boxers and 
promoters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lauer, however, said that the present system has been in place  
for years and that Nevada has had no problems before. 
</P>
<P>
	``This information has been open for a long time now, and I  
didn't hear the athletic commission testify to any abuses of this 
open information,'' Lauer said. ``All of a sudden because of this 
Mike Tyson episode they want to make everything confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was ordered last September to undergo five days of  
psychological testing by a team of doctors at Massachusetts General 
Hospital before boxing regulators would agree to hear his request 
for a license to replace the one taken from him for biting Evander 
Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to court to try and keep the records closed, but a judge  
ruled that Nevada law made them public documents and they were 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you say that embarrassed Mike Tyson?'' Lauer asked.  
``It didn't. Mike Tyson does a good enough job of embarrassing 
himself in other ways.''

<HEADLINE>  Saint Louis Hires Romar As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Lorenzo Romar, who turned around a struggling  
program at Pepperdine and was an assistant for 1995 national 
champion UCLA, today was hired as Saint Louis' basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar replaces Charlie Spoonhour, who retired March 5 after  
seven years at Saint Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	```This is a coach's dream,'' Romar said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported that Romar will earn about  
$400,000 annually, including shoe and television-radio deals. The 
newspaper said Romar made about $125,000 at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar was 19-13 at Pepperdine this season, and 42-44 overall.  
The Wave earned a spot in the National Invitation Tournament, 
losing to Colorado in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine was 10-18 the season before Romar's arrival and 6-21  
in his first season. But the Wave improved to 17-10 the next 
season. This year's team finished second in the West Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar's strength is in recruiting. As an assistant to Jim  
Harrick at UCLA for four years, he helped bring in Toby Bailey, 
Jelani McCoy and Charles O'Bannon, key players on the national 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a proven recruiter and his communications skills with  
his student-athletes are highly regarded,'' Saint Louis athletic 
director Doug Wollard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar played at Washington, then played in the NBA with Golden  
State (1980-83) and Milwaukee (1983-84). He finished his pro career 
averaging about six points and six assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar then played for Athletes in Action from 1985-92, serving  
as co-coach from 1989 through 1992.

<HEADLINE>  French Tunnel Death Toll Hits 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Exhausted firefighters battled searing  
heat and poisonous smoke today in a tunnel under Western Europe's 
highest peak, searching through charred tractor-trailer trucks for 
victims of a blaze that killed at least 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-mile tunnel under Mont Blanc, a major route connecting  
Italy and France, turned into an inferno two days ago, when the 
blaze broke out in a truck carrying flour and margarine. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters sprayed the area with coolant today, trying to  
bring down temperatures that at one point reached more than 1,800 
degrees in the tunnel, said Lt. Stephane Marcelin of the Chamonix 
fire department. 
</P>
<P>
	The extreme heat and smoke had such a deadly effect, said  
another fire official, Jean-Guy Laurent, that only two or three 
victims were able to find refuge in heat-resistant bunkers in the 
tunnel. The rest were found at the wheels of the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie-Claude Bazile, a spokeswoman for the regional government  
of Haute-Savoie region on the French end of the tunnel, said 30 
people were confirmed killed, with nine bodies identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``There could be more, unfortunately,'' Bazile told The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first fatal fire in the tunnel, which was the longest  
in the world when President Charles de Gaulle opened it in 1965. 
The Alpine tunnel is used daily by about 4,000 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from his hospital bed, Chamonix fire chief Christian  
Comte said he'd spent five hours in the tunnel Wednesday, looking 
for his men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smoke was very dense and the temperatures were soaring,  
but I knew that I had to go help them,'' he said from the 
Sallanches Hospital, where he was recovering from smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the AP in Paris by telephone, Comte said he'd worked  
his way along the wall of the tunnel until he came to a group of 
six firefighters -- all lying on the ground with their jackets over 
their heads, motionless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they were all dead,'' he said. He helped them all  
leave, but one later died. 
</P>
<P>
	A fresh contingent of 52 firefighters and 17 vehicles began  
battling the blaze early today, said Haute-Savoie's governor, 
Pierre Breuil. French, Swiss and Italian firefighters were working 
from the Italian end of the tunnel because the wind was blowing 
fumes and smoke toward the French side. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the temperature had been lowered to 158 degrees  
at a critical point in the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian firefighters Thursday evening managed to reach the area  
where the blaze began, discovering five bodies in scorched cars, 
adding to the four bodies found the day before. They also passed 20 
destroyed tractor-trailer trucks and up to 11 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire raised questions about the emergency systems in the  
tunnel, which is equipped with ventilation equipment and 20 bunkers 
designed to resist heat and toxic fumes, each of which can hold 
dozens of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers in the two-lane tunnel can pull out every 1,000 feet in  
case of breakdowns or if they need to turn around. In addition, 
tunnel officials can send messages to drivers through an emergency 
broadcast system. 
</P>
<P>
	A truck driver who passed the burning truck claimed tunnel  
personnel did not take the situation seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	At the French end, according to Jean-Luc Lacave, the tunnel was  
still open, and at the Italian end, where he exited and reported 
the fire, there was little reaction from officials, who said they 
were aware of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't take the fire seriously and they waited much too  
long,'' he told RTL radio. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether any of the emergency systems had  
suffered a breakdown when the Belgian truck caught fire, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michel Charlet, the mayor of Chamonix, the town closest to  
the French side, said the accident ``could not have been avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time now, it has been said that the Mont Blanc  
tunnel is no longer adaptable to the traffic'' of thousands of 
heavy trucks per day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the night, firefighters discovered that 100 yards of the  
tunnel's ceiling had collapsed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims of the fire included two Italian employees of the tunnel  
operator, one firefighter and a couple from Lyon. The identities of 
the other victims were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven others suffered mostly minor injuries from inhaling  
toxic smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said the tunnel  
would remain closed for several weeks.

<HEADLINE> UConn Huskies Hope To Stay Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Rip.  
</P>
<P>
	That's Connecticut star Richard Hamilton's nickname. The Huskies  
hope it doesn't describe their delicate physical state going into 
the most important game in school history Saturday against Ohio 
State in the NCAA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	A quickie summary of the Huskies' aches, pains and assorted  
maladies: 
</P>
<P>
	--Jake Voskuhl, their space-filling 6-foot-11 center, has missed  
two games this season with soreness in his left foot that 
temporarily put him on crutches and left him less than 100 percent 
at other times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies need a productive Voskuhl to combat 6-11 Ohio State  
center Ken Johnson, who blocked seven shots and altered the tempo 
of the Buckeyes' regional final victory over St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injury, Voskuhl has practiced as hard as ever during  
workouts that have not changed in length or intensity even during 
the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we change now?'' Voskuhl said. ``We've been doing  
things the same way all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the pregame emphasis placed on two teams driven by star  
guards, coach Jim Calhoun said what the Huskies most need to do is 
rebound the way they did by outrebounding 25 of 34 opponents this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a guy comes up with 17 points, 10 rebounds, if those things  
start happening ... that may determine the game,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kevin Freeman, the 6-7 forward who was the MVP of the Big East  
tournament, has an ear infection that is not considered especially 
worrisome. At least it wasn't serious enough to keep him off the 
team plane. 
</P>
<P>
	--Albert Mouring, a backup guard and one of the Huskies' key role  
players with a 7.4 scoring average, missed the second half of the 
West Regional final against Gonzaga with a sprained right knee. But 
it didn't keep him from going hard in practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss the Final Four? Are you kidding?  
</P>
<P>
	``No way you can miss THAT,'' he said. ``You'd have to be  
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Hamilton, who is 6-foot-6 yet is 15 pounds lighter than 5-10  
point guard Khalid El-Amin, needed right foot surgery in July while 
training for the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he has recovered to score in double figures in all but two  
games, even while battling a deep thigh bruise that limited his 
effectiveness late in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough time, being out, but everybody stuck with me  
and told me it would be all right,'' Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	So all right that the Huskies (32-2) are the only other team  
besides Duke to be No. 1 rated this season. After never reaching 
the Final Four in 20 prior NCAA tournament appearances, the Huskies 
are within two victories of the school's first national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It's pressure, for sure, but probably no more so than they faced  
in the three regional finals they lost under Calhoun -- to UCLA, to 
Duke on a last-second shot by Christian Laettner, to North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference this year, Calhoun said, is ``This team wouldn't  
let anybody get in the way of getting to St. Petersburg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or from Calhoun's son, Jim Jr., of going there for his dad's  
first Final Four appearances in 27 seasons of coaching at 
Northeastern (14) and Connecticut (13). The younger Calhoun's wife, 
Jennifer, gave birth March 5 to the couple's first child, Emily. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Huskies stepped off the team plane Wednesday night,  
Calhoun got his first look at his first grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
	`It's thrilling,'' said Calhoun, who has a 552-227 career  
record. ``She's more beautiful than I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll probably feel the same way if he finds himself cradling  
the NCAA championship trophy Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Homers on First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra needed just one  
pitch to prove his batting stroke was in great shape. Now he hopes 
to show his elbow is just as healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit the first pitch he saw Friday over the left-field fence  
in his first game since March 18. Then, on his third at-bat, he let 
one pitch go by before hitting another homer, also off Rick 
Helling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you close your eyes, it works,'' said Garciaparra,  
the designated hitter in Boston's 10-3 win over the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to return to shortstop Saturday, when the Red Sox visit  
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what he feels like, but he's going on the trip,''  
manager Jimy Williams said. ``He'll play in some capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, the 1997 AL Rookie of the Year, last played  
shortstop on March 11 when he felt pain in his elbow after making a 
relay throw. He sat our three games, was DH the next four and 
missed three more before heading last Sunday for the West Coast 
where he was examined by two doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The diagnosis was encouraging. He had tendinitis but no  
structural damage in his throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows his arm,'' Williams said. ``He knows how he feels. He  
knows how he's supposed to feel, how he wants to feel. Will he be 
at that particular point at the outset? Probably not. But from the 
reports that he's OK, at least we're going in the right 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra said the injury never affected his hitting. That was  
obvious Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people tell me I shouldn't hit the first pitch,'' he  
joked. ``I feel bad for those people. I felt like I ignored them 
and I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to see Nomie get back to being right on track is really  
nice,'' said Pedro Martinez, who struck out 10 and allowed just one 
run in six innings, getting the win. 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 exhibition games, Garciaparra is 10-for-33, a .303 batting  
average. He has four homers, nine RBIs and 24 total bases. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a game Friday that bore similarities to the one Mo  
Vaughn had for Boston last spring after also spending a Monday and 
Tuesday out of town before returning on a Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, now with the Anaheim Angels, missed two days for his  
trial on a drunk driving charge (he was acquitted), returned to the 
lineup on a Thursday and hit three homers, including a grand slam, 
in a 12-9 win over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra scoffed at the comparison.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get lucky,'' he said. ``I don't think about that. It's  
spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:*Lou Merloni, who had the inside track on Boston's utility  
infielder job, was to return to Massachusetts to have his sprained 
left wrist examined this weekend by team physician Arthur Pappas. 
Merloni was hurt sliding into third base Thursday night against 
Philadelphia. ... Catchers Mandy Romero and Joe Depastino were 
returned to Boston's minor-league camp. ... Left fielder Jon 
Nunnally, acquired in a trade with Cincinnati on Thursday, went 
1-for-3 and threw out Tom Goodwin trying to score from second base 
in the fourth inning. ... The Red Sox' four homers gave them 31 for 
spring training. They gave up none Friday and have allowed an 
AL-low 14.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) -- The president and chief operating officer  
of Toys R Us resigned Friday, two weeks after the nation's largest 
toy retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings that were down 
sharply from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce W. Krysiak, 48, also resigned as president of the  
company's U.S. Toy Store division. He will be succeeded in that 
position by Mike Shannon, 47, executive vice president since 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not appoint a new president and chief operating  
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce Krysiak has indicated that he wishes to leave to pursue  
other interests,'' said Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Nakasone. 
``We appreciate his contributions over the past year and wish him 
well in his future endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Toys R Us in February 1998, Krysiak headed the  
discount chain Dollar General Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Krysiak said it was a ``difficult decision that has nothing to  
do with the direction in which Toys R Us is heading, and which I 
fully support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent from a  
year ago as it lost business to discount chains like Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramus, N.J.-based Toys R Us also struggled amid weakness  
in the toy industry worldwide, with a lack of blockbuster toys 
driving consumers to stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us operates 1,500 stores: 704 toy stores in the United  
States; 466 international toy stores, including franchise stores; 
212 Kids R Us children's clothing stores; and 118 Babies R Us 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us closed 90 stores and cut 3,000 jobs last year and  
decided to revamp its store format to make it easier to navigate 
and to add more bargain items, electronics and children's clothing.

<HEADLINE> Government Lawyer Alleges Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Interior Department lawyer who says he was  
ordered to dispose of some Indian trust records will be questioned 
next week in connection with a lawsuit over the government's 
handling of accounts worth $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In an affidavit made public Thursday, Ralph Williams said he was  
given the job of reconciling discrepancies in some of the accounts 
in late 1997. Once his work was done, he was supposed ``to ensure 
that ... any other information which was inconsistent from my 
findings could be purged from the files,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he declined to get rid of the material because he  
thought it would be illegal. He said the instructions came from the 
department's deputy solicitor, Ed Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior officials denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth held Interior  
Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in 
contempt for the government's two-year delay in turning over checks 
and other documents related to five account holders who filed the 
lawsuit. It was not clear whether Williams handled any of those 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth released the affidavit Thursday along with an order  
protecting Williams from retaliation by the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is scheduled to be questioned by lawyers in the case on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's chief attorney, Solicitor John Leshy, issued a  
brief statement defending Cohen and denying that his office would 
attempt to dispose of records that are relevant to the lawsuit. 
Department officials declined to make Cohen available for an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Indian plaintiffs brought Williams' allegation  
to the judge's attention after they were approached recently by 
Williams' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams still works in the solicitor's office. He did not  
respond to a request for an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior manages $2.5 billion belonging to tribes in addition to  
the $500 million owned by individual Indians. The money includes 
lease revenue, royalties and court settlements. The funds were 
mismanaged for decades, and lawyers for the Indians say the 
government could be liable for billions of dollars in claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation was introduced in the Senate Thursday to let tribes  
have their money transferred to private banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is the first step, but it is an indication that many  
in Congress have no faith in the Interior Department's ability to 
manage these accounts,'' said the chairman of the Senate Indian 
Affairs Committee, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. ``There seems 
to be an institutional rot there that does not go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell cosponsored the bill with Sen. Frank Murkowski, an  
Alaska Republican who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Routine Same in Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Scoonie Penn insists Ohio State is  
not superstitious. Don't believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' Final Four will be no different from the weeks  
leading up to it. No routine will be broken and no quirky detail 
forgotten for fear something bad might happen. 
</P>
<P>
	At team meetings, the players will sit in the same configuration  
of seats, always four across the front with the rest in the back. 
Penn will lead the Buckeyes on the floor for practice and in 
Saturday night's national semifinal with Connecticut and will 
always take the first shot in warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	The team trainer will tape ankles in the same order -- always  
ending with a tap on the bottom of each foot -- and the Buckeyes 
will unwind before the game by listening to their lucky boom box. 
</P>
<P>
	Nope, Penn protested, nothing odd about that.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been our routine the whole season. Now people are  
looking for the answer to why we're winning,'' he said. ``They ask 
if we're doing anything the same and we start talking, yes, we're 
doing the same things we've been doing all season. And they become 
superstitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what would happen if you weren't first on the floor?  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing,'' Penn said. ``But I'm not going to test it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim O'Brien can only shake his head and, like the rest of  
his players, follow Penn's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it interesting,'' he said. ``I'm not going to get in  
the way of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' craving for routine might have been a product of  
the team's choice of Final Four lodging. While the other three 
teams are staying in resort hotels, Ohio State is hidden in a 
remote, gated community that is patrolled by guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why it switched from the Hilton to private condominiums  
surrounded by 6-foot fence, O'Brien said, ``Because it's too, too 
busy in there, too crazy. It has nothing to do with being 
paranoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Jason Singleton said there is logic behind the team's  
superstitious nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie took his boom box to Puerto Rico and we won that  
tournament,'' Singleton said. ``He didn't take it to the Big Ten 
tournament and we lost. So we put two and two together and we 
figure we've got to take it to all our NCAA tournament games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is almost no end to the team's superstitions. Ken Johnson  
is always the last player out of the locker room. Tri-captains 
Penn, Singleton and Neshaun Coleman are the first players in the 
three-man weave drill in practice. Trainer Mike Bordner has worn 
the same suit for each NCAA game, with the small pins given to each 
participant arranged in ascending order on his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien said many of the team's peculiarities stem from Penn's  
desire for order. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes direction, he likes organization,'' O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the year, to break up the monotony of another  
repetitious series of drills, O'Brien decided to shake things up. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my infinite wisdom I decided, why don't we just have  
shooting games instead and make it a little bit light?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few practices later, O'Brien asked the team what it wanted to  
do in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie said, `No shooting games! Let's do our routine and do  
it the same way we always do,''' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the team's superstitious nature that allowed O'Brien to  
keep his hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the tournament began, everyone on the team agreed to  
shave his head if the Buckeyes made it to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien showed up Sunday after the win over St. John's in the  
South Regional title game and asked who was going to lose his hair 
first. Not wanting to break up its routine, the team agreed they 
wouldn't go through with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Great. That's terrific,' because I really did not  
want to have to shave my head,'' O'Brien said with a laugh.

<HEADLINE> Fisher New San Diego State Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ten years after becoming the only interim coach  
to win the national championship, Steve Fisher is back in college 
basketball, this time at lowly San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who took Michigan to three national championship games  
in five years and recruited the ``Fab Five'' to Ann Arbor, signed a 
contract at midnight Thursday in a San Diego hotel and was 
introduced as the Aztecs' coach during a news conference Friday 
afternoon at the campus arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more people than we normally have at basketball  
games,'' quipped athletic director Rick Bay, who was elated to 
attract a coach with a national reputation to a school that has 
little tradition and little success. The Aztecs drew an average of 
just 3,189 to its 12,000-seat arena during a 4-22 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said he was attracted to San Diego State because of Bay,  
who also has Michigan ties, and because the city would be a good 
fit for his family. His wife and two children remained in Ann Arbor 
while he took a job as an assistant with the NBA's Sacramento 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled to be the new basketball coach, ready to get  
started, knowing there will be a tremendous amount of work that 
needs to be done,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not naive to the fact that I think I can close my eyes and  
wave my wand and we're going to go from 4-22 to 22-4. But, nobody 
thought Ohio State would go from last (in the Big 10) to the Final 
Four, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego State gave Fisher a six-year deal, with a one-year  
rollover due after the first season. He'll make just more than 
$300,000 in base pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aztecs are certainly in need of a turnaround, having had  
just one winning season since their last NCAA tournament 
appearance, in 1985. Fisher replaces Fred Trenkle, who resigned at 
the end of the season after posting one winning record in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay said it was his goal to get a coach with a national profile,  
but never felt absolutely confident he would. He said he knew a lot 
of coaches were interested in the job, but as they talked to their 
peers, were told that it could be their last major college job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve was willing to take that risk,'' Bay said. ``Steve was  
the most qualified candidate that I had. We are very fortunate to 
have that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's Rick Majerus rejected the Aztecs' offer Monday night. Bay  
said that while Majerus is a good guy, he's also eccentric and 
would be more of a challenge than Fisher would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve, on the other hand, has even better credentials, really,  
than Rick, in some ways,'' Bay said. ``I don't feel I was trading 
off competence for comfort. So I feel very good about the way this 
thing came together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's career at Michigan began and ended abruptly.  
</P>
<P>
	He was promoted on an interim basis on the eve of the 1989 NCAA  
tournament after Bill Frieder accepted a job at Arizona State. He 
coached the Wolverines to an overtime victory against Seton Hall to 
win the national championship, then had the ``interim'' label 
removed three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it back to the title game in 1992 and '93, losing both  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired by Michigan on Oct. 10, 1997, shortly after a  
Kansas law firm hired by the university issued a report that called 
into question his role in arranging complimentary tickets for a 
booster. The NCAA accepted the school's self-imposed penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't end the way it should have, but it ended,'' Fisher  
said. ``You move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was 184-82 at Michigan, and was 20-6 in seven NCAA  
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He will coach with the Kings their next three games, then take  
over here next Wednesday or Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Muslim Pilgrims Pray at Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of Muslim  
pilgrims piled into -- and on top of -- buses on their way to a 
ritual of solemnity, prayer and reflection today, a key part of the 
annual hajj. 
</P>
<P>
	From midday until after sunset, pilgrims will stand praying and  
reflecting on their lives at Mount Arafat, where Mohammed, Islam's 
chief prophet, gave his last sermon 14 centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some two million pilgrims swathed in simple white robes made  
their way Thursday to the plain of Mina, six miles north of Mecca, 
where Mount Arafat is located. Some walked, others held tightly to 
the roofs of crowded buses. The hajj chant of ``Here I am, oh 
Almighty, here I am'' reverberated across Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's ritual takes place on Islam's holy day, Friday, for  
the first time since 1994, giving this year's hajj the status of a 
``greater pilgrimage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around 1.2 million Saudis are participating in this year's hajj,  
the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which involves performing set 
rituals over a series of days. All able-bodied Muslims are required 
to perform the hajj at least once if they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saudi official said Thursday that fewer foreigners have come  
this year, attributing the drop to economic troubles in southeast 
Asia and among oil producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic and political turmoil has reduced the number of  
pilgrims from Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the 
world, from 230,000 last year to 70,000, according to the official, 
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has been hit hard by the Asian economic meltdown,  
which devalued currencies and caused widespread unemployment. The 
crisis also led to political turbulence and rioting. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilgrims in neighboring Persian Gulf states also were believed  
to be staying home because of slumping international oil prices, 
the official said. Specific figures, however, were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there were more than enough pilgrims to create traffic  
jams that turned a 15-minute trip into a 90-minute crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	All over the streets, volunteer coordinators and police called  
out, ``Yalla, ya hajj'' -- ``Hurry up, pilgrim!'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 45,000 personnel have been mobilized to deal with the  
pilgrims, including security troops, caterers and medical teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A million prepared meals will be sold at 1,500 centers, and 35  
bakeries will prepare about 5 million loaves of bread daily, said 
Mohammed Hussein Qaroub, a Trade Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
	Walkways have been widened, many covered to provide shade.  
Phone, mail and telex services are also available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saudis also have prepared for disasters. More than 27,000  
fireproof tents have been set up, part of a $640 million project 
that will be completed by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, fire tore through a sprawling, overcrowded tent city at  
Mina, trapping and killing more than 340 pilgrims and injuring 
1,500. A stampede last year killed 180 pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the world's high-ranking officials performing the hajj  
this year are Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir, Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Aslan Maskhadov, president of 
Russia's breakaway Chechnya region.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Loses Bid for Early Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson won't be able to get out of  
jail until at least early June. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Friday praised the ``remarkable'' progress made by  
the former heavyweight champion, but rejected his request for a 
reduced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Tyson deserves no special treatment,'' Montgomery County  
District Court Judge Stephen Johnson said in denying the motion 
that would have cut the boxer's one-year term to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	He must still serve 60 days in Maryland for violating probation  
for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who had waived his right to attend the hearing, was  
brought to the courthouse before the proceedings began. But 
sheriff's deputies realized their error and immediately took him 
back. His wife, Monica, was present when the judge announced his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is undergoing counseling, had a change in his  
antidepressant medication and is studying for a high school 
equivalency diploma in the Montgomery County jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went in with a great deal of hope today that the proper  
foundation had been laid and the judge was amenable to that but 
that's not how it turned out,'' said Michael Steele, Tyson's 
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public humiliation of Mike Tyson continues,'' added  
Steele, alleging that Tyson was brought to the courthouse for the 
benefit of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking into it,'' said Eric Seleznow, spokesman for  
the Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, acknowledging that 
Tyson should not have been taken from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are ``painstakingly going out of their way to assure  
that he is being treated fairly,'' said Douglas Gansler, Montgomery 
County state's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges  
following a minor traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg in 
August. He won a comeback bout against Francois Botha on Jan. 16 
and was sentenced Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month Tyson spent five days in solitary confinement after

service provider listed on the U.S. Nasdaq composite stock index, 
announced Friday that its revenues rose 47 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by a 66 percent increase in subscribers, Pacific Internet  
said 1998 revenues rose to 71.9 million Singapore dollars (U.S.

<HEADLINE> NATO Shoots Down Two Yugo MiGs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets shot down two Yugoslav MiG  
fighters in Bosnia, thwarting an attempted attack on NATO-led 
peacekeeping forces, alliance and U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation outside Yugoslav territory was a dangerous  
broadening of the showdown between the Western alliance and 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The air-to-air combat came as Yugoslav media reported that NATO  
forces launched their first daylight attack on Yugoslavia. Air raid 
sirens wailed at midafternoon in Belgrade and several other cities, 
and targets were hit in three suburbs of the capital, the official 
Tanjug news agency and independent Studio B television reported. 
</P>
<P>
	People in the capital's center, however, said they did not  
immediately see evidence of the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fighting in Bosnian skies, NATO jets flying defensive  
missions ``encountered'' the Yugoslav MiGs and shot them down about 
five miles inside Bosnia, said Maj. David Scanlon. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers were searching for the pilots, NATO spokesman Jamie  
Shea said. Initial NATO reports said the men were captured. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses and local news reports said wreckage was scattered in  
three places along a narrow strip of Bosnia's Serb republic. The 
land separates the Muslim-Croat federation from the border of 
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, speaking to  
Britain's Channel 4 TV News, denied that the planes went down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever they say, it is not true,'' Jovanovic said, referring  
to NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	In bombing attacks Thursday night, NATO aircraft and missiles  
blasted targets in Yugoslavia, directing much of their fire on 
Kosovo, where fighting raged between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials called the bombing, which began Wednesday, a  
successful start to forcing President Slobodan Milosevic to agree 
to a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not going to be one knockout blow, but day after day,  
if he does not stop his genocidal attacks on the Kosovo people, we 
will take larger and larger lumps out of his military force,'' 
British Defense Secretary George Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's army maintained its defiant tone, claiming it  
inflicted ``substantial damage'' against an ``overpoweringly 
stronger enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's U.N. envoy said today that ``hundreds of  
civilians'' have been killed in NATO airstrikes which hit a 
cemetery for Nazi victims, two refugee camps and two youth hostels. 
</P>
<P>
	The claims made by Vladislav Jovanovic in a speech to the U.N.  
Security Council could not be independently confirmed. Yugoslav 
authorities in Belgrade have reported at least a dozen dead and 
dozens wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav forces continued their offensive on the ground against  
ethnic Albanians. International monitors and relief officials 
forced to leave Kosovo because of the bombing said they feared Serb 
forces were burning villages and killing ethnic Albanians or 
forcing them to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian sources reported persistent gunfire overnight in  
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, and an ethnic Albanian human rights 
group said a political figure and a union leader were killed in the 
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency said Kosovo refugees who crossed into  
Albania claimed that 20 men were shot to death by Serb forces 
evacuating the village of Goden in southwest Kosovo on Thursday. 
The account could not be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
	``With only a handful of independent observers left on the  
ground, we are extremely worried about the plight of Kosovo's 
civilian population, which has already been through a terrible 
ordeal,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	William Walker, the U.S. head of the 1,400-member monitoring  
mission that left Kosovo this week, also said the situation was 
deteriorating. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe decided today to reduce Walker's mission created last year 
to monitor a failed peace agreement down to 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia failed today to muster enough support to pass a  
resolution in the U.N. Security Council demanding NATO stop bombing 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said today that allied aircraft had flown 400  
sorties against Yugoslavia in the first two days of air operations 
and had struck 50 targets, all air defense and related facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb damage assessments were still being made, said Air  
Commodore David Wilby, briefing reporters at NATO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making steady headway just as we had anticipated,'' NATO  
commander Gen. Wesley Clark said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``We've 
done severe damage to a number of targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton appealed directly to the Serbian people today  
for support, saying Milosevic has imperiled their future and forced 
their ``sons to keep fighting a senseless conflict that you did not 
ask for and that he could have prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no hint from Milosevic that he would back down over  
Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia. He cut off diplomatic 
relations with the United States, France, Germany and Britain, 
while Serbian authorities ordered journalists from NATO nations out 
of the country. Scores did so, but some were trying to return today 
after conciliatory statements from Yugoslav officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav army statement said the Thursday night bombing  
targeted military barracks, military airports, air defense systems, 
communications centers and command posts. It lacked specifics on 
any damage caused and claimed Yugoslav forces retaliated 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an unfair airborne battle, acting against an overpoweringly  
stronger enemy, according to reports available, substantial damage 
was inflicted on the enemy,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilby denied that NATO had attacked Yugoslav military barracks.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment ... our only target is the integrated air  
defense system and facilities associated with that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes Thursday hit inside Kosovo around Pristina, Kosovska  
Mitrovica and the southwestern town of Prizren, media in Yugoslavia 
said. Serbian TV said three missiles hit a police station on a 
military base, injuring one policeman and leaving two others 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montenegro, Yugoslavia's other republic, there were reports  
of explosions at army compounds and barracks, as well as at an 
airport and radar facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug reported that ethnic Albanian rebels had attacked Serb  
police in Djakovica, wounding one. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleurat Sejeu, spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in  
London, told BBC World television that Yugoslav MiGs were being 
used against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Sejeu said Serbs had rounded up thousands of displaced ethnic  
Albanian civilians in the central Drenica region and were marching 
them toward Pristina. ``Nobody knows what will happen'' to them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 Kosovo Albanians crossed into Albania on Thursday,  
saying Serb security forces had swept into the village of Goden, 
detaining men, setting the village on fire, and marching women and 
children across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Selim Ferraj, 37, one of the few males with the group from  
Goden, said he feared the other men were dead. ``I am only alive 
because I knew the Serb commander before,'' said Ferraj, who 
escaped with his wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile said today that Romania  
plans to accept up to 4,000 refugees from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after appearing to waver on the NATO strikes, Italian  
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said today that Italy will stand 
firm with alliance -- but also push to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a freeze on all relations with NATO, Russia today  
told NATO's top diplomatic official and its senior military 
representative in Moscow to leave the country.

<HEADLINE> NY Cops Charged in Diallo Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jesse Jackson galvanized protesters outside  
Police Headquarters today as word spread that four white officers 
had been indicted for murder in the shooting of an unarmed African 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson arrived as several hundred protesters gathered for what  
has become a daily rite. He linked arms with the Rev. Al Sharpton; 
they blocked the entrance, then were read their rights and taken 
inside for arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous demonstrations over the death of Amadou Diallo have  
resulted in 821 arrests, including NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and 
actors Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson told reporters: ``I look out here today and I see  
blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, men and women, moving from 
battleground to common ground and the moral ground. This is a great 
day. A day of joy. A day of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the case, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
told The Associated Press Thursday night that the officers had been 
indicted for second-degree murder. But by early afternoon there 
still was no official confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-degree murder is the intentional killing from depraved  
indifference to life. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 25 
years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indictment is only the first step,'' protester Yee Ling Poon,  
an attorney from Chinatown, said this morning. ``I am going to stay 
out here until the whole attitude toward minorities has changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a strong supporter of the police  
department and a target of the demonstrations, appeared to be 
softening his position today, saying on his radio show: 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talk about the good record of our police department,  
that is not meant in any way to demean or to deny or to denigrate 
the feelings of frustration and anger and hurt over the shooting 
that took place. I feel those myself but it's also meant to try to 
convey perspective and reality to a situation in which there aren't 
many trying to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor, was hit 19 times on Feb. 4  
in the vestibule of his Bronx home when officers Kenneth Boss, Sean 
Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy fired a total of 41 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Street Crime Unit members were looking for a  
rape-murder suspect when they found Diallo. It is unclear whether 
the officers thought Diallo fit the suspect's description. A lawyer 
for one of the officers has said his client believed Diallo was 
reaching for a gun, although he was later found to be unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, said neither he nor his  
client had been notified of the indictment, but added he was not 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``As sure as I was that he was going to be indicted, that's how  
sure I am that he's going to be acquitted,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the other three officers said they had yet to be  
contacted by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have not spoken publicly about the case and all  
declined to testify before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting, apprehensions over the sometimes adversarial  
relationship between minorities and police have pitted Giuliani 
against protesters critical of the mayor's reactions to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The peaceful protests began in minority communities but have  
gained momentum and cut across racial lines in the seven weeks 
since Diallo's death. Demonstrators, including young people who had 
never been to a protest and one-time activists drawn back to the 
streets, have angrily accused police of racism.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Internet Stock Firm Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nikko Securities Co., a major Japanese brokerage,  
said Friday it plans to set up a new company specializing in 
Internet stock trading, a burgeoning business in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new firm is to start operations Oct. 1, when stock brokerage  
commissions in Japan are completely liberalized, a Nikko spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikko spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused  
to discuss other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai financial daily said the new firm, tentatively  
called ``Nikko Online Securities,'' will be set up by May, with 
half of its capital owned by Nikko Securities group and the 
remaining 50 percent by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure the security and reliability of the online system,  
Nikko will team up with a systems development firm operated by 
Timothy McCarthy, former president of U.S.-based Charles Schwab 
Corp., the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp. also said Friday it will  
invest in an Internet brokerage service, 
</P>
<P>
	Sony will take a 50 percent stake in a joint venture to be set  
up with Oki Matsumoto, an adviser at Goldman Sachs and Co., as 
early as next month, a Sony spokesman said. The joint venture 
between Sony and Matsumoto is to start in October. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Daiwa Securities Co., another major Japanese  
brokerage, announced it and seven other U.S. and Japanese companies 
have jointly established an online brokerage service firm 
specializing in Japanese securities. 
</P>
<P>
	That Tokyo-based joint venture, DLJdirect SFG Securities Inc.,  
is to begin operations in June. The seven other firms joining the 
venture include DLJdirect Inc., a major U.S. online brokerage firm 
and four Sumitomo group companies.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Found Guilty in Gay Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- A Methodist pastor who presided at a  
``wedding'' of two Chicago men was found guilty today of 
disobedience in the first test of the church's ban on same-sex 
ceremonies and could be defrocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Gregory Dell, 53, sat silently as retired Bishop Jack  
Tuell, who presided over the church trial, read the verdict from 
the jury of 13 pastors, who decided 10-3 that Dell disobeyed church 
law by conducting the ceremony in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict was followed immediately by the start of a penalty  
phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell testified in his defense that the church had instructed him  
``to minister to all the people,'' which left him facing a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can't be a pastor fully to all the people ... you don't  
want me as a pastor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rev. Stephen Williams, serving as the prosecutor, said  
Dell had made ``a mockery of church law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't just break the law because you disagree with it,''  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, who has been with the church 30 years, insisted at the  
trial that he would continue to conduct same-sex marriages like the 
one he conducted for Karl Reinhardt and Keith Eccarius, an 
eight-year member of the Broadway United Methodist Church in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Larry Pickens, Dell's defense counsel, told jurors that  
the church has a long-standing history of ministers -- including 
founder John Wesley -- who have broken church law in an effort to 
better serve their parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, my brothers and sisters, is a case about what we do when  
a pastoral need and a church law conflict,'' Pickens said, noting 
that a third of Dell's congregation at the Chicago church are gay 
or lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. It's invigorating. It's draining,'' said Eccarius,  
one of the men who exchanged vows before Dell. ``It's probably the 
most important issue our church has to deal with at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who support the ban agreed on the issue's importance.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are already people who've left the church or are  
planning to because of the advertisement of this trial,'' said the 
Rev. Kent Svendsen, a Methodist pastor from rural Ashton and a 
leader in the church's ``confessing movement,'' which believes gay 
men and lesbians can be converted to heterosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not to exclude or attack people who are  
different, but to help them heal,'' Svendsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell attended Duke University's Divinity School with another  
Methodist minister, the Rev. Jimmy Creech. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Creech's 1998 trial over a same-sex union at his former  
Nebraska church that prompted Methodist leaders to codify a 
``social principle'' that had only advised against blessing 
same-sex unions. Creech, was not defrocked but is on leave from the 
church.

<HEADLINE> Charges Upgraded in Ala. Gay Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two men accused of fatally beating a man  
and burning his body because he was gay could be executed in 
Alabama's electric chair now that charges against them have been 
upgraded to capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Eric Mullins and Charles Butler Jr. had been charged with  
murder for the Feb. 19 killing of Billy Jack Gaither of Sylacauga. 
That charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and allows 
for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury on Wednesday upgraded the charges to capital  
murder, Coosa County Circuit Clerk Cordelia Gandy said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaither was beaten to death on a dirt road beside a creek, where  
a passer-by found his charred remains atop a pyre of two old tires. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Mullins, 25, and Butler, 21, confessed to killing  
Gaither, 39, after luring him from his home with a phone call. 
Police said the defendants claimed Gaither made a sexual advance 
toward them.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Waste Arrives at N.M. Dump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- After 25 years of lawsuits, studies and  
protests, the nation's first nuclear dump -- a network of chambers 
carved out of the salt beds deep beneath the New Mexico desert -- 
received its first truckload of radioactive waste Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 100 people who live in Carlsbad, 25 miles from  
the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, cheered the truck and held up 
cardboard signs reading, ``Welcome finally'' and ``It's about 
time!'' as the rig rolled through before daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the 270-mile, 7 1/2-hour trip, the truck faced a  
scattering of protesters yelling ``Poison! Poison!'' along with two 
young women who sat down in the road and a man who tried to block 
the highway with his car. 
</P>
<P>
	The first load of waste came from Los Alamos National Laboratory  
in the New Mexico city that was the birthplace of the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, up to 6.2 million cubic feet of waste generated  
since the dawn of the atomic age will be entombed over the next 30 
years in the salt beds nearly a half-mile below ground. The waste 
consists of such items as clothing, tools and rags contaminated 
with plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, the United States has had no permanent resting place  
for weapons-related plutonium waste. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the waste has been piling up at 23 weapons  
installations around the country such as Rocky Flats near Denver 
and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, where it is kept 
mostly in 55-gallon drums on above-ground concrete pads, underneath 
bubble structures or in earthen mounds. 
</P>
<P>
	These corroding drums must be periodically repackaged, and some  
fear the waste is vulnerable to hazards such as tornadoes or 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of the first shipment of waste at WIPP marked more  
than two decades of effort to open the $1.8 billion repository, 
first proposed in 1974. The first truckload will be placed 
underground by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic -- this is just the culmination of everything I've  
worked for for 25 years,'' said Wendell Weart, a Sandia National 
Laboratories scientist who was instrumental in creating the 
repository. 
</P>
<P>
	WIPP is not designed for the thousands of tons of high-level  
waste stored at nuclear power plants across the country. Yucca 
Mountain in Nevada is being studied as a long-term burial place for 
that waste. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals court in Washington and a federal judge in Santa Fe  
on Wednesday rejected last-ditch appeals from environmentalists who 
sought to stop the transfer of the waste to WIPP. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, a crowd of about 100 people cheered and the  
driver gave a thumbs-up as the load rolled out of Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, its departure delayed by heavy fog. 
</P>
<P>
	But down the road in Santa Fe, a hub of anti-WIPP sentiment,  
dozens of protesters lined the route, holding up placards that read 
``Stop Nuke Trucks'' and ``Science or Science Fiction?'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Beems, 42, of Albuquerque, parked his car across the  
middle of the road with lighted flares around it. He was arrested 
on charges of obstructing the road and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The two young women who sat down on the interstate south of  
Santa Fe moved when asked to do so by state police. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-wheeler carrying three huge steel containers bearing the  
black-and-yellow radiation symbol passed through WIPP's white metal 
gates at 3:36 a.m. to the cheers of about 500 employees and 
dignitaries. WIPP employees waved American flags and jumped up and 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a doubt it would happen -- I just didn't know  
when,'' said Shari Cullum, who works in the WIPP accounting 
department. ``I had a big lump in my throat. This is cool.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Passes Satellite Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most satellite TV customers, for the first  
time, could watch their local broadcast stations on their satellite 
systems under a bill passed Thursday by the House Commerce 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved without dissent, is meant to resolve a  
dispute between satellite companies and broadcasters over the 
conditions under which viewers who get their TV from satellite can 
watch broadcast programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite TV companies are not supposed to beam local TV  
stations to customers who use either pizza-sized dishes or big 
``backyard'' dishes, although one company, EchoStar, does in a few 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill makes clear that satellite providers legally may carry  
local signals. Eventually, companies would have to carry all local 
stations in a given market by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is supposed to be merged with a similar measure from  
the House Judiciary Committee. The merged bill could go to the 
House for a vote next month. The Senate also may vote on a 
satellite TV bill next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills aim to help make satellite companies stronger  
competitors to cable TV providers, which carry local TV signals. 
That, in turn, should serve as a check on cable rates, which will 
be deregulated next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would direct the Federal Communications Commission  
to look into whether there is a better way of determining which 
satellite TV customers are eligible to receive broadcast network 
programs from ``distant'' network affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law lets satellite companies provide customers with  
``distant'' network signals -- which come from other broadcast areas 
-- only if those customers cannot receive their local stations using 
rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds  
for years over how to interpret the arcane legal test that 
determines when a satellite customer cannot get a local signal and 
thus is eligible to receive network programming by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The major TV networks and DirecTV, the nation's largest  
satellite TV company, recently agreed to delay a deadline for 
cutting off ineligible satellite customers from network signals. 
Given that, the committee's bill does not include a provision 
addressing this matter as a previously approved version of the bill 
had. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that agreement deal does not stop as many as 500,000  
customers who own big backyard satellite dishes from being cut off 
from network programs on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	If the industries do not voluntarily avert this cutoff, Rep.  
Billy Tauzin, R-La., will insert a provision into the bill that 
will, spokesman Ken Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra returned to the Boston Red Sox lineup for the  
first time in eight days and Todd Hundley returned to his spot 
behind the plate for the first time all spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who hasn't played since March 18 because of pain in  
his elbow, homered twice off Rick Helling in his first game since 
March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you close your eyes, it works,'' said Garciaparra,  
the designated hitter in Boston's 10-3 win against Texas at Port 
Charlotte, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who last played shortstop on March 11, hopes to  
return to the field Saturday, when the Red Sox visit the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what he feels like, but he's going on the trip,''  
manager Jimy Williams said. ``He'll play in some capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley, who missed most of last season after undergoing  
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow, caught two innings in 
the Dodgers 7-2 win against Baltimore in Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thankful I got the chance to play,'' Hundley said.  
``What's happened this spring with so many players all over 
baseball having ligament damage, I wouldn't wish that on my worst 
enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley left the game after an hour-long rain delay in the  
bottom of the second. He hit a bloop single to center off Mike 
Mussina in his only plate appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he hoped to start Hundley  
again on Sunday, and remains uncertain as to whether Hundley will 
be ready for the April 5 season-opener against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mesa, Ariz., Rod Beck hit Travis Lee in the head in the top  
of the sixth, sparking a bench-clearing brawl in the bottom half of 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting close to opening day. This is part of baseball,''  
said Billy Williams, who filled in for manager Jim Riggleman, who 
was with the other half of the Cubs. ``You see the pushing and the 
shoving, no punches thrown. You'll see this happen over the next 
three or four days because the season's about to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa homered for the Cubs and Matt Williams drove in seven  
runs for the Diamondbacks who beat the Cubs's split squad 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kissimmee, Fla., Kerry Ligtenberg said he will likely have  
season-ending surgery on his ailing right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to remain positive, but I just don't think it's  
going to heal by itself,'' said Ligtenberg, who had 30 saves last 
season. ``There's no sense in putting it off. If I get it done now, 
I can be back for the opener next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Haines City, Fla., Kevin Appier impressed scouts from  
Cleveland, Boston, Texas and the Mets by allowing one run in six 
innings as Kansas City beat Toronto 5-4 in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who is recovering from reconstructive shoulder surgery,  
struck out five and allowed seven hits in his strongest outing of 
the spring. The Royals can't afford Appier's $4.8 million salary 
and would like to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	At Clearwater, Fla., Curt Schilling struck out 10 in 5 1-3  
innings, but allowed six runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings as 
Philadelphia lost to Cincinnati 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who threw 102 pitches, gave up a three-run homer to  
Jeffrey Hammonds in the first and three more runs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good, and I'm kind of confused as to how I gave up six  
runs,'' Schilling said. ``I'm trying to fine tune the last pieces 
of being ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Bradenton, Fla., Pittsburgh right-hander Jose Silva, struck  
in the face by a line drive earlier this week, won't be able to 
pitch in game conditions for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Port St. Lucie, Fla., the New York Mets placed Hideo Nomo on  
unconditional release waivers after the right-hander reported to 
Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	If Nomo isn't claimed before waivers expire Tuesday, the Mets  
will release him and give him only 45 days termination pay, 
$719,262, instead of his full salary of $2,925,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games:

shot. Garth Brooks pinch hit in the eighth and hit a foul popup to 
first.

and three runs scored.

</P>
<P>
	At Tampa, Fla., Roger Clemens, the New York Yankees expected  
opening day starter, rebounded from two subpar outings by allowing 
no hits in six innings. Houston scored five runs off Mariano Rivera 
in the ninth to win it.

	NATO Begins More Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a third night, American-led NATO forces  
have launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia. Serb military sites 
were the targets of air-launched cruise missiles and U.S. stealth 
fighter jets, the Pentagon said. NATO was hitting numerous targets 
in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade's suburbs in what appeared to be 
the strongest attack so far. It began with cruise missile fired by 
B-52 bombers. F-117 stealth fighter jets equipped with laser-guided 
munitions also took part. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Shoots Down Two Yugo MiGs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the first spillover of NATO's air war with  
Yugoslavia beyond its borders, two U.S. Air Force F-15 fighters 
shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jets in Bosnia today, officials said. 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said it was not immediately clear 
why the Russian-built MiGs had crossed into Bosnian airspace, but 
he said it was possible they had intended to attack NATO 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The shootdowns brought to five the 
number of Yugoslav MiG-29s destroyed since NATO's air campaign 
began on Wednesday. 

</P>
<P>
	Anti-NATO Protests Target Embassies  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Protesters opposed to NATO attacks on  
Yugoslavia directed their anger at American sites around Europe 
today, drenching olive branches in red dye and calling President 
Clinton a ``fascist.'' Up to 10,000 people in Bulgaria gathered in 
the nation's capital of Sofia to protest the NATO airstrikes. In 
Greece, a NATO member, 15,000 protesters marched to the U.S. 
Embassy. The U.S. and British embassies in Moscow were also the 
scene of demonstrations. And riot police blocked demonstrators 
trying to reach the American Embassy in Skopje, Macedonia.

	Kevorkian Convicted of Murder  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian was convicted of  
second-degree murder today for giving an ailing man a lethal 
injection and putting it all on videotape. Kevorkian, 70, could get 
a life term at sentencing April 14 for the death of 52-year-old 
Thomas Youk, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. The jury 
rejected his defense that some acts ``by sheer common sense are not 
crimes.'' Kevorkian also was convicted of delivery of a controlled 
substance, which carries up to seven years.

	Pastor Found Guilty in Gay Marriage

	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- A Methodist minister who officiated  
at the ``marriage'' of two gay men was convicted in a church trial 
today of disobedience in the first test of the denomination's ban 
on same-sex ceremonies and could be defrocked. The jury of 13 
pastors decided 10-3 that the Rev. Gregory Dell disobeyed church 
law when he presided over the ``holy union'' of the Chicago men 
last September. Immediately after the verdict, the penalty phase of 
the trial began.

	Safety of Diabetes Drug Reviewed  
</P>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Unable to determine exactly how risky a  
controversial diabetes drug is, scientists advised the government 
today to restrict how doctors prescribe Rezulin, in hopes that only 
diabetics who need it most will risk deadly liver damage. ``This is 
not to be used ever as a first-line drug for diabetes,'' said Dr. 
Jules Hirsch of Rockefeller University. He stressed that patients 
should try Rezulin only after finding that other, less-risky 
therapies don't work.

	Russia Won't Cooperate on Y2K Bug  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In another show of protest over the fighting in  
Kosovo, Russia's Defense Ministry said today it will stop 
cooperating with the United States on the Y2K computer problem. In 
Washington, Sen. Robert F. Bennett, chairman of the Senate Special 
Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, urged Russia to 
reconsider. Western defense officials have been working with Russia 
on upgrading its computers for fear that the cash-starved country 
has not done enough to tackle the millennium bug. Some fear that 
faulty computers could trigger false alarms on Russia's nuclear 
early warning systems.

Championship. Hometown hero David Duval missed a 4-foot birdie putt 
on the 18th, but still managed to piece together a 3-under 69 for 
138. Bruce Lietzke had a 68 and was two strokes behind, followed by 
Davis Love III (70) and a pair of two-time U.S. Open champions -- 
Ernie Els (67) and Curtis Strange (69).

<HEADLINE> Jones, Johnson Win in SAfrica Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- World champions Marion Jones and  
Michael Johnson were impressive winners Friday at the Engen Grand 
Prix Summer Series. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong headwind slowed the times, but both sprinters were  
impressive. Jones started brilliantly in the 100 meters, and never 
was threatened, clocking 11.06 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in shape to run fast,'' Jones said. ``My body felt in  
10.8 shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also got out well, then eased up to win the 200 at  
20.41. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling particularly good,'' Johnson said. ``The time is  
not significant in this wind, but I will be ready this year -- 
looking to win the world championship in Seville, Spain, over 200 
meters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 100, Namibian Frank Fredericks, the 1993 world 200  
champion, won in 10.38. ``My goal is gold in Seville,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic champion in the men's 400 hurdles, Derrick Adkins,  
started fast in a tough field, but clipped the seventh hurdle. He 
limped home in seventh, beaten by South African Llewellyn Herbert 
(49.01). 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners included triple jump world record-holder Jonathan  
Edwards of Britain, who leaped 56 feet, 9 1/4 inches, and Jerome 
Young, in the 400 at 45.31.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Routine Same in Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Scoonie Penn insists Ohio State is  
not superstitious. Don't believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' Final Four will be no different from the weeks  
leading up to it. No routine will be broken and no quirky detail 
forgotten for fear something bad might happen. 
</P>
<P>
	At team meetings, the players will sit in the same configuration  
of seats, always four across the front with the rest in the back. 
Penn will lead the Buckeyes on the floor for practice and in 
Saturday night's national semifinal with Connecticut and will 
always take the first shot in warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	The team trainer will tape ankles in the same order -- always  
ending with a tap on the bottom of each foot -- and the Buckeyes 
will unwind before the game by listening to their lucky boom box. 
</P>
<P>
	Nope, Penn protested, nothing odd about that.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been our routine the whole season. Now people are  
looking for the answer to why we're winning,'' he said. ``They ask 
if we're doing anything the same and we start talking, yes, we're 
doing the same things we've been doing all season. And they become 
superstitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what would happen if you weren't first on the floor?  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing,'' Penn said. ``But I'm not going to test it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim O'Brien can only shake his head and, like the rest of  
his players, follow Penn's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it interesting,'' he said. ``I'm not going to get in  
the way of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' craving for routine might have been a product of  
the team's choice of Final Four lodging. While the other three 
teams are staying in resort hotels, Ohio State is hidden in a 
remote, gated community that is patrolled by guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why it switched from the Hilton to private condominiums  
surrounded by 6-foot fence, O'Brien said, ``Because it's too, too 
busy in there, too crazy. It has nothing to do with being 
paranoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Jason Singleton said there is logic behind the team's  
superstitious nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie took his boom box to Puerto Rico and we won that  
tournament,'' Singleton said. ``He didn't take it to the Big Ten 
tournament and we lost. So we put two and two together and we 
figure we've got to take it to all our NCAA tournament games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is almost no end to the team's superstitions. Ken Johnson  
is always the last player out of the locker room. Tri-captains 
Penn, Singleton and Neshaun Coleman are the first players in the 
three-man weave drill in practice. Trainer Mike Bordner has worn 
the same suit for each NCAA game, with the small pins given to each 
participant arranged in ascending order on his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien said many of the team's peculiarities stem from Penn's  
desire for order. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes direction, he likes organization,'' O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the year, to break up the monotony of another  
repetitious series of drills, O'Brien decided to shake things up. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my infinite wisdom I decided, why don't we just have  
shooting games instead and make it a little bit light?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few practices later, O'Brien asked the team what it wanted to  
do in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie said, `No shooting games! Let's do our routine and do  
it the same way we always do,''' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the team's superstitious nature that allowed O'Brien to  
keep his hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the tournament began, everyone on the team agreed to  
shave his head if the Buckeyes made it to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien showed up Sunday after the win over St. John's in the  
South Regional title game and asked who was going to lose his hair 
first. Not wanting to break up its routine, the team agreed they 
wouldn't go through with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Great. That's terrific,' because I really did not  
want to have to shave my head,'' O'Brien said with a laugh.

<HEADLINE> Joe Torre Returns to Legends Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A smiling and tan Joe Torre returned to  
Legends Field on Friday, meeting with his players and coaches for 
the first time since prostate cancer surgery at Barnes-Jewish 
Hospital in St. Louis on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre talked with his players about five minutes during a  
closed-door meeting. He also met with his coaching staff in the 
manager's office for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was important for them to see that I'm feeling  
fine and that it's just a matter of time,'' the New York Yankees 
manager said. ``I asked them if there were any questions, I'd be 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre will continue recuperating from the surgery in Florida  
until heading to New York around the time of home opener April 9 
against Detroit. Torre also plans on coming to the ballpark either 
daily or two of every three days during the remaining week of 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that time, the 8th or 9th, I may be visible but I'm not  
going to be directing the team,'' Torre said. ``Don Zimmer has done 
enough of that during his career -- a lot longer than I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer is the team's interim manager until Torre returns.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time I've felt natural ... seeing him sitting  
behind his desk,'' Zimmer said. ``He's going to get stronger every 
day. Up to this point, he's made a great recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Catalona, who performed the surgery, said it's  
normally 6-to-12 weeks before patients go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to come back and suddenly be washed out and have  
to take a few days off,'' Torre said. ``We'll go according to how I 
feel and how I maintain my strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre planned on visiting his team early next week, but moved up  
his visit after consulting with his doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been progressing every day, and I talked to my doctor  
yesterday and he said, `Why don't you go tomorrow?' '' Torre said. 
``After he said that, that's all I needed to hear. There's not much 
you can do. I walk and eat. He just thought I needed a little 
stimulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's visit caught his players off guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was great. I was surprised to see him,'' Yankees second  
baseman Chuck Knoblauch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more surprising was Torre's condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like he was ready to manage right now,'' pitcher  
David Cone said. ``Obviously he needs time. It's remarkable the guy 
look great. He's well on the road to recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Torre feels weak later in the day. That's why he  
doesn't want to rush his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sure puts things in the proper perspective,'' Torre said.  
``You try and do that, but you get so involved that winning is the 
most important thing in the world. I sense it will be again once I 
get back into uniform.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cops Let Suspected Dealer Flee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- In a sort of drug-bust-in-reverse, police  
accidentally let a suspected dealer get away with $17,000 in 
cocaine they supplied. 
</P>
<P>
	After a two-month search, U.S. marshals arrested the suspect  
last week. But the cocaine is still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred Jan. 15, when an undercover officer posing  
as a dealer met with a man in a restaurant parking lot and sold him 
a kilo, or 2.2 pounds, of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty officers were watching, waiting to move in when the  
undercover officer signaled for an arrest. But the officers had 
trouble with their radios, and no one was able to see the exchange 
well, an unidentified source told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect -- who got a good deal, paying less than street value  
-- left in a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Two backup officers from Bellevue pursued the man but cut off  
the chase for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Meadows, 45, was finally arrested at a restaurant. He  
told police he threw away the cocaine on Interstate 405. Detectives 
and drug-sniffing dogs scoured the area but never found it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that we do this kind of thing 99 percent of the  
time successfully. I wish it would be successful 100 percent of the 
time. But it's not an exact science,'' Assistant Chief Clark 
Kimerer said.

<HEADLINE> Examples of Cable TV Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Examples of companies' plans for cable TV rates this year:  
</P>
<P>
	--Time Warner, which runs the nation's largest cable TV company  
with 12.6 million customers, announced price increases this year of 
no more than 4.9 percent, said spokesman Mike Luftman. 
</P>
<P>
	The average customer's bill, consisting of expanded basic,  
set-top box and remote rental and a couple of premium channels, is 
expected to go up less than 4 percent, Luftman said, adding that no 
price changes will occur because of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	--AT&AMP;T-owned Tele-Communications Inc., which runs the  
second-largest chain of cable TV systems, said its customers can 
expect some price adjustments after deregulation, said spokeswoman 
Lela Cocoros. She couldn't give any specifics for increases this 
year but said the company wants to minimize them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Comcast, the third-ranked cable company, has said it would  
raise rates 5 percent this year, and says its takeover of another 
cable provider, MediaOne, will not change those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cablevision Systems Corp., the nation's sixth-largest cable TV  
company, announced price increases this year averaging about 5 
percent, said spokesman Charlie Schueler. 
</P>
<P>
	But some customers could get rate reductions. Customers on New  
York's Long Island who buy a bundled package of telephone and cable 
services and spend more than $50 a month on just their phone 
service will get their cable TV service discounted, he said.

<HEADLINE> NY Cops Charged in Diallo Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jesse Jackson galvanized protesters outside  
Police Headquarters today as word spread that four white officers 
had been indicted for murder in the shooting of an unarmed African 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson arrived as several hundred protesters gathered for what  
has become a daily rite. He linked arms with the Rev. Al Sharpton; 
they blocked the entrance, then were read their rights and taken 
inside for arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous demonstrations over the death of Amadou Diallo have  
resulted in 821 arrests, including NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and 
actors Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson told reporters: ``I look out here today and I see  
blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, men and women, moving from 
battleground to common ground and the moral ground. This is a great 
day. A day of joy. A day of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the case, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
told The Associated Press Thursday night that the officers had been 
indicted for second-degree murder. But by early afternoon there 
still was no official confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-degree murder is the intentional killing from depraved  
indifference to life. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 25 
years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indictment is only the first step,'' protester Yee Ling Poon,  
an attorney from Chinatown, said this morning. ``I am going to stay 
out here until the whole attitude toward minorities has changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a strong supporter of the police  
department and a target of the demonstrations, appeared to be 
softening his position today, saying on his radio show: 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talk about the good record of our police department,  
that is not meant in any way to demean or to deny or to denigrate 
the feelings of frustration and anger and hurt over the shooting 
that took place. I feel those myself but it's also meant to try to 
convey perspective and reality to a situation in which there aren't 
many trying to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor, was hit 19 times on Feb. 4  
in the vestibule of his Bronx home when officers Kenneth Boss, Sean 
Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy fired a total of 41 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Street Crime Unit members were looking for a  
rape-murder suspect when they found Diallo. It is unclear whether 
the officers thought Diallo fit the suspect's description. A lawyer 
for one of the officers has said his client believed Diallo was 
reaching for a gun, although he was later found to be unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, said neither he nor his  
client had been notified of the indictment, but added he was not 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``As sure as I was that he was going to be indicted, that's how  
sure I am that he's going to be acquitted,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the other three officers said they had yet to be  
contacted by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have not spoken publicly about the case and all  
declined to testify before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting, apprehensions over the sometimes adversarial  
relationship between minorities and police have pitted Giuliani 
against protesters critical of the mayor's reactions to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The peaceful protests began in minority communities but have  
gained momentum and cut across racial lines in the seven weeks 
since Diallo's death. Demonstrators, including young people who had 
never been to a protest and one-time activists drawn back to the 
streets, have angrily accused police of racism.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Rises Sharply / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and corn furtures rose Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations that next week's report on 
spring planting plans will show farmers turning toward more 
profitable crops. Soybeans retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Wednesday from the Agriculture Department will  
provide the first concrete estimate of whether farmers intend to 
plant more soybeans over corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants are expecting spring wheat acreage to suffer  
most as farmers turn toward crops that have a better chance of 
selling overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also found continued support from talk that the Clinton  
administration is considering a one-time exemption to the ban on 
exports to Iran and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures moved higher in step with wheat, while soybeans  
were pressured by expectations for a large American crop that will 
have to compete for sales with bumper South American crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 6 cents to $2.98 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.32 1/4 a bushel; May oats rose 2 3/4 cents to 
$1.22 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents to $4.96 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose 0.67 cent to 66.62 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose 0.50 cent to 71.55 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs fell 0.15 cent to 43.95 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose 
0.98 cent to 57.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Will Refinery Blasts Raise Gas Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gas prices surged in California following  
last month's deadly explosion at a Tosco refinery, and analysts say 
Thursday's fire at a Chevron plant may well send them higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to go up a lot,'' said Michael Mayer, a  
securities analyst who follows Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in the explosion Thursday afternoon at the  
Chevron plant in Richmond, which sent a huge pillar of black smoke 
across the Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Chevron plant said the refinery would remain  
open, while the unit where the fiery explosion occurred was shut 
down indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The refinery can produce up to 240,000 gallons of crude oil  
daily, said Chevron spokeswoman Dawn Soper. She would not say how 
the unit's closure would impact production there. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I couldn't speculate on anything regarding  
pricing,'' Soper said. With refineries in El Segundo and elsewhere, 
``we don't expect what happened today to have a significant affect 
on our customers including those at the pump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But production already is crippled in the state, with at least  
three other refineries operating at less than 100 percent capacity, 
said Jay McKeeman, executive vice president of the California 
Independent Oil Marketers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Various refinery shutdowns in California mean about 250,000 to  
300,000 gallons a day are cut out of the state's normal daily 
supply of 2 million gallons, according to Chevron spokesman Jack 
Coffey. Tosco's Avon plant alone usually produces 160,000 gallons a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is one in a continuing series of problems,''  
McKeeman said. ``California is a huge petroleum consumer entity, 
(buying) 13 billion gallons of gasoline a year. It needs a lot of 
refining capacity a year to meet that demand. Anytime there's a 
glitch in the system you get a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 23, the day of the blast at the Tosco Avon refinery that  
killed four workers and left another man critically injured, prices 
shot up 16 cents -- to $1.18 a gallon on the West Coast -- before 
sliding back down to about $1.02 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for regular gasoline were about $1.30 a gallon or more in  
the San Francisco Bay area this week, compared to about $1.12 on 
the West Coast overall, according to the U.S. Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	California motorists face unique concerns when buying gas  
because laws require it to be specially formulated and most of what 
they purchase is produced in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't immediately get access to other supplies of fuel,''  
McKeeman said. ``It's going to cost more; there's delays in getting 
conforming fuel in the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much supply could be affected is an open question,  
McKeeman said. The refineries experiencing various problems -- which 
also include an Arco facility in the Los Angeles area and an Exxon 
site in Benicia -- account for as much as half of the state's fuel 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's true that close to half of the refining capacity in  
the state is at risk, yeah, there's a very definite problem of 
supply shortages,'' McKeeman said.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Prosecutors To Charge Nichols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Terry Nichols, serving a life sentence  
after his federal conviction as a conspirator in the Oklahoma City 
bombing, will be charged with murder in state court next week, the 
district attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy said 160 counts of  
first-degree murder will be filed against Nichols as early as 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a federal jury in Denver found Nichols, 43, guilty of  
conspiring to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and of 
eight counts of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of federal 
law officers killed in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	The state charges represent the other victims of the April 19,  
1995, bombing, which killed a total of 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Timothy McVeigh was convicted of first-degree  
murder, conspiracy and weapons-related charges. McVeigh was 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy said his office likely won't file state charges against  
McVeigh unless it looks as though he will escape the death penalty. 
His sentence has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy said he wanted to meet with victims of the bombing before  
formally filing charges against Nichols.

<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Vancouver center Bryant  
Reeves underwent successful arthroscopic surgery Friday to repair a 
slight cartilege tear in his right knee and will be out for up to 
four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In placing Reeves on the injured list, the Grizzlies activated  
rookie forward Makhtar Ndiaye, who began the season on the injured 
list with a strained shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' injury caps a frustrating campaign for the four-year  
veteran, whose six-year $66 million salary kicked in at the start 
of this season. After reporting to training camp almost 40 pounds 
overweight, Reeves was relegated to the bench for the first nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Averaging 10.8 points and 13 rebounds over 25 games, Reeves  
suffered the injury before Monday's game at Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Marine's Charges Stand in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military judge ruled that  
prosecutors may proceed with the obstruction of justice case 
against a Marine navigator accused of destroying a videotape made 
just before his jet cut a ski gondola cable in Italy last year, 
killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., destroyed a videotape that he shot before his radar-jamming 
EA-6B Prowler hit the gondola cable during a low-level training 
flight last February. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Alvin Keller said Thursday there was sufficient evidence to  
proceed with the court-martial. Trial is scheduled to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer is the second Marine aviator to be tried in the  
accident. On March 4, a military jury at Camp Lejeune acquitted the 
jet's pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., of 
manslaughter and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Manslaughter counts against Schweitzer were dismissed after the  
acquittal. But Schweitzer and Ashby both face charges of 
obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice because 
of the videotape's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Schweitzer could be sentenced to 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified during his trial that Schweitzer filmed the  
early part of their training flight. After they landed, he gave the 
tape to Schweitzer and never saw it again, Ashby testified. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing for dismissal, defense lawyers said the aviators  
couldn't have known a criminal inquiry would be started when they 
landed after the accident and couldn't have conspired to block one. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty said the defense argument was  
far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had just screwed up a $50 million airplane,'' Daugherty  
said. ``To say the only thing aviators think about when they screw 
up an aircraft is an administrative mishap board ... defies common 
sense.''

<HEADLINE> Ligtenberg May Be Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Kerry Ligtenberg said Friday he will  
likely have season-ending surgery on his ailing right elbow, 
leaving a gaping hole in the Atlanta Braves' bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to remain positive, but I just don't think it's  
going to heal by itself,'' Ligtenberg said before Friday's 
exhibition game against Montreal. ``There's no sense in putting it 
off. If I get it done now, I can be back for the opener next 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg was diagnosed with a partial tear of the medial  
collateral ligament in his right elbow March 10, two days after 
allowing five runs in the ninth inning of a spring game against 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was asked not to throw for at least three weeks  
and then be reexamined. But he said trainer Dave Pursley ``pushed 
on it yesterday where the ligament is, and it's pretty tender. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me if it were him, he would get the surgery done. So,  
I'm leaning toward that,'' Ligtenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Braves orthopedic surgeon Dr. Joe Chandler will be at  
training camp Sunday. ``Hopefully he'll let me throw some and we'll 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg had a breakthrough year in 1998, taking over the  
closer's role after Mark Wohlers experienced control problems and 
was sent to the minors. The former independent league player, once 
traded for a bag of baseballs, wound up with 30 saves in 34 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers struggled to find the strike zone last season after  
injuring his side last May. He was 0-1 with a 10.18 ERA with 
Atlanta, walking 33 in 20.1 innings. At Triple A Richmond, he was 
worse, going 0-3 with a 20.43 ERA, walking 36 in 12.1 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, in seven appearances this spring, has allowed eight  
hits, five runs, walked six and struck out eight in seven innings 
and lowered his ERA to 7.71. He pitched two scoreless innings 
Thursday night for his best outing of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rocker, who was 1-3 in 47 games last year for Atlanta with  
a 2.13 ERA in 38 innings, will likely begin the season as the 
closer.

<HEADLINE> Japan Said Back on Economic Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A top Japanese economic advisor said Friday that  
reforms are showing the first signs of success and will be enough 
to return Japan to growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of the newly created Economic  
Strategy Council, said the current combination of massive 
government spending and deregulation have already begun to turn the 
economy around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results are finally appearing,'' said Higuchi, who is also  
honorary chairman of Asahi Breweries Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to a 34 percent drop in corporate bankruptcies in  
January from a year before and rising sales of new condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the council's projections show gross domestic product  
barely growing this year but expanding at more than 2 percent next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to avoid if all possible three years of negative  
growth,'' he told reporters at a luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy is mired in its longest recession since the end  
of World War II, having shrunk the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Strategy Council was created when Prime Minister  
Keizo Obuchi took office last summer with promises to restore 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi moved with a speed that was uncharacteristic of Japan's  
usually cautious policy makers, rushing through a series of 
spending measures worth an unprecedented $737 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that, $508 billion was earmarked to bail out the debt-plagued  
banking system and $229 billion was in public works and other 
stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
	Higuchi said the infusion of money into the economy was  
sufficient to restore growth in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that more far-reaching reforms to the legal system  
and deregulation were still needed to end Japan's economic malaise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cold is about to go away, but the basic system that led to  
the cold has not been addressed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem, according to Higuchi: a powerful central  
bureaucracy that protected inefficient industries and stifled 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the steps his council recommended last month to the prime  
minister are: 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the number of lawyers to strengthen oversight of the  
bureaucracy by the courts; 
</P>
<P>
	--Cutting the number of bureaucrats by up to a quarter over the  
next decade; 
</P>
<P>
	--Creating a new over-the-counter stock market to bankroll  
venture capitalists.

<HEADLINE> Army Sec.: Hard To Reinstate Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reinstating the military draft to help fill  
the ranks of America's fighting forces may not be fair or 
practical, Army Secretary Louis Caldera said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said it would be harder than in the past to fashion a  
fair draft, and an unfair one might harm the military rather than 
help it. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said renewing the draft, which ended 25 years ago , is  
one possible response to the problems the armed forces are having 
in finding enough recruits to fill its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``By its very nature the draft communicates that military  
service is everyone's obligation,'' Caldera said in a speech at the 
National Press Club. ``And it might act as a leveling influence in 
the ranks and in other society,'' bringing together young people 
from differing backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the draft would have the added benefit of reducing the  
$100 million a year the Army spends in recruiting advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for today's Army,'' Caldera said, '' a draft may simply  
not be fair or practical'' because the armed forces do not need as 
many young people as they did during World War II. During the 
Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s only one in 10 of those eligible 
to serve did so, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today with our smaller post-Cold War armed forces, our  
stronger volunteer tradition and our need for longer terms of 
service to get a good return on the high, up-front training costs, 
it would be ever harder to fashion a fair draft,'' Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a draft that was perceived as unfair ``because too few  
are called, might harden feeling against the military and hurt 
rather than help raise the regard in which military service is 
held.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some members of Congress have raised the prospect of  
renewing the draft because some branches of the armed forces can't 
find enough recruits, military leaders say the all-volunteer force 
of 1.4 million is sufficient for now, although they support better 
pay, benefits and living conditions for the troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all male U.S. citizens and male aliens living in the  
United States, must register with Selective Service. But the United 
States has not drafted the nation's youth into the military since 
the Vietnam War ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera, a West Point graduate who took over his post last July,  
said recruiting efforts are being hampered by baby boomer parents 
who don't value military service and ``consider it a bad choice 
compared to trying to go to college.''

<HEADLINE> Safety of Diabetes Drug Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Federal officials said today they have  
linked 38 cases of acute liver failure to the diabetes drug Rezulin 
and believe the risk of liver problems grows over time as patients 
take the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Food and Drug Administration officials have discovered  
43 cases of acute liver failure among Rezulin patients, 38 of which 
were probably caused by the medicine, the officials told a panel of 
scientific advisers weighing the drug's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those 43 people, seven had a liver transplant and survived,  
five survived without a transplant and 28 died. Officials did not 
know the outcome of the other three cases. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, several doctors told the FDA scientific  
advisers that Rezulin helps many of their toughest diabetes 
patients, and the benefits outweigh the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``No drug is 100 percent safe,'' said Dr. Steven Edelman of the  
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Diego. ``But diabetes is a 
serious disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only an estimated 45 percent of Rezulin patients are getting the  
proper liver testing to detect problems in time to treat them, 
under the best-case scenario, said Dr. David Graham, an FDA 
epidemiologist. Thus, it's impossible to say if a better job of 
liver testing would save a significant number. 
</P>
<P>
	Very few Rezulin patients have used the drug for more than  
several months, but Graham argued that the longer patients do use 
it, the greater the risk of liver damage. Using the data that 
exist, Graham created a model to estimate that among people who use 
Rezulin for six months, as many as one in 1,800 could have liver 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA believes it has received reports of only about 10  
percent of the liver damage that may have occurred among Rezulin 
users, because there is no law requiring doctors to report patient 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that individual patients have benefited''  
from Rezulin, Graham said. But ``the longer you stay on 
troglitazone (Rezulin), the greater the risk of developing acute 
liver failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-month debate over the safety of the novel drug, taken by  
750,000 Americans, has sharply divided diabetes specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the medications sold for type 2 or so-called adult onset  
diabetes, Rezulin is the only one that targets the disease's 
underlying cause. It has helped patients for whom other therapies 
failed and thus are at higher risk of serious complications. 
</P>
<P>
	But other specialists have stopped prescribing Rezulin because  
it can attack some patients' livers. On Monday, Britain ruled that 
Rezulin was too dangerous to sell in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration long has warned patients of the  
liver risk, and urges they get repeated, rigorous liver tests to 
catch early signs of damage. For many such patients, stopping 
Rezulin can reverse liver damage, FDA drug chief Dr. Janet Woodcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA called the highly unusual safety meeting today  
because of the alarming finding that some patients who took all 
those precautions still died -- from severe liver toxicity that 
arose just weeks after they had passed a liver test. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of scientific advisers is itself under intense  
scrutiny because some of the scientists have conducted research 
financed at least indirectly by Rezulin's manufacturer, 
Warner-Lambert Inc. The same panel enthusiastically backed 
Rezulin's initial approval in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	One opponent of the drug, consumer advocate Dr. Sidney Wolfe of  
Public Citizen, contends that ill-informed doctors are using 
Rezulin in ways that worsen the risk. How? By prescribing Rezulin 
to patients who are supposed to try less risky therapies first, and 
by not properly conducting liver tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of people who are dead from this drug, and in  
most cases I think they're people who could have responded to 
something else,'' Wolfe says. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has spent months investigating more than 100 reports of  
problems among Rezulin users to sift out which patients' liver 
toxicity Rezulin actually could have caused -- and which diabetics 
may have become ill or died for totally unrelated reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert plans to ask FDA's advisers to allow more  
diabetics to use Rezulin, by letting the drug be combined with 
older diabetes therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Rezulin's harshest critics don't expect the advisory group  
to take the drastic step of recommending that Rezulin be banned. 
But it has many options, from taking no action to recommending much 
stricter safety steps that could hinder how often doctors prescribe 
Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA typically follows its advisers' recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the outcome of today's hearing, experts expect  
Rezulin sales could soon drop off dramatically because two new 
drugs that promise Rezulin's benefit without the liver risk are 
awaiting FDA approval. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 million people have adult-onset diabetes. Their bodies'  
natural insulin gradually loses its ability to convert blood sugar 
into energy. Insulin and other medicines can help control many 
patients' blood sugar, but an estimated 1 million diabetics need 
additional help. Uncontrolled diabetes leads to kidney damage, 
blindness, heart disease and other complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was widely hailed as  
the first drug to attack this underlying diabetes trigger by 
somehow resensitizing the body to insulin. Many patients need fewer 
daily insulin injections; some have even been able to quit insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA has been issuing escalating warnings about the liver  
side effects since November 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The ghost of Tony Stewart lives on in the Indy  
Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who now drives for former Washington Redskins coach Joe  
Gibbs on NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit, got the attention of the 
popular stock-car owner by winning the IRL driving championship in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray, his replacement with Team Menard, found Stewart's old  
car to his liking on Friday, when he had the fastest lap during 
practice for the MCI WorldCom 200 at Phoenix International Raceway, 
averaging 173.653 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car is not super special, but the conditions (wind) are  
bad enough that we are better than everyone,'' said Ray, who got 
the attention of Wisconsin lumberyard magnate John Menard by 
qualifying second with another team in last year's Indianapolis 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if anything today means anything for tomorrow,''  
Ray said about qualifying for the second race of the IRL season. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Sharp was second in practice with a 173.027 mph lap,  
followed by Scott Goodyear, John Hollansworth and Sam Schmidt, who 
did his 171.388 mph lap in the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOONEY TUNES AT THE TRACK:* Warner Bros. Studio Stores will  
sponsor Team Truscelli Racing's entry in 10 Indy Racing League 
races this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the arrangement announced Friday, the IRL practice day for  
Sunday's MCI WorldCom 200 at Phoenix International Raceway, the 
car, tractor-trailer and crew of driver Robert Moreno will carry 
the company's logo and featured Looney Tunes cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriately, the introductory cartoon figure in Phoenix is  
Speedy Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno, a Brazilian who took up residence in Monaco while  
driving in Formula One, is in his first year in the IRL. The 
40-year-old veteran last raced in eight CART events in 1997, then 
spent last season out of world-class racing. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLD NO. 99:* Brazilian Raul Boesel got a $10,000 check Friday,  
the first handed out under the Firestone First at '99 Award 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Boesel was in Phoenix to practice for the 200-mile Indy Racing  
League race Sunday, but he earned the money during the Indy 200 
near Orlando, Fla., on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCormack Motorsports ace led 19 laps at the Walt Disney  
World Speedway, but the 99th was not among them. He was running 
fifth behind Scott Sharp and three other cars equipped with 
Goodyear rubber. Boesel finished fifth in a race won by Eddie 
Cheever Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The award will be presented following every IRL race this season  
as part of a promotional partnership between Firestone Racing and 
Tony George's Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corp.

<P>
	 *BRINGING JUNIOR ALONG:* Mark Dismore will have more problems  
than usual controlling his nerves Sunday before the MCI WorldCom 
200 at Phoenix International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore, who had the fastest time during winter testing in  
Phoenix, has to juggle his feelings about work and family while 
preparing to drive in the 200-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because his son, also named Mark, will be making his  
driving debut in a Formula 2000 support race earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'll watch,'' Dismore said. ``I think I'll sit  
in the motor home and have my wife tell me what happened. But he 
should be able to do this. It's an educational deal; it's a 
school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore, who usually takes second billing to Kelley Racing  
teammate Scott Sharp, had a 175.627 mph lap during testing four 
weeks ago. But he could only coax a 170.916 mph tour of the 
one-mile oval out of his car on Friday, the eighth-fastest practice 
time.

<HEADLINE> Showtime Plans Holocaust Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For too many, the Holocaust languishes somewhere  
between old news and ancient history. And as for young people -- 
well, what could be the relevance of anything that happened before 
rock music or TV? 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Hannah Stern sets other priorities ahead of her  
heritage. An all-too-typical 16-year-old kid in New Rochelle, N.Y., 
she feels put upon when her parents insist she drop everything to 
celebrate the Jewish holiday Passover. 
</P>
<P>
	She begs to skip the Seder: ``It's a waste of time.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going because it's important,'' says her mom.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why,'' Hannah counters, ``is it important?''  
</P>
<P>
	The answer to that question reveals itself for young and old in  
``The Devil's Arithmetic,'' a Showtime original film. Showtime is 
making a major point of the film's for-all-ages appeal. So do 
Dustin Hoffman and Mimi Rogers, who as executive producers were 
driving forces in making the film. It premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. 
EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Jane Yolen's 1988 novel of the same title, ``The  
Devil's Arithmetic'' thrusts unsuspecting Hannah back in time, to a 
place where Seders and Judaism were deemed capital offenses -- 
German-occupied Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	There she finds a renewed sense of family, while encountering  
the horrors of her family's past. She is literally absorbed in a 
chapter of history that, from the comfortable distance of the 
1990s, she had never cared to explore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Devil's Arithmetic'' wants its audience -- especially  
youngsters -- to care. And how could they fail to, after sharing 
Hannah's reality check? 
</P>
<P>
	In no way does it water down its depiction of Nazi-waged  
genocide. But this beautifully made film knows when to speak in 
hushed tones. Even for young viewers, it should prove disturbing, 
but not traumatizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the child has to be old enough to have some frame of  
reference,'' Rogers said, ``and to be able to ask coherent 
questions about the film afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially for kids, the Holocaust can seem too horrible to be  
true. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think taking the journey with a contemporary teen and  
seeing it through her eyes makes it real, makes it understandable 
for young people,'' said Rogers, who, supplementing her producer's 
role, appears in a cameo as Hannah's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannah is played by Kirsten Dunst, the 16-year-old actress whose  
previous films include ``Little Women'' and ``Wag the Dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had read the book before,'' Kirsten said. ``So as soon as I  
found out they wanted me to play this role, of course I wanted to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film also stars Brittany Murphy (``David and Lisa'') as  
Rivkah, a Polish girl in 1941 who befriends Hannah, certain that 
they're cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	And Louise Fletcher, best known for her Oscar-winning  
performance in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' is Hannah's 
Aunt Eva, at whose home the Seder takes place. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't understand what it was like in the camp,'' she  
gently tells Hannah. ``This experience is so far from your world.'' 
But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
	Scenes of Hannah's collision with the past were filmed last fall  
near Vilnius, Lithuania, on a muddy, desolate site designed to 
resemble Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day we pulled up to the concentration camp, I was,  
like, shocked,'' Kirsten said. ``I couldn't hold back my tears. 
Even when you see it for yourself, you can't imagine how it must 
have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Deitch, the film's director, found the shoot no less  
jolting. 
</P>
<P>
	Her projects include the Oprah Winfrey TV film ``The Women of  
Brewster Place'' -- and numerous episodes of ``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Though I had directed my share of scenes involving murders and  
people getting beat up, I had never done anything that involved 
this degree of evil,'' Deitch said. ``I was a little unprepared for 
what it would be like. 
</P>
<P>
	``For instance, in the hanging scene, when two of the girls  
watching hug each other, suddenly I think, 'The Nazis would never 
let them do that,' and I'm yelling at the guard, 'Go over there and 
break those two girls up. Hurry up! Pull 'em apart!''' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary doing certain scenes,'' Kirsten agreed. ``When we  
were walking to the gas chamber, sometimes it would feel too 
real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never fear. At the end of the film, Hannah returns home. A  
fateful link between then and now, she will always remember what 
she went through. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kirsten Dunst will remember, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel proud to help tell the story,'' she said. ``We just  
have to keep making movies about the Holocaust so that people never 
forget about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	WHO PLAYS HOSS?: A new TV film whose working title is ``Michael  
Landon, the Father I Knew'' is in production for CBS. Michael 
Landon Jr. is directing, based on his true story that reveals the 
relationship between a beloved television star and the son who 
idolized him. But things turn sour. Disillusioned by his father, 
Mike Jr. turns to drugs and alcohol until he hits bottom. Only when 
he begins to believe in himself can he take responsibility for his 
own life and to accept his relationship with his not-so-perfect 
father. John Schneider and Cheryl Ladd star. Consider yourself 
warned.

University, predicted that the next major high-tech advances will 
involve wireless networks, tablet-sized computers, speech 
recognition programs and software to let people collaborate on 
electronic documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, wearing a Georgetown sweatshirt, recounted to students  
some ways that Microsoft helps employees work more efficiently, 
such as making sales figures available online and abolishing most 
paper documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates described telling his staff to bring to him binders filled  
with copies of every paper form the company used, from purchase 
approvals to benefits requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did something only a CEO really can do -- I said get rid of  
them,'' said Gates, who ordered the forms be made available 
electronically. ``In fact, the only ones we have left are the ones 
we have to fill out and send to the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited figures showing 153 million people worldwide --  
including 87 million in the United States and Canada -- use the 
Internet at least for e-mail. But he predicted a full decade may 
pass before most people get online. 
</P>
<P>
	``People tend to be evangelistic about the Web,'' Gates said.  
``This kind of evangelism, that's pretty much what's pulling people 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Use of high-tech tools by businesses is more common than by  
consumers. Gates said students already comfortable with technology 
should encourage their future employers to adopt digital tools to 
enhance their companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students lead the way,'' Gates said. ``It's really students  
who are driving this into business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates also said:  
</P>
<P>
	--Technology may replace some jobs but those workers should be  
retrained. ``There is infinite demand for jobs out there. It's not 
like we're going to run out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--To serve customers better, companies ``should be able to call  
up every interaction with a customer in just a few seconds ... any 
phone call, any news, any insight that somebody in the company has 
about what that customer is thinking and what they might need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But asked later about privacy concerns, Gates said, ``These are  
important political questions, and the rules need to be laid 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's visit to Washington was the first by Gates since last  
summer, when he appeared with other software executives to talk 
about new laws the industry wanted from Congress.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Athlete Speaks About Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGEDALE, Tenn. (AP) -- The families of the two men killed in  
a Nov. 15 truck crash have forgiven the University of Kentucky 
football player who was driving. Jason Watts wishes it were that 
simple for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You almost want them to be mad at you because it will make the  
guilt easier,'' Watts said Thursday in his first public comments 
since the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident killed teammate Arthur Steinmetz, 19, and Eastern  
Kentucky student Scott Brock, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, 21, of Ovieda, Fla., faces a July 19 trial on two counts  
of second-degree manslaughter and a count of wanton endangerment. 
He is scheduled for a court appearance Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But he told students at Southern Adventist University, about 18  
miles north of Chattanooga, that he sees the dead bodies of his 
friends in his dreams and is lucky if he sleeps three or four hours 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
	His own scars from the crash also remind him if he happens to  
think about something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mental and emotional scars will last forever,'' Watts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I literally see my buddies dying in my arms because of me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Watts spoke as part of the school's drug and alcohol awareness  
week. Watts, who was Kentucky's starting center, said he hoped 
someone will learn from his tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all because of a stupid mistake,'' he said. ``Drinking  
beers and getting behind the wheel is something that could've been 
avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, who was dismissed from the Kentucky team, spent the night  
before the crash drinking with his friends. The celebration was 
fueled by Kentucky's 55-17 Senior Day victory over Vanderbilt, 
which earned the Wildcats a berth in the Outback Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But by early morning, they became bored and decided to hunt  
deer. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts was driving his truck on U.S. 27 when it slipped off the  
roadway as he passed a car, clipped a mailbox and blew out a back 
tire. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men said nothing to each other, knowing they were  
about to crash, Watts said. The truck flipped, throwing all three 
out of the vehicle. Watts went through the windshield, bending his 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to, he went first to Brock, who gave him a  
half-smile before dying. He then tried to shake awake Steinmetz, 
only to have him die in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of my poor judgment, my two buddies were gone,'' a  
soft-spoken Watts said. ``When you think about it, I should've been 
the first one to go. Getting in that car that night was a 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his friends dead, Watts said he wanted to die as well and  
even tried holding his breath in the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hospital, his blood alcohol content tested 1 1/2 times the  
legal limit. He had a 12-inch gash on his right arm that wound up 
requiring surgery several times. He also had cuts on his left 
shoulder and back that required stitches and staples in addition to 
injured ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts had been in trouble before while drinking.  
</P>
<P>
	He shot then-teammate Omar Smith in the buttocks as they handled  
a rifle outside the house they shared in 1997, and had a blood 
alcohol level of 0.129 percent two hours after the shooting. He was 
charged with unlawful discharge of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said even his friends on the offensive line pointed out  
that he should have been the first person killed. But he told the 
audience that he feels he is now living three lives -- his own and 
for his dead friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rough, but it's nowhere near as rough as it is on the  
families,'' he said.

	NATO: Yugoslavia Defense Silent  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Western officials said today that  
Yugoslavia's air defense system, which had caused concern before 
the NATO air attacks, have hardly been used. Air Commodore David 
Wilby of the British Royal Air Force said only one launch of a 
surface-to-air missile has been spotted and it wasn't successful. 
Wilby also confirmed that on the first night of the NATO air 
strikes, three Yugoslav MiG aircraft were shot down -- one over 
Kosovo, the other two over central Serbia.

	NATO Protests Continue in Macedonia  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Riot squads pushed back demonstrators  
at the American Embassy today, a day after the mission was attacked 
with gasoline bombs and rocks. Police surrounded the compound, 
where U.S. troops strung up concertina wire and set up defensive 
positions. Sources said officials were considering banning all 
anti-NATO demonstrations. Macedonians have been showing increasing 
displeasure at the more than 10,000 NATO troops sent here to 
implement a peace agreement on Kosovo. Macedonian nationalists and 
members of the Serb minority in the former Yugoslav republic are 
sympathetic to Yugoslavia. 

</P>

	Russia Avoids Kosovo Confrontation  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin gathered his ministers  
today to discuss the Kosovo crisis, but Russia has refrained from 
directly confronting the West to help its ally Yugoslavia. Some 
Russian leaders have hinted that Russia could provide Yugoslavia 
with weapons, flouting an arms embargo. But the military's Chief of 
General Staff Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin said Russia could help 
Yugoslavia without using force. A military source told the Interfax 
news agency that Russia could provide Moscow's satellite 
intelligence.

out today at Islamic extremists in neighboring Algeria. ``We must 
speak up for the women and people of Algeria, who are victims of 
the war that is civil in name only,'' she said. In seven years of 
violence by Islamic radicals in Algeria, thousands of women have 
been raped, forced into slavery and killed in the name of religion, 
Mrs. Clinton said. She also decried violence against women in 
Afghanistan, where, she said, women and girls are being 
``brutalized by the Taliban once again.''

murder charges in the injection death of a Lou Gehrig's disease 
patient. Further legal matters in the trial apparently would be 
handled by attorney David Gorosh, who had been acting as

enforcement source said yesterday the victim was female. The body 
was found just outside the park, where Carole Sund, 42, her

Sierra Village, where the burned bodies of two victims were found 
in the trunk of their rental car. One was identified as Mrs.

	EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- A public relations firm has taken Casual  
Fridays to the other extreme -- its employees wear tuxedos and 
evening gowns for Formal Fridays. Alison Pollak, director of media 
at the Pollak Agency, came up with the idea. Tired of having to 
dress up for client meetings while others wore jeans, she suggested 
that all 10 employees try dressing to the hilt one Friday. That one 
Friday led to another, and another. Some clients have started 
joining in, and the firm even landed an account from someone who

<HEADLINE> McDougal Forgets Whitewater Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Under questioning by prosecutors, Susan  
McDougal is claiming ignorance or memory lapse about the land deals 
that are central to Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeatedly stating ``I don't recall'' and ``I don't remember,''  
Mrs. McDougal testified in her criminal trial that she had 
forgotten what little she knew in the 1980s about the Whitewater 
real estate dealings involving her husband, James McDougal, 
President Clinton and his wife, and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Her trial recessed Thursday afternoon for the weekend when the  
prosecution had technical difficulties with a video machine while 
showing the jury a tape of an ABC television interview of Mrs. 
McDougal years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense may call two more witnesses next week before  
resting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was indicted on two counts of criminal contempt  
and a count of obstruction of justice for refusing to answer 
federal grand jury questions in the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Before running into technical problems, prosecutors were able to  
show a few minutes of the interview. In one outtake, Mrs. McDougal, 
who had been convicted and sentenced in the Whitewater 
investigation before the interview, was asked what the one thing 
she wanted to say after four years of silence in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joking manner, she said ``that I hate'' the prosecutors  
``and that I want them dead and their children dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has maintained she did not trust Starr and refused  
to answer the grand jury questions because she feared the 
independent counsel would twist her words to implicate the Clintons 
or charge her with perjury if she did not say what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	During two days of questioning by prosecutor Mark Barrett, Mrs.  
McDougal said more than 40 times that she did not recall various 
business deals. She said her former husband, who died in federal 
prison last year, handled most of the financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't someone who studied business ... but generally I  
agreed with Jim,'' she told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was confronted with information she provided to  
accountants in 1986 about McDougal's failed savings and loan. She 
maintained that she knew little about the financial deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to Jim'' and passing along what he said to the  
accountants, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ex-husband had suffered a stroke after federal regulators  
removed him from the S&AMP;L, Madison Guaranty. Accountants were trying 
to track the losses to the institution caused by the McDougals' 
numerous real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal also testified that she didn't remember dealing  
personally with former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker on a proposed 
shopping center, even though the accountants' written summary of 
her 1986 interview said she dealt with Tucker on the project, which 
was never built. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed shopping center was an important part of the 1996  
fraud case against the McDougals and Tucker, each of whom was 
convicted of felonies.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Refinery Explodes in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of people complaining of  
breathing problems flooded into hospitals after an explosion at a 
Chevron oil refinery spewed black smoke over the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast Thursday at the 97-year-old refinery on the edge of  
San Francisco Bay prompted Richmond officials to sound the city's 
sirens, warning residents to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 600 people went to three area hospitals. Some said  
they were nauseous and had a metallic taste in their mouths or 
burning sensation in their throats. Three firefighters were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that obviously is of concern to Chevron.  
We're taking this very seriously,'' said company spokeswoman Dawn 
Soper. ``We'll work hard to ensure anything like this is prevented 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Stanton of the Richmond Fire Department said the smoke  
was considered a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron spokesman Terry Swartz said there were toxins in the  
smoke, but he downplayed the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the question is, is there a health hazard to our employees  
or the community, I don't believe there is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents complained the explosion was just the latest  
health risk from Chevron and other nearby refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast occurred just a month after a fireball engulfed five  
workers at the Tosco Avon refinery in Martinez on Feb. 23, killing 
four and leaving one critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically they need to shut it down or something because the  
majority of these babies are being born with asthma,'' said Angela 
Brawley, who lives near the Chevron refinery. 
</P>
<P>
	The thick, black smoke was visible across the bay in San  
Francisco and Marin County. Firefighters had contained the blaze 
about 5 1/2 hours after it began, though they expected to continue 
fighting hot spots, said Soper. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit where the explosion occurred -- a processing and  
manufacturing site for gasoline and jet fuel -- was shut down 
indefinitely for investigation.

<HEADLINE> Charges Recommended in Van Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- At the flash of a police car's  
headlights, Jeremy Holmes apparently decided he had to get out from 
behind the wheel of the speeding van he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, whose driving privileges had been revoked in Wisconsin  
because of a bad traffic record, tried to switch seats with a 
passenger, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crowded van spun out of control and flipped over twice  
Thursday, ejecting 12 of the 14 passengers and leaving six dead on 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bodies were scattered in all directions on the road,''  
said police officer John Conger, whose patrol car Holmes had 
spotted moments before the crash. ``I've never seen anything like 
this before and I trust that I'll never see something like it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conger said he had clocked the van at 80 mph on Interstate 90  
about 70 miles southwest of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight others in the van were injured, six critically. No one  
wore seat belts, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, of Clinton, Iowa, was confused but admitted he had been  
driving the van, Conger said. He was treated and in police custody 
Thursday night, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have recommended that prosecutors charge Holmes, 20, with  
six counts of negligent vehicular homicide and six counts of 
causing great bodily harm, said Sgt. Brad Altman of the Wisconsin 
State Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger that Holmes had tried to switch places with was  
among those killed, Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims, all between 15 and 25, had been heading to a  
Janesville motel that had been their home base for two weeks for 
sales trips, sheriff's Cmdr. Thomas Gehl said. Other members 
arrived at the motel earlier in another van. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hurt and we're scared and we're freaking out,'' said  
one, refusing to give her name. ``I can't believe this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The young people were selling magazines for an organization  
called Yes, police said. A spokesman for Subscriptions Plus Inc. of 
Bethany, Okla., said the company processes orders sold by Yes 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	State labor officials were investigating whether child labor  
laws were violated, said Mike Goetzman, a spokesman for the state 
Department of Transportation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Accuse China on Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The human rights situation in China has  
``deteriorated sharply,'' the State Department said today, and the 
United States will seek a resolution to censure China at a meeting 
of the U.N. agency that monitors rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past three months, Chinese authorities ``have initiated  
a crackdown against organized political opposition, dozens of 
political activists have been detained for peaceful political 
activities, and three leaders of the China Democracy Party have 
been given harsh sentences in closed trials that clearly violated 
due process,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning said his government firmly  
opposes the U.S. action, which he described as interference in 
China's domestic affairs. He said the proper forum for a discussion 
of such issues is the U.S.-China human rights dialogue, which 
resumed in January after a three-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu said the United States has tried to censure China seven times  
at U.N. Human Rights Commission meetings in Geneva, and each time 
the effort failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they try again this year, they will fail again,'' he said.  
``We request the U.S. government to reconsider and change this 
wrong decision.'' This year's commission meeting opened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. action further aggravates a relationship already  
burdened by disagreements over trade, Taiwan and U.S. plans to 
develop a missile defense system. Among other irritants are 
allegations of Chinese spying at the weapons development site at 
Los Alamos, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	On the positive side, the White House announced that Chinese  
Premier Zhu Rongji will come to the United States April 6-14 on an 
official visit. The announcement had been widely expected. The 
administration hopes to use that visit to reach final agreement on 
China's quest for membership in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, asking not to be identified, said  
China will attempt to block the U.S. effort in the rights 
commission by introducing a ``no-action'' resolution that, if 
approved, would forbid the panel from considering the U.S. 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the official, Chinese ``no-action'' resolutions  
have succeeded twice previously. On a third occasion, the vote 
ended in a tie, meaning that the U.S. resolution was placed on the 
agenda. The proposal nonetheless ended in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton decided against seeking a China resolution at  
the 1998 commission meeting, citing progress in the rights 
situation in China. It was the first time since China's crackdown 
on pro-democracy activists at Tiananmen Square in 1989 that the 
United States did not seek a China resolution. The House and the 
Senate took strong exception to the decision in lopsided votes a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's decision drew strong expressions of support from  
House Relations Committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and 
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, long an outspoken critic of China's rights 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin recalled that the latest annual State Department report on  
human rights conditions worldwide, issued last month, noted that 
Chinese authorities ``tightened regulations on publishers and 
newspapers, increased monitoring of the Internet, continued to 
restrict religious practice and intensified controls over Tibet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These developments are a source of deep concern to the United  
States. They constitute a reversal of the comparatively more 
tolerant attitude toward political expression and association which 
Chinese authorities had begun to exhibit,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said China has accepted international human rights  
obligations by signing the international covenant on civil and 
political rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``In its dialogues with the United States, the European Union  
and others,'' Rubin said, ``China has stated its intention to 
fulfill its obligation under these conventions and other 
instruments of international human rights law.''

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Racing Driver Finishes 2nd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) -- O.J. Waddell's shoulders were a  
little sore, his adrenaline running a little high, after coming in 
second in a $25,000 harness racing event at Los Alamitos Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
	A second place finish was good enough, said Waddell, who is  
paralyzed from the waist down and must be strapped into the sulky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel kind of winded from the excitement,'' he said after the  
race, adding, ``I feel a little bit sore on my shoulders from the 
horse pulling but other than that I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell, driving Hutt Girl, finished 3 3/4 lengths behind  
Canterbury Tower in the mile race for fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Waddell was at a party 18 years ago when a fight  
broke out. He wasn't involved in the scuffle but was shot in the 
back and left paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	For the race, his legs were strapped into the sulky, which  
prompted some concern from other drivers who say an accident on the 
track could put other drivers and horses in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I showed today that I do belong,'' Waddell said.  
``That was one of the most important things I wanted to do 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell began training horses after his accident, learning the  
trade from this father. That work exposed him to harness racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell was scheduled to race today, driving Laagin in an  
elimination heat in the $200,000 Arnold Pacing Series.

<HEADLINE> Grandchildren Remember DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio's four great-grandchildren  
accepted lilies from patients at the children's hospital bearing 
the Yankee Clipper's name on Friday, then told a memorial service 
about the man they knew simply as ``Big Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us remember him as a hero, as a baseball legend,''  
Vanassa Hamra said as she took turns reading their eulogy with her 
sister Valerie and cousins Kendahl and Mitchell Stein. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendahl Stein, 11, followed by saying: ``We also looked up to  
him, but not as a legend. We looked up to him as our 
great-grandfather.'' She later said one of their favorite memories 
is of DiMaggio feeding turkey to their cats at Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 people, including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a  
handful of former players, crammed into the small auditorium at Joe 
DiMaggio Children's Hospital to remember the Hall of Famer. 
DiMaggio died March 8 after a lengthy bout with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Yankee Hall of Famers Phil Rizzuto and Reggie Jackson  
also offered eulogies. Also in attendance were former Yankees Clyde 
King, Phil Linz, Tom Tresh and Stan Bahnsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dom DiMaggio, Joe's brother, sat in the back of the audience and  
did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great sense of pride,'' said Jackson, who got to know  
DiMaggio while winning two World Series with the Yankees in the 
late 1970s. ``He made any date special. He made the time that you'd 
spend with him unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzuto, who said DiMaggio took him under his wing when he came  
up in 1941, had the audience chuckling when he said he used to love 
watching the Yankee Clipper shave. 
</P>
<P>
	``He shaved with such distinction. It was beautiful to watch.  
Now it might be a little flaky to say that,'' Rizzuto said as 
laughter rang through the auditorium. ``But he was perfect in 
everything he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A portrait of a smiling DiMaggio in a blue sport coat and blue  
print tie stood in front of the lectern, with five lily displays 
fronting the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he was here right now, he would say, `Gosh, folks, this  
wasn't necessary,''' Linz said following the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the auditorium was illuminated by candlelight as the  
hospital's young patients offered their thanks to the man who 
dropped by to read them stories and boost their spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clutching a lily in one hand and a hospital worker in the other,  
dozens of children lined up down the center aisle to present the 
flowers to the great-grandchildren. The flowers then were placed in 
a vase beside DiMaggio's portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great humanitarian with a very special place in his  
heart for children,'' said Frank Sacco, the hospital's chief 
executive officer, noting that DiMaggio's only demand in return for 
lending his name to the facility was that no child be turned away 
because of a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it with the same stature, grace and dignity as he did  
in baseball a half-century earlier,'' Sacco said. ``He did 
everything we asked of him, yet he remained humble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another memorial service for DiMaggio will be held April 23 at  
St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. Cardinal John O'Connor is 
expected to officiate at that service. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Yankees Roger Maris and Billy Martin also received  
similar tributes at St. Patrick's following their deaths.

<HEADLINE> Krzyzewski Has Final 4 Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- It's natural to assume Duke has  
Final Four experience and won't be fazed by all the hoopla. After 
all, coach Mike Krzyzewski has been to eight of them since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But no player on this powerful Duke team has ever been to the  
Final Four. Same goes for Michigan State, Ohio State and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any nervousness that we may feel, we know the team we're  
playing against is also experiencing it,'' Duke's Shane Battier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (36-1) arrived at the Don CeSar resort on St.  
Petersburg Beach on Thursday afternoon, ready to take on the 
Spartans in the national semifinals Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took it as a regular road trip,'' said Battier, who emerged  
from the team bus with a camcorder while slapping a handful of fans 
high-fives. ``But as soon as we landed it was a pretty electric 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski received the largest hand from about 75 fans, and  
players milled around the hotel lobby signing basketballs and caps. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus ride along Interstate 275 took Duke past Tropicana  
Field, the site of this year's Final Four and the scene of a 
17-point collapse last season against Kentucky in the South 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drove right past it,'' Battier said. ``I got out my  
camcorder and on first feature film I say, `This was the spot we 
didn't take care of business last year but the good Lord has put us 
in a position this year where we can redeem ourselves.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski laughed when told Duke's hotel has housed many famous  
guests, including former Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's a great, great place,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I'm  
sure when I come back sometime with my wife I'll try to figure out 
who was here before me, but right now I'm trying to figure out how 
to stop Mateen Cleaves on a fastbreak more so than who stayed in 
room 602.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the best NCAA tournament record among active coaches,  
Krzyzewski has plenty of insights for his team about the Final Four 
and the experiences surrounding one of the nation's biggest 
sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think until you get into this for about a day, when  
you are around all the stuff, you really get a true feeling of 
it,'' Krzyzewski said of the hoopla. ``Then, when you come out on 
the floor Saturday, that's one of the best days in sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has received enormous hype all season, being billed as one  
of the all-time great teams. That should help them cope with a 
hectic weekend filled with media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them just before we go into something what they going  
to experience for the next 12 to 24 hours,'' Krzyzewski said of his 
players. ``You tell them the truth and they usually handle it the 
right way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Battier, who grew up in Michigan, being in Florida is fun  
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see too much sand growing up, so it's pretty cool to  
come and see girls in bikinis and see the sand,'' Battier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Could that be a distraction?  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things this team has learned to deal with is  
putting distractions behind us and focusing on basketball,'' 
Battier said. ``We'll see the sun (Thursday) but after that we're 
going to be in the hotel watching film, and eating and sleeping 
basketball.''

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Bring Back Robinson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- James Robinson is back in Minnesota.  
</P>
<P>
	Badly in need of outside shooting help, the Timberwolves signed  
the guard to a 10-day contract Friday. Robinson, whose nickname is 
``Hollywood,'' played for the Wolves during the 1996-97 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who came to Minnesota the first time as part of a  
trade for Isaiah Rider, was cut by the Los Angeles Clippers last 
week. He holds Wolves records for points in a quarter (23) and 
3-pointers made in a quarter (six) and a half (six). He set all 
three marks at Cleveland on Dec. 30, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves made room for Robinson on the roster by waiving  
forward Brian Evans, who was acquired from New Jersey in this 
month's Stephon Marbury trade.

<HEADLINE> Speaker Hastert Chats Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert misses being able  
to spend time around young people now that his new post keeps him 
away from home a lot more. So Friday, the former high-school 
government teacher and coach connected with local students via the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids from the Illinois Republican's own alma mater, Oswego High  
School, even came back from their just-started spring break for the 
chance to have a live online chat with such a powerful alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
	``To talk with someone at that high a level of government on a  
Friday morning -- life is good!'' said Oswego Principal Ross 
Truemper. About a dozen seniors in advanced government class 
participated from the school about 60 miles west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussion -- prompted by mostly prearranged questions --  
covered some of the hottest topics facing Washington these days: 
Kosovo, tax cuts, Congress' post-impeachment relationship with 
President Clinton, arts funding, and Hastert's predecessor, former 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven schools, all in Hastert's district of Chicago suburbs  
and far-flung farmland, posed their questions in turn. At times, 
the hourlong discussion got ahead of itself as the next school sent 
a query before Hastert had finished his answer to the last one. And 
one out-of-turn school found itself chastened by another with a 
``point of order'' complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by DeKalb High School about the Kosovo situation, Hastert  
said he supports American servicemen involved in the NATO mission 
but wishes Clinton had explained how it would end, saying, ``Nobody 
knows for sure if this will be successful or when it will end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged that the $15 billion in tax cuts promised  
in just-passed Republican-written budgets may not materialize. ``If 
there are funds left over, they may be distributed through tax 
cuts,'' Hastert wrote West Chicago Community High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert dodged a question from Dixon High School -- located in  
the Illinois prairie town where Ronald Reagan grew up -- on whether 
he thinks parents of children in private schools should get tax 
credits. Instead, he expressed support for public schools and for 
sending federal education dollars to states and local districts so 
they can decide how to spend them. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker pledged to work with Clinton to ``get things done.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hastert defended the combative tenor of Gingrich's reign, while  
promising a shift under his watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though those years were partisan, we accomplished a great  
deal for the American people,'' he said. ``I have great respect for 
Newt but I will run the House differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the session began, Hastert said he is still struggling to  
get comfortable with the Web, but he allowed that he has two 
favorite Web sites: that of country singer Johnny Cash and, for the 
former championship-winning high school wrestling coach in him, one 
with wrestling scores and updates.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Firm Lures Major Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- J. Patrick Barrett has made millions. He's  
courted by governors and senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Zaccanelli moved from Syracuse to Texas 20 years ago with  
$300 in his pocket. Today, he helps oversee the Perot financial 
empire as one of Ross Jr.'s top lieutenants. He owns part of the 
NBA's Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither man is easily impressed. Nor are they enticed by small  
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Telergy Inc., a 3-year-old, privately held  
telecommunications company, has managed to persuade both men to 
back its plan to become a giant in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw great potential here, but even I admit I've been mildly  
surprised,'' said Barrett, a past chairman of the Avis car rental 
company and former New York State Republican Party head who now 
serves as Telergy's president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet access, data transfer, videocommunications, intranet  
service, cable television, are all merging into one service ... and 
someday it will all be delivered through Telergy's network,'' said 
Zaccanelli, who is on the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Telergy is one of a new generation of fast-growing  
telecommunications companies looking to profit from the increasing 
need for network capacity, or bandwidth, said Paul Robinson, a vice 
president at Eastern Management Group, a New Jersey-based 
telecommunications consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies sell space, or transmission capacity, on  
fiber-optic networks to other phone carriers. Telergy also resells 
local and long-distance service to about 3,500 business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a high-risk business because of the cost of building the  
networks. Only the strongest, best-managed companies will survive, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telergy founder Brian Kelly said it would still be a while  
before Telergy actually makes money. Since 1995, it has spent $200 
million building a fiber-optic network stretching from Montreal to 
New York City, the busiest communications corridor in the country. 
Eventually, the network will include the Cleveland and Washington, 
D.C. areas. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time it is finished, Telergy's network will have cost at  
least $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company is off to a good start, having struck  
multimillion dollar service deals with Bell Canada and Bell 
Atlantic Corp. It has also brokered novel right-of-way deals with 
three major utilities that give it access to 10 million homes and 
businesses in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Telergy's roots can be traced back to a part-time job. Kelly and  
his brothers, twin Kevin, and younger sibling, William, started a 
truck-washing business after the twins graduated from LeMoyne 
College in Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	To make ends meet, Brian began selling telephone equipment  
part-time. That experience led him to launch another small business 
selling disposable telephones to hospitals for patient use. That 
venture gave the Kellys a better idea, and in 1991 they started 
Telecommunications Management Systems to manage phone service for 
hospital patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, TMS serves more than 50 hospitals throughout the  
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of doing business, TMS obtained a certificate to  
resell long-distance to commercial customers. The Kellys envisioned 
something grander and formed KCI Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kelly decided quickly that to be a major player in the  
telecommunications business, he had to get his own high-capacity 
fiber optic network going. So he approached Niagara Mohawk and made 
a deal to use the utility's right-of-way across upstate New York as 
the backbone of the system. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, New York's utilities were gearing up for  
deregulation and eyeing new ventures, with an especially keen eye 
on telecommunications. Thus, Telergy was born, and it soon had 
similar deals with New York State Gas &AMP; Electric and Consolidated 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Telergy's utility deals put it in a good position in  
New York, its plan is not unique, said Milton Mueller, a 
telecommunications expert at Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past three years, utilities across the nation have  
begun selling or developing their rights of way to build local 
telecommunications networks, Mueller said. MFS Network 
Technologies, a subsidiary of MCI WorldCom, is building a fiber 
network along 542 miles of New York State Thruway right-of-way, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telergy's network-building strategy appears to be working,  
Mueller said, and with help from Barrett and Zaccanelli, Brian 
Kelly's vision may become a reality.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Tried for Same-Sex Weddings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- Some say he is a disobedient  
rule-breaker, plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Others testifying at the church trial of the Rev. Gregory Dell  
say he was simply trying to serve his parishioners when he presided 
over the ``holy union'' of two Chicago men last September, a month 
after United Methodist leaders banned same-sex ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is the first test of the ban, which was prompted by the  
1998 trial of another United Methodist Church minister who 
performed a same-sex union in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, 53, was expected to testify today.  
</P>
<P>
	During opening statements at a suburban Chicago church Thursday,  
prosecutors said Dell has made ``a mockery of church law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't just break the law because you disagree with it,''  
the Rev. Stephen Williams told a jury of 13 pastors from northern 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, who has pleaded innocent to the charge of disobedience,  
does not deny he disregarded the same-sex union ban that he admits 
is binding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Larry Pickens, Dell's defense counsel, told jurors that  
the church has a long-standing history of ministers -- including 
founder John Wesley -- who have broken church law in an effort to 
better serve their parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, my brothers and sisters, is a case about what we do when  
a pastoral need and a church law conflict,'' Pickens said, noting 
that a third of Dell's congregation at Broadway United Methodist 
Church in Chicago are gay or lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	A verdict was expected no later than Saturday. If found guilty,  
Dell's 30-year career as a pastor in the Methodist church could 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. It's invigorating. It's draining,'' said Keith  
Eccarius, one of the men who exchanged vows before Dell. ``It's 
probably the most important issue our church has to deal with at 
this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who support the ban agreed on the issue's importance.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are already people who've left the church or are  
planning to because of the advertisement of this trial,'' said the 
Rev. Kent Svendsen, a Methodist pastor from rural Ashton and a 
leader in the church's ``confessing movement,'' which believes gay 
men and lesbians can be converted to heterosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not to exclude or attack people who are  
different, but to help them heal,'' Svendsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell attended Duke University's Divinity School with another  
Methodist minister, the Rev. Jimmy Creech. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Creech's 1998 trial over a same-sex union at his former  
Nebraska church that prompted Methodist leaders to codify a 
``social principle'' that had only advised against blessing 
same-sex unions. Creech, who is attending the trial, was not 
defrocked but is on leave from the church.

</P>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Henry V. Graham, the National Guard  
general in 1963 who told Gov. George C. Wallace that he would have 
to step aside when Wallace made his famous ``stand in the 
schoolhouse door'' in support of segregation, died Sunday at 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, a real estate dealer in Birmingham, suffered from  
Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the showdown with Wallace at the University of Alabama,  
Graham played several other key roles in the civil rights movement 
in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Graham and the National Guard helped calm a white mob  
and avert violence when a group of Freedom Riders arrived at the 
Montgomery bus station. 
</P>
<P>
	He also commanded the National Guardsmen who escorted  
voting-rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, following 
the ``Bloody Sunday'' confrontation.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken Sr., who spent 36 years in the  
Baltimore Orioles' baseball organization as a scout, coach and 
manager, and the father of future Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. and 
Bill Ripken, who also played with Baltimore, died Thursday of lung 
cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken taught Cal and Bill about baseball while serving as a  
minor league manager. He won 964 games in the minors and was 68-101 
as manager of the Orioles in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Ripken Sr. became the first father ever to manage two  
sons simultaneously in the majors. Cal Jr. was in the middle of a 
major league record consecutive games streak that would extend to 
2,632 games. Bill was the Orioles' second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. was fired after the Orioles opened the 1988 season  
with six straight losses in what would ultimately be a record 
21-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually returned to his old role as third-base coach and  
maintained the position through the end of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. began his career with the Orioles as a catcher with  
the team's Phoenix affiliate in 1957. He ended his playing career 
in 1964 having never reached the major leagues.

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Kathryn Schoonover, who was accused of  
mailing cyanide packets disguised as nutritional supplements to 
people around the country last summer, died Thursday at a federal 
medical facility in Texas. She was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schoonover had been found to be terminally ill with cancer  
after her arrest in California and was sent to the medical center 
on Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schoonover case sent a scare across the nation last August  
when she was arrested outside the post office in Marina del Rey, 
where she had allegedly stuffed cyanide packets attached to health 
supplement brochures into 100 envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no known deaths from cyanide mailings.

</P>
<P>
	MANATEE, Fla. (AP) -- Birdie Tebbetts, who spent 56 years in  
major league baseball as player, manager and scout, died Wednesday 
of congestive heart failure. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Tebbetts, a four-time All Star, was a catcher from 1936-52 with  
the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the Tigers' 1940 team that made it to the  
World Series with a pitching staff that included Schoolboy Rowe, 
Bobo Newsom and Dizzy Trout, and a batting order led by Hank 
Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1953-1965, he managed the Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Braves  
and Cleveland. A heart attack ended his active days in 1965, but in 
1968 he started a scouting career that lasted through 1994.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO forces have seriously damaged  
Yugoslavia's military, but Serb forces including paramilitary 
``ethnic cleansing'' bands remain in Kosovo and continue to kill 
and persecute ethnic Albanians, top U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken down a substantial proportion'' of Yugoslavia's  
air defenses and command and control assets, said U.S. Army Gen. 
Wesley Clark, supreme NATO military commander. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clark, speaking on NBC's ``Today'' show, said Yugoslavia  
``still has forces out in the field and, to be candid, of even more 
concern are the so-called paramilitary forces, including gangs of 
hardened criminals which have in the past and are apparently now 
being employed in ethnic cleansing operations against the Kosovar 
Albanian population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and allied forces have suffered no losses and encountered  
little resistance during two days of air attacks, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Serb military activity in Kosovo was intensifying despite  
the NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, speaking from his headquarters in Brussels, said he had  
fully expected that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would 
step up aggression against ethnic Albanians, whose plight sparked 
the NATO action this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was entirely predictable at this stage,'' Clark said.  
</P>
<P>
	A third day of airstrikes would begin later today, Clark said,  
focused on further reducing Yugoslavia's formidable air defenses, 
which have, as yet, been withheld from the battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also on NBC, insisted the  
19-member allied coalition against Yugoslavia remains united behind 
the air campaign -- despite pressure from Italy to return to 
negotiations -- and that Russia is more concerned with Serb 
intransigence than with the key U.S. role in a campaign against one 
of Moscow's traditional allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright expressed concern about possible continued violence  
against U.S. embassies as a result of the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned, obviously, about the security of our  
embassy personnel all over the world and we are taking all 
necessary precautions,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a special satellite message beamed early today to the people  
of Serbia and Yugoslavia, President Clinton blamed the attacks on 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now he's forcing your sons to keep fighting a senseless  
conflict that you did not ask for and that he could have 
prevented,'' Clinton said in the taped message. 
</P>
<P>
	The nations of NATO, he said, tried to avert the conflict  
``through every means we knew to be available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' program, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen, said the ``targets that we were after we 
successfully hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen wouldn't reveal the targets. But defense officials said  
they included anti-missile batteries, command, control and 
communications sites, ammunition and fuel dumps, bases, barracks 
and other military structures across Yugoslavia -- from near the 
capital of Belgrade to the Kosovo capital of Pristina to 
Montenegro, which with the state of Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting fuel dumps would slow Yugoslavia's tank corps, one  
official said, adding that NATO wouldn't strike tanks and troops 
directly until the U.S.-led alliance reached a much stronger attack 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not there yet,'' said the official, speaking on  
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO missiles and bombs hit more than 40 targets in the first  
night of bombing. Allied planes also shot down at least three MiG 
jet fighters and destroyed more on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night, Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from Navy  
ships in the Adriatic and B-2s led the NATO attack. B-52 bombers, 
which took the lead Wednesday night, didn't fly on the second day 
to launch cruise missiles. Instead, jet fighters such as F-15s and 
F-16s, equipped with precision-guided munitions, dominated the air 
campaign, a defense official said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 NATO aircraft are deployed for the airstrikes, about  
half American. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said crippling Milosevic's military could be achieved  
without ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, laid  
out the now familiar choices for Milosevic: Make peace by agreeing 
to self rule for the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and a 28,000-member 
NATO peacekeeping force or face NATO's growing wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said there was no indication Milosevic was ready to  
talk peace. She said ``diplomatic channels remain open,'' though 
the government in Belgrade announced Thursday it was cutting 
diplomatic ties with the United States, Britain, France and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group also was set to depart  
today from Norfolk, Va., toward the Mediterranean Sea en route to 
the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon was considering using some of the 
Navy ships to support the NATO campaign. The battle group included 
an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, a destroyer, a frigate and an 
attack submarine. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, lawmakers introduced two bills aimed at  
bringing down the Milosevic government and providing weapons to 
ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Shepard Slaying Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Like the gay college student he is accused  
of killing, Russell Henderson is a slightly built young man who was 
raised on the dusty high plains of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 10 months apart in age, Henderson and Matthew Shepard wound  
up in the same city, where they frequented some of the same 
nightspots and even had mutual acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	But when their paths crossed back in October, they were heading  
in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard was educated in Europe and  
had big plans for the future, Henderson, at 5-feet-7, 138 pounds, 
was a high school dropout who held unskilled jobs. He had had minor 
scuffles with the law, but no history of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, his buddy Aaron McKinney and Shepard met in a college  
bar last fall. Eighteen hours later, Shepard was found near death, 
tied to a fence, bloodied by a pistol-whipping. Henderson was 
jailed after trying to outrun a police officer and was soon named a 
suspect in Shepard's death. McKinney was arrested soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection continued Friday in Henderson's trial on charges  
of murdering Shepard. McKinney is scheduled to stand trial on 
identical charges in August. Both men could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege Henderson and McKinney, both 21, pretended to be  
homosexuals, lured Shepard out of the Fireside Lounge and took him 
to a remote area east of Laramie and attacked him. They believe 
Henderson and McKinney intended to rob Shepard, but also targeted 
him in part because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's girlfriend is awaiting sentencing after pleading  
guilty Dec. 23 to accessory after the fact to murder. McKinney's 
girlfriend goes on trial in May on an accessory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preview of his defense strategy, attorney Wyatt Skaggs told  
prospective jurors this week that Henderson witnessed the beating 
but did not participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Sept. 24, 1977, Henderson was raised by his mother, Cindy  
Dixon, who often left him in the care of his grandparents and 
aunts. 
</P>
<P>
	Little is known about Henderson's father, and his mother died of  
exposure in January on a two-lane road north of Laramie, several 
hours after she left a bar. Police said it may have been an 
accidental death. 
</P>
<P>
	At school, Henderson blended in with the crowd, just another  
dark-haired, polite young man. One of his childhood loves was 
scouting. He earned 21 merit badges to become an Eagle Scout. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson dropped out of high school and moved out of his  
grandmother's home. He piled up a series of petty offenses, mostly 
traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, Henderson took a night job at Taco Bell, said Tammy  
Shields, his manager at the time. ``He was always on time and, if 
he wasn't he would always call and let us know,'' she said. ``He 
just didn't say much. He went and did everything you told him to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Henderson and McKinney were hired by a roofing  
company, working long hours, said Doc O'Connor, who also owns Doc's 
Western Village apartments and gave McKinney a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russ was a very mellow, mild man,'' O'Connor said. ``He didn't  
talk that much but was very polite and well-mannered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's life took a bad turn shortly after midnight on Oct.  
7 when police responding to a vandalism call spotted Henderson and 
McKinney as they got out of a black pickup and crouched down. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Clint Waters turned on the patrol car's lights and the  
two men bolted in different directions. Waters tackled Henderson a 
half-block away when the young man was by slowed by hedges in a 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Waters found a bloody .357 Magnum in the back of the  
pickup and asked Henderson if it had been fired. According to 
police, Henderson laughed and said, ``I guarantee you won't find 
anyone with a bullet in them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the police eventually found was a badly beaten Shepard, who  
died five days later.

<HEADLINE> First Union Helps Minority Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- First Union is putting $5 million into a fund  
that invests in minority-owned businesses, joining a partnership of 
major corporations started by Earl Graves, the founder of Black 
Enterprise magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund, Black Enterprise/Greenwich Street Corporate Growth  
Partners, recently received $86 million in commitments from other 
companies such as J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, IBM, Bell Atlantic and 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves once served as chairman and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola  
of Washington, D.C., the nation's largest minority-owned Pepsi 
bottler. He is also a board member at numerous companies, including 
Aetna Life and Casualty Co.; AMR Corp., the parent of American 
Airlines; DaimlerChrysler Corp.; and Federated Department Stores. 
</P>
<P>
	His magazine, which now has a circulation of 300,000, was

<HEADLINE> F-16 Crash Forces Flight Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Air Force suspended all F-16 fighter  
flights at Luke Air Force Base -- its largest training area for the 
jets -- after one of the planes crashed in the desert Friday. It was 
the fifth such accident at Luke since October. 
</P>
<P>
	Student pilot Capt. Michael G. Rider, 27, ejected safely before  
the single-seat jet slammed into the desert about 22 miles 
southwest of the training base near Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 200 F-16s -- worth about $20 million apiece -- will  
be inspected before they are cleared to fly again, Gen. John Barry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider had been airborne for 20 minutes when he developed engine  
problems and turned back toward Luke. Witnesses said the plane was 
on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a big ball of fire going across, then it hit the  
ground,'' said Willie Falcido, a maintenance worker who saw the 
crash from the roof of a school. 
</P>
<P>
	The last three F-16 crashes were also engine-related.  
</P>
<P>
	Pilots fly more than 100,000 sorties a year out of Luke.

<HEADLINE> CBS Plans TV Movie on Bills' Flutie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A made-for-TV movie is in the works on the  
life of Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's agent and CBS confirmed that an agreement had been made  
to develop a movie based on Flutie's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We signed with a film production company, who optioned it to a  
network,'' Jack Mula, Flutie's Boston-based agent told The Buffalo 
News. ``Some things are settled, and some things still have to be 
worked out. There will be a big announcement soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted an unidentified source at CBS Entertainment  
as saying the project is ``in development.'' Not all movies in 
development make it on the air, but Mula said this one would. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on who might play the 5-foot-9 quarterback who  
was the Heisman Trophy winner in 1984 after completing a ``Hail 
Mary'' touchdown pass to give Boston College a 47-45 victory over 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie returned to the NFL last season after eight years in the  
CFL, and led the Bills into the playoffs. Flutie signed a contract 
extension last week worth $22 million over four years.

<HEADLINE> NASD Seeks Day-Trading Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the risky practice of day trading gaining  
popularity among Main Street investors, regulators have been 
dismayed by stories of people putting up their student loan money, 
mortgages or retirement savings to finance it. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock Market is  
considering a proposal requiring electronic day-trading firms to 
screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers' board of  
governors voted at a meeting in New York City on Thursday to seek 
comment on the proposal from its member brokerage firms and the 
public. The NASD announced the move in Washington after the 
closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Zarb, NASD's chairman and chief executive officer, said in  
a statement that the action ``affirms our continuing efforts to 
ensure that investors are better protected and better informed 
about the risks involved before engaging in high-risk investment 
activities like day trading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an important step toward making individuals aware of the  
potential risks involved in day trading,'' Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading firms sell training courses and special software  
programs to ordinary investors who want to try the lightning-speed 
practice of day trading, exploiting small price movements in stocks 
to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the enforcement director of the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission said the agency is examining the advertisements 
of day-trading firms to see if they make unrealistic promises to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Enforcement director Richard Walker also said the market  
watchdog agency is inspecting day-trading firms in a joint effort 
with the NASD. There are roughly 100 such firms nationwide, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC would ultimately have to approve the requirements for  
day-trading firms proposed by the NASD. SEC spokesman Christopher 
Ullman declined comment on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt warned in January that day trading  
can be ``highly risky'' for ordinary investors, who should engage 
in it only ``with funds they can afford to lose.'' He expressed 
dismay at stories he had heard of people putting up money for 
education, mortgages or retirement to finance their day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	James H. Lee, chairman and president of the Electronic Traders  
Association, which represents day-trading firms, said Thursday he 
hadn't yet seen the NASD proposal and couldn't directly comment on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he hoped the proposal ``doesn't work to discourage  
firms from discussing any instructions'' in using computer programs 
to day trade. He drew a distinction between such training and 
investment advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most of the 5 million or so ordinary investors who do  
occasional stock trading on the Internet, most day traders use the 
services and computer facilities of the day-trading firms, which 
sell investors training courses, require them to put up large 
amounts of money to open a self-trading account, and charge them 
commissions on each trade. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the number of full-time day traders who operate out of  
these firms is small, about 2,500 to 3,000 nationwide. But the 
recent growing popularity of the practice has raised questions 
about whether the firms are promoting a service that may cause 
people to get in over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators have stepped up their scrutiny and a  
handful, particularly in Massachusetts, have recently filed fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The new NASD proposal would require day-trading firms to apply  
standards of ``suitability'' to potential investors similar to 
those that full-service brokers must apply to their clients. The 
firms would have to determine that the practice would be 
appropriate for an investor's financial situation and investment 
experience before allowing him or her to open a day-trading 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, day-trading firms would have to give potential  
investors a written disclosure statement warning them that day 
trading ``can be extremely risky'' and they should be prepared to 
lose all the money they put into it. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors would be told they should not use their retirement  
savings, second mortgages, education funds or money needed to live. 
They also would be warned to be wary of claims of big profits from 
day trading, which requires in-depth knowledge of the securities 
markets and trading techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------

	Comments on the proposal may be submitted to NASD Regulation by  
e-mail through its Web site at www.nasdr.com.

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian Withdraws As Own Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian fired himself as his  
attorney Friday as jurors went into their second day of 
deliberating whether to convict him of murder for the nationally 
televised death of a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, accused of murdering 52-year-old Thomas Youk with a  
lethal injection, turned his defense over to attorney David Gorosh, 
who had been serving as the retired pathologist's legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take your good advice and withdraw,'' Kevorkian  
told Judge Jessica Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you're going to do it?'' replied Cooper, who suggested to  
Kevorkian throughout the brief trial that he get himself a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You said any time, your honor.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian stumbled over legal procedure several times during the  
trial and unsuccessfully tried to persuade the judge to let him 
call Youk's widow and brother as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the jury continued hashing out Kevorkian's fate after  
spending five hours deliberating the case on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, could get life in prison if convicted. He has  
been tried four times on assisted suicide charges, with three 
acquittals and one mistrial. This is the first time he has stood 
trial on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own count, Kevorkian has taken part in more than 130  
suicides since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The injection death of Youk was videotaped and later shown on  
``60 Minutes'' in a segment that included Kevorkian daring

judge them harshly for a guilty verdict and suggested they should 
trust their judgment more than the law. He contended his intent was 
not to kill Youk, but merely to relieve his suffering.

<P>
	Prosecutor John Skrzynski said Kevorkian should not be allowed  
to make a political statement with Youk's death.

<P>
	In her instructions to the jury, Cooper said euthanasia or mercy  
killing is not a defense to murder.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses To Cut Tyson Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was turned down today in his  
bid to have his jail sentence in Maryland reduced from one year to 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means the earliest the former heavyweight champion  
could be released from jail is June. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge setback,'' Tyson lawyer Paul Kemp said.  
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery County Circuit Judge Stephen Johnson, who imposed the  
original sentence last month, said at today's hearing he still 
considers the sentence ``fair and appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the best interest of Mr. Tyson that his current  
treatment be maintained,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who had waived his right to attend the hearing, was  
brought to the Montgomery County courthouse before the hearing 
began. But jailers realized their error and immediately took him 
back. His wife, Monica, was present when the judge announced his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson must still serve 60 days for violating probation for a  
1992 rape conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	He is undergoing counseling, had a change in his antidepressant  
medication and is studying for a high school equivalency diploma in 
the Montgomery County jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson he is serving a one-year sentence after pleading no  
contest to misdemeanor assault charges in connection with a minor 
traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg last August.

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian Withdraws As Own Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian fired himself as his  
attorney Friday as jurors went into their second day of 
deliberating whether to convict him of murder for the nationally 
televised death of a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, accused of murdering 52-year-old Thomas Youk with a  
lethal injection, turned his defense over to attorney David Gorosh, 
who had been serving as the retired pathologist's legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take your good advice and withdraw,'' Kevorkian  
told Judge Jessica Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you're going to do it?'' replied Cooper, who suggested to  
Kevorkian throughout the brief trial that he get himself a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You said any time, your honor.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian stumbled over legal procedure several times during the  
trial and unsuccessfully tried to persuade the judge to let him 
call Youk's widow and brother as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the jury continued hashing out Kevorkian's fate after  
spending five hours deliberating the case on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, could get life in prison if convicted. He has  
been tried four times on assisted suicide charges, with three 
acquittals and one mistrial. This is the first time he has stood 
trial on murder charges.

<HEADLINE> Cal Ripken Sr. Dies of Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken Sr. made up for an ordinary baseball  
career as a player by becoming a distinguished teacher of the game. 
His most notable student was his own son, who parlayed instruction 
from his father into a Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr., who spent 36 years in the Baltimore Orioles  
organization, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken Jr. learned many of the finer points of the game  
while accompanying his father to the ballpark while Ripken Sr. was 
managing teams in the Baltimore farm system. The young Ripken ended 
up becoming the most durable player in the history of the game, 
playing in 2,632 straight games before voluntarily ending the 
streak last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. also helped develop the skills of another son, Bill,  
an infielder who also played with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ripken boys were among hundreds of players and coaches who  
learned the game from a man whose teachings also had a great 
influence on current Orioles manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always talk about the Oriole Way. Cal Ripken Sr. was the  
one who indoctrinated every one of us who came in,'' said Miller, 
who served under Ripken as a pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's someone who meant a lot to this organization for a very  
long time,'' Orioles general manager Frank Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we will remember most about Cal Sr. is how he helped us  
understand that baseball is more than a national pasttime, it is a 
metaphor for life,'' Gov. Parris Glendening said. ``Through 
baseball, he taught us that diligence, determination and discipline 
are keys to winning at the game of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. had leathered skin and a gruff voice, characteristics  
at least partially attributable to the fact that he was a heavy 
smoker. Back in the days when smoking on the field wasn't taboo, he 
often cupped a filterless cigarette in his palm while watching 
batting practice or in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken won 964 games in the minors and was 68-101 as manager of  
the Orioles in 1987-88. He was fired after the Orioles opened the 
1988 season with six straight losses in what would be ultimately a 
record 21-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. also enjoyed a lengthy run as Baltimore's third base  
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about a guy who knew the game backwards and  
forwards,'' Arizona Diamondbacks coach Buck Showalter said 
Thursday. ``I always considered that he was the best third base 
coach I'd ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was relieved of his duties as Baltimore's third base  
coach in 1992. He was offered another job within the organization, 
but instead went into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Ripken Sr. became the first father ever to manage two  
sons simultaneously in the majors. Cal was the Orioles' shortstop 
and Bill played second base. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Cal Sr. downplayed his unique baseball association  
with his boys. But he said it would be something he would look back 
at fondly after retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just happen to be in the same business at the same place,''  
Ripken said in 1992. ``Maybe years from now, when I'm reflecting 
upon things in my rocking chair, I'll smile about all this. But for 
now they're just a second baseman and a shortstop on this 
ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. began his career with the Orioles as a catcher with  
the team's Phoenix affiliate in 1957. He ended his playing career 
in 1964, having never reached the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	His 13-plus years in the Baltimore farm system is the longest  
tenure of any minor league manager in Oriole history. During that 
time, Ripken Sr. worked odd jobs over the winter because baseball 
didn't pay him enough to support a family of six. 
</P>
<P>
	He often brought his boys to the ballpark, but left most of the  
development of the family's four children to their mother, Vi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just as if their father was a truck driver -- he was  
away from home a lot, and you just had to live with it,'' Vi Ripken 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr., who left spring training Tuesday to be with his father,  
viewed his father as the inspiration for his incredible consecutive 
games streak. 
</P>
<P>
	When young Cal was 16, his dad hooked a snowplow to a tractor in  
an effort to help clear the neighborhood. The tractor stalled, and 
when Cal Sr. tried to get it going, a crank flew off and hit him in 
the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Sr. pressed an oily rag to his head in an effort to stop the  
bleeding while his scared son got him into the family car. But 
instead of driving to a hospital, Cal Sr. told his son to drive 
home. There, Cal Jr. watched his dad put on some butterfly 
bandages, then saw him head back to the plow to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get the feeling that things are a little low, that I  
need a little motivation to work on my hitting, I visualize the 
tractor-crank story. That pushes me,'' Cal Jr. said in the midst of 
his streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of that story more than any other. Sometimes I'm  
beating my head against the wall and not getting any results at the 
plate, and I'm wondering if my effort is worth it all. That story 
sums it all up for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife and his two major league player sons,  
survivors include daughter Ellen, son Fred and six grandchildren. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tech Star To Put Friendships Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Friendship only goes so far for Monica  
Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana Tech senior from East Chicago, Ind., will run into  
friends Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs when the Lady 
Techsters meet Purdue tonight in the semifinals of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're not going to be standing around catching up on old  
times -- not when a berth in Sunday's national championship game is 
at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did grow up at Purdue close to Purdue and I have a lot of  
friends on that team,'' Maxwell said. ``But I told somebody this 
earlier, I'm not here to rekindle any friendships. We're here for 
basketball and I'm sure they feel the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game follows the Duke-Georgia semifinal and matches the two  
teams with the nation's longest winning streak and the only No. 1 
seeds left in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1-ranked Purdue (32-1) has won 30 straight and is returning  
to the area where it suffered its only loss, 73-72 to Stanford on 
Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (30-2) has won 22 in a row since losing to,  
that's right, Purdue. The Boilermakers beat Tech 71-65 in 
Indianapolis on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenge for the Lady Techsters?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not playing Purdue for revenge,'' Maxwell said. ``We're  
here at the Final Four and Purdue just happened to be our opponent. 
That's how we're going to approach the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree that Louisiana Tech is a much better team now.  
Only one team has come closer than 14 points to the Lady Techsters 
since the Purdue game and they've won their four NCAA tournament 
games by an average of 26.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Their withering defensive pressure has thrown opponents into  
disarray and triggered Tech's offense with fast breaks that have 
led to easy baskets and big scoring runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're clicking on all cylinders right now,'' Purdue coach  
Carolyn Peck said. ``Monica Maxwell has played extremely well. 
There's no other way I could describe her than an animal on the 
boards. She really has a nose for the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell had 22 points and 13 rebounds in an 88-62 victory over  
UCLA in the West Regional finals. After an up-and-down regular 
season, she's averaging 13.3 points and 9.3 rebounds in NCAA 
tournament play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a different point than we were in December,'' said  
Amanda Wilson, who leads Tech with a 16.5 scoring average. ``It's 
crunch time now. In December ... we were just trying to develop 
ourselves as a team. I think we're at the point now where ... we're 
ready to win the national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech, in the Final Four for the 10th time, reached the  
championship game last year but lost to Tennessee 93-75. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors White-McCarty and Figgs and sophomore Katie Douglas have  
carried Purdue through the best season in school history. It's also 
the final season for Peck, who's leaving to become coach and 
general manager of the WNBA's Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is going to be an emotional weekend,'' Figgs said.  
``But at the same time, we know that we can keep the weekend going 
by going out and playing our best game, playing a great game. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we're focused on the game. After the game, we'll worry  
about what the rest of that holds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue has been outstanding in close games, winning three times  
by two points and beating Illinois by four in the finals of the Big 
Ten tournament. And the Boilermakers have shown a remarkable 
ability to get to the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	They've made 74 more free throws than their opponents have  
attempted and have enjoyed a big edge at the line in NCAA 
tournament play, making 85-of-123 to their opponents' 22-of-43. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore said his team can't let that  
continue and expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen a basketball team, men or women, that  
shoots more free throws than Purdue,'' Barmore said. ``They dribble 
around until you foul them. If you don't foul them, they dribble 
around some more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to really play good defense and try to  
keep them from just having a parade to the foul line.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Williamson Pitching Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- As Scott Williamson began warming up for  
the bottom of the ninth inning, a handful of Cincinnati Reds fans 
seated behind home plate squinted to try to read the name on the 
back of the uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Who?  
</P>
<P>
	The first time Williamson threw a fastball, the fans turned  
towards each other in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you see that?'' one said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another started glancing down his program to find the reliever's  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Number 66, number 66,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	About that time, Williamson threw another fastball that made a  
loud pop when it found the catcher's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't even see that ball!'' a fan exclaimed.  
</P>
<P>
	That scene at a game in Fort Myers this week has played out at  
other spring training ballparks as well. Williamson, a nonroster 
pitcher with an offensive lineman's number, has been making himself 
known, fastball by fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure when they look at the No. 66, they know I'm an  
invitee. Hopefully that number will change, will get a little bit 
lower -- 65, or something like that,'' Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a change in plans, Williamson will be getting a much  
lower number on a major league uniform in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson, 23, has been one of the biggest surprises of the  
Reds' training camp. He's the last player listed in the media guide 
-- alphabetical, with nonroster players at the rear -- and was 
basically brought to camp for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched so well that he survived one cut after another. When  
setup man Stan Belinda went on the disabled list this week with 
tendinitis, there was an opening for Williamson to make the roster 
instead of returning to Triple-A Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not etched in stone, but right now with the injuries,  
he's got a hell of a chance,'' manager Jack McKeon said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson's numbers practically demand it. The right-hander has  
given up only one run in 13 2-3 innings for a 0.66 ERA. He allowed 
only an infield single during 1 1-3 innings of a 12-8 victory 
Friday over Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the right-hander couldn't imagine being in this  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson was a ninth-round draft pick in June 1997 out of  
Oklahoma State. He lasted so long in the draft because he never had 
an ERA lower than 4.31 in three seasons at Tulane and Oklahoma 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Things fell into place in the Pioneer League, where he put up a  
1.78 ERA in his first professional season. He divided last season 
between Double-A and Triple-A, going 4-5 as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	His progress was slowed last year by various injuries -- a line  
drive that grazed his forehead, a strained tendon in a finger, a 
stiff shoulder. Near the end of the season, the Reds made some 
changes in his delivery that increased his fastball from the low 
90s to 97 mph. They also suggested he try relieving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never relieved before -- a couple of times in high school,  
but that was to get a couple of guys out in the seventh inning.'' 
he said. ``Whatever management says, you do. If it helps me get to 
the big leagues faster, then I'd rather be a reliever.''

<HEADLINE> Speaker Hastert Chats Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert has two favorite  
places to visit on the Web: country singer Johnny Cash's site and, 
for the former championship-winning wrestling coach, a site with 
wrestling scores and updates. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who said he is still struggling to get comfortable with  
the Web, got a little practice Friday as he chatted online with 
students in his district who lobbed questions about some of Capitol 
Hill's hottest issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The opportunity to connect with young people now that his new  
job keeps him away from home more was a welcome one for the former 
high school government teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The feeling was mutual. Students from the Illinois Republican's  
alma mater, Oswego High School, came back from their spring break 
for the chance to hear from a powerful alumnus. Six other schools 
participated, all from Hastert's district of Chicago suburbs and 
far-flung farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussion covered such topics as Kosovo, tax cuts,  
Congress' post-impeachment relationship with President Clinton, 
arts funding, and Hastert's predecessor, former Speaker Newt 
Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Kosovo, Hastert said he supports American servicemen  
involved in the NATO mission but wishes Clinton had explained how 
it would end. 
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged that the $15 billion in tax cuts promised  
in just-passed Republican budgets may not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert dodged a question on whether parents of children in  
private schools should get tax credits, but he expressed support 
for public schools and for sending federal education dollars to 
states and local districts so they can decide how to spend them. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker pledged to work with Clinton to ``get things done.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also defended the combative tenor of Gingrich's reign,  
while promising a shift under his watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though those years were partisan, we accomplished a great  
deal for the American people,'' he said. ``I have great respect for 
Newt, but I will run the House differently.''

<HEADLINE> Guerrero Riding Infiniti in Phoenix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- If an Infiniti-powered car winds up in victory  
lane at an Indy Racing League event this year, Roberto Guerrero 
probably will be behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	He has the crew, the experience and, apparently, the engine to  
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The improvement the engine has made since '97 is incredible,''  
the 39-year-old Colombia native said Friday ``The engine is to a 
point that, with the right breaks, it can win a race. It's going to 
be hard, because when you only have four cars out of 28 with the 
engine, it obviously makes the odds a little bit harder, but I 
think it's ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case two years ago. By the time the series hit  
Phoenix International Raceway for the second race of the season, 
teams using the new Infinitis were already thinking about switching 
to Oldsmobile's dependable Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero drove one of the two Infiniti-equipped cars still  
running at the end of the 200-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not familiar with their program at that point in time, but  
clearly as an outsider looking in they've jumped leaps and bounds 
from that point to this,'' Cobb Racing crew chief Phil Spano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Buhl is the only other driver at Phoenix with an  
Infiniti-equipped G Force. Rookies Jaques Lazier and Scott 
Harrington have Infinitis in their Dallara chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington Motorsports crew chief Steve Dunlap said Nissan  
improved its backup support while taking the bugs out of the 
powerplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had good luck with our private tests and mileaged the  
engine out without any difficulty, and when we got down to the 
block it was in great shape,'' Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsepower and durability aside, Guerrero has reason to feel  
confident in Phoenix, the site of this weekend's MCI WorldCom 200. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned his only Indy car title on the irregular, one-mile  
oval 12 years ago, setting a track record by averaging 138.020 mph 
during the race in a turbocharged CART machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in 1987, Guerrero was second in the Indianapolis 500, and  
the next year qualified for his only Indy 500 pole while setting a 
track record of 232.482 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	But that Memorial Day weekend also marked the start of a skid.  
He finished last in the race when he spun into the wall during the 
second parade lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Accidents also knocked Guerrero out of the Indy 500 in 1993 and  
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	His luck improved in 1996, when he joined the IRL with Pagan  
Racing and had a fifth-place finish at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagan started with Infiniti in 1997, but by the end of the  
season the Aurora had a virtual lock on the series. At the same 
time, Guerrero's relationship with owner Allan Pagan was 
deteriorating. It lasted four races into last season before the 
driver left. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, former sports car racer Price Cobb decided his  
new racing team had outgrown its drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, he was the perfect shoe,'' Cobb said. ``I sat  
down with Infiniti, one of our supporters, and we bounced off of 
each other a great deal of information and many, many names, and we 
came to the consensus that Roberto Guerrero was the man that we 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not the least of Guerrero's achievements with Cobb was to finish  
fourth last August at Texas Motor Speedway after leading 22 laps -- 
the first time an Infiniti-powered car had led an IRL event. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb believes the crew let Guerrero down in Dallas and again in  
this season's first race outside Orlando, Fla., when Guerrero 
finished 13th after running 88 laps with a piece of another car's 
bodywork caught underneath the chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was arguably when we would have been challenging for the  
front, and it was all he could do to keep the car out of the 
fence,'' Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the engine was strong, justifying the owner's trust. Cobb,  
who won the World Porsche Cup in 1994, became impressed with Nissan 
while driving in IMSA's Camel GTP series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nissan used to trounce us all the time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Brand, Ellis Win AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Duke sophomore center Elton Brand  
and Auburn's Cliff Ellis were honored today by The Associated Press 
as college basketball's player and coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the only unanimous All-America selection this season,  
enters the Final Four averaging 17.8 points and 9.6 rebounds for 
the top-ranked Blue Devils, who have won a school-record 31 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Brand has had 17 double-doubles this season, nine  
in the last 15 games and two in the Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament. Brand is shooting 62 percent from the field and he has 
83 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand received 28 votes from AP member newspapers and radio  
stations, while senior guard Andre Miller of Utah was runner-up 
with 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is the third Duke player to win the Adolph Rupp Trophy,  
following Art Heyman in 1963 and Christian Laettner in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis led Auburn to one the best seasons in school history as  
the Tigers finished 29-4, a school record for victories, and 
reached their highest ranking ever, No. 2. Auburn, which finished 
as the Southeastern Conference's regular-season champion, was 
fourth in the final rankings and earned a No. 1 seeding in the NCAA 
tournament, losing to Ohio State in the regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, who has been at Auburn since 1994, has compiled a 444-271  
record in 24 seasons as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He received 36 votes for coach of the year, 17 more than  
runner-up Jim O'Brien of Ohio State. Ellis is the first Auburn 
coach to win the award and the second from the SEC in the 1990s, 
joining Eddie Fogler of Vanderbilt in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Spring Could Be Special for MSU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Beaches around the Tampa Bay area  
are packed with college kids on spring break. Mateen Cleaves and 
some of his Michigan State pals are here, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're not here primarily for sun and fun. They're here to  
win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans arrived at the Final Four on Thursday and got  
comfortable in the team hotel on Sand Key, off the coast of 
Clearwater Beach. That's about a 40-minute drive from Tropicana 
Field, but it might as well be 40 light years away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nice,'' senior guard Thomas Kelley said as he watched  
the sun go down over the Gulf of Mexico. ``You could get used to 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Girls in cutoffs and bikini tops walked by. They smiled,  
obviously aware that these were basketball players. And even if 
they weren't, the dark green T-shirt with ``St. Petersburg, Final 
Four'' on the front would have tipped them off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4), who are in the Final Four for the first  
time in 20 years, play top-ranked Duke (36-1) on Saturday night at 
Tropicana Field. On their way, they won the Big Ten championship, 
the Big Ten tournament and an NCAA regional title. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they know the Blue Devils are a formidable foe. If the  
Spartans are to have a chance, coach Tom Izzo feels Cleaves will 
have to be at his best. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State fell behind Kentucky 17-4 in St. Louis last  
weekend, but a long 3-pointer by Cleaves just before the half got 
the Spartans to within a point and they took control in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt it was important to have someone quarterback  
your team and be somewhat of an extension (of the coach),'' Izzo 
said. ``Once the game starts, even though we can make adjustments, 
there's things a guard does on the floor that I just don't think 
you can do from the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves didn't become an extension of Izzo overnight. Still,  
during his three years of playing for Izzo, they have found a way 
to become friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can call him up at three in the morning,'' Cleaves said. ``I  
can just say, `I can't sleep right now, I need somebody to talk 
to.' And that's the kind of guy he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are active in community affairs in East Lansing. They feed  
the homeless together, visit children in hospitals, and drive out 
to counsel young offenders in a prison near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's helped me grow up as a person,'' Cleaves said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Final Four Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Duke's Shane Battier has a  
reputation for defense and taking charges. So, when the sophomore 
opened up on offense with a 27-point game against Maryland, the 
Blue Devils were suitably impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski recalled someone asking Duke's Chris  
Carrawell about all those points by Battier. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Well, he wasn't the Naismith High School Player of  
the Year because he took charges. He must have shot the ball 
somewhere along the line.''' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *``MY FAVORITE COACH!'':* On their first night at the Final  
Four, coaches Jim Calhoun of Connecticut, Jim O'Brien of Ohio 
State, Tom Izzo of Michigan State and Mike Krzyzewski of Duke spent 
some time together. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who will try to end a personal 18-game losing streak  
against Calhoun in Saturday's semifinals, recalled the UConn 
coach's arrival in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he sees all of us,'' O'Brien said, ``he says `Tom, it's  
nice to see you. Mike, it's nice to see you. Jim, it's REALLY nice 
to see you.''' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GET THE POINT:* Point guard Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State  
tried to define the requirements of his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be able to take constructive criticism,'' he  
said. ``You've got to not be afraid. You've got to have a good 
personality. You've got to know everybody's personality on the 
team, who, how, when and where to get them the ball. You've got to 
run the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like a coach.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ARCHITECT IN TRAINING:* Tropicana Field, site of the Final  
Four, has some bad memories for Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose 
team blew a 17-point lead to Kentucky in the regional finals in 
this building a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides losing the game, there were the leaks in the building,  
leaving puddles here and there. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach K is featured in a current Nike commercial working on a  
sand sculpture of the field and was asked about the real building 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty nice, isn't it,'' Krzyzewski said. ``It's a lot  
less wet than it was last year. Fixed up all the leaks. I think 
that's why they had me do that. Last year when we were here, it was 
pretty wet. They fixed this place up nice. I'm glad they used my 
models to do the repairs. It was nice of them to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COACHES VS. CANCER:* In 1993, Missouri coach Norm Stewart won a  
personal battle with cancer and launched a partnership between the 
American Cancer Society and the National Association of Basketball 
Coaches, raising funds to fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 28 coaches including John Wooden, Dean Smith, John Thompson  
and Bob Knight, Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Calhoun have signed 400 
lithographs and 200 basketballs that will be sold at the Final Four 
and elsewhere with proceeds to benefit Coaches Against Cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches realize that together they are capable of helping  
the Amercian Cancer Society maximize its fund-raising potential, 
while generating much-needed awareness,'' said Tom Ford, assistant 
executive director of the National Association of Basketball 
Coaches. ``The unique teamwork exhibited by these coaching legends 
is an inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALSO-RANS:* With three No. 1 seeds in the Final Four, Ohio  
State sometimes feels like an outsider, coming in as a No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we're playing an undercard,'' guard Scoonie Penn  
said. ``We probably don't get spoken about as much as the other 
teams. ... But I feel that's OK with us. I feel like we've been in 
that situation all season, kind of played the underdog role. It fit 
us well so we'll continue playing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it's any consolation, the last time three top seeds made it  
to the finals, Arizona was a No. 4 and won the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *POLL WATCHERS: With No. 1 Duke, No. 2 Connecticut and No. 3  
Michigan State in the Final Four, it marked the first time since 
1974 the top three teams in the final Associated Press poll made it 
to the season's last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, No. 1 North Carolina State, No. 2 UCLA and No. 3  
Marquette made it and NC State won the title.

<HEADLINE> Markets Calm Despite NATO Airstikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As NATO airstrikes battered Yugoslavia for a  
third day, the world's financial markets remained calm Friday. 
Historians said the robust U.S. economy and the perception that the 
conflict won't drag on have so far insulated the market from any 
sharp moves. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change drastically if the war spills into other  
nations or if it looks like ground troops will be needed to end the 
Serbian persecution of ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo 
province, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are considerable risks,'' said Arnold Kaufman, editor of  
Standard &AMP; Poor's weekly newsletter, The Outlook. ``The conflict 
could spread and affect the economies of more significant trade 
partners. And the market doesn't like the possibility of major 
conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, while NATO forces launched their first daytime attacks  
over Kosovo, U.S. stocks slid modestly. The Dow Jones industrial 
average fell 14.15 points to close at 9,822.24. Asian and European 
markets turned in a mixed performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Market response to the fighting over Kosovo has fallen in line  
with previous military conflicts, with several jittery days 
followed by one big rally, economists said. Stocks slid early this 
week as conflict loomed, but the Dow roared back with a 
169.55-point gain Thursday, the day after the bombing started. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an ominous feeling in the days before military  
action,'' said Yale Hirsch, editor and publisher of the Stock 
Trader's Almanac. In recent conflicts, from the Persian Gulf War to 
NATO efforts in Bosnia, ``that's been followed by a feeling of 
pride, a sense that we're pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stocks rose over the course of the Gulf War, but fell  
during the Vietnam War, when the economy was also marred by high 
inflation. Analysts said the strength of the current economy should 
help U.S. markets bear up throughout the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Losey, chairman of the finance and real estate department  
at American University, said financial markets tend to fluctuate as 
long as the potential risk of a conflict remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Once there's a significant victory, markets often rise. The  
first sign of trouble can send them reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the start of the Gulf crisis, there appeared to be a  
substantial risk that it would become a conflagration and that 
world oil supplies would be endangered,'' he said. That risk pushed 
the Dow down 12 percent between Aug. 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded 
Kuwait, and Jan. 16, 1991, the day before U.S. air attacks began. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the attacks were launched, Losey noted, ``it became obvious  
after only a few hours that we were going to win that conflict.'' 
On that day, the Dow rose 4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the markets may have held steady this week because  
the conflict in Kosovo is fueled by humanitarian concerns, rather 
than the economic factors that drew the United States into the 
Persian Gulf in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Balkans are not a major trading partner, and may not pose  
a threat to any of our major trading partners,'' said Owen Lamont, 
an associate professor of finance at the University of Chicago's 
Graduate School of Business. He predicted Russia would have to 
advance its efforts to support Yugoslavia before U.S. markets would 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
	Market historians said signs of an advancing conflict -- such as  
news of the first casualties, or the arrival of ground troops -- can 
spur market movement. On Friday some traders sold stocks, concerned 
that the crisis could escalate this weekend, leaving them unable to 
respond until markets reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, others doubted that a major market shift will ever occur.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the third day of a raid, and it just doesn't sound like  
we're going to go into a full battle,'' said Larry Wachtel, market 
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``The market has barely reacted 
up until now, and I don't think it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman said the markets may be lulled by the quick resolutions  
to conflicts in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Americans now feel there's little risk in these  
skirmishes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Americans in Majors Angered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Several major leaguers are angry with the Baltimore Orioles'  
decision to play Cuba in Havana on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the idea of Fidel Castro getting all the  
publicity,'' Fernando Vina, the Milwaukee Brewers' All-Star second 
baseman, said in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mets coach Cookie Rojas was short and to the point: ``I  
don't agree with it. That's all I'm going to say,'' he said in 
Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco Giants pitcher Osvaldo Fernandez, who escaped Cuba  
in 1995, had mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the Cuban people, I want this to happen for them so they  
can see what a big-league team looks like, and what organized 
baseball looks like, and because it might open doors for a lot of 
players there. But for the system, the government, no I don't 
really care for it,'' said Fernandez, who hasn't pitched for the 
Giants since July 1997 because of elbow problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins owner John Henry, whose team has the largest  
Cuban-American fan base in the majors, has been the most vocal 
opponent in baseball -- even taking part in fan protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major problem here is ignorance,'' he said. ``People are  
not aware of the depth of oppression in Cuba. If they were, no one 
would support this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, who purchased his team in January, said the only reason  
Orioles owner Peter Angelos wanted to play Sunday's exhibition game 
against Cuba's national team was to expose the Orioles to Cuban 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has shown he doesn't care what we think. He sure didn't ask  
us what we think,'' Henry said. ``He's interested in getting a 
competitive advantage -- to get the Orioles' name plastered across 
Cuba so the next Cuban baseball player who defects will head for 
Baltimore. ... A lot of people in baseball believe this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the Florida Marlins should be the team playing a  
game in Cuba, if the game in Cuba were the right thing to do. But 
it's not right thing to do,'' Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos said recruiting wasn't behind the trip.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for all of us to open our minds and open our  
hearts to people of other countries. This is a wonderful thing that 
is happening throughout the world,'' he said Friday. ``I don't know 
of anything that has ever been done for a constructive purpose that 
didn't generate controversy. Anything that departs from what is 
customary is going to generate a difference of opinion, but it's a 
worthwhile endeavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, the  
latest Cuban star player to join a major league team, has declined 
comment on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not too fond of the idea,'' said Milwaukee Brewers  
outfielder Alex Ochoa, whose mother was five months' pregnant with 
him when she fled Cuba in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing what my parents went through makes it hard for me to  
like the idea that we're going to let Fidel Castro get that 
attention,'' Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't totally agree with the situation, with Fidel Castro in  
the stands, that will be hard to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, a Florida native,  
also opposes the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a good idea for several reasons,'' he said.  
``Why get it started? If I had a vote, I'd vote no.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T: No At Home-Road Runner Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T-controlled At Home, a leading provider of  
high-speed Internet access over cable TV lines, doesn't plan to 
merge with rival Road Runner despite persistent rumors about such a 
deal, a top AT&AMP;T executive said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it happening.'' said Leo Hindery, president and  
CEO of AT&AMP;T Broadband and Internet Services. ``I think there's been 
excessive, inappropriate and undue speculation this last week about 
them coming together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not on the table. It's not being discussed,'' Hindery  
added, responding to a question at a gathering of cable executives 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters later whether such a union would make sense,  
Hindery replied: ``It might.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T recently acquired cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. and  
as a result, TCI's controlling stake in At Home, which also is 
owned by Cox Communications and several other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Road Runner provides high-speed Internet access over cable TV  
lines, too. Its owners include Time Warner and MediaOne -- which on 
Monday entered into a deal to be taken over by Comcast Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Hindery expressed concerns about what he said was an  
increase of racist Web sites on Internet and children's exposure to 
them. He didn't offer a plan to address those concerns but 
suggested policy-makers look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindery, who said he's not a ``proponent of censorship'' noted  
that filtering or blocking technology can shield children from 
sites parents find offensive, but technology, he said, is not 
``foolproof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet breeds some of the most hateful, sexist, racist,  
bigoted, nasty stuff I've ever seen in my life,'' Hindery said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's got to be a way -- I don't know what it is-- that starts  
with some discussions at the policy-maker level here in Washington. 
There has got to be a way to hold people accountable for hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, Hindery told reporters he has no plans to  
jump ship to head up Seagram's entertainment division. ``I have a 
long-term contract with AT&AMP;T. ... I'm with AT&AMP;T.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that Hindery was  
approached for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	As for cable rates, which will be deregulated March 31, Hindery  
said: ``It would also be easy ... to raise our rates to levels that 
put the crucial price/value relationship in peril. But we cannot do 
that. And we must not.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan State, Duke To Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The first time was early December in  
Chicago, two of the top teams in the country meeting in the Great 
Eight. 
</P>
<P>
	The second time will be late March in St. Petersburg, two of the  
top teams in the country meeting in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The game Saturday night between top-ranked Duke and Michigan  
State is far more important, of course. And this time the winner 
gets to play for the national championship on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	That first game, won by Duke 73-67, won't have much bearing on  
the rematch, the players and coaches said. But they did spend a lot 
of time talking about it Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Michigan State's a lot different and I think we are,  
too,'' said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who has the Blue Devils 
(36-1) in the Final Four for the eighth time since 1986. ``They 
know each other even better. They seem to be very healthy and have 
a deep rotation with eight or nine guys. So I think they use their 
people better now that they did earlier, and so do we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That game was the first of Duke's school-record 31 straight  
wins. Michigan State (33-4) lost its next game to then-No. 1 
Connecticut and has won 29 of 30 since, including the last 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a totally different team back them,'' Spartans junior  
forward A.J. Granger said. ``We've matured along the way and so 
have they. I would say the maturity is going to play a big part in 
the game, and we've come a long way in that department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game in United Center, Duke took a 17-2 lead as  
Trajan Langdon hit two 3-pointers and a free throw in the opening 
four minutes. Langdon finished with 23 points on 7-for-12 shooting, 
4-of-7 beyond the arc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my teammates did a great job setting screens and Will  
Avery did a great job getting me the ball in my rhythm,'' said 
Langdon, a second-team All-America who had 47 points in the last 
two NCAA tournament games on 9-for-12 from 3-point range. ``It just 
felt good in Chicago that night. I had a variety of different 
people on me. It wasn't that they did a bad job, just my teammates 
did a great job of getting me the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mateen Cleaves, Michigan State's first-team All-America, had a  
bad night in the first meeting, going 3-for-17 from the field with 
nine points and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even think about that last game. I try to get that  
game out of my head,'' said Cleaves, who has averaged 11.3 points 
and 7.0 assists while keeping up his tough defense in the NCAA 
tournament. ``I'm really not going out there to play for payback or 
that I have to prove to somebody that I can shoot better against 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thing is I have to concentrate on doing a better job for my  
team,'' he said. ``I didn't do a good job with my team then, my 
shooting. ... This time I have to do a better job of running my 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are better than they were in December and history  
becomes a fading factor in an event like the Final Four. Still, 
reality is reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tom Izzo, who has the Spartans in the Final Four for the  
first time since 1979, was asked if he has found a flaw in Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess if you have to really search and search and search,  
there's no backup point guard for Avery if he gets in foul trouble 
and that could be a problem,'' he said.

	Mass Killings Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces executed scores of  
Kosovo Albanians and shelled numerous villages as fighting raged 
today throughout the province despite NATO air attacks, ethnic 
Albanian sources said. Meanwhile, Serbs were looting ethnic 
Albanian-owned stores in the capital and setting them ablaze. NATO 
officials stressed today that the air attacks were the beginning of 
what could be a long operation to make President Milosevic end his 
offensive in Kosovo. 

</P>

	NATO Downs Two Yugoslavia MiGs  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets shot down two Yugoslav MiG  
fighters and captured their pilots today in Bosnia, thwarting an 
attempted attack on NATO-led peacekeeping forces, alliance and U.S. 
officials said. The confrontation outside Yugoslav territory was a 
dangerous broadening of the showdown between the Western alliance 
and Yugoslav President Milosevic over Kosovo. Meanwhile, 
Yugoslavia's U.N. envoy said today that ``hundreds of civilians'' 
have been killed in NATO airstrikes which hit a cemetery for Nazi 
victims, two refugee camps and two youth hostels. 

</P>
<P>
	Anti-NATO Protests Target Embassies  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Protesters opposed to NATO attacks on  
Yugoslavia directed their anger at American sites around Europe 
today, drenching olive branches in red and calling President 
Clinton a ``fascist.'' Up to 10,000 people in Bulgaria gathered in 
the nation's capital of Sofia to protest the NATO airstrikes. In 
Greece, a NATO member, 15,000 protesters marched to the U.S. 
Embassy. In Russia, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the 
U.S. and British embassies.

	French Tunnel Death Toll Hits 35  
</P>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Firefighters searched among the charred  
remains of cars and tractor-trailers today for victims of a 
catastrophic fire -- a blaze that killed at least 35 people in a 
seven-mile tunnel under Western Europe's highest peak. The blaze in 
the Mont Blanc tunnel, which broke out Wednesday on a Belgian truck 
carrying flour and margarine, was not extinguished until this 
afternoon. The Alpine tunnel is a major route connecting France and 
Italy, used daily by up to 4,000 trucks.

	Chinese Premier To Visit U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will travel to the  
United States next month to meet with President Clinton. Zhu's 
visit may give the United States and China a chance to reach 
agreement on trade initiatives that will clear the way for China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization. However, the discussions 
are occurring at a time of increased tensions over China's record 
on human rights and allegations of Chinese espionage at U.S. 
nuclear laboratories.

	CT Scans Can Check Heart Disease  
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Ordinary hospital CT scanners can be  
equipped to snap stop-action pictures of the heart, offering a new 
way of detecting dangerously clogged arteries many years before 
they cause trouble. Fatty buildups in the heart's arteries begin in 
early adulthood, but often there is no sign of damage until a heart 
attack strikes in middle age or beyond. However, these deposits 
frequently contain calcium that shows up on CT scans.

	Students Help Others on Spring Break  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some college students still party over spring  
break but many are choosing to spend the week involved in volunteer 
or charity work. Schools, uneasy about the binge drinking and 
violence associated with the annual break, are helping students 
skip the revelry. ``This generation does want to make a 
difference,'' said Thomas Greene of Norwich University, a Vermont 
school that sent students to Washington to work in soup kitchens 
and build houses. Last year, 20,000 students from across the nation 
did some alternative break activity, estimates Break Away, a group 
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.

the Dow Jones industrial average was down 7.49 at 9,828.90. Losers

</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Steve Fisher, with one national title and two  
other Final Four appearances on his resume, will be San Diego 
State's new coach, The Associated Press has learned. San Diego 
State called a news conference for 6:15 p.m. EST today to make the 
announcement. Fisher, presently an assistant with the NBA's 
Sacramento Kings, was 184-82 at Michigan, and had a 20-6 record in 
the NCAA tournament.

<HEADLINE> Report: San Diego St To Hire Fisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Will a Michigan man hire another Michigan man  
to take over San Diego State's woeful basketball program? 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Rick Bay appeared poised to hire Steve Fisher,  
whose career as the Wolverines' basketball coach ended as abruptly 
as it began. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could be finalized as soon as this weekend, Fox Sports  
News reported Thursday night, citing unnamed sources close to 
Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, an assistant with the NBA's Sacramento Kings, did not  
return two phone calls placed to his room at a Los Angeles-area 
hotel. The Kings are scheduled to play the Lakers on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay said he was still talking to candidates Thursday evening.  
</P>
<P>
	``As of this moment I don't have a coach,'' Bay said. ``I'd like  
to think I'm getting closer, but I don't have a coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A school official involved in the coaching search denied that an  
agreement had been reached with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if an announcement was imminent, Bay said, ``I'd like  
to say it's imminent that I'll have a coach. I went up to the 12th 
hour with (Rick) Majerus, and that didn't happen. So I'd be 
reluctant to characterize it as imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus, who coached Utah to the national championship game last  
year, rejected San Diego State's job offer Monday night, and 
Gonzaga's Dan Monson took himself out of the running. Former St. 
John's coach Fran Fraschilla reportedly turned down the Aztecs, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego State was 4-22 this year, its fourth losing season in  
five years under Fred Trenkle, who resigned at season's end. The 
Aztecs have had just one winning season since their last NCAA 
tournament appearance, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was an assistant to Bill Frieder for seven years at  
Michigan and was named interim coach on the eve of the 1989 NCAA 
tournament when Frieder accepted a job at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	An angry Bo Schembechler, the football coach who also was the  
athletic director, said at the time: ``A Michigan man will coach 
Michigan, not an Arizona State man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan won the national title that year and Fisher had the  
interim label removed about three weeks later. Fisher coached the 
Wolverines to the title game in 1992 and 1993, losing both times. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if a Michigan man would take over at San Diego State,  
Bay said: ``If anybody can do it, I would say a Michigan guy 
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bay said Fisher is ``a guy I've known a while, and we both have  
Michigan in our background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bay wrestled and played football at Michigan, and, after a stint  
in the Marine Corps, returned as assistant wrestling coach, then 
became head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was fired by Michigan on Oct. 10, 1997, shortly after a  
Kansas law firm hired by the university issued a report questioning 
his role in arranging complimentary tickets for a booster. The NCAA 
accepted the school's self-imposed penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about that incident, Bay said: ``People make their  
own judgment. Without having confirmed or denied that I've talked 
to Steve, if I would hire a coach, I would check everything out.''

<HEADLINE> Cal Ripken Sr. Dies of Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken Sr. made up for an ordinary baseball  
career as a player by becoming a distinguished teacher of the game. 
His most notable student was his own son, who parlayed instruction 
from his father into a Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr., who spent 36 years in the Baltimore Orioles  
organization, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken Jr. learned many of the finer points of the game  
while accompanying his father to the ballpark while Ripken Sr. was 
managing teams in the Baltimore farm system. The young Ripken ended 
up becoming the most durable player in the history of the game, 
playing in 2,632 straight games before voluntarily ending the 
streak last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. also helped develop the skills of another son, Bill,  
an infielder who also played with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ripken boys were among hundreds of players and coaches who  
learned the game from a man whose teachings also had a great 
influence on current Orioles manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always talk about the Oriole Way. Cal Ripken Sr. was the  
one who indoctrinated every one of us who came in,'' said Miller, 
who served under Ripken as a pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's someone who meant a lot to this organization for a very  
long time,'' Orioles general manager Frank Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we will remember most about Cal Sr. is how he helped us  
understand that baseball is more than a national pasttime, it is a 
metaphor for life,'' Gov. Parris Glendening said. ``Through 
baseball, he taught us that diligence, determination and discipline 
are keys to winning at the game of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. had leathered skin and a gruff voice, characteristics  
at least partially attributable to the fact that he was a heavy 
smoker. Back in the days when smoking on the field wasn't taboo, he 
often cupped a filterless cigarette in his palm while watching 
batting practice or in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken won 964 games in the minors and was 68-101 as manager of  
the Orioles in 1987-88. He was fired after the Orioles opened the 
1988 season with six straight losses in what would be ultimately a 
record 21-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. also enjoyed a lengthy run as Baltimore's third base  
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about a guy who knew the game backwards and  
forwards,'' Arizona Diamondbacks coach Buck Showalter said 
Thursday. ``I always considered that he was the best third base 
coach I'd ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was relieved of his duties as Baltimore's third base  
coach in 1992. He was offered another job within the organization, 
but instead went into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Ripken Sr. became the first father ever to manage two  
sons simultaneously in the majors. Cal was the Orioles' shortstop 
and Bill played second base. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Cal Sr. downplayed his unique baseball association  
with his boys. But he said it would be something he would look back 
at fondly after retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just happen to be in the same business at the same place,''  
Ripken said in 1992. ``Maybe years from now, when I'm reflecting 
upon things in my rocking chair, I'll smile about all this. But for 
now they're just a second baseman and a shortstop on this 
ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. began his career with the Orioles as a catcher with  
the team's Phoenix affiliate in 1957. He ended his playing career 
in 1964, having never reached the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	His 13-plus years in the Baltimore farm system is the longest  
tenure of any minor league manager in Oriole history. During that 
time, Ripken Sr. worked odd jobs over the winter because baseball 
didn't pay him enough to support a family of six. 
</P>
<P>
	He often brought his boys to the ballpark, but left most of the  
development of the family's four children to their mother, Vi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just as if their father was a truck driver -- he was  
away from home a lot, and you just had to live with it,'' Vi Ripken 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr., who left spring training Tuesday to be with his father,  
viewed his father as the inspiration for his incredible consecutive 
games streak. 
</P>
<P>
	When young Cal was 16, his dad hooked a snowplow to a tractor in  
an effort to help clear the neighborhood. The tractor stalled, and 
when Cal Sr. tried to get it going, a crank flew off and hit him in 
the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Sr. pressed an oily rag to his head in an effort to stop the  
bleeding while his scared son got him into the family car. But 
instead of driving to a hospital, Cal Sr. told his son to drive 
home. There, Cal Jr. watched his dad put on some butterfly 
bandages, then saw him head back to the plow to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get the feeling that things are a little low, that I  
need a little motivation to work on my hitting, I visualize the 
tractor-crank story. That pushes me,'' Cal Jr. said in the midst of 
his streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of that story more than any other. Sometimes I'm  
beating my head against the wall and not getting any results at the 
plate, and I'm wondering if my effort is worth it all. That story 
sums it all up for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife and his two major league player sons,  
survivors include daughter Ellen, son Fred and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Coach Overcomes Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- When Jim O'Brien set out to be a  
coach 22 years ago, making it to a Final Four was always in the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't supposed to be like this, not leading a school  
hundreds of miles away from home, and not without his life partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not a big deal,'' O'Brien protests as the  
questioning turns to his personal life. ``It's no different than 
anybody. On the other side, there's not that much to tell. It's 
just another day's existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others think it's more than that, the journey of a man in  
mid-life confronted with loss and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien will be barking orders in his raspy voice and Brooklyn  
wiseguy accent to players from Ohio State Saturday night, not his 
beloved alma mater, Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if his Buckeyes beat Connecticut and improbably go on to  
win the national championship 48 hours later, there will still be 
an ache. His wife Christina died eight years ago, leaving O'Brien 
behind with two teenaged daughters to raise. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, 48, doesn't see himself as victim or survivor.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I've been through all that much more than a  
lot of people,'' he said. ``I had a personal tragedy, yeah, but I'm 
not the only one. A lot of people go through stuff like that. I 
changed jobs; a lot of people go through that. The only difference 
is when you're coaching at a high-profile place, it gets a lot more 
notoriety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, O'Brien was coaching at Boston College, where he had  
been a point guard under one of the great point guards, Bob Cousy. 
Three straight losing seasons put his future in jeopardy. At the 
same time, Christina was battling Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemotherapy had given them promise and things seemed to be  
turning around. But on a Sunday morning, four days before the start 
of the Big East tournament, Christina went out for a walk, came 
home and collapsed. The potent chemicals had apparently weakened 
her heart. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien never discusses his loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the type of subject we ever talk about,'' Ohio State  
forward Jon Sanderson said. ``He has gone through a lot. But he 
doesn't really share a lot of that with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun watched how his old friend reacted  
to his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``How he handled that -- going through a tumultuous time and  
raising two daughters -- speaks to what kind of man he is,'' Calhoun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien moved on personally and professionally, leading Boston  
College to postseason tournaments the next three years. The Eagles 
went 22-9 and made it to another NCAA berth two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, O'Brien was feuding with BC's administration  
over entrance requirements for recruits. The fight turned ugly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't have gotten as personal as it did,'' said  
assistant coach Rick Boyages, also on O'Brien's staff at Boston 
College. ``In other ways, it couldn't help but be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, looking for a coach after the firing of Randy Ayers,  
called O'Brien. Feeling betrayed by his alma mater, O'Brien closed 
his eyes and jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Boston loves Jimmy,'' said assistant coach Paul  
Biancardi who also came with him to Columbus. ``It's always tough 
when you leave someplace where you've been for 11 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Again, O'Brien has adapted. He is idolized after guiding Ohio  
State from an 8-22 record a year ago to 27-8 and its first Final 
Four in 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughters are out on their own -- Erin, 23, is an assistant  
women's basketball coach at Vanderbilt, Amy, 22, lives and works in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fortunate that both were well-grounded kids,'' O'Brien  
said. ``I'm not sure it was me who got them through it or them who 
got me through it.''

<HEADLINE>  Kwan Falls and Drops to Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan badly hurt her chances  
for keeping the women's title at the World Figure Skating 
Championships when she fell today on a jump in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan went down to the ice on a double axel -- normally a simple  
jump for her -- and had trouble landing the first part of her triple 
lutz-double toe loop combination. She was marked down in technical 
merit from 5.1 to 5.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Her presentation marks, mostly 5.8 and 5.9 with a 5.6, put her  
fourth after the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Maria Butyrskaya took advantage of Kwan's mistakes to  
move into first place with a sultry number to ``St. James Infirmary 
Blues.'' She won the short program with marks between 5.7 and 5.8 
with a solo 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya was rated best by all nine judges.  
</P>
<P>
	Her Russian teammate Julia Soldatova was second and France's  
Vanessa Gusmeroli was third. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kwan to win the title on Saturday she has to take the free  
skating portion -- not impossible for Kwan. However, Butyrskaya has 
to finish third or worse. If the Russian is second, she will take 
the title no matter how well Kwan skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I don't control my own destiny,'' Kwan said of her chances  
of retaining her title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance final later today, the free routine will decide  
the title between champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov 
and the French duo of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan caught a cold on her way to Finland and was forced to take  
antibiotics earlier in the week to improve her condition in time 
for three skates within 75 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I've been crying, so I'm congested'' again, she  
said after her program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although obviously shaken by her performance, she vowed to  
marshal the discipline that she's noted for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the name of the game is to believe in yourself,'' she  
sid. 
</P>
<P>
	She did enough to win her qualification group easily with six  
triples, although she cut another triple down to a double at the 
end of her program. 
</P>
<P>
	However, from the start of the short program Kwan seemed  
tentative. She lost her balance in the air on the opening jump but 
salvaged a one-foot landing and went into the second part slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she barely got off the ice for her double axel and crumbled  
as she landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even her spins and spirals seemed to lack the sparkle had  
highlighted her performances in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan will skate last on Saturday.

<HEADLINE>  Kwan Falls and Drops to Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan badly hurt her chances  
for keeping the women's title at the World Figure Skating 
Championships when she fell today on a jump in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan went down to the ice on a double axel -- normally a simple  
jump for her -- and had trouble landing the first part of her triple 
lutz-double toe loop combination. She was marked down in technical 
merit from 5.1 to 5.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Her presentation marks, mostly 5.8 and 5.9 with a 5.6, put her  
fourth after the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Maria Butyrskaya took advantage of Kwan's mistakes to  
move into first place with a sultry number to ``St. James Infirmary 
Blues.'' She won the short program with marks between 5.7 and 5.8 
with a solo 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya was rated best by all nine judges.  
</P>
<P>
	Her Russian teammate Julia Soldatova was second and France's  
Vanessa Gusmeroli was third. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kwan to win the title on Saturday she has to take the free  
skating portion -- not impossible for Kwan. However, Butyrskaya has 
to finish third or worse. If the Russian is second, she will take 
the title no matter how well Kwan skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I don't control my own destiny,'' Kwan said of her chances  
of retaining her title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance final later today, the free routine will decide  
the title between champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov 
and the French duo of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan caught a cold on her way to Finland and was forced to take  
antibiotics earlier in the week to improve her condition in time 
for three skates within 75 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I've been crying, so I'm congested'' again, she  
said after her program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although obviously shaken by her performance, she vowed to  
marshal the discipline that she's noted for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the name of the game is to believe in yourself,'' she  
sid. 
</P>
<P>
	She did enough to win her qualification group easily with six  
triples, although she cut another triple down to a double at the 
end of her program. 
</P>
<P>
	However, from the start of the short program Kwan seemed  
tentative. She lost her balance in the air on the opening jump but 
salvaged a one-foot landing and went into the second part slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she barely got off the ice for her double axel and crumbled  
as she landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even her spins and spirals seemed to lack the sparkle had  
highlighted her performances in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan will skate last on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, Alexei Yagudin used his quad to create the difference  
between him and Yevgeny Plushenko to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss took the bronze medal. Weiss  
grazed the ice with his free leg on his quad attempt, not getting 
credit for it. Another American, Tim Goebel, completed the first

<HEADLINE> F-16 Crashes Near Arizona Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An F-16 fighter crashed this morning during a  
training mission west of Phoenix, the fifth warplane out of Luke 
Air Force Base to go down since October, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-seat F-16 crashed about 22 miles southwest of the  
training base in suburban Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot ejected safely and was taken to the base hospital for  
examination, said base spokeswoman Mary Jo May. The pilot's 
identity was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	May had no details of what caused the crash.  
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said they heard the plane's engines sputtering and  
reported the plane appeared to be on fire as it went down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a big ball of fire going across, then he hit the  
ground,'' said Willie Falcido, a maintenance man who saw the crash 
from the roof of an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was the fifth since October involving an F-16 at Luke,  
the largest F-16 training base in the world. Pilots fly more than 
100,000 sorties out of the base each year.

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Aims To Keep Dream Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- If any team in America knows what  
it's like to have no chance, it's Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	They've come this far, from the emptiness and frustration of an  
8-22 season all the way to the Final Four in one year. The Buckeyes 
are not ready to stop dreaming just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach said we're playing with the house money right now,''  
guard Brian Brown said. ``Nobody expected Ohio State to be in the 
Final Four. I think we've messed up a lot of people's pools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (27-8) plays Connecticut (32-2) today in a national  
semifinal game that some view as a prelude to the main event, Duke 
and Michigan State. If people want to overlook the Buckeyes, that's 
fine with them. 
</P>
<P>
	But remember, to get here they've already knocked off No.  
1-seeded Auburn and St. John's -- two pretty impressive upsets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we're playing an undercard,'' said Scoonie Penn,  
whose emergence as a sensational scorer and floor leader sent the 
Buckeyes on this improbable journey. ``We probably don't get spoken 
about as much as the other teams. They're the No. 1 seed, we're the 
No. 4 seed. I feel like we've been in that situation all season, 
playing the underdog role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the understatement of the tournament. Ohio State was  
pitiful last year, going 1-15 in the Big Ten. Penn, who followed 
coach Jim O'Brien from Boston College, had to watch from the 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, O'Brien convinced Penn and backcourt-mate Michael Redd  
that the losing would stop. It's hard to imagine that O'Brien, even 
in his most optimistic dreams, envisioned this. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made guys believe in this program,'' Penn said. ``When I  
first arrived here, I don't think anyone in this basketball program 
really knew how to win anymore. It was time to turn this around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borrowing a trick from Pat Riley (``Three-Peat'') and John  
Calipari (``Refuse to Lose''), O'Brien has coined a phrase for this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't settle,'' O'Brien said. ``It would be very easy for us  
to just walk in and say, `You know, fellas, if you lose, this has 
been great. Nobody's going to have anything but nice things to say 
about you.' We've achieved more than anyone could have thought we 
would have.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this what we want to have? Or do we want to try to get a  
little bit more?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Ohio State keeps going may depend on the guard matchups.  
</P>
<P>
	Penn and UConn's Khalid El-Amin don't know each other from way  
back, the way their coaches do. They do know how to run a team, 
motivate everyone who crosses their path and turn 5-foot-10 bodies 
into catalysts that seem perfectly built for the last weekend in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could play basketball at 5-6 or 6-4,'' UConn coach Jim  
Calhoun said of his star point guard. ``He's a kid with some great 
ability as far as quickness, shooting strength. But the greatest 
asset for him is his character and mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to win every single drill, every single scrimmage and  
every single game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially the one against Ohio State.

<HEADLINE> Iberia Airlines Pilots Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- More than 50 Iberia airline flights were  
canceled Friday as the carrier's pilots began a planned eight-day 
strike that threatens to create havoc for travelers during the 
Easter holiday period. 
</P>
<P>
	The flights canceled included 11 to Germany, Switzerland,  
Portugal and the Netherlands. The remainder were domestic flights, 
Iberia spokeswoman Consuelo Arias said. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement between the company and the Spanish Airline Pilots  
Union, SEPLA, will ensure that 95 percent of Iberia's roughly 800 
daily flights will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides met Friday in the dispute over delays in signing a  
new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	SEPLA says Iberia has declined to sign a final version of the  
labor agreement and is trying to renegotiate some of the terms, 
such as bonuses for pilots who fly at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Iberia, which the government plans to privatize, estimated that  
some 200 flights will be canceled during the first four days of the 
strike. It was not known how many may be affected during the final 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancelations are expected to mean about $100 million in  
losses for the airline.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Falls at World Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan can do a double axel with  
her eyes closed. But with her eyes open in the World Figure Skating 
Championships, the tearful Kwan fell on the jump Friday and dropped 
to fourth place after the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if her sparkle and skill come back for Saturday's final,  
she can retain her title only if Maria Butyrskaya of Russia 
falters. Butyrskaya took first place in a routine combining 
precision and allure to the seductive wail of ``St. James 
Infirmary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runner-up Julia Soldatova of Russia and third-place Vanessa  
Gusmeroli of France both said they were surprised to find 
themselves ahead of Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michelle is still the best skater,'' Gusmeroli said.  
</P>
<P>
	If Kwan regains her top form Saturday, even Butyrskaya would be  
hard-pressed to beat her in the long program. But under a new 
scoring system that was introduced this year, in which the 
qualification round counts for 20 percent, Butyrskaya could win the 
title even if she places second behind Kwan in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya has had a tendency to slip at critical times, such as  
falling twice at the Grand Prix finals. But she also can rise to 
the occasion, as at the Russian nationals where she hit seven 
triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan is more consistent, but has off days. She expressed  
confidence Friday that she could win the free skate, but knows that 
ultimately the title is Butyrskaya's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't control my own destiny,'' she said, after crying  
backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan caught a cold en route to Helsinki and said, ``I haven't  
been on all week,'' adding she was still surprised at missing the 
double axel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can close my eyes and do it. This time, I was wide awake and  
couldn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kwan had looked increasingly assured during practices,  
she appeared tentative almost from the beginning Friday. Before 
missing the double axel, she had trouble landing the first part of 
a triple lutz-double toe loop combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Her technical marks ranged from 5.1 to 5.4, but were stronger on  
presentation with mostly 5.8s and 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldatova and Gusmeroli are solid, appealing skaters, but no  
challenges to a top-form Butyrskaya. Tatiana Malinina of Uzbekistan 
is the only skater other than Kwan considered to have much chance 
of knocking Butyrskaya to third in the free program. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina, who beat Butyrskaya at the Grand Prix finals two weeks  
ago, was short of her best Friday, finishing fifth in a program 
that was wan but free of major errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan's performance was not the only surprise for the Americans.  
Sarah Hughes ended the short program in ninth place, higher than 
expected for a 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly pleased, Hughes was able to shrug off an anomalous low  
technical mark of 4.4 from the Austrian judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I have to try harder to impress the Austrian judge,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance final, Russians Angelika Krylova and Oleg  
Ovsiannikov retained the title with an unconventional free dance 
that placed them ahead of France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal 
Peizerat, who had led after the original dance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov appeared to be having a ball as they  
danced to the music of African drums. The syncopated rhythms, with 
no melody, had unsettled traditionalists when the pair first used 
it last year, but they have stuck with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Annisina and Peizerat took a more conventional approach with  
their music, using the ``Man in the Iron Mask'' soundtrack, but 
used a unique move in which she lifts him off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz placed third.

<HEADLINE> Nomura Has One-Time Losses of $4.6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's leading investment house, Nomura Securities  
Co., has disclosed one-time losses of about $4.6 billion after 
pumping money into an affiliated finance company, making it the 
latest victim of plunging Tokyo real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the losses reflect the poor performance of Nomura's U.S.  
subsidiary, Nomura America Holding Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura said Friday that it will give 348 billion yen, or $2.9  
billion, to Nomura Finance Co. in April. The company, which 
specializes in real estate lending through the sale of securities 
backed by mortgages, also received 371 billion yen from Nomura in 
the fiscal year that ended in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a decade of falling real estate prices and a lackluster  
stock market have left many of Japan's financial firms struggling 
with a huge bad debt burden, and Nomura said it will need billions 
in bank loans to foot the bill for its unit's latest problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura Securities also said it was recording a one-time loss of  
$1.4 billion at its U.S. subsidiary, Nomura America Holding, Inc., 
a unit it also has bailed out in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	It will incur other extraordinary losses from the sale of  
securities and because of more stringent accounting standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura's parent company in Japan still expects a pretax profit  
of about $2 billion for the fiscal year ending Wednesday, said 
Kenichi Watanabe, a director at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	But he declined to comment on Nomura's consolidated earnings  
forecast, which includes the operations of majority-owned 
affiliates, saying only that the company will announce earnings 
results in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura did not expect to have to provide any more aid to its  
finance affiliate, said Toshiaki Ito, an executive managing 
director at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Nomura Finance will halt new lending and try to  
recover its outstanding loans as soon as possible. The unit will 
try to cut its operations by two-thirds by March 2001, Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
	To help cover the cost of the bailout, Nomura Securities asked  
six banks for loans totaling 460 billion yen, or about $3.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. unit of Nomura Securities expects its holdings of  
mortgage-backed securities to fall to about $7 billion at the end 
of this month, from $9 billion in September, said Watanabe. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura had to inject $530 million into the U.S. unit in  
September to help offset pretax losses of about $700 million for 
the six months ended Sept. 30.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Begins Selling Furbys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Furby and fries, please.  
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's on Friday launched a Happy Meal promotion featuring  
one of the hottest toy sellers during last year's holiday season -- 
Furby -- hoping to enjoy the same success it has had with Teenie 
Beanie Baby promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers buying a children's meal will get one of 80 different  
varieties of Furby, an odd-looking creature that will either blink, 
wiggle its ears, growl or move its feet. Unlike the larger versions 
manufactured by Tiger Electronics, however, the McDonald's toy is 
not electronic and does not speak. 
</P>
<P>
	At a restaurant in Los Angeles, Roberta Berne turned the  
bug-eyed plastic toy over with a bemused expression and hoped her 
two children would like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does look a little silly,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's said it has ordered tens of millions of the creatures  
for the promotion, which lasts through April 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is giving away 3,500 full-size Furby in  
contests tied to its Monopoly game contest that also is currently 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain's Teenie Beanie Baby promotions over the past two  
years have been so successful that McDonald's this spring is 
expected to launch a third incarnation.

<HEADLINE> Youth Baseball a Cuban Passion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The ping of an aluminum bat hitting a ball rings  
across the diamond. Tiny feet stir the infield's dust. Parents rise 
to their feet to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball field at Brothers to the Rescue Memorial Park is  
alive with cries of ``Good swing!'' and ``Watch the ball!'', 
interspersed with shouts in Spanish: ``Corre! Corre!'' and ``Sigue! 
Sigue!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds on a team called the  
Reds are of Cuban descent. Baseball is a passion their parents and 
grandparents brought across the Florida Straits when they fled 
their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	But many parents say it's wrong for the Baltimore Orioles to  
travel to Havana to play an exhibition game Sunday against the 
Cuban national team. They say the Cuban government has spilled too 
much blood for such a game to be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't go,'' Vicente Alvarez said as he watches his  
grandson through the dugout's chain-link fence. ``Most of the 
people I talk to agree with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez lists his reasons: 41 Cubans trying to escape the island  
who died in 1994 when their tugboat was rammed by Cuban government 
vessels; four men who died in 1996 when their unarmed airplanes 
were shot from the sky by Cuban military jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballpark in suburban Miami was named in honor of those four  
fliers, who belonged to the exile group Brothers to the Rescue. But 
as the boys jog in from the field after an inning, their minds seem 
to be on hitting -- not history. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Jonathan Alvarez, 6, runs to the dugout and leans  
against the chain-link fence, slipping his hands through the wire 
to greet his grandfather, who arrived late. Alvarez grips his 
grandson's tiny fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jonathan, did you bat?'' he asks in Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
	``Si,'' the boy answers. ``A home run.''  
</P>
<P>
	The teams compete in the Flagami Khoury League -- the same league  
Jose Canseco of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays once played in. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping score for the Reds with a pencil and notebook is  
Marisela Rodriguez-Blair. A lover of baseball, she says she has 
mixed emotions about the Orioles game. But she comes down against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think that they have no business there,'' she says.  
``Goodwill starts in the United Nations, not in the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She comforts her son, Bryan Blair, when the 6-year-old walks in  
after being called out and tosses his helmet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know that I love you more than anybody in this world?  
And I'm proud of you, even when you get an out,'' she says. ``Now, 
get your gloves,'' she tells the boys, sending them back to the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``My kid has a very hot temper. It's part of being Cuban, I  
think,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in South Florida, scores of Cuban exiles have  
protested the Havana game and a second meeting of the Orioles and a 
Cuban team at Camden Yards on May 3. They argue the games are 
particularly inappropriate after the Cuban government's recent 
crackdown on political dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will be the first major league team to play a game  
on the island since 1959. ESPN plans to televise the game. But Juan 
Malagon, coach of the Reds' opponents, the Marlins, says he will 
not watch. 
</P>
<P>
	He says Cuban President Fidel Castro will use the spectacle to  
profit politically, declaring it a victory for the Cuban 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Malagon says even his 6-year-old son Ronald knows what to say  
about the bearded man in olive fatigues. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Fidel comes on television, I ask him, `Who's that?' And  
he tells me, `That's the devil, papa.' I taught him,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game is finished, the Reds win 24-10. The team's coach  
calls it the best game of the season. The boys gather near the 
plate, assemble into two lines and give each other high-fives. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Temperature Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A temperature change of only a few degrees can  
disrupt a community of animals, according to a researcher who 
studied how hot and cold affects the delicate balance of starfish 
and mussels in Oregon's tidal waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Sanford of Oregon State University said his study,  
published today in the journal Science, suggests that if a key 
species in a community of animals is particularly sensitive to 
temperatures, a slight warming or cooling can start a whole cascade 
of rapid changes affecting every animal in an ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said in an interview that he found a 5-degree change in  
temperature is enough to change dramatically the feeding habits of 
the starfish, a five-armed creature that feeds mainly on mussels 
and is common along the Pacific coast of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding, said Sanford, has important implications for  
understanding the effects of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people have assumed that the effects of climate change  
would be gradual,'' the researcher said in an interview. ``But this 
shows that if an important species in a community is highly 
sensitive to temperature, then the effects of a small temperature 
change can happen rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his study, Sanford tracked the feeding patterns of starfish  
kept in the laboratory at different temperatures. He checked his 
results by manipulating the population of starfish and mussels in 
two areas along the Oregon coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford found that a temperature drop of 5 degrees caused the  
starfish to virtually stop feeding on the mussels. This allows the 
mussels to rapidly expand in population. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, when the water temperature was increased by 5  
degrees, Sanford said starfish went on a feeding binge, quickly 
reducing the population of mussels. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, he said, there are dramatic changes in the tidal  
community of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	When mussels are not controlled by starfish, said Sanford, their  
population explodes. The mussels attach themselves to every surface 
in the near-shore tidal zone, crowding out barnacles, algae and 
other organisms. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take away the sea stars, then you go from an ecosystem  
with a diverse population of species to a system where there is 
essentially only one species,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	When starfish eat too much, he said, the reef-like mussel  
communities quickly start falling apart. These reefs, Sanford said, 
are homes for crab, sea cucumbers and worms, all important parts of 
the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures along the Oregon coast are affected by upwelling,  
cold deep waters surging to the surface. The frequency of 
upwellings, said Sanford, is determined by winds that, in turn, are 
affected by global temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	If cold upwellings become less frequent, starfish may eat more  
mussels, said Sanford; if the upwellings happen more often, thus 
cooling the tidal waters, starfish will eat less, allowing the 
mussel population to suddenly explode.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Accuse China on Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will formally accuse China  
of wholesale violations of the human rights of its people. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was announced today by the State Department  
spokesman, James P. Rubin, who assured Beijing at the same time 
that the Clinton administration would maintain its policy of 
``engagement'' with China. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Human Rights Commission opened its annual session this  
week in Geneva, Switzerland, with a plea for more efforts to 
prevent abuses and to punish the guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-week commission meeting, allegations of  
violations in countries including Iraq, Sudan and Myanmar as well 
as the Yugoslav province of Kosovo also are likely to be examined. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. decision reflects findings in a report to Congress by  
the State Department that China last year went into reverse on 
human rights after some past signs of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement coincided with one from the Chinese government  
that Premier Zhu Rongi would visit Washington early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. relations with China already are in a downspin over  
suspicions that China pilfered information on miniaturizing nuclear 
warheads from a U.S. laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said a resolution the U.S. delegation planned to introduce  
in late April at the commission meeting in Geneva would reflect the 
``sense of deep concern'' within the administration with China's 
human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``China's human rights record has deteriorated sharply,'' the  
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright notified Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan about  
the U.S. move in Geneva, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Hits 10,000-Rebound Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Patrick Ewing grabbed his 10,000th NBA rebound  
Friday night, becoming the 12th player in the league's history to 
score at least 20,000 points and grab 10,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks center entered the game against Phoenix needing four  
rebounds to reach the milestone. He got it with 3:49 remaining in 
the first quarter on a miss by Suns center Luc Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was stopped briefly while the achievement was announced  
to polite applause from the America West Arena crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, in his 14th NBA season, entered the game with 22,461  
points, 17th on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	The others on the 20,000-point, 10,000-rebound list are Kareem  
Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Elvin 
Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, Robert Parish, Elgin Baylor, Charles

<HEADLINE> UConn Huskies Hope To Stay Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Rip.  
</P>
<P>
	That's Connecticut star Richard Hamilton's nickname. The Huskies  
hope it doesn't describe their delicate physical state going into 
the most important game in school history Saturday against Ohio 
State in the NCAA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	A quickie summary of the Huskies' aches, pains and assorted  
maladies: 
</P>
<P>
	--Jake Voskuhl, their space-filling 6-foot-11 center, has missed  
two games this season with soreness in his left foot that 
temporarily put him on crutches and left him less than 100 percent 
at other times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies need a productive Voskuhl to combat 6-11 Ohio State  
center Ken Johnson, who blocked seven shots and altered the tempo 
of the Buckeyes' regional final victory over St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injury, Voskuhl has practiced as hard as ever during  
workouts that have not changed in length or intensity even during 
the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we change now?'' Voskuhl said. ``We've been doing  
things the same way all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the pregame emphasis placed on two teams driven by star  
guards, coach Jim Calhoun said what the Huskies most need to do is 
rebound the way they did by outrebounding 25 of 34 opponents this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a guy comes up with 17 points, 10 rebounds, if those things  
start happening ... that may determine the game,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kevin Freeman, the 6-7 forward who was the MVP of the Big East  
tournament, has an ear infection that is not considered especially 
worrisome. At least it wasn't serious enough to keep him off the 
team plane. 
</P>
<P>
	--Albert Mouring, a backup guard and one of the Huskies' key role  
players with a 7.4 scoring average, missed the second half of the 
West Regional final against Gonzaga with a sprained right knee. But 
it didn't keep him from going hard in practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss the Final Four? Are you kidding?  
</P>
<P>
	``No way you can miss THAT,'' he said. ``You'd have to be  
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Hamilton, who is 6-foot-6 yet is 15 pounds lighter than 5-10  
point guard Khalid El-Amin, needed right foot surgery in July while 
training for the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he has recovered to score in double figures in all but two  
games, even while battling a deep thigh bruise that limited his 
effectiveness late in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough time, being out, but everybody stuck with me  
and told me it would be all right,'' Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	So all right that the Huskies (32-2) are the only other team  
besides Duke to be No. 1 rated this season. After never reaching 
the Final Four in 20 prior NCAA tournament appearances, the Huskies 
are within two victories of the school's first national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It's pressure, for sure, but probably no more so than they faced  
in the three regional finals they lost under Calhoun -- to UCLA, to 
Duke on a last-second shot by Christian Laettner, to North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference this year, Calhoun said, is ``This team wouldn't  
let anybody get in the way of getting to St. Petersburg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or from Calhoun's son, Jim Jr., of going there for his dad's  
first Final Four appearances in 27 seasons of coaching at 
Northeastern (14) and Connecticut (13). The younger Calhoun's wife, 
Jennifer, gave birth March 5 to the couple's first child, Emily. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Huskies stepped off the team plane Wednesday night,  
Calhoun got his first look at his first grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
	`It's thrilling,'' said Calhoun, who has a 552-227 career  
record. ``She's more beautiful than I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll probably feel the same way if he finds himself cradling  
the NCAA championship trophy Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Brown Is Strong Oakland Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Last fall, when he was campaigning for a  
ballot measure that would enhance his powers, Mayor-elect Jerry 
Brown used the slogan ``Oaklanders for Change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	Three months into Brown's term, three city department heads,  
including the police chief, have been dismissed. The schools chief 
is rumored to be brokering a quiet exit. And Brown and his allies 
are planning to move against the influential port commission. 
</P>
<P>
	As the former California governor and presidential candidate put  
it during a speech to Baptist ministers: ``At some point, there 
must come a day of reckoning, and I say that day has come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the sea change has some feeling queasy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Public safety is something that you just don't play politics  
with,'' said Shannon Reeves, president of the Oakland chapter of 
the NAACP and a leader in the fight to keep Police Chief Joseph 
Samuels Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the change is needed in Oakland, a predominantly  
minority city of about 400,000 that has been hit by earthquake, 
fire, recession and the usual urban ills of poverty and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We voted him in because he would make a change,'' the Rev. Joe  
Smith of Good Hope Baptist Church told The Oakland Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal of Samuels, Oakland's first black police chief,  
was perhaps the most controversial of Brown's moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was among a group of about 200 Samuels supporters who  
swept into a City Council meeting in March to argue their case. The 
group later marched to Brown's loft-workspace near Jack London 
Square, shouting, ``Come out! We're the people!'' -- a play on the 
name of Brown's grassroots political group, We the People. (Brown 
wasn't in.) 
</P>
<P>
	The chief's supporters said crime and complaints of police  
brutality went down on Samuels' watch, a relatively rare 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown said the figures didn't go down far enough. Oakland  
had 81 homicides last year; twice-as-big San Francisco had 63. The 
man once known as ``Gov. Moonbeam'' for some of his flakier 
pronouncements made fighting crime a key part of his mayoral 
campaign and said the crime rate must go down if he's to pull off 
his bold scheme of repopulating downtown in a burst of ``elegant 
density.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown exercised his new ``strong mayor'' powers to demand and  
receive the resignations of Samuels, the director of public works 
and the personnel director. Formerly, the city manager had more 
day-to-day authority than the mayor over the governing of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong-mayor measure didn't give him control over the city's  
troubled schools, but Brown has surmounted that obstacle with the 
aid of state Sen. Don Perata, a longtime political force in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Perata has drafted a bill that would appoint a state team to  
audit the district and report back to a board appointed and led by 
Brown. Under the legislation, Brown could also take a major role in 
appointing a new school administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The district has long been criticized for low test scores and  
controversial moves such as its embrace of ebonics, or black 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	School Superintendent Carole Quan has also come under fire over  
the district's spending of more than $300,000 to investigate the 
suspected embezzlement of a reported $30,000 from a high school 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the payment problem is not his primary concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``My issue is the education of the children in Oakland, which is  
deficient, and instead of blaming the families and the kids, I hold 
the superintendent and her leadership team as the primary 
responsible party,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making waves was a move, again through legislation that  
would be proposed by Perata, to put Brown on the Board of Port 
Commissioners and let him appoint two members. The board, which 
controls the airport and 19 miles of shoreline, consists of 
appointees of former Mayor Elihu Harris, including his wife, who 
was named just months before Harris left office. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the upheaval, there are no indications Brown's support --  
he got 59 percent of the vote over 10 other mayoral candidates, and 
his ``strong mayor'' powers were overwhelmingly approved -- has 
significantly eroded. 
</P>
<P>
	While one group of ministers has counseled Brown to slow down,  
another group has come out in support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heat's on,'' the mayor said with a laugh, ``and if you  
can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.''

<HEADLINE> Howdy Doody in Custody Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Howdy Doody, the freckle-faced puppet  
that entertained millions of American children in the 1950s, is in 
the middle of a custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
	A Detroit museum and the family of a Connecticut puppeteer who  
used to pull the marionette's strings are in a legal tug-of-war for 
the original redheaded doll in cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
	Howdy is sitting in a safe deposit box in Connecticut while the  
case plays out in federal court in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Institute of Arts, which has one of the largest  
collections of historically significant puppets in North America, 
is accusing Rufus Rose's three sons of purloining the puppet. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum claims in its lawsuit that Rose and ``Buffalo Bob''  
Smith, the host of ``The Howdy Doody Show,'' agreed years ago to 
donate the original 27-inch-tall wooden puppet to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Howdy Doody is one of the most significant TV icons from the  
'50s and '60s. The original puppet would have great historical 
significance, both in terms of television history and for a 
collection of puppets,'' said Stuart D. Rosen, an attorney for the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rose family claims that the puppeteer did think about  
leaving the doll to the museum but was not legally obligated to do 
so and ultimately chose not to do it in his will. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1947 to 1960, NBC aired more than 2,500 live episodes of  
the show. Buffalo Bob, Howdy, Clarabell the mute clown and other 
characters from Doodyville, U.S.A., were a regular part of the 
lives of millions of baby boomers. Buffalo Bob would shout, ``Say, 
kids, what time is it?'' and the Peanut Gallery -- the kiddie studio 
audience -- would scream: ``It's Howdy Doody time!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose and his wife, Margaret, created the original Howdy Doody  
puppet and replicas of it at their design studio in Waterford. 
Copies of Howdy -- without the strings -- were taken on the road for 
public appearances, and one of those was bequeathed in 1980 to the 
Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Buffalo Bob wanted to hit the road again, visiting  
college campuses and military bases to make a living. In a letter 
to Buffalo Bob, Rose said he would lend him ``the one and only 
original Howdy,'' but there was a catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBC conveyed ownership of all the Howdy Doody marionettes to  
me with the provisions that I not use them in any commercial manner 
as the characters from the `Howdy Doody Show,' and that Howdy 
himself eventually be placed in the care of The Detroit Institute 
of the Arts,'' Rose wrote. ``I hand Howdy on to you with this 
mutual understanding and responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose died in 1975. Just before Buffalo Bob died last July, he  
returned Howdy to the Rose family. The family now refuses to hand 
Howdy over. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank N. Eppinger, the attorney for Rose brothers, said the  
letter is not legally binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's son Christopher said Friday that Howdy Doody has special  
value to the family. ``It's certainly a part of Americana. It's 
part of my parents' career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he wanted to sell the celebrated doll, Rose said the  
family has no plans for the puppet at this point. However, he said 
Howdy has been appraised at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum interim director Maurice D. Parrish said he considers the  
puppet to be priceless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about the original Howdy Doody,'' Parrish said.  
``By having the puppet here, it guarantees that it will continue to 
be available to the public, and as a museum, we can provide for its 
preservation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No trial date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Orioles-Cuba Tickets by Invitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban baseball fans got the news Friday on  
government radio and television: 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets for Sunday's exhibition game between the Baltimore  
Orioles and a national Cuban team will be by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
	The invitations will go to organizations linked to the  
government, such as schools and sports clubs. Those not among the 
lucky ticket-holders can watch on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not invited to the game, which I want to see so much!''  
said Salvador Aguilar Martinez, part of a group of baseball fans at 
Central Park and unhappy about the decision to make the game an 
invitation-only event. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans of all ages and walks of life are waiting for this  
moment, which will give them a chance to see how their players 
stand up beside the major leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Marlins,'' said Sergio Giral, who was among about  
100 people Friday at Central Park, a gathering spot for those who 
like to argue baseball. ``I would support moves to see other big 
league teams come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At last we are going to see some tough baseball,'' said Miguel  
Marquez, 65, among the fans gathered at the Latinoamericano Stadium 
to discuss the baseball showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sunday game will be marvelous,'' Marquez added. ``I have  
waited a long time for this moment. Anything can happen in a 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brigades of workers Friday cleaned up the field at the old  
stadium, which since 1961 has been the site of all the national 
Cuban baseball tournaments. Later in the evening, the hometown 
Industriales played the Santiago team in a series final. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Communist Party daily Granma played down the  
exhibition game in favor of the national playoffs, calling them ``a 
true fiesta of the people that will decide the national champions 
of Cuban baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The precise time of the Orioles' arrival in Havana was being  
kept secret in Cuba and Miami, where their charter plane will take 
off for the short flight. Sports officials said the team was 
expected to arrive Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will start Scott Erickson against one of two  
right-handers: Jose Ibar, who has a record of 38-5 in the last two 
Cuban championships; and Pedro Luis Lazo, known for his mean 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Cubans played a big league team on the island was  
in March 1959 -- three months after the triumph of the revolution 
that brought Fidel Castro to power. The Los Angeles Dodgers won the 
exhibition game with Cincinnati.

	NATO Begins More Airstrikes  
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO has launched a third night of airstrikes  
in Yugoslavia, the Pentagon said today, calling the allied 
operation against Serb targets large, involving air-launched cruise 
missiles and U.S. stealth fighter jets. The NATO attack began with 
cruise-missile-equipped B-52 bombers leading the assault, Pentagon 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. Also in the mix were F-117 stealth 
fighter jets equipped with laser-guided munitions. Bacon also 
confirmed that NATO warplanes shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet 
fighters over neighboring Bosnia.

	Clinton Appeals to Serbian People

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed directly to the  
Serb people today for support in NATO's struggle against Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. ``He has jeopardized Kosovo's future 
and brought you more war,'' Clinton said in a satellite-beamed 
message he labeled ``the plain truth.'' With Yugoslav authorities 
tightly controlling the media in Belgrade, administration officials 
said the purpose of Clinton's broadcast, and a similar one by 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the local Serbo-Croatian 
language, was to explain to the Serb people why NATO bombers had 
attacked their country.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian was convicted today of  
second-degree murder and delivery of a controlled substance for 
giving a lethal injection to an ailing man whose death was shown on 
CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes.'' It was the first time in five trials that 
``the suicide doctor'' was found guilty. Kevorkian, 70, could get a 
life term for the death of 52-year-old Thomas Youk, who suffered 
from Lou Gehrig's disease. Kevorkian served as his own attorney 
during the short trial and repeatedly stumbled over legal 
procedure.

	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- After 25 years of lawsuits, studies and  
protests, the nation's first nuclear dump -- deep beneath the New 
Mexico desert -- received its first truckload of radioactive waste 
today. The truck left Los Alamos National Laboratory and traveled 
270 miles south to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad. 
Ultimately, up to 6.2 million cubic feet of waste generated since 
the dawn of the atomic age will be entombed over the next 30 years 
in the salt beds nearly a half-mile below ground.

Ligtenberg, who took over the closer's role after Mark Wohlers 
experienced control problems, had 30 saves in 34 chances last

	Mass Killings Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces executed scores of  
Kosovo Albanians and shelled numerous villages as fighting raged 
today throughout the province despite NATO air attacks, ethnic 
Albanian sources said. The dead reportedly include a prominent 
lawyer and his two sons who were arrested on the first day of the 
attacks. Those could not be independently confirmed because 
international monitors withdrew last week and Serb authorities 
expelled foreign journalists. NATO officials stressed today that 
the air attacks were the beginning of what could be a long 
operation to make President Milosevic end his offensive in Kosovo.

peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The pilots were captured in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by the peacekeeping forces, alliance spokesman 
Jamie Shea said. U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin

is to force President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a peace deal

Belgrade and bombs hit suburban targets, the station reported. NATO 
officials said today that allied aircraft had flown 400 sorties 
against Yugoslavia in the first two days of air operations and had 
struck 50 targets, all air defense and related facilities. They 
said the attacks have been a successful start to forcing President 
Slobodan Milosevic to cooperate on a peace deal for Kosovo.

similar GOP-written budgets for fiscal 2000 calling for $778

surpluses for domestic spending and a smaller tax cut.

38 of which were probably caused by the medicine, they told a panel

told the panel that Rezulin helps many patients, and the benefits

<HEADLINE> Fidelity Limits Phone Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fidelity Investments is cutting off phone  
privileges for 30,000 investors who jam the company's lines, some 
calling every hour, with routine queries for stock quotes and 
account balances. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutual fund giant is now routing calls from these customers  
to representatives who've been instructed not to answer such 
questions. Instead, the callers will be directed to Fidelity's 
automated telephone and Internet systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been blacklisted,'' said Joseph Bellock, a  
special counsel in the New York State Attorney General's office and 
one of the frequent callers cut off by Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity's move is designed to save money: a phone call fielded  
by a human being costs Fidelity an average of $13, while an 
automated phone call costs only $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wouldn't say how frequently a customer had to be  
calling to make the list, which represents a tiny fraction of the 6 
million mutual fund and brokerage accounts at Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 34 of the 30,000 customers singled out as frequent callers  
have complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity receives about 680,000 calls a day, 77 percent of which  
are handled by automated systems. Most mutual fund customers call 
four or five times a year, while those who trade stocks in a 
brokerage account call an average of 15 times a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Fidelity sent letters to 25,000 customers who call  
repeatedly for balances, quotes or other information, instructing 
them on how to use its Web site or automated phone system instead. 
The same letter was sent to 5,000 customers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	David O'Leary, an industry analyst at Alpha Equity Research in  
Portsmouth, N.H., applauded Fidelity's move, saying the customers 
who call so frequently are just lazy, retired or have nothing else 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more they can drive their customers to the Internet, the  
more they reduce their costs,'' said O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	The frequent callers will still be able to talk to a phone  
representative to ask more complicated questions, said Anne 
Crowley, a Fidelity spokeswoman. Many people simply need 
instruction on how to use the automated systems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people, once they've been shown it, said, 'This was  
great,''' Crowley said.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mellon Bank will keep some branches open on  
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day to allay the fears of account 
holders who are concerned about Y2K -- the Year 2000 computer bug.

<P>
	Some computers were not designed to recognize the year 2000 and

open branches because anxious customers might want to come in. 
Mellon banks also stayed open during a bank holiday declared by

<HEADLINE> Syracuse Settles Harassment Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Two former Syracuse tennis players who  
filed a sexual harassment suit against the school reached a 
settlement Friday, three days before the trial was to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount awarded to Dacia Kornechuk, Kirsten Ericson and their  
families was kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericson, who graduated last year, and Kornechuk, a senior, were  
seeking $762 million in damages in the lawsuit, which was filed 
last May in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Both women quit the 
tennis team in 1997 after they filed a complaint with the 
university's sexual harassment office against women's coach Jesse 
Dwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornechuk, of Peabody, Mass., and Ericson, of Saranac Lake,  
N.Y., alleged that Dwire harassed them in the two ways forbidden by 
the university's sexual harassment policy -- hostile environment 
harassment and quid pro quo harassment, in which a superior demands 
sexual favors in exchange for job or academic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The main issue: Massages repeatedly given by Dwire in his office  
and when the team was on the road. The two former players said that 
Dwire gave them massages that were unwelcome and sexual in nature, 
and that Dwire behaved inappropriately throughout their time on the 
team, conducting sex-related conversations about their personal 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwire, 52, has never commented on the allegations against him,  
but he denied the massages were sexual in nature and said his 
physical therapy experience was one reason he was hired by the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	The university denied virtually all of the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Dwire was suspended by the university when the charges were  
filed. After an investigation by the school, a five-member hearing 
panel found that statements made by Dwire in one instance violated 
the school's sexual harassment policy and in another violated its 
discrimination policy. The panel found that other accusations 
against Dwire did not constitute violations of university policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also voted 3-2 to suspend Dwire without pay for two  
years. But Neil Strodel, associate vice president for human 
resources, shortened the suspension to three months, citing among 
other things the absence of other allegations of harassment during 
Dwire's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	That suspension ended in September 1997, and Dwire, after  
accepting counseling, returned to coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women appealed Strodel's decision, calling the hearing  
process ``a total sham.'' According to Ericson, the appeal was 
rejected by Eleanor Gallagher, vice president for human resources 
and government relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other former members of the Syracuse women's tennis team  
have since come forward, alleging they also were sexually harassed 
by Dwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The women described incidents of harassment dating back to 1978  
-- the year Dwire became coach.

<HEADLINE> Michigan State, Duke To Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- One team dominated the tough  
Atlantic Coast Conference with an unprecedented 16-0 mark and has a 
31-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The other finished 15-1 in the Big Ten, considered the nation's  
best conference all season, and has won 22 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	So, with the Tale of the Tape apparently so even, why is  
top-ranked Duke such an overwhelming favorite to beat fellow No. 
1-seed Michigan State tonight in the NCAA semifinals? 
</P>
<P>
	``They really are a team with depth and they have a lot of  
things going for them,'' Spartans coach Tom Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams also have an All-American: Duke's sophomore center  
Elton Brand, the only unanimous choice; and Spartans junior guard 
Mateen Cleaves, also on the first team. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (36-1) and Michigan State (33-4) even met during the  
season. The Blue Devils held on for a 73-67 victory in early 
December in the Great Eight in Chicago, one of just two games they 
didn't win by double-digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Duke remains a favorite to beat the Spartans again  
and then win the championship Monday night against Ohio State or 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils lead the nation in scoring (92.9) and average  
margin of victory (25.9), and are second in field-goal percentage 
(51.8). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done a lot of great jobs with a lot of great players,''  
said Izzo, in his first Final Four. ``He doesn't let them get away 
from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He, of course, is Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, who is in his eighth  
Final Four since 1986. He's trying to become just the fourth coach 
to win three national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't feel like we're invincible,'' Krzyzewski  
said. ``I don't think any of our players or coaching staff have 
ever portrayed that mood, that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a fairly young team with five sophomores and a freshman  
in our first eight. With that level of experience we can lose to 
anybody,'' he continued. ``We just have played so hard this year 
and so passionately that we haven't lost except that one time and 
that's been a strength of our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the season and all of March, the talk has been of  
Duke winning its third championship of the '90s, a decade in which 
it's made five trips to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans, however, are fed up with all the hype and are  
ready to prove something themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while it gets on your nerves,'' Michigan State forward  
Andre Hutson said of Duke's aura. ``You just have to look past it 
because they've earned a lot of respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to give the guys credit. They play hard, they've only  
lost one game this season and they have a lot of great players. ... 
You have to turn off the TV sometimes and put away the papers and 
concentrate on what you have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Spartans do what they want to do, it would be one of  
the great Final Four upsets ever.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Files for Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield  
has filed for divorce, six months after a public admission that he 
fathered two children out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield filed papers Friday in Fayette County Superior Court  
to dissolve his 2 1/2-year marriage with Janice Holyfield. The filing 
comes two weeks after Holyfield's boxing stature was tainted in a 
disputed draw with Lennox Lewis in a title unification bout. 
</P>
<P>
	The court document said the marriage ``is irretrievably broken  
and there exists no possibility of reconciliation. The boxer seeks 
joint custody of the couple's 6-month-old son, Elijah, and a 
judgment that would allow him to keep `all of his separate 
property' and `an equitable portion of the marital property.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has nine children, including three with his first  
wife, Paulette, and five others with four women out of wedlock. 
Paulette Holyfield received a divorce settlement of about $4 
million in 1991 after six years of marriage. Infidelity was the 
basis of that divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has grossed $205 million in ring purses during his  
professional career, including $92 million for his past five fights 
during his marriage to the former Dr. Janice Itson, whom he met at 
a religious crusade in Philadelphia in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also built a $15 million, 54,000-square-foot mansion  
in Fayette County south of Atlanta. Holyfield has been living in 
the mansion while his wife and the baby have lived in the boxer's 
older home next door since his public admission of infidelity last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Soars After Refinry Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline futures prices soared Friday on the New York Mercantile  
amid expectations that a fire at a California refinery will divert 
supplies away from the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude, heating oil and natural gas futures also jumped. On other  
commodity markets, gold slumped, while wheat rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures rose to the highest level since October after  
Chevron Corp. reported an explosion and fire had shut down a large 
gas-making unit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how long the unit near San Francisco would be  
shut down. But market participants were worried a spate of recent 
production problems in the West might cause producers to divert gas 
to that region to secure better profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast would suffer most under that scenario since it  
relies on gasoline shipped by pipeline from the Gulf Coast to meet 
consumers' daily driving needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has grown more sensitive to supply concerns following  
a decision by major producing nations to further slash output in a 
bid to boost prices. Mexico recently defaulted on several contracts 
to U.S. customers in a bid to achieve its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Further supporting gas prices are inventory figures released  
this week indicating that demand is at record levels even before 
the peak driving season begins. The American Petroleum Institute 
also revised downward by 1 million barrels its estimate of weekly 
gasoline production. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract for May delivery of light, sweet crude rose 50  
cents to $16.17 a barrel; April heating oil rose 1.29 cents to 
42.74 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline rose 2.22 cents to 
50.63 cents a gallon; April natural gas rose 0.02 cent to $1.855 
for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures slumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange after  
Canada's prime minister called on the International Monetary Fund 
to sell part of its reserves to help poor countries pay their 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Chretien joined a growing number of wealthier nations  
calling for IMF gold sales. Chretien, whose country is the world's 
fourth-largest producer, suggested that as much as 10 million 
ounces should be put on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	That could seriously depress gold prices, and market  
participants said the proposal was significant because it likely 
would hurt Canada's mining industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures prices have been languishing below $300 an ounce  
for months, depressed by low inflation in the United States and 
other industrial countries, as well as central bank decisions to 
sell their holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	April gold fell $3.40 to $279.70 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors  
began positioning ahead of a key government report next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department early Wednesday is set to reveal  
farmer planting intentions for the spring crop, which will provide 
the first concrete estimate of whether producers intend to plant 
more soybeans over corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants are expecting spring wheat acreage to suffer  
most as farmers turn toward crops that have a better chance of 
selling overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also found continued support from market talk that the  
Clinton administration is considering a one-time exemption to bans 
on exports to Iran and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat rose 6 cents to $2.98 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Small Town Crafts Economic Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALVA, Okla. (AP) -- Even Alva officials admit they have little to  
offer when it comes to economic development, nothing that makes the 
little northwestern Oklahoma town stand out from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mayor Stan Kline puts it, the town's greatest attributes are  
a safe environment, a relatively high quality of life and good 
people -- pitches that businesses looking for a new location hear 
from just about every town they consider. Market incentives speak 
louder than anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``These bigger communities, they can actually come up with cash  
money,'' Kline said. ``In a community of less than 5,000 people, it 
takes every dime we generate to run the city. We don't have $3 or 
$4 million to draw a company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the city has come up something experts say is a first, a  
municipal version of Economics 101 that relies on Alva's one truly 
unique resource -- Northwestern Oklahoma State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is simple: enact a 1 percent city sales tax to fund  
scholarships for new students at the college. Supporters say more 
people in town means more money spent at local businesses -- and 
that could make Alva more attractive to industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where you get the economic development, having these  
students living in Alva either in our dorms or in apartments and 
buying things in town,'' Northwestern spokesman Steve Valencia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alva residents will vote on the proposal May 11. Kline said the  
tax would raise about $500,000 per year, which would be split 
between scholarships and development of parks and recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Venable, managing editor of the economic development trade  
journal Site Selection, said many communities collect a local tax 
to fund development efforts. He said using a college as the main 
draw is new. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a community like this has to do, and it sounds like what  
they're doing, is they have to look for that distinctive feature 
and capitalize on that,'' he said. ``It's tough for small 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alva knows. There's no interstate, and its population dipped  
below 10,000 in the last census. It is 110 miles away from Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	With 536 student employees and a payroll of $6.5 million,  
Northwestern is by far Alva's largest employer. Agriculture 
accounts for most of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberal arts and teacher education college has 1,369  
students. Joe Struckle, the university's president for 24 years, 
said the school hopes to double enrollment over the next few years, 
and scholarships would help. 
</P>
<P>
	For the plan to work, Northwestern must be able to attract new  
students to a town with a two-screen movie theater and one that's 
an hour's drive from the nearest shopping malls. One condition of 
the scholarships would be that students must live in Alva. 
</P>
<P>
	Struckle said he believes Alva residents will approve the tax  
measure, but knows he and other supporters have lobbying to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to produce, and we know that,'' he said.  
``By God, you can always give money away.''

<HEADLINE> Irwin Wins Primestar 500 Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH (AP) -- By definition, professional race car drivers  
are fearless. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some great examples of that Friday in the opening  
round of qualifying for the Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, 
where 37 drivers were faster than the previous track record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a horsepower racetrack and it's kind of a gutsy  
racetrack,'' Kenny Irwin said after taking his Robert Yates Racing 
Ford around the reconfigured 1 1/2-mile oval at 190.154 mph -- burying 
the record of 185.906 set last April by Jeremy Mayfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``By no means did I come close to holding it wide open here, but  
it suits us,'' Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin won his first Winston Cup pole in the 1998 season-finale  
at Atlanta Motor Speedway in November. That track is very similar 
to the Texas oval, particularly now that a $3.4 million 
reconfiguration and repaving has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``For whatever reason, these type of configurations are good for  
Robert Yates engines. They're horsepower tracks,'' Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes at Texas Motor Speedway eliminated problem areas in  
turn four and in the transitions from the corners to the 
straightaways on the D-shaped oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all the racetrack,'' last year's top rookie said of the  
jump in speeds. ``The changes they made in (turns) one and two are 
the biggest reasons. The track is just faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, who broke his right shoulder blade when he  
crashed his Busch Series car last week in Darlington, put his car 
on the outside of the front row with a lap of 189.853. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not as sore as I thought I'd be today,'' said Labonte, who  
got relief help from Matt Kenseth after driving the first 45 laps 
of the Winston Cup race Sunday in Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan for Sunday's 500-mile race is for Kenseth, a regular in  
the Busch Series, to stand by in case Labonte needs to get out of 
the car again. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, a Texas native and local favorite, spent most of this  
week working with trainers for the NFL's Carolina Panthers 
rehabilitating his injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow's going to play a big key in how we do it on  
Sunday,'' Labonte said. ``It feels pretty good right now, but we'll 
see how it feels when I get out there with some other cars and run 
a few more laps at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Park, another rookie last year, was a bit of a surprise as  
he took third place on the grid with a lap of 189.341 in a 
Chevrolet. For Park, who missed 15 races last year after a very bad 
crash in Atlanta, it was easily his best qualifying effort. His 
best previous start was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	He was followed by two-time Winston Cup champion Terry Labonte,  
Bobby's older brother, whose Chevy ran 189.122. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward Burton was fifth in a Pontiac at 188.990, followed by the  
Ford of Mark Martin at 188.957, the Chevys of Ken Schrader and Jeff 
Gordon at 188.778 and 188.699 and, rounding out the top 10, the 
Ford of Bill Elliott at 188.587. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton, Ward's younger brother and the current series  
points leader, was expected to contend for the pole on Friday, but 
wound up 20th at 187.311. 
</P>
<P>
	The twenty-five fastest qualifiers locked up starting spots in  
the 43-car field, with the rest of the lineup to be set today 
following the final round of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers who failed to make the top 25 and will have to  
either try again Saturday or stand on their first-day laps were 
former series champions Dale Earnhardt, who was 38th, and Darrell 
Waltrip, 46th of the 48 drivers who made qualifying attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	On a track where crashing was commonplace during the first two  
Winston Cup weekends, the only incident among NASCAR's elite came 
during qualifying when Ken Bouchard smacked the wall hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard, who suffered a concussion, was flown by helicopter to  
a Dallas hospital, where he underwent tests and evaluation. Track 
officials said the driver from Fitchburg, Mass., was awake and 
alert, but was kept overnight for observation.

<HEADLINE> Irwin Wins Primestar 500 Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH (AP) -- Kenny Irwin must like these fast Bruton Smith  
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, who won his first Winston Cup pole in the 1998 season  
finale at Atlanta Motor Speedway in November, set a track record on 
Friday in capturing the top qualifying spot for the Primestar 500 
at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's top rookie cruised around the 1 1/2-mile oval on his  
qualifying lap at 190.154 mph, the fastest of 37 drivers who beat 
the previous record of 185.906, set last April by Jeremy Mayfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The speeds were boosted by a $3.4 million offseason  
reconfiguration and repaving of the track to eliminate problem 
areas in turn four and in the transitions from the corners to the 
straightaways on the D-shaped oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the ovals at which Irwin has won poles are owned by  
Speedway Motorsports Inc., the company headed by Smith that also 
owns and operates four other racetracks. And both are similar in 
look and feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' the 29-year-old Irwin said. ``I don't care  
what anybody says about this racetrack, they've done a great job. 
It's real fast, but I really like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin says he liked it before the changes, winning a NASCAR  
Craftsman Truck Series race here in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, who broke his right shoulder blade when he  
crashed his Busch Series car last week in Darlington, put a Pontiac 
on the outside of the front row with a lap of 189.853.

<HEADLINE> Fed Gov Sees Minor Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer bug shouldn't  
disrupt the U.S. economy enough to cause a national recession, 
Federal Reserve Board Governor Edward Kelley Jr. says. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could have the same effect as a severe snow storm or last  
year's United Parcel Service strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these instances, the shock to our economic infrastructure  
is transitory in nature, and, critically, the recovery process is 
under way before any adverse `feedback' effects are produced,'' he 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said he expects the millennium bug will cause isolated  
disruptions to commerce, as well as to some public services. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fairness, it must be said that if disruptions that occur  
are not isolated events as I have assumed, but rather spread across 
key sectors of the economy by interacting with each other, ... the 
decline in economic activity would prove to be longer lasting and a 
recession could conceivably ensue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem occurs when computers try to add or subtract  
dates using only the last two digits of the year -- 00 in the case 
of 2000 -- which may confuse them into reading the date as 1900. 
That could cause some to give faulty readings, corrupt the data or 
shut down completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is the most senior member of the Fed board, which is the  
governing body of the nation's central bank, which determines 
interest-rate policy, regulates banks and oversees the nation's 
payments system. It is the lender of last resort in financial 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	He says a small percentage of banks overseen by the Fed are not  
progressing satisfactorily in their Y2K preparations. But he 
expects the industry as a whole to be prepared by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing the Year 2000 computer problem likely will cost private  
companies more than $50 billion, Kelley said. He's revised his 
estimate upward since testifying before Congress last spring, but 
he's not sure how much more it will be. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said the federal government is spending just under $7  
billion on the problem, but he doesn't have a good handle on what 
state and local governments are doing to prepare for the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed economists have identified $3.4 billion earmarked by states,  
``but I'm quite confident that number is too low,'' Kelley told a 
group of business students at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate 
School of Management. And that may be where many of the Y2K 
problems occur, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critical, electronically-driven local systems that could be  
vulnerable include water, traffic, police, health and welfare 
services, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, ``One or two malfunctioning traffic  
signals can cause serious congestion, confusion and delay, and the 
breakdown of traffic management systems could cause near total 
gridlock.''

<HEADLINE> EU Endorses Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The European Union today endorsed the creation of  
a Palestinian state by next year, a decision angrily denounced by 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	EU leaders seemed to be trying to compensate Palestinian leader  
Yasser Arafat for his apparent willingness to postpone a unilateral 
declaration of statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip beyond May 
4, the end of the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of a summit in Berlin, EU leaders issued a statement  
urging Israel to wrap up talks with the Palestinians on their 
status within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration appears to leave open the possibility that if a  
final Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement is not in place by then, 
the Europeans may recognize a unilaterally declared Palestinian 
state -- despite Israel's vehement objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians have an unqualified right to self-determination,  
``including the option of a state,'' the EU said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European bloc said it is ``convinced the creation of a  
democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the 
basis of existing agreements and through negotiations would be the 
best guarantee of Israeli security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement drew praise from Palestinian leaders, but  
Netanyahu said the EU seriously undercut its chances of ever 
becoming a Mideast mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans, on whose soil one-third of the Jewish people  
perished, now are telling Israel `accept the solution that you 
oppose and that we say you should have by the year 2000,''' he told 
reporters during a meeting in Jerusalem today with European 
conservative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has persistently turned down Europe's requests for a  
greater role in Mideast negotiations, complaining the 15-nation EU 
is overly sympathetic to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian Cabinet minister Ziyad Abu Ziyad said the statement  
``will be taken into consideration when the Palestinians come to 
take the decision'' on whether to delay the statehood declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat discussed the issue with President Clinton earlier this  
week. He reportedly has been trying to win assurances that if he 
held off on declaring independence in May, a Palestinian state 
would eventually win international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States did not commit to a new deadline, but said  
that after Israel's May 17 election, it would press for speeding up 
final status talks. The negotiations would not be open-ended, U.S. 
officials assured the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Saint Louis Hires Romar As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Lorenzo Romar, who turned around a struggling  
program at Pepperdine and was an assistant for 1995 national 
champion UCLA, today was hired as Saint Louis' basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar replaces Charlie Spoonhour, who retired March 5 after  
seven years at Saint Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	```This is a coach's dream,'' Romar said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported that Romar will earn about  
$400,000 annually, including shoe and television-radio deals. The 
newspaper said Romar made about $125,000 at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar was 19-13 at Pepperdine this season, and 42-44 overall.  
The Wave earned a spot in the National Invitation Tournament, 
losing to Colorado in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine was 10-18 the season before Romar's arrival and 6-21  
in his first season. But the Wave improved to 17-10 the next 
season. This year's team finished second in the West Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar's strength is in recruiting. As an assistant to Jim  
Harrick at UCLA for four years, he helped bring in Toby Bailey, 
Jelani McCoy and Charles O'Bannon, key players on the national 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a proven recruiter and his communications skills with  
his student-athletes are highly regarded,'' Saint Louis athletic 
director Doug Wollard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar played at Washington, then played in the NBA with Golden  
State (1980-83) and Milwaukee (1983-84). He finished his pro career 
averaging about six points and six assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Romar then played for Athletes in Action from 1985-92, serving  
as co-coach from 1989 through 1992.

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw, Peck Earn AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw is leaving Tennessee  
with a lot more in her resume than she expected when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came into Tennessee my freshman year, I said OK,  
hopefully I can play,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I'm going to work hard 
enough to play. Hopefully I can help the team, average 10 points or 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Help the team? Well, Holdsclaw certainly did that. She led  
Tennessee to three national championships and became a first-team 
All-American three times. On Thursday, she became the first woman 
to win The Associated Press player of the year award twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw was an overwhelming choice for the honor in voting by  
AP newspaper and broadcast members nationwide. Purdue's Carolyn 
Peck, who has her team in contention for the national championship 
in just her second season, was named the coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor. It's very exciting,'' Peck said. ``But  
I've got to give credit to my team and my staff. It's been a 
complete team effort the last two years. Any coach who walked into 
the situation I did with the players I had would be blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the most decorated player of her era, also won The AP  
award as a junior last season, when she led Tennessee to a 39-0 
record and its third straight national championship. The Lady Vols 
fell one game short of returning to the Final Four this year, 
losing to Duke in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw, so fluid that she makes the game  
seem effortless, still had an outstanding season. 
</P>
<P>
	She led Tennessee in scoring (21.3) and rebounding (8.1), shot  
52 percent from the field and left thousands of admiring fans 
something to remember by matching her career high of 39 points in 
her final home game, an 89-62 victory over Boston College in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw finished with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, No. 1  
on Tennessee's career list in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been so special,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.  
``She has been a low-maintenance player because she does the right 
things off the floor. She makes good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a joy and an honor to coach Chamique, and I have  
to throw in every once in a while that it has been a challenge,'' 
Summitt said. ``But I like the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for Summitt was to take a great player and help  
make her even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I challenged myself immediately when she signed with  
us,'' Summitt said. ``Because I saw this potential for greatness. I 
don't know if I envisioned three national championships and the 
level of notoriety that Chamique received. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did envision someone very special. So I was very  
challenged because I knew all eyes would be on this player and the 
development of this player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck will join the WNBA's Orlando Miracle as coach and general  
manager when the college season ends, but she has done far more 
than just go through the motions as a lame-duck coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history and  
will take a 32-1 record and 30-game winning streak into the 
national semifinals against Louisiana Tech tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been easy for Peck to coast this season, but  
that's not her style. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask so much of our players,'' she said. ``To feel as a  
staff we were not working as hard as we possibly could would have 
been a disservice to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck counts Summitt among her influences after spending two  
seasons as an assistant at Tennessee. She also spent one year on 
the staff at Kentucky and one season as an assistant to Nell 
Fortner at Purdue. When Fortner left to coach the U.S. national 
team, Peck was promoted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the combination of all of that, plus the staff I have,  
has helped me so much,'' Peck said. ``One thing I've found as a 
head coach, you don't have to feel like you've got to do it all by 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team effort. And I think when our team sees us work as  
a team, they work as a team as well.''

<HEADLINE> Authors Defend Evolution Teaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fearing a growing assault on the teaching of  
Darwin's theories, a group of textbook authors has launched a 
campaign in defense of evolution education. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement, to be released today at the National Science  
Teachers Association, a convention of 20,000 science teachers, 
comes as some public school districts consider softening their 
evolution curricula. 
</P>
<P>
	``As scientists and teachers, we find it unacceptable that  
school districts considering our books for adoption would be 
encouraged to choose one book over another based on the perception 
that teachers should avoid the topic of evolution,'' the statement 
by 23 authors reads. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by the California-based National Center for Science  
Education, the signers include Bruce Alberts, president of the 
National Academy of Sciences and an author of a cell biology book. 
</P>
<P>
	Evolution education continues to raise passions in American  
schools more than 70 years after teacher John Scopes was convicted 
of violating a Tennessee law against teaching it. And the debate 
rages a decade after the Supreme Court ruled that public schools 
can't teach that God created the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last five years, the National Center for Science  
Education has logged scores of complaints from parents and 
educators worried about attacks on evolution education. 
</P>
<P>
	Some school districts have pushed for textbooks that are  
considered ``soft'' on evolution teaching, said Molleen Matsumura 
of the NCSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have advocated disclaimer stickers on texts, such as one  
approved by the Alabama Board of Education in 1995. The Alabama 
label explains that evolution is a theory and that text statements 
about the origins of life should be considered as such. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Melvindale-Northern Allen Park School Board in  
Michigan decided to supply some of its libraries with books that 
raise questions about the validity of evolutionary theory. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Texas last year, school districts across the state were  
urged to adopt textbooks that didn't ``harp on'' evolution, 
Matsumura said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Christian publisher's textbook, ``Of Pandas and People,'' has  
grown in popularity. It, and others like it, subscribe to the 
theory that the world and its living creatures came about by 
``intelligent design.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evolution scientists say that's just code for creationism.  
</P>
<P>
	The evolutionists are ``vastly overreacting to what we're trying  
to accomplish,'' said Raymond G. Bohlin, who has a doctorate in 
molecular biology and heads the Probe Ministries, based in 
Richardson, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	What he and others want, he said, is for evolution to be fairly  
represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are no other theories, the scientists who signed the  
statement say. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching biology without evolution is like teaching physics  
while ignoring gravity, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's academically and intellectually dishonest to teach  
biology any other way,'' said Eric Strauss, author of a popular 
introductory biology textbook and a biology professor at Boston 
College.

<HEADLINE>  Muslim Pilgrims Pray at Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT ARAFAT, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Two million Muslim pilgrims  
dressed in seamless white robes prayed today on this desert 
mountainside, reflecting on their lives in an annual ritual 
considered a foretaste of the day of judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi officials handed out chilled water and juice to the  
faithful, who endured 104-degree heat for the ritual at Mount 
Arafat, a central part of the annual hajj pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday Friday, the mountain plain near Mina, six miles north  
of Mecca, was a sea of white, dotted by the green and black 
umbrellas of those seeking relief from the scorching sun. Medical 
workers rushed to treat those who fainted from the heat, carrying 
some out on stretchers hooked up to motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	All day, hoses sprayed a fine mist on the pilgrims to help them  
stay cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the heat, some pilgrims walked all the way to the top of  
the mountain to pray and beg for mercy at the spot where Islam's 
founder, Prophet Mohammed, gave his final sermon 1,400 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamdouh Mohammed, a 42-year-old Egyptian, was making the  
pilgrimage with his year-old son in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought him here so that he will comprehend Islam at an  
early age,'' Mohammed said. ``I want Allah to see him and instill 
in him the good, pure spirit that every Muslim must have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah was among thousands participating in  
noon prayers at Namrah Mosque on Mount Arafat. An hour-long sermon 
there touched on the ``enemies of Islam,'' singling out those who 
pit weaker Muslim nations against each other or label Muslims as 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Iranian pilgrims chanted ``Death to America!'' and ``Death to  
Israel!'' during a peaceful demonstration inside their camp of 
60,000 at Mount Arafat. Saudi forces did not intervene in the 
rally, which lasted less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, Saudi Arabia bars demonstrations during the hajj  
pilgrimage, but the government has tolerated low-key Iranian 
rallies. In 1987, an Iranian rally led to clashes with Saudi forces 
in which 402 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iranian government insists on holding the protests, known as  
the ``disavowal of infidels,'' during the pilgrimage to denounce 
the United States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	When evening came, the pilgrims traveled three miles to  
Muzdalifah, the next stage in the hajj journey all able-bodied 
Muslims are required to make once if they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilgrims then head to Mina before dawn, where they will cast  
pebbles Saturday at a pillar representing the temptations of Satan. 
They then return to the holy city of Mecca, where more rituals 
follow, including sacrifices of rams or oxen. 
</P>
<P>
	Such sacrifices are carried out throughout the Muslim world  
beginning Saturday, the start of the three-day Islamic holiday of 
Eid al-Adha. Shops and government offices close for the holiday, 
one of the most important on the Islamic calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	This year the ritual at Mount Arafat was performed on Islam's  
holy day, Friday, making this year's hajj a ``greater pilgrimage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sheer numbers making the pilgrimage have made the hajj  
vulnerable to disasters. In 1997, fire tore through an overcrowded 
tent city at Mina, killing more than 340 pilgrims and injuring 
1,500. A stampede last year killed 180 pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi television broadcast short warnings Friday, urging  
pilgrims to avoid carelessly flicking cigarette butts in the tent 
cities where many are housed. Footage of firefighters patrolling 
the sprawling campsites on motorcycles accompanied the warnings.

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw, Peck Earn AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw is leaving Tennessee  
with a lot more in her resume than she expected when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came into Tennessee my freshman year, I said OK,  
hopefully I can play,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I'm going to work hard 
enough to play. Hopefully I can help the team, average 10 points or 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Help the team? Well, Holdsclaw certainly did that. She led  
Tennessee to three national championships and became a first-team 
All-American three times. On Thursday, she became the first woman 
to win The Associated Press player of the year award twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw was an overwhelming choice for the honor in voting by  
AP newspaper and broadcast members nationwide. Purdue's Carolyn 
Peck, who has her team in contention for the national championship 
in just her second season, was named the coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor. It's very exciting,'' Peck said. ``But  
I've got to give credit to my team and my staff. It's been a 
complete team effort the last two years. Any coach who walked into 
the situation I did with the players I had would be blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the most decorated player of her era, also won The AP  
award as a junior last season, when she led Tennessee to a 39-0 
record and its third straight national championship. The Lady Vols 
fell one game short of returning to the Final Four this year, 
losing to Duke in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw, so fluid that she makes the game  
seem effortless, still had an outstanding season. 
</P>
<P>
	She led Tennessee in scoring (21.3) and rebounding (8.1), shot  
52 percent from the field and left thousands of admiring fans 
something to remember by matching her career high of 39 points in 
her final home game, an 89-62 victory over Boston College in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw finished with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, No. 1  
on Tennessee's career list in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been so special,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.  
``She has been a low-maintenance player because she does the right 
things off the floor. She makes good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a joy and an honor to coach Chamique, and I have  
to throw in every once in a while that it has been a challenge,'' 
Summitt said. ``But I like the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for Summitt was to take a great player and help  
make her even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I challenged myself immediately when she signed with  
us,'' Summitt said. ``Because I saw this potential for greatness. I 
don't know if I envisioned three national championships and the 
level of notoriety that Chamique received. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did envision someone very special. So I was very  
challenged because I knew all eyes would be on this player and the 
development of this player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck will join the WNBA's Orlando Miracle as coach and general  
manager when the college season ends, but she has done far more 
than just go through the motions as a lame-duck coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history and  
will take a 32-1 record and 30-game winning streak into the 
national semifinals against Louisiana Tech tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been easy for Peck to coast this season, but  
that's not her style. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask so much of our players,'' she said. ``To feel as a  
staff we were not working as hard as we possibly could would have 
been a disservice to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck counts Summitt among her influences after spending two  
seasons as an assistant at Tennessee. She also spent one year on 
the staff at Kentucky and one season as an assistant to Nell 
Fortner at Purdue. When Fortner left to coach the U.S. national 
team, Peck was promoted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the combination of all of that, plus the staff I have,  
has helped me so much,'' Peck said. ``One thing I've found as a 
head coach, you don't have to feel like you've got to do it all by 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team effort. And I think when our team sees us work as  
a team, they work as a team as well.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Crash Evidence Is Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators are re-interviewing  
three witnesses to last week's deadly Amtrak crash in Illinois who 
gave differing accounts of when a truck driver entered the train's 
path. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence gathered from the scene disagrees with the driver's  
account of the accident, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lauby, the head of the National Transportation Safety  
Board's rail division, said Thursday that investigators' initial 
report on the eyewitnesses did not reconcile the inconsistencies of 
their testimony to his satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is not clear whether they have slightly different  
stories, which he would not detail, because they did not see the 
entire incident, they have incomplete memories or some other 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	A key question is whether the driver of the steel-laden  
tractor-trailer that the train hit 50 miles south of Chicago, 
killing 11, started into the railroad crossing after warning lights 
had started to flash. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for truck driver John R. Stokes has said his client  
did not cause the March 15 crash by attempting to go around the 
crossing gates and beat the oncoming train. But NTSB Chairman Jim 
Hall told a Senate panel looking into the accident that evidence 
suggests the truck driver did try to cross when the lights were 
flashing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the information and data we've collected so  
far tells a different story'' from that of the driver, Hall said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also said a key part of the investigation will focus on  
whether Stokes' employer, Melco Transfer Inc., adequately monitored 
his driving record before allowing him to stay on the road. Ken 
Wykle, head of the Federal Highway Administration, said it appeared 
the company met all federal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash is renewing an old debate in Washington over what can  
be done to keep vehicles out of the nation's 259,000 grade-level 
railroad crossings, where most train accidents and fatalities 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the options discussed before the Senate Transportation  
subcommittee on surface transportation, one given the least 
attention is the one many believe is the most foolproof way to 
reduce accidents: spending the enormous sums needed to either 
eliminate crossings or add high-tech improvements that make it 
virtually impossible for cars to get around gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, talk focused on drivers' responsibility to obey warning  
signs, increasing penalties for those who don't, adding enforcement 
tools such as cameras and encouraging efforts to educate the public 
about the dangers of crossings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wykle said the Federal Highway Administration is ready to issue  
tough new penalties for truck drivers who violate federal rules 
about how to drive through a rail crossing. In the works for a year 
and expected out within a few months, the new regulations would 
suspend the licenses of first-time violators for two months. Fines 
would range from $2,500 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate rules penalizing such truck drivers' employers are  
being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Railroad Administration head Jolene Molitoris heralded a  
test of photo enforcement at California railroad crossings that has 
reduced collisions by 72 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's goal is to reduce the number of U.S. crossings 25  
percent by 2001.
