<HEADLINE> Nigerian Dual Exchange Rate To Remain In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The dual exchange rate system,
which was itroduced last year in Nigeria, will continue to
operate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The system provides for the operation of the autonomous
foreign exchange market for commercial transactions at
market-determined rates, while the fixed or official rate remains
22 Naira to one U.S. Dollar (one U.S.Dollar now equals to 85
Nigerian Naira at the autonomous foreign exchange market).
</P>
<P>
Abacha explained in the 1996 budget speech in capital Abuja on
Thursday that the official rate would cover only official
transactions, including debt servicing. All commercial
transactions will be conducted at the autonomous rate.
</P>
<P>
He said that the federal government would continue to
intervene in the autonomous market on a monthly basis, adding,
"The ultimate goal of our exchange rate policy is the eventual
merger of the two rates of exchange."
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the interest rate regime of 1995 would
be maintained this year, and directed all banks and other
financial institutions to maintain a maximum spread of 7.5
percent between their deposit and lending rates, subject to a
maximum lending rate of 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said that the fixing of interest rates during the last
fiscal year arose from a genuine desire to achieve macro-economic
stability and promote investment in the productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government, He noted, was committed towards the
achievement of that objective this year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Remains Firm on Aegean Crisis with Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal said today that it was out of the question for Turkey to
give up on its rights in its conflict with Greece for the sake of
achieving its goals in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister is now in Brussels to meet with EU
officials and explain Turkey's position on the Aegean dispute with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with EU Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Hans
Van Den Broek and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, Baykal
said that problems between Turkey and Greece could not be solved
without direct dialogue between the two countries, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said he had also raised the European Commission's
recent statement expressing full solidarity with Greece during
this meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece today furnished Ankara with its response to
a diplomatic note dated January 29 in which Turkey had rejected
Greek claims to the uninhabited islet of Imia in the Aegean. A
written statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Athens'
response, delivered by Greek Charge d'Affaires Panos Vlasopoulos
to Foreign Ministry undersecretary Onur Oymen, did little more
than repeat the known Greek position on the islet.
</P>
<P>
The statement indicated that Turkey expected Greece to refrain
from actions on the international level aimed at harming Turkey's
interests.
</P>
<P>
Greece has vowed to block Turkey's path in the EU, and to
exert efforts to prevent Brussels from extending credits to
Ankara under the customs union accord between Turkey and the
EU.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb PM to Attend Rome Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic said today he would travel to Rome to attend the
special conference that aims to save peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic made the statement after talks with High Representative
to Bosnia Carl Bildt in Pale, the administrative centre of the
Serb entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The Rome conference, proposed by the United States and
scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, will be participated by the
three key players in the Balkan -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, and Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic. Also present will be representatives
of the Contact Group and Italy, the current EU president and host
of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The high-level meeting is designed to salvage the peace process
in Bosnia that has fallen into serious crisis due to the arrests
of two Serb high-ranking officers and the dispute between Muslims
and Croats over the township Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said he would call for the lifting of the sanctions
against the Serb state Republika Srpska at the Rome meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The end of the sanctions is a prerequisite for better
cooperation between the Serb entity and the Muslim-Croat
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina," the Serb news agency SRNA
quoted Kasagic as saying.
</P>
<P>
The participation of the Rome conference by a Serb leader was
officially proposed by France on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Bildt, Kasagic stressed the interest of
the Republika Srpska to continue talks with other parties in the
joint commissions for the implementation of the Dayton peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic also discussed with Bildt the problem created by the
recent arrests of senior Serb officers and their extradition to
the Hague tribunal and said that it would be regrettable if the
joint commissions continued their work without the Serb
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities has suspended all contacts with the Muslim
government and the NATO-led IFOR troops to protest against the
arrests and extradition of the two Serb senior officers, a general
and a colonel.
</P>
<P>
"We can work on problems only if we meet and work within the
commissions," Kasagic said.

Serb parliament speaker, said today the Serbs were ready to resume
cooperation with the international community.

to guarantee the safety of Serb representatives, the Serb leader
said, hinting at the recent arrest of a group of Serb officers and
soldiers who were detained in the IFOR-controlled zone of
separation in Sarajevo by Muslim police.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Krajisnik and Bildt discussed the normalization
of relations between the Serbs and the IFOR as well as the
Muslim-Croat federation, the Serb news agency SRNA said.
</P>
<P>
At a separate meeting with Serb Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic,
Bildt stressed the necessity of overcoming obstacles to the
implementation of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bildt told reporters after the meeting that joint commissions
had to resume work and resolve all issues important to the peace
process within the set deadlines.

<HEADLINE> 300,000 Palestinians Pray In East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 300,000 Moslems
attended prayer services at Temple Mount In east Jerusalem today,
the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan, reported Israel
Television.
</P>
<P>
The number, the largest for many years, was possible because
the closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip had been partially
lifted, which allowed men over 30 to cross the Green Line to join
the prayers.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of incidents whatsoever, a fact that made
Jerusalem police to heave a sigh of relief. Some 2,000 policemen
were deployed at Temple Mount and nearby for fear that Hamas
should take the opportunity to make incitements or worse still to
carry out violent attacks. It turned out that, like the previous
three Fridays, today the worshippers left Temple Mount peacefully
after the prayers.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities imposed closure on Palestinian
territories on Monday in an attempt to prevent possible acts of
vengeance by Hamas for the killing of Yihye Ayyash, a Hamas
bomb-maker who was killed last month believably by Israeli secret
agents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Bethlehem, Palestinians protested against an army
decision to build a high-standing wall round the Rachel's
Tomb. The demonstrators dispersed quietly when it was announced
that security forces have agreed to build a one-meter security
fence instead.
</P>
<P>
The wall was originally intended to separate Jewish and Moslem
worshippers.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Atomic Energy
Minister Viktor Mikhailov has warned that if NATO expands into
Eastern Europe and deploys tactical nuclear weapons there, Russia
would respond by destroying the sites where they are based.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov issued the warning in an interview with two American
reporters on Thursday, according to today's Washington Post. The
report said that Mikhailov, a member of the Russian National
Security Council, added a menacing note to the already heated
Russian opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the next day (of the eastward expansion) nothing will
happen. But...one day tactical nuclear weapons will be deployed.
And since I am responsible for Russia's nuclear security, I have
to take adequate measures. Very simple measures to make it so
these sites don't exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov said that NATO's decision to expand into Eastern
Europe "means that you are officially carrying out a policy of
nuclear weapons proliferation."
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov said that he was sick of Washington's complaints
about Moscow's contract to sell nuclear reactor technology to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He also complained about strategic nuclear weapons with
multiple warheads on U.S. submarines.
</P>
<P>
"Who gave you the right to sail around the oceans with nuclear
weapons? Nobody," the Russian minister said. "If you Americans
want to have nuclear weapons, then you should keep them on your
own territory."

After the talks, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said he was no

</P>
<P>
The leader of the IRA's political wing raised a condition that
the IRA ceasefire could be restored with the onset of all-party
political negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the absence of such talks had led to the

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa needs a
modern navy, not only to defend its territorial waters, but to
assist its neighbors, Defense Minister Joe Modise said in Cape
Town today.
</P>
<P>
Modise, who is also chairman of the Southern African
Development Community's Inter-state Defense and Security
Committee, said South Africa is under "enormous pressure" from
Mozambique to assist in protecting its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
"They say their marine life is being plundered," he told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania has also asked for South African assistance,
while the Organization of African Unity (OAU) wants help in ending
toxic waste dumping on Somali shores.
</P>
<P>
"I was a bit taken aback. I expected them (OAU) to go to
Egypt, Algeria or Nigeria, but they said South Africa must help,"
he said, noting that toxic waste on Somali shores could also
affect South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Lead Supply in Shortage, Pushing Prices Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Lead prices will go even higher
in London Metal Exchange this year as demand continues to outpace
production, according to a report by the Economist Intelligence
Unit released today.
</P>
<P>
The report says that lead consumption last year was 4.82
million tonnes, outpacing production, 4.575 million tonnes, by
70,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The supply deficit will rise to 110,000 tonnes this year and
90,000 tonnes in 1997, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Lead consumption in the western world is forecast to grow by
2.5 percent to 4.94 million tonnes this year, but the growth rate
will fall to 2 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that reported lead stocks could be down to
only 4.5 weeks' consumption by the end of this year, but this will
be offset partly by continuing high unreported stocks.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests that growing shortages ill drive the price
this year to 20 percent above the 1995 average, or from 630 U.S.
dollars to 756 U.S. dollars a tonne.
</P>
<P>
The report warns that as shortages emerge, the lead market will
become a target for investment and this will exacerbate price
volatility.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Rocks Southwest Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 people were
killed and 32 others wounded in fierce fighting at Huddur Town
between Somali faction leader Mohamed Farah Aideed's militiamen
and those of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) early today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted when RRA fighters launched an attack on a
militia base belonging to General Aideed's supporters at Huddur,
400 kilometers southwest of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Aideed's forces invaded and captured Huddur in mid-January. It
had been the stronghold of the RRA, which is armed and supported
by Aideed's rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed, since Aideed's invasion of
Baidoa last September.
</P>
<P>
Heavy machine guns, rocket propelled grenades and multiple
rocket launchers were used during the three-hour fighting.
</P>
<P>
According to RRA's militia commander in Mogadishu Colonel
Mohamed Hassan Shatigudud, his forces had regained control of
Huddur. However, independent sources from the local field radios
disputed RRA's claim and confirmed the fighting.
</P>
<P>
About 150 RRA infantry militiamen were involved in the attack,
said Shatigudud, who further claimed that his militiamen had
neutralized two technicals of Aideed's men in the town.
</P>
<P>
Shatigudud has declared that his community was engaged in an
all-out war against Aideed in the region. He furthermore said the
campaign against Aideed's militiamen was agreed by the leadership
of the RRA.
</P>
<P>
There is no official word from Aideed's side as yet. However,
a senior official supporting Aideed who declined to be identified
said the RRA attack was repulsed, adding that Huddur was now safe
and stable under the control of what he called the national army
of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a national government since the
overthrow of late President Mohamed Siad Barre in early 1991.

<HEADLINE> Two Moslem Guerrillas Killed in Attacks on Israeli Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Moslem guerrillas were
killed and another was wounded, meanwhile an Israeli officer and
five militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA)
were injured, in a series of operations the guerrillas launched at
Israeli and SLA positions.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in an announcement of the Islamic
Resistance, the Military wing of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party
of God).
</P>
<P>
It said that on the occasion of the International Al-Qudds
(Jerusalem) Day, its guerrillas mounted a series of attacks on the
Israeli forces and their client militia in an area stretched from
the eastern to the western sector of the occupied border strip in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist militant organization said in a
statement that the guerrillas have launched since the dawn today 26
attacks on positions of the Israeli occupation forces and the
SLA militia.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that a number of Israeli troops and SLA militiamen
were killed or wounded by guerrillas in the attacks. It did not
mention any casualty among the attackers
</P>
<P>
But Security sources from the south reported that two Shiite
Moslem guerrillas were killed and another was injured in the
fightings.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli surrogate militia confirmed the series of
operations against the Israeli and SLA positions in south
Lebanon, and claimed that one Israeli officer and five militiamen
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces, on the other hand, resumed
since 6:00 a.m. (4:00 GMT) today bombardments from their
positions at Qalaa Ash-Shqif and Az-Zefate in Nabatiyeh area, at
a number of suspected guerrilla bases opposite to the occupied
buffer enclave.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources reported that the Israeli forces
shelled the areas of Yohomor, Arnon, Mazraa Al-Hamra, the Litani
river basin, Faron, Al-Khandoriyeh, Western and Eastern Zautar,
Kafra, Kafrarman, Jebal Al-Rafih, Zahrani river basin and Wadi
Al-Akhdar and an unidentified barrack of the Lebanon Army at
Upper Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that more than 550 artillery shells hit these
areas.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments wounded a baby called Imani Hassan Ibrahim,
who was immediately transferred to the South Hospital in Nabatiyeh
city for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments also damaged the building of a hospital at
Al-Khandoriyeh town, but caused no casualty, according to the
security sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed that today's operations and bombardments
did not go beyond a limit of daily exchanges of fire between the
Moslem guerrillas and the Israeli occupations forces.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon remains the last active battlefront of the
long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict, where Hezbollah and other
armed groups are engaged in a guerrilla warfare against the
Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Urged For Southern African Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's industrial and
commercial representative body has advised leaders of regional
organizations not to argue but cooperate to enhance development
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The executives should not think of regional organizations as
personal estates to be jealously guarded," Kassim Owango,
national chairman of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said today.
</P>
<P>
At the conference examining economic integration in Southern
Africa in Zimbabwe's northern resort town of Victoria Falls, he
noted that Africa should promote inter-institutional cooperation
similar to that between the European Union and North America Free
Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a time when debate is ranging on the
overlapping roles of the 12-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and the 22-member Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations were scheduled to hold a major
conference to resolve the issue of dual membership.
</P>
<P>
To promote integration, the African governments should expand
activities which complement rather than substitute private sector
initiatives, Owango said.
</P>
<P>
He urged international institutions such as the World Bank to
vigorously support any efforts toward economic integration in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he also urged African countries to further
investment procedures and movement of capital to promote
integration.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and his Namibian counterpart Sam Nujoma met in
Cape Town today to discuss matters of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the discussions were "highly confidential,"
Mandela told a press conference, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
South African Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg and Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad were present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mandela told the opening of parliament that South
Africa would not insist on the repayment of Namibia's disputed
383 million-U.S.-dollar debt.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg also told parliament earlier this week a solution
to Namibia's debt should be found by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The debt had been run up under the white minority government
and would be treated as an one-off amount, the South African
government has said.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma's visit came as a surprise to the local and Namibian
media which were unaware of his arrival in Cape Town this
morning.
</P>
<P>
After returning to Windhoek this afternoon, Nujoma told
reporters that he was to pay a state visit to South Africa in
March.

LUSAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Regional Director of
International Labor Organization (ILO) Adam Simbeye today urged
Zambian employers and employees to prevent conflicts in
industrial relations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day national workshop on industrial disputes
and their resolution here, Simbeye said lack of negotiating
skills, dialogue and consultations by both employers and
employees are the major causes of most conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"It is important therefore that both parties should always
seek a practical approach to resolving such disputes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Healthy industrial relations and industrial harmony in
workplaces are of paramount importance for continuous production
and economic growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Zambian employers and employees to work out
strategies for identifying and preventing disputes to minimize
areas of conflicts and promote healthy industrial relations.

<HEADLINE> Gabon Finds 19 Suspected Ebola Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- An international team of
medical experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), Gabon
and France has arrived in a remote village in northern Gabon to
investigate an outbreak of suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever
which has killed 10 people and infected at least nine others.
</P>
<P>
All 19 persons are from the village of Mayibout, located on the
Ivindo River in a sparsely populated area about 150 kilometers
from Makokou, the provincial capital of Ogooue-Ivindo, said WHO
spokesman Richard Leclair.
</P>
<P>
The patients were admitted to the provincial hospital in
Makokou on February 5-6, exhibiting symptoms of high fever, bloody
diarrhoea and severely reddened eyes. The nine survivors have been
isolated to prevent further spread of infection, and appear to be
recovering, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
A WHO expert of its Geneva headquarters told Xinhua that
preliminary laboratory results on blood specimens which were taken
from nine of the patients strongly support the initial diagnosis
of Ebola disease. Confirmatory tests are still underway.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, the outbreak of Ebola disease in Gabon will mark
the second appearance of the disease on the African continent
since the epidemic in Zaire in 1995 which infected 316 people and
killed 245.

<HEADLINE> Zaire Continues Repatriating Rwandan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Zairian troops sealed off a
second camp of Rwandan refugees Friday in a new effort to persuade
190,000 Rwandan refugees to return home, the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today.
</P>
<P>
A still unknown number of Zairian soldiers surrounded the
Nyangezi Muluua camp about 25 kilometers south of Bukavu at 7
a.m. As of mid-morning, the situation remained normal in the camp
which houses about 26,400 Rwandan refugees, UNHCR spokesman Ron
Redmond said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Redmond, the UNHCR had 11 trucks on standby
outside the camp in case there are some refugees who wish to
voluntarily return home.
</P>
<P>
"But so far there are no volunteers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ringing of the camp is part of a new effort by Zaire to
empty the 40 Rwandan refugee camps on its soil by cutting them off
from the surrounding community. The scheme was agreed to in late
December at a meeting in Geneva between Zaire, the United Nation
and officials from the Tutsi-led Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
The Zairian troops are intended to impose what amounts to an
economic embargo, preventing refugees from trading or working in
surrounding communities in a bid to make life in the camps more
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's operation, a tent was set up near the camp to
receive confiscated goods that had been brought into the camp,
said Redmond.
</P>
<P>
But as in the first operation on Tuesday, in which Zairian
troops surrounded a larger camp near Goma, the Zairians have given
assurance that the soldiers will not enter the camps or force the
refugees back to Rwanda, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Zairian officials, including three vice-ministers, are meeting
with refugee leaders in the camp today to encourage them to
repatriate peacefully," Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
In Goma, he said, UNHCR officials have been able to confirm the
detention of at least five alleged intimidators since the camp
there was sealed off. These people are Hutu extremists who try to
warn the refugees against repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"This is a Zairian operation to maintain law and order in the
camp," Redmond said, adding that the detentions were carried out
by members of the Zairian camp security contingent who have been
working in the camp for the past year.

Chelyabinsk today after he announced the decision to seek a second
term of office Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing representatives of local business community, the

would double in the second half of this year, and would double
again in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said that he will settle the payment
delay problem, reorganize the weak banking system, make the
privatization campaign more effective and develop a market of the
securities of privatized businesses.

LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external debt as of
December 31, 1995, stood at 32.585 billion U.S. dollars, an
increase of more than three billion dollars over October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The debt rise was announced by Nigerian Head of State General
Sani Abacha in his broadcast to the nation on the 1996 budget
late last night.
</P>
<P>
The debt was recorded despite the fact that no new loans were
taken in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the total debt, 66.5 percent is owed to the Paris Club
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the Nigerian federal government has
spent about ten billion dollars on servicing the external debt.
</P>
<P>
To speed up repayment of the debts, the Nigerian government
has adopted various measures including the introduction of the
Debt Conversion program in 1989, through which about 800 million
dollars has been redeemed.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Favors Confidential Talks on Cyprus issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Confidential discussions away
from the limelight is the way to proceed with efforts to bring
about a settlement in Cyprus, a top U.N. envoy for Cyprus said
here today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's resident
representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel made the remark after a
meeting with President Glafcos Clerides, during which they
reviewed "what has been happening in the area."
</P>
<P>
Feissel told the press that he believed that in this kind of
situation the way to proceed is to discuss it "quietly."
</P>
<P>
He said discussions should be "confidential," not secret, until
there is something to talk about one way or another.
</P>
<P>
"To play with all the cards on the table face-up is probably
not the best way to proceed," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. envoy declined to comment on any short-term
or long-term U.N. plans concerning Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. Secretary-General remained "very much
committed and interested in the Cyprus question, attaches great
importance to it and wishes to move things forward as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control 37 percent of its territory following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain sponsored a session of confidential talks
in London last May, attended by representatives from the two
communities on the island. But the talks failed to narrow the gap
between the two sides on the basic issues concerning the Cyprus
problem.

U.S. rose 0.9 percent in December, helping boost outlays by 4
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said today that overall spending on
residential, nonresidential and government projects totaled a
record 537.5 billion dollars, up from 532.9 billion
dollars in November when spending dropped 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the annual increase, the gain in 1995 was less than
half the 9.1 percent advance in 1994. It was another sign of
slowing U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, residential spending rose 0.7 percent
in December, to a 241.2 billion dollars. The strength was in
the multi-family sector, a big increase of 11 percent, while
single-family spending fell 1.2 percent on top of a 0.6 percent
drop in November.
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential spending was up by 3.2 percent, to 115.9 billion
dollars, comparing to a 0.9 percent drop in
November.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa-Pakistan Missile Deal in Doubt: Senator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Media reports that South
African missiles were about to be bought by Pakistan were
"speculative," visiting Pakistani senate chairman Wasim Sajjad
said in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not directly deny the rumored 164 million US
dollar deal, he said Pakistan's policy against nuclear
non-proliferation was clear. It was also in favor of the total
elimination of missiles from Southeast Asia by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This was held despite "stiff resistance" from neighboring
India and the fact that Pakistan was concerned about India's
long-range missile development capabilities, he was quoted as
saying by the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of South African Arms Sale Company, the Denel,
said earlier this week the leak of sensitive information about
the proposed sale of missiles to Pakistan placed the deal at
risk.
</P>
<P>
Denel was negotiating with Pakistan although no deal had been
concluded, spokesman Paul Holtzhausen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
earlier today, Sajjad, who has been senate chairman since 1988
and has served as acting Pakistani president, addressed South
African senators at an informal meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani leader is in the country for an official visit.

<HEADLINE> Oil Tanker Runs Aground off Wales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Anti-pollution teams are
battling to prevent an environmental disaster today after a
fully-laden oil tanker ran aground off Britain's southwest coast
spilling about 6,000 tonnes of crude oil into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The coastguard declared a full environmental alert, saying the
spill was significant and some oil was expected to come ashore.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists said a serious spill would threaten nearby
colonies of sea birds and seals on the wild coast of southwest
Wales, where the tanker ran aground off Milford Haven harbor.
</P>
<P>
Coastguard specialists sent surveillance aircraft whose crew
spotted apparent extensive damage to cargo tanks on the tanker's
starboard side.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of six specialist DC-3 dispersant spraying aircraft
were flying to the scene and floating booms were laid around the
tanker in an attempt to prevent the oil slick from spreading.
</P>
<P>
The tanker has been refloated and is being held out at sea by
tugs and it has stopped leaking oil, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian-registered tanker, Sea Empress, was carrying a
full load of 130,000 tonnes of North Sea oil form Scotland to U.S.
oil company Texaco's Milford Haven refinery when it ran aground.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst accident in Britain since the supertanker
Braer broke up on rocks in the Shetland Isles off the northern tip
of Scotland in January 1993, spilling 80,000 tonnes.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
plunged 0.6 percent in January, the biggest drop in nearly five
years, U.S. Federal Reserve said toady.
</P>
<P>
It was another new evidence of weakness in the manufacturing
economy although the decline was partly due to the blizzard which
hit eastern area of America in the month.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said the decline in factory output,
utilities and mines was the steepest since an 0.8 percent fall in
March 1991.
</P>
<P>
It was also the second drop in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve also reported that the nation's industries
were operating at 81.9 percent of capacity, down from 82.7 percent
in December and the lowest since November 1993 when 81.8 percent
utilization rate was seen.
</P>
<P>
In January, factory output declined by 0.6 percent. Output of
durable goods, such as cars and computers, was down 0.5 percent,
comparing to a 0.4 percent advance a month earlier. Nondurable
goods production fell 0.7 percent, the third straight decline.
Mining production slipped 0.3 percent and output at utilities
fell 0.9 percent.

HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The majority of German
investors are optimistic about putting their stakes in Southern
Africa because peace and wide-ranging free-market reforms are
being implemented there, a German business expert said today.
</P>
<P>
Executive director of the german-based Africa association
Martin Kramer said the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) region is fast-gaining prominence as an ideal investment
destination.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a three-day Southern African Regional
Economic Integration Conference in Zimbabwe which ended today.
</P>
<P>
"In all member countries of SADC, we can observe reform
processes and are able to realize a tremendous challenge," Kramer
said.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC states, particularly South Africa and Zimbabwe,
have relatively sophisticated banking and financial systems,
strong physical infrastructure, responsible economic policies and
charismatic leadership.
</P>
<P>
One of SADC's advantages is the trend toward free movedment of
goods, labor and capital, he said, adding a common currency
similar to the European Monetary Unification could further
enhance investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kramer advised SADC states to conclude bilateral investment
agreements with Germany.

JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 376 AIDS cases have
been detected in Indonesia by the end of January 1996, according
to a data released recently by the Indonesian Ministry of Health's
Directorate-General for Contagious Diseases.

<HEADLINE> hke021656-- Indian BJP Leader Demands Speedy Trial of Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian major opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party President L.K. Advani today urged the
designated court to carry out speedy trial of the multi-crore
rupee hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Advani, who was among the ten politicians accused of receiving
money from illegal foreign exchange dealers, filed a plea asking
the special court to take cognizance of the charge sheet against
him even if the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) failed to
file documents as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The CBI, which should have filed all the necessary document on
January 29, has got permission from the court to prepare
additional "sensitive" supporting materials before February 27.
</P>
<P>
Advani had resigned from his House of the People seat on
January 16 when the CBI filed its charge sheets against seven
leading politicians including one against him. The BJP chief had
vowed not to contest in the coming general elections unless the
court clears his name.
</P>
<P>
In the four-page plea, Advani said the investigative agency
deliberately delayed the filing of the charge sheet so as to
scandalize him just before the elections.
</P>
<P>
The BJP president said no evidence was cited against him in the
charge sheet except for conclusions derived from conjectures. The
CBI had alleged that Advani received six million rupees (about
164,000 US dollars) from hawala dealers.
</P>
<P>
Advani noted that "such an obscure charge sheet has yet to be
seen in the annals of legal history."

ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) - Italian Prime Minister Lamberto
Dini today appointed Vincenzo Caianiello as justice minister and
Mario Arcelli as budget minister.
</P>
<P>
A government new bulletin issued this morning said that
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has approved the new appointments.
</P>
<P>
President Scalfaro is widely expected to dissolve parliament
later on Friday and call a general election. But Dini's government
of technocrats is reportedly asked to remain in office in a
caretaker capacity until the vote.
</P>
<P>
The Italian president summoned the leaders of the two houses of
parliament this afternoon, paving the way for dissolving the
legislature and calling an early national election.
</P>
<P>
Dini resigned as prime minister on January 11 but stayed in
power while negotiations were held on the formation of a new
government.
</P>
<P>
The country has been gripped by a political stalemate since
Lamberto Dini resigned as premier on January 11.
</P>
<P>
Dini has since served in a caretaker capacity while Antonio
Maccanico, a noted political fixer, tried to form a new
government. He abandoned his efforts earlier this week, leaving
Scalfaro with little choice except to call elections.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Accident in Indonesia Enters 40th Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The hostage accident in Irian
Jaya, Indonesia, entered the 40th day today with a report that the
health of a four-month pregnant Dutch national is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
An Antara report from Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya,
confirmed this today by quoting Chief spokesman for the Triokora
military region command Lt Col Maulud Hidayat.
</P>
<P>
In two letters to a Roman Catholic Bishop early this month,
some of the 13 hostages being held by the Free Papua Movement
(OPM) said that they are exhausted from moving all the time.
</P>
<P>
Twenty six people including seven foreigners, who were carrying
out a scientific research at a mountainous area, were abducted by
the OPM on January 8 and 13 of them were released later. The OPM
kidnappers have dragged the hostages from place to place in order
to avoid the army.
</P>
<P>
In their letters written on February 5-6, the hostages called
for an immediate dispatch of food and medicine because their
health has been deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Since the abduction, the Indonesian Special Armed Forces
cordoned off the area to prevent the OPM, led by Kelly Kwalik of
the Amungme tribe, from taking the hostages across the border into
Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Despite mounting pressure of using force, the military is still
seeking "persuasive" methods to free the hostages, sources said.
</P>
<P>
For the unharmed release of the hostages, the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), with the approval of the
Indonesian government, sent a team to Irian Jaya in a bid to
resume cut-off contact with the OPM.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC dropped leaflets from a plane on February 10 urging
the OPM to get contact with it. The ICRC recently said it has
successfully made contact with the OPM's Kelly Kwalik group.
</P>
<P>
The international institution also confirmed a planned meeting
between ICRC representatives and the Kelly Kwalik group at an
undisclosed location next week, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that some sort of breakthrough would probably be
achieved before next Wednesday, the sources added.

WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- After two months of
battling against bad winter weather and other obstacles, the U.S.
peace implementation forces (IFOR) have completed their deployment
in Bosnia, the U.S. Army said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The army said that nearly 26,000 American troops and their
equipment have rolled into the former Yugoslav republic and
staging bases in neighboring countries including Croatia, Italy
and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The deployment, the first U.S. overland one since the end of
World War Two in the Balkans, was "accomplished with minimal
disruption of property, no aviation accidents, no significant cold
weather injuries and no fatalities," the army said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, only one American soldier was killed by an
explosion and several were injuried.
</P>
<P>
Of those 26,000 American soldiers, about 17,000 are now in
Bosnia while another 4,400 are in Hungary and others in Croatia,
according to a spokesman for the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has stated that the U.S. troops
will stay in the former Yugoslav republic only for 12 months to
enforce the U.S.-brokered peace agreement to end the 43-month
civil war in the country.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Court Clears Way to Punish Ex-presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Constitutional
Court ruled today that the May 18 special law designed to punish
two accused former presidents and their followers is
"constitutional."
</P>
<P>
The law was adopted by the National Assembly last December
after former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo and their
followers were accused of cracking down on the pro-democracy
movement on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, capital of South Korea's
South Cholla province. In that crackdown, about 150 people were
killed and 2,000 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are also accused of engineering the military
mutiny on December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Chun's supporters last month filed a petition seeking a halt to
the legal action against the accused, saying that they believed
the special law was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
However, the court said that the public desire for legislation
that would do away with historical wrongs takes precedence over
the possible inequalities that may arise from the application of
the special law.
</P>
<P>
Roh and Chun, who were arrested on November 16 and December 3
last year respectively, have also been indicted for amassing slush
funds worth hundreds of millions of dollars during their rule.
</P>
<P>
Chun took office months after the Kwangju massacre, and he was
succeeded by Roh, who was in office from 1988 to 1993.

HELSINKI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- World swimming ruling body
FINA's two-year ban on Finnish swimmer Petteri Lehtinen was
overturned by the international court of arbitration for sport in
Lausanne, the Finnish anti-doping committee said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lehtinen said he had used a medication containing salbutamol
-- a stimulant and anabolic agent permitted only by inhaler -- to
treat asthma but had forgotten to disclose this as required on a
routine form after a surprise late-night test.
</P>
<P>
Finnish swimming authorities had rigorously opposed the
two-year ban but FINA insisted that the 21-year-old Lehtinen was
guilty of doping and turned down an appeal by the Finns last July.
</P>
<P>
Lehtinen has been competing since last August after the
Lausanne court granted a provisional stay of the ban in time for

<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 16 (Xinhua) -- King Norodom Sihanouk of
Cambodia has issued an urgent appeal for medical aid to soldiers
wounded in the dry-season offensive against the Khmer Rouge in
Cambodia's northwestern region, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Wednesday in Beijing where the king
was on a routine medical treatment, Sihanouk asked "rich countries
and friends of Cambodia and the Cambodian people" to respond to a
"more than dramatic situation", the Cambodian Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Intense fighting between the Khmer Rouge and the Royal
Cambodian Armed Forces(RCAF) "is resulting in the inability of
hospitals ... to meet their basic obligations to the seriously
wounded and other victims of the war and mines", King Sihanouk
said.
</P>
<P>
Military hospitals in Phnom Penh and the northwest are filled
with wounded soldiers. Some doctors are worrying that medical
supplies will soon run out.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated in
January that more than 120 wounded soldiers were being brought to
military hospitals in Battambang and Banteay Meanchey every week.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients at the Phnom Penh military hospital has
climbed from 700 in early January to 887 this week, Hospital
Director Kao Try said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the hospital does not have enough room or beds for
all the patients, adding that about 200 patients are sleeping on
the floor.

somewhat high inflation rate and the arduous task of fighting
corruption.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Cricket Team Beats UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Led by a record-shattering
188 from Gary Kirsten, South Africa defeated the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) by 169 runs in their opening match of the Wills
World Cup Cricket Match Friday in Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
The dominating innings from 28-year-old batsman drove South
Africa to their highest total of 321 for two wickets after they
were put into bat by the UAE captain Sultan Zarwani.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, chasing an almost beyond-the-pales target, managed 152
runs for eight wicket in the allotted 50 overs as South African
pacemen Allan Donald and Brian McMillan made scoring difficult for
them.
</P>
<P>
Only toward the end Arshad Laiq (43 not out) and Shaukat
Dukanwala (40 not out) put up some resistance but to no avail as
eight of the UAE batsmen had returned to pavilion with just 72
runs on the board.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten's show of brisk fire in the middle of the innings
followed by calculated assault near the end of the stipulated
quota of overs conferred a dictating command on the South Africans
in the match.
</P>
<P>
His 188 off 159 balls saw him surpass the highest score in
World Cup matches of 181 which was recorded by West Indian Vivian
Richards against Sri Lanka at Karachi in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The South Africans crossed their previous highest ever One-Day
total of 314 which they stacked up against New Zealand in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
All the same, the breezy batsman, failed by just one run to
overtake the all-time highest score in One-Day cricket. The
highest ever One-Day score was achieved by Vivian Richards in 1984
against England at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Dropped at 118 by the UAE captain Zarwari at backward square,
Kirsten went on to smack 13 boundaries and four sixes during the
course of his knock.
</P>
<P>
He was in a prolific form right from the start, racing to his
fifty off 51 balls.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten's 100 came off mere 77 balls. He was in a more
attacking mould in the latter stage of the Springboks innings,
hitting boundaries and sixes at will.
</P>
<P>
Captain Hansie Cronje based the foundation of the massive total
with 57 off 62 balls.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten and Cronje added 116 runs in the second wicket stand
after the early departure of Andrew Hudson for 27 at the total
score of 60.
</P>
<P>
For the UAE players the decision of putting the South Africans
into bat on the moistened strip backfired as their seam bowlers
failed to exploit the morning conditions amid strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Their bowlers' failure was compound by sloppy fielding from
almost all around as the shots which could have been stopped by
diving smartly were allowed to flow to the boundaries
conveniently.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Orders Marine Court to Probe Ferry Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today ordered the Marine Court to probe into the ferry accident
which killed at least 283 people in Banda-Aceh last month.
</P>
<P>
After reporting to Soeharto the fact-finding results of the
Gurita ferry accident, Transportation Minister Haryanto
Dhanutiroto conveyed the president's order at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the Marine Court will make a separate
investigation into the sea accident so that the government will be
able to take correct moves about it.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Gurita on January 19 was carrying 377 passengers
on its daily trip from Malahayati to Sebant, off the coast of
North Sumatra. At that time, the ferry was also carrying 31
vehicles and 78.2 tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
At least 39 people survived, 55 were found dead, while 283
others declared missing, according to the official figures
released then.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it was impossible to salvage the ferry
because it sank as low as 384 meters below the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Dhanutiroto said that the actual number of passengers, totaling
377, was one of the major finding that came from a special
fact-finding team.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied the charge that the ferry was overloaded.
On an inspection tour last month after the ferry accident, the
minister told press that the ferry only carried 210 passengers and
16 crew members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chief detective of police in the Aceh region,
lieutenant colonel Srya Dharma was quoted by the daily "Kompas" as
saying that six government officials including those from the port
of Malahayati, where the ferry was based, could face criminal
charges in connection with the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Dharma said the charges against them could include negligence,
filing false reports and endangering the lives of members of the
public.

<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of the ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) brought out a colorful
procession here today to mark the success in the national
elections Thursday.
</P>
<P>
BNP Standing Committee member Abdul Matin Chowdhury and some
other party leaders took part in the procession.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally before the procession, the party leaders
said, the turn-out proved that people are not with the opposition
but with the BNP "under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister
Begum Khaleda Zia".
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition-led violence, the people by using their
franchise, have protected the national sovereignty and
independence, upheld the constitution and advanced the democratic
march, they said.
</P>
<P>
While all opposition parties boycotted the polls from 8 a.m. to
4 p.m. Thursday by enforcing a countrywide strike, the BNP and
some 40 small parties participated in the polling.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission, partial results up to now
showed that BNP had won over 160 out of the 300 parliamentary
seats.

DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition parties
today announced a 3-day fresh agitation program beginning February
24 in a bid to press their demand for resignation of the prime
minister and holding of fresh general elections.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the program, Sheikh Hasina, former opposition leader
of the parliament and president of the largest opposition party --
the Awami (People's) League, said that all educational
institutions, government offices, banks, insurance, rail, road and
waterways and two ports in Chittagong and Khulna will remain
closed during the days.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh held its 6th parliamentary elections Thursday, which
was contested among candidates of BNP its own and some 40 small
parties. All the opposition parties boycotted the polls and
denounced it as "one-party farcical" election.
</P>
<P>
The people by refraining from voting in Thursday's election
have expressed their no-confidence in the BNP government and thus
the government has lost its legitimacy, Hasina said, urging the
president of the country to take steps to constitute a neutral
caretaker government and hold fresh general elections within 90
days.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO Implementation Force
(IFOR) surrounded a Bosnian terrorist training camp and
arrested 11 terrorists on Thursday evening in the
Muslim-controlled town of Fojnica, close to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Among these detainees, eight are Bosnians and three foreigners,
probably from Iran as they had air tickets from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Major Peter Bulloc said that the terrorists, who
had possessed a large quantity of ammunition and explosives in
their place, had been taken into custody for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
IFOR commander Admiral Leighton Smith came to the terrorist
training center today to see for himself what weapons were hiding
in the camp.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists group was preparing attacks against IFOR
installations in Bosnia, said an IFOR official.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, all foreign soldiers fighting
in Bosnia should have withdrawn from Bosnia by January
19. Therefore, the arrest of Mujaheddins would be an embarrassment
for the Bosnian government as this is a violation of the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000-4,000 foreign mercenaries and Mujaheddins had fought
in Bosnia with the Muslims during the three and half year civil
war, Tanjug news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Share Prices Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai securities
market today concluded the week with a bullish performance. The
index surged nearly 16 points, or nearly three percent, as
turnover more than doubled, a phenomenon rarely seen so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
The index on the Shanghai bourse closed at 552.94 points, the
highest this year, up 5.24 percent from the close of last week,
with a turnover of a record nearly one billion yuan, on the last
trading day before the Lunar New Year Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Transactions this week were valued at 1.975 billion yuan, up
12.34 percent.

<P>
The strong performance on the Shanghai securities market ended
the lunar Year of the Pig on an optimistic note, analysts said.

The market fluctuated during the week. It corrected on thin
trading on Monday. The next day, active trading in such blue chips
as the Shanghai Petrochemical Corporation, Ma'anshan Iron and
Steel Corporation and Jinbei Automotive Co. Ltd pushed up 163
shares, leaving 14 down and 10 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Blue chips were sluggish on Wednesday, driving the index down
slightly.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the index put on 7.73, or 1.46 percent, due to the
listing of the Xinjiang Joinworld Co. Ltd and heavy trading in
shares of the Sichuan Changhong Electronics Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
On the initial public offering day Xinjiang Joinworld rose to
8.80 yuan from 4.20 yuan, up more than 90 percent, if adjusted for

</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Rubber Belt Co. Ltd disclosed on Wednesday that it
would take over two factories in Shanghai and Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province, and one of its wholly-owned

taking to expand its operations through acquisition and making use
of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Hero and Wing Sung, two major pen manufacturers in Shanghai,

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Troops May Withdrawn to Chechen Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that federal troops may be withdrawn from Chechnya to
the border areas of the rebel republic, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting at a pipe-rolling plant in Cheryabinsk
located in the Urals, President Yeltsin said that he had made some
mistakes, when holding the post of the Head of State, and
"perhaps, Chechnya was one of them."
</P>
<P>
"For many nights I lay awake, thinking that, perhaps, it was
possible to act in some other way," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is almost impossible to reach agreement with
Dudayev's men and "force should be used."
</P>
<P>
He qualified the actions of Chechen separatists as
"international terrorism and banditism" and said that without an
encirclement of Chechnya, the separatists may attack other
neighboring local republics.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin pointed out that "if troops are fully withdrawn from
Chechnya, the bandits will massacre the peaceful population. And
they won't stop, they will go to Daghestan,
Karachayevo-Cherkessiya and other republics of the North Caucasus
and will seize them. This cannot be allowed."
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian president stated that "we want to withdraw
troops to the Chechen border" but "Chechnya should be and will be
integrated in Russia."
</P>
<P>
While visiting neighboring Yekaterinburg on Thursday, Yeltsin
promised to settle the 14-month-old Chechen issue as soon as
possible, "not within years, but within months," and probably
before the presidential elections scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived at his hometown of Yekaterinburg on Wednesday
evening, and declared on Thursday that he would run for a
second term of office.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president arrived in Chelyabinsk on Thursday
evening and is expected to return to Moscow Friday night.

ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today
strongly condemned a rocket-propelled grenade attack against
the U.S. Embassy in downtown Athens last night, saying the
terrorist action only served "anti-Greek plans".
</P>
<P>
"The government unequivocally condemns the provocative
terrorist action, which was not a random act," a statement
issued by the Ministry of Press and Mass Media said.
</P>
<P>
A moving vehicle fired a 3.5 inch rocket Thursday night against
the outer wall of the parking lot behind the embassy, wrecking
three cars and nobody was hurt in the attack, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Although no group has so far claimed responsibility for the
attack, senior police officers believe it bore the hallmark of the
"November 17" terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the government "will confront these
provocations and intensify its activities to rid our society of this

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Denies Prior Knowledge of Hawala Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao has said that he had no prior knowledge of the
Hawala deals and would not like to comment on the issue as the
matter is sub-judicial, the National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Goa, South India, on Wednesday, Rao
said that several agencies worked under him but he did not
interfere in their working.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that he had timed the cases on the eve of the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Rao's denial was in response to widespread speculations here
that the prime minister has masterminded the Hawala case to deal
with his rivals prior to the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala case is a five-year-old bribery scandal in which
some top politicians were accused of receiving huge amount of
money from illegal foreign exchange traders.
</P>
<P>
Rao said that it was true that some criminal elements had
entered public life through politics, adding that the ruling
Congress party would screen all such elements.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that this had happened over a period of time and
not overnight.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said during his long public life, he had
headed several organizations, but many of them were autonomous in
their status.  The law would take its own course whenever the
agencies investigated a matter and filed charge sheets, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government
coordinator on Palestinian affairs, Maj.-Gen. Oren Shahor, and the
 Palestinian negotiator, Nabil Shaath, met at the Erez Junction
today to discuss problems related to the building of a Palestinian
 airport in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed to set up three sub-committees, which will
be responsible for examining different aspects of the project.
</P>
<P>
Shahor stressed that Israel demands full security control over
the airport.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 36 million-dollar airport has already
begun.
</P>
<P>
According to Perre Jeanniot, Director-General of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA), he expects a
Palestinian airline to become operational by this summer. He
visited Gaza and met with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Jeanniot said, the airline would operate on a
limited scale, with shuttle flights between Gaza and the West
Bank. Flights further afield will come later.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians would have no problems with personnel, he
said, since they have trained people who have been employed in
other countries. The PA currently has two planes, each capable of
carrying up to 50 passengers, donated by the Dutch
government. Apparently other states will also contribute aircraft,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Official on Conflict with Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- There is a difference in
viewpoints between Yemen and Eritrea over the sovereignty of the
Red Sea island of Greater Hanish, said Abdul Malik Mansour,
Assistant Secretary General of the People's Congress in Yemen, in
a statement broadcast today by the Egyptian Sawt al Arab (Voice of
the Arabs) radio.
</P>
<P>
Mansour said the standpoint of Yemen calls for the withdrawal
of Eritrean troops from the island and the restoration of the
situation to the original status that existed before last December
15 in order to seek a negotiated solution, but Eritrea has so far
refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni official praised the efforts undertaken by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to resolve the Yemeni-Eritrean conflict,
referring to the recent meeting in Cairo between the Yemeni Deputy
Premier and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim al Iriani and President
Mubarak. The Mubarak-Iriani talks, he said, were part of the
ongoing consultations between Yemen and Egypt, particularly on the
Yemeni-Eritrean dispute.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the French and Egyptian initiatives aimed at
overcoming the present crisis, underlining that the current
contacts will soon crystallize in a certain vision for the peaceful
settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mansour also said that the French initiative was based on the
formation of an international arbitration body to examine the
views of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is playing the role of mediator to contain the Yemeni-
Eritrean crisis and to promote rapprochement of the two sides'
views.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak was quoted to have said that there was
agreement on the convocation of Yemeni-Eritrean summit without
preconditions, asserting that such meeting could help pave the
grounds for a solution.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Hellenic Bank, one of Cyprus'
top banking groups, has taken over Barclays Pcl on-shore
operations here, thus strengthening its position on the local
market.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press today, the deal was concluded in
London on Wednesday evening, when a letter of intent was signed
after discussions between the two sides which lasted more than 10
days.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts from the two banks are now working out technical
details before the final agreement is signed in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
However, the full integration of Barclay's accounts and
operations into Hellenic may take about a month to complete.
</P>
<P>
An announcement from Hellenic merely said Thursday the letter
of intend had been signed, setting the framework for the
agreement in principle for the purchase of the British bank's
on-land operations but did not give any price.
</P>
<P>
According to a Hellenic Bank source, the take-over will cost
the bank something between 8.5-9.5 million Cyprus pounds (about
17-19 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some 50 branches of Barclays will be added to Hellenic's
network of roughly 80 branches and the staff now working for the
British bank will be absorbed by the Cypriot group.
</P>
<P>
The takeover will raise Hellenic Bank's market share to around
13-14 percent "which places us in a very strong position on the
Cyprus market", one senior Hellenic Bank officer said.

<HEADLINE> New Governor-General of Australia Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Sir Williame Deane, new
Governor-General of Australia was sworn in at the Parliament House
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Deane, a former High Court Justice, will spend the next five
years in the Government House in Canberra. His term will expire
in February 2001.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, former Governor-General Bill Hayden bode farewell
to Canberra and retreated to his farm in Queensland.
</P>
<P>
Both Prime Minister Paul Keating and Opposition leader John
Howard, who are fighting for the rein of the Australian
government, attended the ceremonies marking the change of the
governor-general, or the representative of the Queen of the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It's a curious moment that Keating and Howard abandoned fierce
mutual attack in the election campaign and unanimously praised the
role of Governor-General in Australia's political life.
</P>
<P>
Keating was fresh from his launch of the Labor party's
election campaign this week, where he vowed to replace the Queen
as the head of state with an elected Australian president.
</P>
<P>
Keating is using the republic issue to boost the Labor
government's stance in the federal election, which is due on March
2.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Opposition of dodging the controversial question
of whether Australia should become a republic, saying that the
country needs a strong sense of national identity in the process
of merging into Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that an Australian head of state, not the Queen, would
claim the opening of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He promised to hold a non-limited plebiscite on whether
Australia should have an Australian as the head of state within 12
months if the Labor is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that a special committee would consult widely
on how the president would be elected before putting relevant
constitution amendments to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Opposition insisted that an
institutional convention must be held to reach consensus of all
interest parties on the republic issue. It did not announce
whether it support or oppose a republic, let alone a schedule on
when Australia would become one.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed that 54 percent of Australians supported a
republic, while only 38 percent preferred the Queen as the head of
state.
</P>
<P>
But many people were worried about Keating's personal
involvement in the republican process. They did not accept
Keating's proposal that the president be elected by a two-thirds
majority of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The government has never suggested that its model is the only
one," Keating said.
</P>
<P>
His new proposal of a plebiscite was a major compromise from
his former stand that a referendum would be held directly on the
question of whether Australia should become a republic.

Cambodian-Vietnamese border areas in 1953.
</P>
<P>
The maps, which were drawn in Paris in 1953 and published by
the French Service Geographique de I'Indochine, will give weight
to Cambodia's argument in the talks with Vietnam for resolving the
festering territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Vietnamese villagers illegally entered the Cambodian
territories under the protection of the Vietnamese Armed Forces in

scales, which may have led to inaccuracies in the border lines.
</P>
<P>
It was also confirmed that then Prince Sihanouk had copies of
maps of Cambodia's frontiers distributed to the United States, the
United Nations, Thailand and Vietnam in March 1964.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian Constitution stipulates that the territorial
integrity of the kingdom shall absolutely not be violated within
its borders as defined in the 1/100,000 scale map, which were
published from 1933 to 1953 and recognized internationally in the
years from 1963 to 1969.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Election Campaign Starts in Russia  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin and
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, the two major rivals in
competing for the presidential throne in the Kremlin in June,
officially launched their campaigns on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived in his hometown of Yekaterinburg, declared
on Thursday afternoon that he will run for his second four-year
term of office.
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting of local officials in the city located in
the Urals that, having analyzed the situation in the country and
results of last December's legislative polls as well as the list
of contenders to the presidential post, "I have come to the
decision."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stressed that he decided to run for re-election in
order to "ensure the continuation of the course of reforms,"
noting it would not be the choice of personalities at the
forthcoming elections scheduled for June 16, but the future of
Russia would be decided.
</P>
<P>
In last December elections to the State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian parliament, the Communist Party of the Russian
Federation (KPRF) won a big victory. It holds 157 of the 450
Duma seats and controls another 60 seats distributed among
several friendly groups. Gennady Seleznyov, member of the KPRF,
became Duma speaker.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, however, believes he has all chances to defeat the
opposition candidates at the upcoming elections. The candidates
totallng dozens also include leader of the Yabloko bloc Grigory
Yavlinsky and Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia
Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
The president admitted that he had made some mistakes in
carrying out reforms, and noted that certain corrections should
be made now and in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Filatov, deputy head of the national committee for
presidential elections, said in a TV interview on Thursday night
that Yeltsin and his supporters must use the election campaign to
demonstrate to the public the achievements of the present
administration, make an honest assessment of mistakes and heed
voters' interests.
</P>
<P>
He named the Chechen war, spreading corruption and crime and
wage delays as both the main problems for Yeltsin and the
principal issues of concern to the voters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Yekaterinburg, the president offered to end the
14-month-old war in Chechnya as soon as possible, "not within
years but within months, probably before the elections."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also stressed: "I am prepared to account for everything
done over the past five years and I will soon make public my
election platform. I am in favor of reforms, but not at any
cost. I am in favor of adjusting government policies, and not
for a return to the past. I want Russian policies to rely not on
utopias nor dogmas, but on common sense."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Yeltsin's decision, Zhirinovsky said the
president has good chances of winning, noting: "His nomination
reduces my chances." But Yavlinsky said: "Russia will not elect
either Yeltsin or Zyuganov."
</P>
<P>
Filatov said Yeltsin may reach an agreement with the
"democrats" forces in the run-up to the presidential polls. In
particular, he refers to the Russia's Democratic Choice leader,
Yegor Gaidar, who he said "may review his attitude" in favor of
Yeltsin. Gaidar has recently voiced against Yeltsin's intention
for re-election, noting that it may only help the communists.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government "Our Home Is Russia" bloc has voiced
support to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the KPRF, at its fourth conference, nominated
its leader Zyuganov as a presidential candidate to challenge
Yeltsin, and called on Zyuganov "to consolidate around himself
leaders of political parties and movements as well as public
organizations which pronounced a backing to the single candidate
of left forces."
</P>
<P>
According to Valentin Kuptsov, Deputy Chairman of the KPRF
Central Committee, more than 90 percent of the party's primary
organizations have seconded Zyuganov's candidacy, and as many
as 2.2 million signatures have already been collected in his
support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several pro-communist parties, including the
"Power to the People" bloc and the "Working Russia" movement,
also expressed their support to Zyuganov's nomination.
</P>
<P>
Briefly expounding his electoral program at the conference,
Zyuganov promised to electorates restoration of Russia's
potential for development, a comeback of civil and ethnic accord,
efficient law and order enforcement and "a stop to extinction of
Russia."
</P>
<P>
A recent poll by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center shows
that Zyuganov's potential electorate currently stands at some 20
percent of all voters, a 10 percent lead over other candidates
including president Yeltsin. But sources in the Kremlin believe
Yeltsin will be the only winner, or he will, at least, go halves
with Zyuganov in having opportunity to win the upcoming polls.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Slashes AWSJ over Malaysian Steel Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today refuted allegations by the Asian Wall
Street Journal (AWSJ) that Malaysia's steel giant Perwaja Steel
would plunge Malaysia into a business scandal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Langkawi International Airport, Mahathir said
the allegations were baseless as they (AWSJ) knew nothing about
Perwaja.
</P>
<P>
"They can say what they want say. I am not interested in their
opinion as we manage our own affairs better than theirs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know how to manage Perwaja, and we don't need their
advice," Mahathir told the press when he broke the fast with the
people.
</P>
<P>
Perwaja Steel is Malaysia's biggest steel producer mainly owned
by the government. The AWSJ's report claimed that the company was
unable to pay its creditors and was insolvent. The allegations
were highlighted by AWSJ in its latest issue under the headline
"Steel Fiasco May Rattle Malaysian government".
</P>
<P>
Talking about the performance of the Perwaja Steel, Mahathir
said, "We have some problems, but we can solve them."
</P>
<P>
Criticizing some foreign journals, Mahathir said "Last time
they said that this country was going to the dogs and now they are
talking about deficit and Malaysia is going to be like Mexico."
</P>
<P>
"Well, we'll see whether Malaysia is going to be like Mexico or
not," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Opposition Cadres to Return to Self-Rule Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine has disclosed today that
contacts are under way between the Damascus-seated Front and the
Palestinian National Authority for the return of the Front's
cadres to the Palestinian self-rule territories.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, Ali Badwan, the Front's
officer in charge of information, said that contacts were taking
place between the representatives of the Front inside the
self-rule territory and those of the Palestinian National
Authority to arrange for the return of the Front's cadres. He
asserted, however, that Nayef Hawatma, Secretary General of the
Front, will not be among the first batch of Palestinian opposition
leaders to return to the self-rule territories.
</P>
<P>
The proposed return of the Front's cadres had actually come up
within the framework of the invitation extended by the Palestinian
National Authority to the leaders-in-exile of the Palestinian
opposition factions and members of the Palestine National Council
(PNC). They were invited to participate in a PNC conference to
examine the amendment of the Palestinian national charter and the
incorporation of the Palestinian opposition in the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian opposition comprises eight leftist and Islamic
groups. Besides, the agenda of the PNC conference included an item
on the transfer of opposition activity from military struggle into
political action, with a view to promoting national unity
particularly after the landslide victory of Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat and his partisans in the recent elections.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Middle East Peace Process: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Iran is opposed to the Middle
East peace process because it is "injustice and will lead to
future war between Palestine and Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the harsh statement while addressing
Friday prayers in Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people turned out today for rallies marking the
Qods (Jerusalem) international day.
</P>
<P>
Carrying placards in support of the Palestinian struggle and
shouting slogans for the liberation of Jerusalem, the marchers
gathered in Tehran University from different parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Rafsanjani's statement could be
interpreted as a big retreat from his previous stance toward the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Iranian president has to retreat from his
previous position because of great anti-Israeli pressure at home
on the eve the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said on February 9 that Iran welcomed promotion of
ties with all countries except for the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turning to reasons behind Iran's refusal to recognize Israel
and to resume relations with the U.S., he noted that the Israeli
authority is illegitimate, the oppressive attitudes of which are
being condemned by Iran.
</P>
<P>
As to the United States, he said, Washington's continued
hostile attitude against the Islamic system as well as the whole
Moslem world and its all-out support for the Israel are among
many obstacles in the way of resuming ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Specialists here noted that moderate President Rafsanjani has
got tough in Iran's stand toward the Middle East peace process and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the Islamic Republic has to face the
reality of the Middle East peace process though it has been kept
away from the process for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have already made peace with
Israel. Syria is now sitting at the negotiation table with Israel
and next it will be Lebanon's turn.
</P>
<P>
Iran, of course, is feeling more and more isolated in the
struggle against Israel. As a matter of fact, Iran's opposition
to peace process is now based much on ideological foundations,
rather than actual material and military bases, the observers
said.

LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria achieved macro-economic
stability in 1995 with an estimated growth rate of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Nigerian Head of State General Sani
Abacha in his broadcast to the nation late last night.
</P>
<P>
The achievement, Abacha noted, was largely due to the growth
of the oil sector (0.78 percent), agriculture (3.19 percent) and
manufacture (2.1 percent) in contrast to rates of 3.02 percent
and minus 5 percent for the last two sectors respectively in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Orphans Invited to Homes for Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of Spring Festival
(February 19-24), telephones at the Social Welfare Institute of
Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province, haven't stopped
ringing, and most are from people with the same idea: share Spring
Festival with an orphan at their homes.
</P>
<P>
"There are a total of 30 orphans living in this house, but the
number of families sending the invitations has risen to more than
600," said the director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
The idea of this originated with a party called "Invite
children to spend the holidays at home", held jointly by the
institute and the local television station.
</P>
<P>
Several orphans received invitations at the party and the
number grew to more than 400 by the next day.
</P>
<P>
"These children have no idea who their parents are, and have no
chance to enjoy the warmth of a family. It is our obligation to
send them a spcial kind of love," said one woman who invited an
orphan home last year.
</P>
<P>
A handicapped child named Zhang Liang visited the home of Zhao
Dianchun, a member of the city's Public Security Bureau, for 12
days during last year's Spring Festival. He had never in his life
had such an experience before that. It was so unforgetable that
whenever he thinks of it these days, he can't help crying.
</P>
<P>
Orphans in other parts of the province, such as Qingdao and
Yiyuan County have also received invitations. In addition,
donations from all parts of society have been arriving at social
welfare institutes or houses in recent days.

<HEADLINE> Liaodong Peninsular Turns into A Golden Triangle in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Liaodong Peninsular, on the
eastern tip of northeast China's Liaoning Province, has emerged as
a "Golden Triangle" for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies marching northward are being attracted to the
region - and investment has been pouring in at the staggering rate
of 10 million US dollars every day.
</P>
<P>
About 3,800 contracts were signed in northeast China last year
with a combined contractual value of 6.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Half of the contracts were concluded by the Liaoning Peninsular
even though it only occupies one 15th of the total territory in
northeast China, a provincial government official said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Liaodong Peninsular opened to the outside world in
1987, 1,500 foreign-financed ventures have been established there
annually, involving an annual total investment of 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 10,000 companies from 60 countries and regions
have opened branches or businesses on the peninsular, bringing in
10 billion U.S. dollars, making the peninsular one of the biggest
recipients of foreign funds in China.
</P>
<P>
The 11 state- or provincial-level economic development zones
offer appealing attractions to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Development Zone, alone, lured 54 prestigious
trans-national companies, seven of which have each spent 100
million U.S. dollars on the peninsular. The most enthusiastic
investors include the BOC Group of Britain, the Lucky Co. and
Lucky-Goldstar International Corp from the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Development Zone, which is adjacent to the
provincial capital of Liaoning, has welcomed 20 big international
companies and 10 of the "Top 100 Companies" in the world.
</P>
<P>
The peninsular has also benefitted from the influx of foreign
investment which has upgraded the equipment and technology of
1,000 existing state-owned enterprises and created job
opportunities for tens of thousands of out-of-work people.
</P>
<P>
The export value generated by local foreign-funded enterprises
increased at an annual rate of 30 percent, accounting for nearly
one third of the peninsular's total.
</P>
<P>
Frequent visits by overseas businessmen have also made the
peninsular a popular destination of tourism. It played host to
260,000 overseas tourists last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysing the principal reason of growing interest shown by
foreign investors in the peninsular, a local trade official cited
four leading factors: the influential geological position, fine
investment environment, a relatively-complete industrial system
and a new government drive to turn an old heavy industrial base
into a modernized industrial center.
</P>
<P>
The region boasts an extensive railway network, the longest
expressway and a 2,100-km-long coastline leading to ports of 160
countries.
</P>
<P>
Industrialists and businessmen from Japan and ROK described the
peninsular as a springboard which can help the province and China
as a whole to reach the Asian and world markets.
</P>
<P>
A senior provincial leader pledged that central and local
governments will invest 150 billion yuan in the technical
transformation of state-run firms in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that more foreign funds will flow to big, new and
high-tech projects as well as pillar industries in the 1995-2000
period.

<HEADLINE> China Insures Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Export credit insurance has
played a major part in spurring China's exports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the People's Insurance Company of China
(PICC), China's number one export credit insurer, had underwritten
exports valued at 5.4 billion US dollars from about 800 Chinese
companies, and paid 34 million US dollars in indemnities.
</P>
<P>
The Exim Bank of China also provided export credit coverage
worth about 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"All PICC's branches, except those in Tibet and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions, have provided such cover for Chinese exports
to Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and Africa," said Liang
Zhidong, deputy general manager of PICC's Export Credit Insurance
Department.
</P>
<P>
Export credit insurance means the coverage offered by an
officially-supported insurance company, and enterprises can resort
to the company when political or commercial factors block payments
for their exports.
</P>
<P>
"Export credit insurance is of significance to China which is
trying to improve its strength through exporting," said Wan
Lihong, a scholar with the Chinese Insurance Society.
</P>
<P>
"It encourages enterprises to export and develop overseas
markets."
</P>
<P>
As China has no special state export credit company, the
government entrusted PICC to act as its export credit agent in
1988, and appropriated 100 million US dollars to set up a state
export credit risk fund in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"To expand export credit insurance, PICC has drawn up special
tables to evaluate risks of exports to different countries," said
Liang.
</P>
<P>
"We have cooperated with international export credit
institutions to improve our underwriting capability."
</P>
<P>
PICC has negotiated with the Exim Bank of America, and a Danish
export credit insurance company on underwriting the export of
large production lines produced in China.
</P>
<P>
China's export credit insurance has plans to focus on
supporting export of machinery products this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Canadian Scientists Develop New Medicine for Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A new drug, developed by
Israeli and canadian researchers and tested on animals, offers
hope to children suffering from a type of leukemia that relapses
and does not respond to any other kind of treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported today that the drug, called AG-490,
is meant for young suffers of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who
relapse.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of patients with this most common form of
childhood cancer can be treated with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alexander Levitski from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem
and Dr. Chaim Roifman from the Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto, head a team that developed a novel concept in leukemia
treatment after looking at the chemical response to cells to JAK-2
protein tyrosine kinase, a signaling protein that becomes
activated in immune system cells of patients having a
relapse.
</P>
<P>
The drug blocks the protein form working and causes the
affected blood cells to die as they are supposed to.
</P>
<P>
The joint team tested AG-490 on cell cultures and in mice. The
inhibition of JAK-2 was found to selectively block leukemic cell
growth by inducing programmed cell death, according to a
scientific report on the drug published Thursday in Nature
magazine.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, whose work is being funded by the National
Cancer Institute and Medical Research Council of Canada and the
Sugen company in Redwood, California, said that more research is
needed to make the drug ready for testing on humans.
</P>

The patent has been registered by Yissum, the HU's R &AMP; D
branch.

<HEADLINE> East Africa Police Urged To Fight Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Police chiefs of
Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya have been urged to chart out a joint
strategy of fighting rampant drug abuse and trafficking in the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day regular conference of East African police
chiefs in Dar es Salaam on Thursday, Tanzanian Minister for Home
Affairs Ali Ameir Mohamed said co-operation is crucial in
fighting drug abuse, which is threatening the East African
society.
</P>
<P>
In the past, est Africa was only used as transit point for
drugs en route to Europe and other overseas markets, but now the
region is being turned into a drug market, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned other areas to be discussed as cross border
cattle theft and illegal trade. He said the conference should
propose viable patrol mechanisms to contain illegal traders.
</P>
<P>
The EA police chief regular conference is a result of agreement
signed by their heads of state to set permanent tripartite commission
for East African Co-operation three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Kagera Basin Organisation To Re-launch 3 Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The four member
countries of the reviving Kagera Basin Organisation (KBO) have
unanimmously agreed to re-launch three projects.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Foreign Minister Lt.Col. Jakaya Kikwete said on
Thursday that the decision was made at a meeting to revive the
organization in Kigali, Rwanda, between last Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The KBO member countries, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and
Burundi, would convene a donors conference to be held in
Brussels, Belgium, in June this year to raise funds for the
implementation of the projects, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He named the projects as Rusumo Hydro-electric Power Project,
Tse tse flies and Trypanosomiasis control project and roads
project (Mutukula-Bukoba-Lusahunga road in Tanzania and
Isaka-Mtungano-Mirama road in Uganda).
</P>
<P>
The organisation's activities, including the implementation of
the projects, stalled in April 1994, following the outbreak of
ethnic fighting in Rwanda, which led to the assassination of the
country's President Juvenal Habyarimana.
</P>
<P>
The KBO meeting also agreed to rehablitate its head office
together with a telephone exchange in Rwanda, destroyed during the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, among others, discussed financial problems facing
the organisation, partly caused by accumulated arrears standing
at about 3.6 million U.S. dollars, the Tanzanian minister
added.

ZHENGZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Young people in central

wasteland during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
A local government official said that the "Youth Green Project"

The project will help local farmers to escape poverty as well
as become environmentally conscious.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, youths in Henan planted trees on

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The drive of eliminating
poverty in the northern part of east China's Jiangsu Province is
paying off.
</P>
<P>
Nine counties and cities in the province each produced 100
million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) in fiscal revenue last
year.
</P>
<P>
Of these, seven are in the northern part of the province,
including Shuyang, Guangyuan, Suining, which used to be well-known
because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has paid increased attention to
the development of the northern areas where the economy lags
behind that of the southern part.
</P>
<P>
To promote a co-ordinated development, the province has
intensified transportation, telecommunications, and energy
construction in the northern part, and has strengthened economic
co-operation between south and north.
</P>
<P>
The province also provided 190 million yuan in circulating
funds to 16 less developed counties in the north last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, the northern part is developing faster than the
province's average pace. In addition, industrial growth rates of
Xuzhou, Lianyungang, Yancheng and Huaiyin, are well above the
province's average.

<P>
NEW YORK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has condemned a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Athens,
capital of Greece.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton strongly condemned the terrorist rocket
attack against the U.S. Embassy in Athens," the White House said
in a statement released Thursday in New York, where Clinton was
campaigning for presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"This incident underscores the continuing threat around the

White House statement.
</P>
<P>
A rocket-propelled anti-tank grenade exploded Thursday night
near the U.S. Embassy's main building in central Athens, blowing

Greek Minister of Public Order Costas Geitonas said all signs
indicated that it was an attack by the leftist guerrilla group
"November 17."

<HEADLINE> GDP Up at State Farms in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- State farms in north
China's Hebei Province had a gross domestic product of 1.44
billion yuan last year, two times the 1990 figure, agricultural
officials here said today.
</P>
<P>
The province has 31 state farms, with a total area of 353,300
ha. By developing high-yield, improved crops strains and
scientific research, state farms have achieved a high growth rate
in all areas.
</P>
<P>
They harvested 407,000 tons of grain last year, representing a
3.8 percent rise. The number of dairy cows has jumped to 14,200,
producing 34,200 tons of milk a year.
</P>
<P>
Output of aquatic products grew at an average annual rate of
12.5 percent over the past five years, climbing to 28,300 tons in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production is gradually replacing agricultural as
the pillar of these farms. Products of the 597 industrial
companies run by state farms came from 1000 categories of goods
that include petrochemicals, clothing, metal products, machinery,
foodstuff, and raw materials, with a combined output value of 580
million yuan in 1995, 2.2 times the 1990 figure.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Debate on Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called for a national debate on whether the American economy
could grow faster, suggesting publicly for the first time that the
Federal Reserve has been too stringent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a political fund-raising dinner here tonight,
Clinton said the pace of the economy "ought to be debated within a
commitment not to let inflation get out of hand."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is on a three-day campaign-style tour through six
states, said the economic debate should be conducted within a
commitment to reducing the deficit, balancing the budget and
avoiding a retriggering of upward inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
However, he offered no specific criticism of Fed policy or its
chairman, Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
But the president raised the question of whether Greenspan and
other Fed governors were too focused on keeping inflation to a
minimum while handling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The release of economic growth figures for 1995 has been
delayed because of the government shut-down during the talks
between Clinton and the Republican-controlled congress over
balancing the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
But most experts estimate that it slowed down to an annual rate
of 1.5 to 1.6 percent last year, compared with 3.5 percent in
1994. Meanwhile, the inflation rate during the past two years has
hovered in the 2.6-percent range while unemployment has remained
at between 5 and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said it is high time for the Fed to raise the
interest rates again as it did in late January, a move used
mainly to give a push to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he hoped the political debate in this election
year will focus on the economy and national security.

SHENZHEN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The 1995 output value of
hi-tech products soared 45.6 percent to 21 billion yuan in
Shenzhen, China's first Special Economic Zone, official sources
here said today.
</P>
<P>
This accounted for 21.9 percent of the city's total industrial
output value. The volume of exports rose to 1.5 million
U.S. dollars, 94.7 percent more than the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed this to chiefly the employment of high
technology.
</P>
<P>
Personal computers and telecommunications served as the
mainstays of hi-tech production, generating an output value of 16
billion yuan last year, representing 76 percent of total output
value of the city.
</P>
<P>
The 260 hi-tech manufacturers in Shenzhen developed 471 new
products, which yielded 6.3 billion yuan in profits last
year.

BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou
Jiahua met William S. Stavropoulos, president of the Dow Chemical
Company of the United States here today.
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos said that he held frank and effective talks with
relevant Chinese departments about the chemical industry. He said
he had a better understanding of the fact that the development of
the industry is a major aspect in China's new five-year plan and
the program for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the business his company is doing in China
can meet the needs of the development of China's chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Stravropoulos added that his company hopes to increase the pace
at which it is entering China's chemical market and to have
long-term cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
To reach that goal, he said, the company is making an
Asia-Pacific strategy and in the coming decade, plans to pour
major investment into Asia, especially in China.
</P>
<P>
Zou said he was happy with Dow Chemical's wish to further
cooperate with China in chemical industry development in line with
China's opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
With the development of China's economy and the improvement of
its people's living standards, Zou pointed out, China's needs for
chemical products will expand. China, he added, will mainly depend
on itself while strengthening cooperation with foreign countries
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He invited the Dow Chemical Company to further expand its
business in China on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. visitors came here at the invitation of China's State
Planning Commission.

<HEADLINE> Minister Says Turkey Located on Earthquake Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Mehmet
Alp said that 92 percent of Turkish land faces the risk of
earthquake, 95 percent of the population and 96 percent of
Turkish industry are located at the earthquake zone.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Alp, who made a speech at the
symposium on solutions to earthquakes in Turkey, as saying that
over a 70-year period natural disasters had destroyed nearly
600,000 buildings, and warned that without preventing such damage,
no improvement would be made.
</P>
<P>
The state minister said that even mild earthquakes required a
great amount of money to repair and that money should be spent
systematically before the earthquake to reduce casualties.
</P>
<P>
Another State Minister Ali Dinceer said that natural disasters
caused losses equal to 1 percent of gross national product every
year.
</P>
<P>
Tosun Terzioglu, chairman of the Scientific and Technical
Research Council of Turkey, said that Turkey was located on an

measurements of fault lines and ensure that the buildings exposed
to earthquakes were safe.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Technology Industrial
Park on the rim of Baohai Bay in Tianjin has made remarkable
progress over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Its income from the development of technology, industry, and
trade grew at an average annual rate of 85 percent, said Xuan
Dongsheng, vice-director of the park.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, income reached 6.2 billion yuan (about 747 million US
dollars), Xuan noted, pointing out that growth and scale of the
park rank at the forefront the country's industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 enterprises are developing new and hi-tech products
in the 22-sq-km park, which has four pillar industries in computer
software and equipment, telecommunications equipment, electronic
appliances, and electrical products.
</P>
<P>
Special products here range from special printing materials,
new types of batteries, large TV screens, and cable to medicines,
and fine chemical products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 54 enterprises with an income of 10
million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars), nine more than the
previous year, eight with incomes of more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 119 foreign-funded firms were approved here with an
contractual investment of 950 million US dollars, 10 times the
1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
The production value of joint ventures reached 4.2 billion
yuan, accounting for two-thirds of the park's total.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Mitsumi Electric Co. Ltd, which uses Japanese funds
exclusively, got 2.5 billion yuan (about 301 million US dollars)
from exports of new and hi-tech products.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reiterates Support to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece pledged that it would
continue to firmly support the island's Greek Cypriot population
until a just solution to the Cyprus problem is found.
</P>
<P>
The greek position was reaffirmed here Thursday night by Greek
Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis while addressing the
island's 56-member House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis, who arrived here Thursday for a four-day official
visit, said the joint defense pact agreed upon by the Greek and
Cypriot governments in November 1993 to "face Turkish
expansionism" is an expression of Greece's dynamic support to the
Cyprus people.
</P>
<P>
"For Greece, any advance of the Turkish occupation forces
toward the southern part of Cyprus automatically constitutes a
casus belli and will be answered with the most apt means which the
nation has," Kaklamanis said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies and guarantors of Cyprus'
independence, are at odds over this east Mediterranean strategic
island for many years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control 37 percent of its territory.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were at the brink of war late in January
following a dispute over the sovereignty of the islet of Imia, in
Eastern Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis told the Cyprus parliamentarians that his visit to
the island was taking place during a crucial period for the whole
nation and that his talks with the Cypriot leadership will give
him the chance to exchange views on future coordination between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Turkey for the lack of progress in the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis will have talks today with President Glafcos
Clerides and Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Tin price on the Kuala
Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended 12 sen higher at 15.72 Malaysian
ringgit (about 6.28 US dollars) per kilogram today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the rebound was aided by improved buying
interest, as traders wanted to build up their stocks ahead of the
week-long festive holidays next week.
</P>
<P>
"Tin manufacturers need to have enough stocks in advance for
their production operation for at least a week after the
holidays," said a dealer.
</P>
<P>
The market was also following a strong close on the overnight
London Metal Exchange (LME) that saw the three-month tin gain by
15 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
At the opening level of 15.6 ringgit (about 6.24 dollars) per
kilogram, bids amounted to 181 tons with offers at 89 tons. The
day's turnover stood at 124 tons, from 90 tons previously, with
buyers mainly from Europe and Japan.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Impasse Stays in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- While the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) is congratulating upon its success in
holding the sixth parliamentary elections, people fear that the
country's political impasse is set to stay and may become worse.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference shortly after the voting ended Thursday,
Sheikh Hasina, president of the largest opposition party -- the
Awami (People's) League (AL), said that the BNP government has
lost legitimacy and the polls marked by widespread violence must
be canceled.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties -- the AL, the Jatiya
(National) Party (JP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami -- have planned
fresh agitation programs to press their demand for cancellation of
the polls.
</P>
<P>
Anti-poll violence has been going on in recent days. On the
polling day alone, at least 14 people were killed and hundreds
injured in clashes across the country. Polling in over 2,400
centers were suspended because of violence.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling party and its government look relaxed about the
future with a well-thought-out plan.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts will continue to come to an understanding with the
opposition on the ongoing political stalemate. We believe in
reaching understanding through negotiation," BNP Chairperson and
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia reiterated to a crowd of foreign
journalists on the eve of the polls.
</P>
<P>
She said that if the situation requires, a constitutional
amendment bill may be moved in the new parliament with provision
for a caretaker government demanded by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Since March 1994, the opposition parties and the government
have been locked in a dispute over resignation of the prime
minister to pave the way for holding the national elections under
the supervision of a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
As the government rejected the demand, the opposition parties
boycotted the last parliament and the poll process.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it would be hard for the opposition
and the BNP to sit across the table under the present
circumstances as the opposition has proposed several preconditions
for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The first is the cancellation of the just-ended election. AL
President Hasina has claimed that 95 percent of the people
expressed no confidence in the BNP government by refusing to vote
in the "sham election."
</P>
<P>
The thin turnout of voters seemed to justify the opposition's
questioning of the legitimacy of the polling results, in which the
BNP would definitely win.
</P>
<P>
Another precondition corresponds with the opposition's
consistent demand for the resignation of the prime minister and
its cabinet to clear the way for the formation of a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"As the BNP government is no more a legitimate government, now
in order to avoid constitutional crisis, the administration and
all lawful authorities of the country should rest with the
president until a legitimate cabinet is installed after a free and
fair election under a neutral caretaker government," said Hasina.
</P>
<P>
However, the preconditions are of the same old tune earlier
played by the opposition, while the BNP sees the holding of the
elections on schedule as a fresh victory allowing its rule for
another term.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that donor countries of Bangladesh had proposed a
new formula before the polling Thursday, namely, a "two-election
theory," to resolve the country's prolonged political crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the formula, the opposition was advised to allow
people to freely exercise their right of franchise in the polling.
 If the voter turnout fell short of the government's expectations,
this would help the opposition in their call for an early new
election through a related amendment to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda's promise to hold talks with the opposition after the
polls appeared to come from an understanding with the donor
countries, which would give the BNP government an excuse to reject
the opposition's demand.
</P>
<P>
In any case, there seems no quick and easy end to the political
conflict that has been going on for nearly two years between the
government and the opposition in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Campaign On Cyclists' Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A government education
campaign aimed at encouraging bicycle riders to wear safety
helmets increased the percentage of helmet wearers from 7.9
percent to 14.8 percent, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
An average of 20 Israelis are killed in bicycle accidents each
year. About 1,000 are reported injured, 200 seriously and 800
mildly injured. Wearing a suitable helmet has been proven to
reduce the risk of head injuries, which are the main type of
bicycle-related damage.
</P>
<P>
After sending out observers to count how many cyclists in 15
towns wore helmets two years ago, the Health Ministry and the Road
Safety Administration launched a campaign of radio jingles,
stickers, and newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
However, officials in the Health Ministry's health education
department now think that a law is needed to induce more cyclists
to don the protective gear.
</P>
<P>
Department head Dov Tamir, who co-wrote an article about its
survey of helmet use among cyclists in the February issue of the
"Israel Journal of Medical Science," said that he will pursue the
legislation option in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in other countries, mandatory helmet laws have
followed educational campaigns by a couple of years, but it would
be a shame to wait for more youngsters to be injured.

<HEADLINE> Hariri to Leave for Vatican Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al Hariri is scheduled to leave for the Vatican by way of Rome
today for an official visit to the Holy See to seek an "axis role"
of the Vatican and the Pope in freeing Lebanon from the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will start talks Saturday morning with Pope John Paul
II and Vatican senior officials, according to well-informed
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese sources ruled out official meetings between
Hariri and Italian officials during the former's short stay in
the Italian capital, since the Italian government has resigned.
</P>
<P>
From the Vatican, the Lebanese prime minister will go to Saudi
Arabia for a private visit, where he will carry out a pilgrimage
to the Moslem shrine of Mecca, before going for Paris to spend
with his family the holiday of Eid Al-Fitr(the festival marking
the end of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan).
</P>
<P>
The multi-billionaire prime minister announced earlier that his
 visit is aimed at seeking an "axis role" of the Vatican and the
Pope personally in helping Lebanon for the liberation from the
Israeli occupation, in compliance with the U.N. Security Council
resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
But local political analysts believe that Hariri carry out the
visit to press for a moderate Vatican stance on Lebanon following
a controversial message issued by a special Vatican-sponsored
Synod on Lebanon last December.
</P>
<P>
The message called for the withdrawal of the Israeli troops
occupying a border strip in South Lebanon and Syrian troops who
control much of the rest of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri payed last night a prompt visit to Damascus where he had
a meeting with Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
Credible sources close to the prime minister reported that
Hariri visited the Syrian capital for an early congratulation to
the Syrian leaders on Eid Al-Fitr, for Hariri will be in the
outside during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and Khaddam, in their meeting last night, reviewed the
latest developments on the Syrian-Israeli track in the peace
process in the light that Syrian and Israeli delegators will
resume their talks at Wye Plantation near Washington on February
27.
</P>
<P>
And the two sides also made a "full assessment" on the
situation in Lebanon, in view of the mixed reactions aroused by
President Elias Hrawi's proposal on the upcoming parliamentary
elections, according to the anonymous sources.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police on Alert in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police have
tightened the screws in east Jerusalem as hundreds of thousands of
Moslem worshippers are expected to attend the last Friday prayer
services of Ramadan at Temple Mount today.
</P>
<P>
Police have closed down roads around Old City to all but public
transportation in an effort to make way for the expected crowds.
</P>
<P>
Some 70,000 Moslem worshippers participated in prayer services
Thursday night at Al Aksa Mosque and the number of worshippers are
expected to grow to nearly 300,000 today.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police are deployed in unprecedented scale. Security
officials said the major concern remains as it has been most of
the week -- that the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) will
attempt a revenge attack for the killing last month of Yihye
Ayyash nicknamed "Engineer," believably by Israeli secret agents.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the age
of 30 are forbidden to enter the city today under the order of
border closure, which has been eased somewhat.
</P>
<P>
A similar partial closure last Friday, however, found many
Palestinian youths able to enter Jerusalem illegally and attend
prayers at Al Aksa.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police chief Arye Amit told reporters Thursday that
the situation would be tense. But, on the other hand, it was
noted by other police sources that the first three Ramadan Friday
prayers passed quietly, leaving hope that there would be no
incidents today.
</P>
<P>
However, Jerusalem police were still reinforced. Some 2,000
policemen are to be on duty in east Jerusalem. Amit is to oversee
security in a mobile command unit, aided by a police helicopter.

Turkey has previously proposed the construction of a pipeline
to carry Turkmen natural gas to Europe beneath the Caspian Sea
and via Transcaucasia and Turkey, a route which bypasses Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the plans for a pipeline carrying Russian natural
gas via Georgia, Armenia and Turkey to Israel is still under
discussion, Eyuboglu said in an interview with Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Russia"s two pipeline routes -- the one running from Armenia
to 10 kilometers inside Turkish borders or the other reaching
Tbilis, Georgia -- will be extended to a Mediterranean Sea to
Israel," Eyuboglu said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that 8-10 billion cubic meters of Russian natural
gas will be purchased by Turkey and 4-6 billion cubic meters by
Israel. The pipeline project will be revised, if the transit
countries, such as Cyprus, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon would like
to purchase natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline between Russia and Israel is expected to run
1,600 kilometers, of which 1,120 kilometers is on the Turkish
soil. The pipeline carrying up to 16 billion cubic meters natural
gas will cost 3.46 billion u.s. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Ties Should Be Stable and Constructive, Qin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Qin Huasun, China's
envoy to the United Nations, said today that China and the United
States should establish "a normal, stable and constructive
relationship."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when briefing U.S. business leaders on
China's economic reform, the policy of opening-up to the outside
world and Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the Sino-U.S. relationship should be viewed and
handled from a strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
"To do this, we should first strictly observe the three
Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques; secondly, respect each other, seek
common ground while putting aside differences and treat each other
as equals; and thirdly, handle the question of Taiwan with
prudence," he said.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the maintenance and development of a normal

to the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also
contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, the Chinese envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the United States is the largest developed country in
the world while China is the largest developing country.

broad prospect for our economic cooperation," he said.

<HEADLINE> People From Tianjin Travelling More During Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Instead of staying home this
year for a family gathering during the upcoming lunar new year
festival as was often the case in the past, an estimated 300,000
people are expected to leave the city to go travelling.
</P>
<P>
This year's festival is especially good for travel because it
falls on Feb. 19 and will last as long as seven days, when the
two-day weekend is tacked on.
</P>
<P>
For quite some time now Tianjin's more than 30 travel agencies
have been full of people coming to arrange their holiday travels,
a sharp contrast to the vast numbers who are usually busy shopping
for the traditional food and gifts.
</P>
<P>
"We used to consider Spring Festival a good time to stuff
ourselves. But, now that we can get good things to eat every day,
we look for a change, and using this chance to see the world is
not a bad idea," said a middle-aged gentleman, Mr. Liu, standing
near the Jinniu Travel Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Liu said he will take a two-day tour with his wife and
child of Longqingxia Gorge in the outskirts of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At the Tanggu Haishang Travel Agency, an man in his early
sixties said that he and his wife will embark on a five-day tour
of scenic Guilin, several thousand km away, in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
"Since we are busy taking care of our grandchildren on ordinary
days, in turn we get financial help from our children for the
holiday tour," he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
He Huanzhen, a section chief at the municipal tourism
administration, said that the increase in travel marks the
beginning of the courtship in the consumer culture of well-off
citizens with a higher standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to some 60 diversified programs arranged specially for
this holiday, people can visit places as near as Beijing or
Taishan Mountain in Shandong Province. Or they can go a step
farther to Harbin in the northeast or Haikou in the far south, or
even farther still to Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Coal and Gold Fever Gives Northwest China a Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Coal and gold are helping
northwest China's Qinghai and Gansu Provinces to develop the
Qilian Mountain Range on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
The mountains extend for over 1,000 km from west to east in the
northwest, covering the Qinghai-Tibetan, Loess and Mongolian
plateaus.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces have already issued a series of flexible
policies governing funds, technology and talents to attract
investors from coastal areas and from abroad. The provinces have
repaired 3,000 kilometers of roadways since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Qinghai's Qilian County alone has
established five new asbestos enterprises, each with an annual
production capacity of 1000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 enterprises are currently using resources, including
150 coal mines and 30 asbestos mines. They are capable of
producing two million tons of crude coal, 4,000 tons of asbestos
and 200 kg of gold, with a production value of over 500 million
yuan (about 60 million US dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
The mountains have more than 50 resources, with coal reserves
of three billion tons topping the list. Asbestos reserves are
estimated to be 27 million tons while gold resources in the
mountain are widely distributed, with large reserves that are easy
to extract.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Benefits From Austerity Policy in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 15 (Xinhua) -- After turning to austerity
policies for nearly a year, Hungary arrested a continued rise of
its international payments and budget deficits in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government began strict belt-tightening policies in March
1995 after the macro-economic situation continued to deteriorate
although the economy registered growth for the first time in five
years in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country's international payments deficit totaled 2.17
billion U.S. dollars at the end of last October and is estimated
to have reached 2.2 billion dollars at the end of 1995, a sharp
decrease from the 4 billion dollars in 1994, a government report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The improving international payments situation was due to a
fall in the foreign trade deficit and an increase in income from
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit fell to 2.6 billion dollars from 3.8 billion
a year earlier and foreign exchange brought in by tourism increased
by 18 percent to 1.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government also managed to reduce the financial deficit to
133.9 billion forints (930 million dollars) in 1995, well below
the planned 156 billion forints (about 1.1 billion dollars) and
238.9 billion forints (1.66 billion dollars) in the previous year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said an income of 47.4 billion forints (3.29 billion
dollars) from sales of energy enterprises had helped the
government curb its financial deficit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's gross domestic product (GDP) continued to rise in
1995 with an estimated growth rate of 5 to 6 percent, the report
said. But the total grain output slid by 4 percent to 1.09
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in Hungary reached 4.14 billion
dollars in 1995, bringing the total foreign investment in the
country over the past six years to 12 billion dollars, which
accounted for more than half of the foreign investment in central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the report admitted that the country still faces tough
economic problems in 1996, including a high net foreign debt of
20.3 billion dollars and a rocketing inflation rate of 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
In view of the remarkable progress, Hungarian Prime Minister
Gyula Horn described 1995 as "a turn in economic development" in
an address to the parliament early this month and vowed to carry
on his austerity policy.
</P>
<P>
But the Opposition voiced strong opposition to the austerity
policy, saying Hungarians had paid dearly for it. The Small
Holders' Party, which has enjoyed high poll ratings in recent
months, demanded Horn's resignation and planned to underscore the
demand by organizing a rally outside the parliament building on
March 14.

<HEADLINE> Reforms Help Firms in Northeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A series of reform measures
have helped small and medium-sized enterprises in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province in overcoming their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 18,086 small and medium-sized enterprises,
85.4 percent of the provincial total, transferred property rights
last year. Property rights of 60 percent were sold entirely, and
20 percent partially, producing a diversified ownership structure.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 of them were either annexed by or joined other
well-managed enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the enterprises turned out a combined industrial
output value of 46 billion yuan in the first 10 months of 1995, up
27.9 percent from the corresponding period of the previous year.
This represents a 19.5 percent larger output than large and
medium-sized state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Sales amounted to 20 billion yuan, up 47 percent from the same
1994 period.
</P>
<P>
Major reform initiatives included the issuing of shares,
annexation, and leasing and selling of property rights.

<HEADLINE> China-ASEAN Economic, Trade Development to Accelerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The development of economic
and trade cooperation between China and Southeast Asia will
accelerate this year, a senior Chinese official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Xie Ruixia, deputy director of the Asian Affairs Department of
China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, made
the remark in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She said the acceleration was based on an increase in trade
last year between China and member countries of ASEAN, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
She said that the total trade volume last year between China
and ASEAN member countries, including Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, hit
19.48 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 41 percent rise over the previous year,
which is much higher than the 20 percent increase rate of China's
foreign trade. A balance between imports and exports was also
reached.
</P>
<P>
China's export mix to ASEAN countries was further optimized
last year with more steel and mechanical products and electronic
items shipped, instead of traditional textiles, other light
industrial products, cereals, edible oils and local products.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's imports from the ASEAN area were primary
products such as crude oil, grains, sugar and plywood.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of last year, the ASEAN countries
invested 1.7 billion US dollars in China. Singapore was listed
fifth among the biggest of all foreign investors in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the focus of China's labor service and project
engineering shifted from the Middle East to the ASEAN, mainly in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Xie held that with political stability and better investment
environment, Asian countries have enjoyed a continuous economic
rise in the past few years and economic activities inside Asia
have become more vigorous.
</P>
<P>
She concluded that the economic and trade co-operation between
China and the ASEAN will maintain its strong momentum this year.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that China's rapid economic development has
made important contributions to economic activities inside Asia,
and China needs a peaceful international environment to build the
country.
</P>
<P>
She continued that China abides by the four principles voiced
by Chinese Premier Li Peng in 1988 during his visit to Thailand
concerning the establishment, restoration and development of
relations between the Chinese Government and the ASEAN, that is,
in state-to-state relations, China strictly observes the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence; under any circumstances,
China opposes hegemonism; in economic relations, China upholds
equality, reciprocity and mutual development; and in international
affairs, China advocates independence, self-determination, mutual
respect, close co-operation and mutual support.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Protests Russian Move on Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today charged that
Russia's unilateral move to stop trimming the Black Sea Fleet
violated a bilateral agreement reached last year in Sochi, a
Russian port city near the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Duma (the lower house of the parliament) adopted
Wednesday a bill to suspend reducing manpower and withdrawing
warships and ground and air forces from bases of the Fleet until
the agreement comes into force.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Russia is also halting the transfer of ground
facilities to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Mukhin, head of the Ukrainian parliament's Committee
on Defense and State Security, said his committee might propose a
bill on the status of foreign military forces on Ukrainian
territory in reaction to the Russian move.
</P>
<P>
The Independence Information Agency quoted a Ukrainian lawmaker
as saying that the Russian bill was a "serious blow" to bilateral
relations and threatened the signing of their friendly cooperation
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the row may also affect the planned visit
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Ukraine, which has just been
scheduled on April 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Black Sea Fleet, one of the Soviet Union's
four main fleets with more than 830 warships, has disrupted
Ukrainian-Russian relations since the disintegration of the Soviet
Union.

<HEADLINE> Painter and Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The color of an old Shanghai
has been fading in the minds of the city's new generation.
</P>
<P>
But, Xu Yuanzhang can never restrain from tracing the city's
past -- its lanes, churches and docks, on a piece of paper and
with a painting brush.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 51, member of the Shanghai Watercolor Research Society,
said that the buildings and streets helped make up the city's
legendary history.
</P>
<P>
One of the regular themes of his work is the residences of the
successful people who once lived in and built Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Xu came up with the idea very naturally, as he is a grandson of
Zhou Zongliang who was the biggest pigment businessman of the
commercial city.
</P>
<P>
Churches are another subject which Xu enjoys. Foreigners built
many churches after they entered the port city a century ago,
making it a colony as well as an access point to inland
China. Some of the churches are still protected as relics.
</P>
<P>
Xu always added brief introductions to his paintings, in an
effort to "let viewers know what the structures were before",
particularly as many people born in the 1970s and 1980s have not
the slightest feelings about the city's past".
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a special exhibition entitled "I Love
Shanghai" was even held to display Xu's water color works, the
first of its kind in Shanghai. One of the aims was to help the
public learn about the city's past humiliation and glory.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was once known as the "Pearl in the East", and a
"paradise" for foreigners to seek money, power and beautiful
Chinese girls.
</P>
<P>
The city was then liberated by the communist party in
1949. And, it is now the country's leading coastal city for the
reform and opening-up, with many overseas-funded banks and
supermarkets being allowed to open.
</P>
<P>
Many old buildings have been pulled down to make way for
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
Xu has to depend on old photographs and his memory, or
sometimes, imagination, to duplicate the old Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Besides painting a disappearing city, Xu has started to learn
to draw a modern and busier metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Xu's works became so popular over night that German and Italian
consulates in Shanghai were eager to buy them as collectors items.
</P>
<P>
However, critics worry that Xu's aspirations might one day
loose color too, just as the old Shanghai did, as the city
develops too fast for any painter to catch up with.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Kill 12 In Northern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 16 Xxinhua) -- Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
rebels are reported to have attacked a trading centre, 77 miles
west of Gulu town in northern Uganda, killing 12 people and
abducting a number of others.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the heavily armed
rebels on Wednesday burnt down around 100 houses and looted food
and livestock in the area, 80 miles from the Sudan border.
</P>
<P>
Two trucks and a tractor were also destroyed by the rebels,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers, numbering between 300 and 500, were part of the
group alledgedly crossing into Uganda from Sudan on February 7
this year through Bibia area.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) have encircled the
rebels in the deforested area of Onyai, nine miles north of the
attacked trading centre, the report said.
</P>
<P>
By last evening, nine of the rebels had surrendered to the
UPDF, which had also rescued six abducted citizens.
</P>
<P>
The LRA was founded in April 1987 by Joseph Kony, a
32-year-old former catechist in a catholic parish, after he fell
out with the catholic church.
</P>
<P>
Most of the LRA rebels, who have caused disturbances in
northern Uganda, have fled into Sudan since October 1994 fled
after the UPDF intensified attacks on
them.

<HEADLINE> More Public Telephones in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of privately-owned
telephones for public use in the capital of the Tibet Autonomous
Region was more than 320 by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of them were IDD, a matter of great
convenience for local people.
</P>
<P>
Although it costs nearly ten thousand yuan (about 1,200 US
dollars) to install a telephone here, there have been people
lining up for it.
</P>
<P>
"Few people asked to install a telephone in the past, but now
the number of people who want one is ever growing," said a
director of the local post office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the improved living conditions, more frequent
social or economic activities have also contributed to the rise in
the number of telephones.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, IDD was still a novelty for most Tibetans. It
is now a fairly common phenomenon, for exchanging information or
even having a simple chat with friends or relatives thousands of
miles away.
</P>
<P>
A Tibetan opened a gold handicrafts shop in downtown Lhasa, but
also had an IDD hook up put in his shop to run a public phone
business on the side.
</P>
<P>
"The telephone not only brings convenience to passers-by, but
also provides me with the lastest information on the international
gold and silver markets," the shop owner noted.

<HEADLINE> Harare Council Dismisses Workers For Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Committee of the
Harare City Council yesterday fired several employees for
corruption and abuse of public property.
</P>
<P>
Executive Mayor Solomon Tawengwa said last night that several
employees had been dismissed immediately and "this should send a
message to all employees that cases of corruption will be dealt
with strongly."
</P>
<P>
The workers were fired despite recommendations of demotions or
suspensions which Tawengwa said could not be considered as the
council had to take tough measures to protect its property.
</P>
<P>
In the past, cases of corruption took a long time to be
concluded as they had to go through committees and in some cases
the offenders escaped with a demotion.
</P>
<P>
Tawengwa said those days were now part of the council's
history, and stressed that serious cases would be dealt with
severely.

BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province plans to build an expressway linking coastal areas with
Hong Kong, according to last Sunday's Guangdong-HK Information
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Liu He'en, deputy provincial head of the
Department of Communications, as saying that the expressway is
planned from Shantou to Shenzhen, connecting up with the HK
expressway system.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the expressway is expected to reach Zhuhai,
Xinhui, Taishan, Yangjiang and west Guangdong via Zhuhai's
Lingdingyang Bridge whose construction has been included in the
province's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996--2000).
</P>
<P>
The official said that financing for the eastern section of the
expressway has been found and is being worked on for other
parts. Matters concerning the construction of the coastal
expressway vis-a-vis Hong Kong has not been decided, because the
province still has to consult with HK departments, and a detailed
timetable has yet to be decided.

<HEADLINE> Invisible Assets of China's Newspaper Evaluated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese newspaper produced
by schoolchildren has been officially valued at almost 70 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Little Masters was launched in 1983 with a circulation of just
12,000.
</P>
<P>
Now it is one of China's top selling publications, with sales
topping one million each issue.
</P>
<P>
What makes the achievement all the more incredible is the age
of the contributors.
</P>
<P>
The majority of its editors and contributors are aged 15 or
under. One contributor was aged just five years old!
</P>
<P>
The invisible assets of the Little Masters' trade mark and
title has been valued at 69,880,000 yuan by a local evaluation
Agency in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in China that the invisible assets of a
newspaper have been evaluated.
</P>
<P>
Chen Pengsheng, director of the Shanghai Youlian Invisible
Assets Evaluation Agency, said "All the work has been carried out
on the basis of international practice and Chinese law."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Shijie, president of the newspaper, said that the
evaluation showed that the Little Masters has been accepted by
society.
</P>
<P>
The Little Masters, which published its first issue in 1983,
is the first of its kind in China to present news, features and
pictures by children.
</P>
<P>
"It is good for children to improve their ability and widen
their knowledge through taking part in activities of serving for
the public," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the newspaper will use its invisible assets to
provide more opportunities for Chinese children.

LANZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The inland and economically
strapped province of Gansu, in northwest China, pumped three
billion yuan into fixed assets in the post and telecommunications
sector during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
This was a 12-fold increase from the Seventh Five-Year Plan
(1986-1990).
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-1995 period, the province increased local telephone
capacity by 663,000 lines, six times that of the previous
five-year plan, bringing the total capacity to 769,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to applications of optical cable, microwave, satellite,
and program-controlled technology the province has dramatically
upgraded its telecommunications networks and technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
Program-controlled telephones now account for 98.96 percent of
the province's total, as against 13.2 percent at the end of the
1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three cities now have program-controlled telephones,
instead of the one at the end of the previous period.
</P>
<P>
The business volume of the postal service jumped to 710 million
yuan at the end of 1995, as against 170 million yuan at the end of
1990.

Dhaka, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's mainstream
opposition parties are expected to announce fresh action programs
today with a call for the president to take over the country's
administration.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League (AL) chief Sheikh Hasina urged the president
to exercise his constitutional powers and set up a caretaker
government with the Chief Justice or a judge of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court or an eminent person as its head.
</P>
<P>
"Now there's no government in the country," the AL chief told
reporters after the voting ended. "Over 95 percent of the people
have expressed no confidence in the present government."
</P>
<P>
Hasina alleged that the 'real voters' did not turn up to cast
their votes in Thursday's elections and most of the polling
centers remained empty.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission admitted the polling turnout was poor
but accused the opposition of obstructing the voters from casting
their votes.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed in Thursday's anti-polls
crashes. The opposition will offer special prayers at mosques
across the country for them.

Dhaka, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Bangladesh's
opposition parties Thursday unequivocally rejected the elections
to the sixth parliament and vowed to continue their street
agitation for a new election under a neutral government.
</P>
<P>
They said that people by rejecting the elections have expressed
their no-confidence in the government and as such the government
has lost all legal and moral authority to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
Jatiya Party Secretary General Hossain Monju said the polls
where more than 90 percent of the voters did not cast their votes
was farcical and completely unacceptable to the people.
</P>
<P>
"So the government must step down now and the proper authority
should form a non-party neutral caretaker government to conduct
fresh general elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami parliamentary group Ansar
Ali at a city rally Thursday demanded cancellation of the
"farcical election". He urged the democratic and donor countries
not to accept the election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
claimed the voter turnout was good braving the threats and
coercion by the anti-election opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
BNP Standing Committee member Badruddoza Chowdhury told
reporters after polling ended that the turnout would have been
much higher if there were no violence and acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He refrained from giving any figure but said that normally in
Bangladesh the voter turnout was around 52 percent.

COLOMBO, February 16 (Xinhua)-- Six top-rung Tamil rebels were
among the 25 killed in Wednesday's sea battle off the eastern
coast of Sri Lanka when the navy and air force jointly destroyed a
rebel arms vessel "Horison"' and its escort boats, according to
security sources today.
</P>
<P>
Rebel radio confirmed the deaths of their six top-rung members
and the 19 others.
</P>
<P>
Navy and air force personnel who participated in the sea battle
said that there were several bodies afloat in the sea, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The wrecked vessel which was first seen drifting towards the
coast was reported to have sunk Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The "Horison"' is the Tamil rebels' second arms ship to have
been destroyed after detection. Four years ago, the Indian navy
destroyed the MV Ahat.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that it is customary for senior officers
of the rebels to accompany an arms ship.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are now underway to ascertain the country where
the arms vessel originated from.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Premier of Queensland
state in Australia announced today that he would quit as the
leader of the state Labor party on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Goss announced the decision after Labor lost its majority
in the state parliament.
</P>
<P>
Labor was defeated by the Coalition of the Liberal and National
parities in a by-election held last week and lost the crucial seat
of Mundingburra to the Liberal party.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Labor and the Coalition hold 44 seats in the state
parliament each, with the balance hanging on the independent
member of parliament Liz Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's decision to support the Coalition effectively
toppled the Labor government in the state and gave the Coalition a
majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The defeat of its Queensland branch was a blow to the federal
Labor party, which is trailing the Coalition in opinion polls in
the run-up to the March 2 federal election.
</P>
<P>
After the downfall of the Goss government, Labor keeps a grip
on only one of the eight states and territories in Australia.
</P>
<P>
It sent a warning signal for the federal Labor government.
Prime Minister Paul Keating admitted that the economic
achievements in 13 years of Labor governing had failed to fully
transform into direct benefits for the voters.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the non-governmental Business Council of
Australia showed that living standards dropped under the Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition is pushing an "enough is enough" campaign against
Labor, saying it is time to have a change of government.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that state governments might be scapegoats
and avert Labor's fate at the federal level. They said the voters
showed their anger against Labor's policies in state elections,
but in the federal election they would support the government.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Queensland would also have a wakening effect on
Labor supporters, showing how close the government would come to a
defeat, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that Labor may lose five seats in Queensland
and New South Wales respectively. But it might gain extra seats in
Victoria and Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
With less than two weeks to go before the national poll, Labor
still needs a major policy boost to catch up with the coalition
and win another three-year term of office.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Foreign Policy Targeted to Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's foreign policy will
maintain its Latin America orientation, Foreign Minister Jose
Angel Gurria said today at the beginning of a summit with seven
Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Mexico, Costa Rica, El salvador, Guatemala,
Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama and Belize Prime Minister attended the
"Tuxtla II" summit, named after a Mexican city, to seek closer
economic and political relations between them.
</P>
<P>
"The priority given to Central America and Latin America in
general has never been changed," Gurria said.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that the Ernesto Zedillo (Mexico's president)
administration is giving top priority to the neighboring countries
and that Mexico reaffirms itself as deeply Latin American," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said emphasis will not only be put on economic
matters. "There will also be advances in political issues," he
said, "what we expect here is that the eight nations will walk
together toward a higher level of integration in all the themes."
</P>
<P>
However, as there was big difference between the conditions
raised by countries at the "Tuxtla I" summit in 1991, "This must
be seen as a process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we are developing now is a regional concept of
hemispheric integration, with fixed deadlines, in a very intense
process." he explained.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said the summit will address regional themes, including
drug trafficking, migration, arms traffic, environment and
agreements with international organizations, all in the context of
the negotiations for the American Free Trade Zone, agreed on in
the United States in December, 1994.

BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa will make a proposal during the Asia-Europe meeting to
set up an environmental technology center in Thailand, according
to a report of the Nation newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The center, if agreed upon, would serve as a tangible
achievement for the meeting, to be attended by leaders from 25
Asian and European countries.

International Trade and Industry Yoshihiro Sakamoto earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay asked japan to support the center financially and with
expertise and staff, senior Thai officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Protests Russian Move on Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today charged that
Russia's unilateral move to stop trimming the Black Sea Fleet
violated a bilateral agreement reached last year in Sochi, a
Russian port city near the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Duma, the lower house of the parliament, adopted
Wednesday a bill to suspend reducing manpower and withdrawing
warships and ground and air forces from bases of the Fleet until
the agreement comes into force.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Russia is also halting the transfer of ground
facilities to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Mukhin, head of the Ukrainian parliament's Committee
on Defence and State Security, said his committee might propose a
bill on the status of foreign military forces on Ukrainian
territory in reaction to the Russian move.
</P>
<P>
The Independence Information Agency quoted a Ukrainian lawmaker
as saying that the Russian bill was a "serious blow" to bilateral
relations and threatened the signing of their friendly cooperation
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the row may also affect the planned visit
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Ukraine, which has just been
scheduled on April 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Black Sea Fleet, one of the Soviet Union's
four main fleets with more than 830 warships, has disrupted
Ukrainian-Russian relations since the disintegration of the Soviet
Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people were killed
and more than 300 injured in clashes during Bangladesh's 6th
parliamentary polls Thursday, according to sources of the Election
Commission (EC) today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said two people each died in districts of Rajbari,
Dinajpur, Chittagong and Jhenidah while one each in districts of
Faridpur, Barisal, Sylhet, Chuadanga, Rangpur and Chandpur.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, polling had been once postponed in 2,431 centers of
59 districts across the country due to violence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Information Minister M. Shamsul Islam as
saying that only six people were killed and 306 centers postponed
their polling due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
The election was marred by killing, violence, boycotts and
strikes, the sources said, adding that voter turnout was extremely
low.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties boycotted the polls because
of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party's refusal to meet their
demand for a neutral caretaker government instead of the present
administration to supervise the election.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties ended their 48-hour strike today and are
expected to announce fresh agitation programs later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Backs Interoceanic Waterway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A joint commission made up of
Nicaraguan executive and legislative representatives stated its
support for the building of a canal and called on international
investors to present their proposals.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the commission, which is to study the
projected interoceanic waterway, said the Nicaraguan government is
interested in "promoting and supporting the construction and
operation of any modern transportation means to facilitate
interoceanic transportation."
</P>
<P>
The Interoceanic Canal Company of Nicaragua (CCIN), an
international consortium, expressed its interest in building an
interoceanic waterway on Nicaraguan territory and the Nicaraguan
government has had several meetings with CCIN to reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
A regulatory law is reportedly to be worked out this year for
the construction of this canal, whether it is an overland
throughway or a waterway.
</P>
<P>
The main conditions imposed by the joint commission are full
respect for Nicaraguan sovereignty and territorial integrity,
compatibility with the sustained development model that guarantees
environmental quality and the rational use of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Construction and Transportation Minister Pablo Vijil
explained that the government is not calling a bidding, but
opening a proposal that will lay the juridical basis for inviting
bidders later.
</P>
<P>
Vijil said the interoceanic waterway construction will increase
Nicaragua's development possibilities. "Big investments could be
made in Nicaragua around the waterway and also world financial
centers, free zones, employment sources, and an improvement in the
Nicaraguans' living conditions."

<HEADLINE> Energy Shortage Cuts Industrial Production in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Production at many Romanian
enterprises is declining because of serious power and gas
shortages in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the stricken enterprises are some major companies in the
chemical, machine-building and metallurgical industries, including
the country's two largest iron and steel complexes, Galati and
Hunedoara.
</P>
<P>
The two steelworks receive only 40 to 60 percent of the
electricity and 2 percent of the gas they need to maintain daily
operations.
</P>
<P>
The partial shutdown of many enterprises has also idled a
considerable number of workers.
</P>
<P>
The power shortfall is mainly blamed on the bitter winter
weather, which has impeded normal operations in all hydroelectric
power stations. Hydroelectric power makes up 28 percent of
Romania's total electricity production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thermal electricity has decreased because of
shortages of coal and heavy oil, and gas supplies imported from
Russia have fallen by 2 million cubic meters since January.
</P>
<P>
To ensure power supplies for residents, the government was
forced to slash supplies for industry.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting, the government decided to import more
heavy oil and coal for thermal-electricity plants.
</P>
<P>
Romania's economy will continue to suffer as meteorologists
predict falling temperatures next month.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian prime minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that some Malaysian businessmen
were keen to go to Bosnia to see what could be done to help
reconstruct the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the launch of the Global Humanitarian Appeal for
Bosnia and Herzegovina over the Internet here, Mahathir said: "The
government will leave it largely to the private sector. I think
they will know how to go about it."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a special appeal for funds for Bosnia and
Herzegovina needed to be launched in Malaysia, Mahathir said:" I
don't think a special appeal needs to be launched at this moment."
</P>
<P>
When asked if the world was doing enough to assist in the
rehabilitation of Bosnia, Mahathir said: "I think so. The world is
made up of different kinds of people. Some people may not be very
sympathetic, some may think that there are others who are
suffering too."
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Bosnia, Mahathir urged Western powers to
stand firm in implementing the Dayton peace accord, adding: "My
worry is that the Western powers may not stand firm. From past
experiences, they tend to give in, but I hope this will not
happen."

<HEADLINE> C. America to Negotiate Free Trade Accord With Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Central American countries
were divided over the negotiation of a free trade agreement with
Mexico on the eve of a summit meeting of their leaders which
starts here today.
</P>
<P>
The summit in the Costa Rican capital is attended by the
presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa
Rica and Panama, the prime minister of Belize and the president of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The first summit, from which Panama and Belize were absent, was
held in January 1991 in the Mexican city of Tuxtla Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
The Central American strategy of negotiating as a bloc with
Mexico has been bogged down because each country has reached a
different stage in their bilateral negotiations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica signed a free trade agreement with Mexico in January
1995, and Nicaragua's negotiations with Mexico on a free trade
pact are very advanced.
</P>
<P>
However, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have just begun
negotiations which have stalled since the Mexican financial crisis
at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
With negotiations in varying stages of progress, Central
America's desire to negotiate together has been effectively
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
However, at a separate meeting on Wednesday, Central American
foreign ministers agreed to negotiate a free trade agreement with
Mexico on the basis of the existing treaties.
</P>
<P>
The summit's agenda will focus on trade issues, but Costa Rican
President Jose Maria Figueres and Foreign Minister Fernando
Naranjo have also insisted on the political importance of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The summit will end Friday with the signing of a joint
communique and two other working documents.

<HEADLINE> Asian Ministers Say ASEM Should Avoid Social Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers from 10
Asian countries have reached consensus that social issues should
be separated from trade at the upcoming Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM), Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 10 Asian countries and the 15 members of the
European Union (EU) will meet for the first time on March 1-2 in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers "agreed that we should not link human
rights, environmental and labor issues with trade," Amnuay was
quoted as saying by a report from Chiang Rai, north Thailand,
where the ministers met for a one-day meeting to prepare for the
ASEM.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that social standards should be discussed at
appropriate forums. For example, labor rights should be included
under the International Labor Organization and not be raised at
the World Trade Organization (WTO) forum, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to Amnuay's statement, Daniel Descoutures, charge
d'affaires of the European Commission, said that the EU's position
on social issues has been misunderstood by some newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU does not want to impose its own rules and
standards on other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of removing the legitimacy of low wages,
which have been an economic advantage for developing countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU has made it clear that it wants the WTO
ministerial meeting in Singapore in December to launch a study
into the commercial aspects of the push for higher working
standards at an international level.

<HEADLINE> U.S., France Want Summit on Dayton Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States and France
said here on Thursday that they wanted the leaders of Bosnia,
Serbia and Croatia to reaffirm their commitment to the Dayton
peace accord at a summit to be held in Rome at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told a joint press
conference after talks with French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette that the peace process was encountering some difficulties
and a summit was necessary to make sure the Dayton accord was
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Bosnia is no longer in war but is certainly not in peace and it
is in the transition period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Rome meeting has been called at a time when the Dayton deal
is threatened by war crimes, the exchange of prisoners and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
Two Bosnian Serb army officers were seized by the Bosnian
Moslem-led government and extradited on Monday to the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague. The Bosnian Serbs have since refused
to cooperate with the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said IFOR had no authority to arrest Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian Serb army chief General Ratko
Mladic, who are required under the Dayton accord to surrender as
suspected war criminals.
</P>
<P>
De Charette told the press conference that France saw the
summit meeting in Rome as an opportunity to remind the three
parties of their commitments to the Dayton accord and the need to
strictly abide by them.

BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Natural Rubber
Committee has agreed in principle to approve a fund of 1.123
billion baht (44.9 million US dollars) to help support the
domestic rubber industry, the Bangkok Post said today.
</P>
<P>
Some 423 million baht (16.9 million US dollars) of the fund
will be used to build warehouses in the country's southern
provinces and 200 million baht (eight million US dollars) will be
set aside to shore up prices of rubber, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the fund, which was proposed by the Agriculture
Ministry, will be used for packing credits -- short-term loans to
help exporters with cash flow between the time of shipment and
payment.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agriculture Minister Charnchai Pathumarat said that
proper warehouses are needed to store rubber when its prices are
low. He added that having somewhere to keep their inventory would
give farmers more leverage with traders.
</P>
<P>
A recent white paper on Thailand's rubber industry said that
high costs, low productivity and limited market access are hurting
the industry.

ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from
Thursday's powerful blast in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, rose
to 60 and there were also scores of others injured, said a report
reaching here from Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
The blast ripped through an ammunition depot at the
Presidential Palace in central Kabul at about 5 p.m. local time,
shattering windows and scattered debris in a 500-meter radius
around the palace.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials were quoted as saying that the blast was
triggered by an accidental fire near the depot.
</P>
<P>
The Kabul government ruled out any sabotage, saying that no
senior official was killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said that they had seen up to 60 bodies lying
in the presidential compound after the blast, considered to be the
strongest one to rock the war-torn Kabul in as many years.
</P>
<P>
The report said 25 injured people were sent to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Anti-aircraft shells, motors, rocket-propelled grenades and
artillery shells continued to explode for more than two hours
after the initial blast cast a huge, black plume of smoke over the
city.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace, ministry buildings, banks and nearby
hotels were seriously damaged in the explosion, but defense
officials said President Burhanuddin Rabbani was not in his office
when the blast occurred.
</P>
<P>
Mini-buses and cars passing the scene were hurled into gutters
by the blast, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in this
major city in northeast China has kept a strong momentum,
according to an official with the local foreign economic and trade
co-operation committee.
</P>
<P>
The city approved 3,800 foreign-funded projects and actually
utilized three billion US dollars in foreign investment in the
Eighth Five-Year Plan Period (1991-1995). The figures are more
than eight times those of the previous five-year plan period, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment used for technology upgrading has also made
a breakthrough in the last five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among 333 large or medium-size enterprises in the city, 120
have taken advantage of foreign investment for technology
upgrading. As a result, a number of joint ventures in the fields
of air-conditioners, glassware, garments, medicine and beer, have
become famous nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment has become the main part of the total
foreign investment in the city.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign businessmen have got enhanced confidence
in their projects and invested more in them.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city's industrial structure has improved along
with the increase in the number of projects and expansion of

JINAN February 16 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Shandong Province is
introducing an electronic data interchange system for its customs
offices and for a national economic information network.
</P>
<P>
The province's public EDI network has been connected up with an
international one, and some major local container shipping units
are linked to an EDI center.
</P>
<P>
Because the system can reduce the amount of paperwork or even
eliminate it, it is considered an effective instrument for
improving efficiency in data processing, communications, and
corporate management.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, all custom offices, commodity inspection,
quarantine, and transportation departments at major ports and
airports will be connected via the provincial EDI network, and by
national and international ones.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, EDI is expected to be available in most businesses
involved in foreign trade, and will begin to be used in
manufacturing, retailing, and administrative sectors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Table Tennis Star Stuck at Transfer Row (take two)  By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The existing system has loopholes," said Yao Zhenxu, vice
chairman of the Chinese Table Tennis Center. "The Center is going
to amend the system in order to avoid the problem like what Ding
is facing."
</P>
<P>
"All clubs are required to register in the Center before April
1," Yao said. "Any club which fails to meet the deadline will
have no right to keep their players from moving elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman also said that the Center was to launch table
tennis leagues soon.
</P>
<P>
"The clubs will be classified in different divisions," he
said. "And the leagues matches will be played in the
home-and-away format."
</P>
<P>
The table tennis leagues are expected to draw back quite a few
players who have an intention to move abroad to make money.
</P>
<P>
"Many players would like to stay to play in the Chinese
leagues," said women's world No. 1 Deng Yaping, the singles
champion both in the 1991 and 1995 world championships.
</P>
<P>
Deng failed to defend her crown in the 1993 Worlds after losing
to former teammate Jing Jung Hong, who represented Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"For years, I have been playing for the glory of China, now I
can play for my club and my personal interests," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Women's world No. 2 Qiao Hong, also a loser to a Chinese
representing her adopted country in the 1993 Worlds, has joined
Beijing Huayuan Club.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ding, Qiao's transfer didn't cause outcry in her home
province of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's Xinmin Evening News blamed the blockage of Ding's
transfer on the "aftereffects" left by He Zhili or Chire Koyama in
her Japanese name, former world champion from Shanghai now
representing Japan.
</P>
<P>
"People here are still smart over He's surprise win over Deng
Yaping in the 1994 Asian Games and they can hardly stand any kind
of disloyalty," the paper said in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
Yao Zhenxu imputed Ding's suspended transfer to the localism,
saying it would harm the healthy growth of the sport.
</P>
<P>
"Players can hone their skills and gain experiences through
club competitions and they will return to represent their
birthplaces in the national games or national championships," Yao
said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, transfers of players won't affect much of the
interests of their home provinces or cities," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Table Tennis Star Stuck at Transfer Row  By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese table tennis star Ding
Song, whose unique chop-and-attack style has baffled European
rivals, felt bemused for himself as he failed to chop his way out
of the first transfer row in the Chinese table tennis history.
</P>
<P>
Ding, a sensation in the world championships in northern
Chinese city Tianjin in May last year, was recruited late January
by Linfeng Table Tennis Club in Southeast China's Zhejiang
province which promises an annual salary equivalent to 18,000
U.S. dollars to any world champion players.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Physical Culture and Sports Institute, to which
Ding belongs, barred the move on the grounds that Ding, born and
trained in Shanghai, should play for his home city in any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to joining Linfeng, which is the first
club in China to pick me up," Ding said. "In the national games or
the national championships, I will still represent Shanghai. I
can hardly figure out why they don't let me go."
</P>
<P>
The club system for table tennis is a newborn in China compared
with these of soccer and basketball which both have leagues played
in the home-and-away format.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Table Tennis Center, the country's sport governing
body, ushered in the club system in August, 1994, in a hope to
rejuvenate its national sport and check the exodus of Chinese
players.
</P>
<P>
Nine table tennis clubs have been set up in China since then.
</P>
<P>
A club in central China's Henan province attracted its hometown
heroine Deng Yaping, triple gold medalist in the 1995 world
championships, while Linfeng enrolled Xiong Ke, national team
member from Beijing, local player Lu Lin, Olympic and world men's
doubles champion, and Ding Song.
</P>
<P>
Ding jumped to fame in the Tianjin Worlds after, with a
wickedly deceptive game, helping China to a 3-2 thrilling win over
three-straight-time world champions Sweden and ended the singles
campaign of then world number one Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese club system for table tennis is far from perfect.
It allows "free-flow" of players among clubs, but at the same
time, it holds that the owner of player has the right to
discourage his or her move.

ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A rocket grenade exploded near
the U.S. embassy here Thursday night, damaging cars but causing no
injuries, according to local police.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 inch rocket-propelled anti-tank grenade, which exploded
about 100 meters away from the main embassy building in central
Athens, ripped through the embassy parking lot and blew out
windows in the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
"It was an attack with a rocket grenade...It appears to have
been carried out by the known guerrilla group," Costas Geitonas,
Minister of Public Order, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Geitonas said that all signs indicated that it was an attack by
November 17, a leftist guerrilla group which takes its name from
the day in 1973 when the then-ruling military junta sent in tanks
to suppress a student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic School.

Greek and Turkish forces seized neighboring islets to press
claims to the uninhabited outcrops and were on the brink of

In order to better ensure the healthy development of overseas
labor service, this provincial capital, Putian City and some other

<P>
Statistics show that total grain production in the province

GUANGZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A song advocating public
morality has been written in south China's Guandong Province,

</P>
<P>
With four characters forming a line, the 800-word song
encourages people to abide by the order of social life and ensure
the security of public life; take good care of public property;
protect the public health and environment; and handle the human
relationship properly.
</P>
<P>
It inherits the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation and
the civilization of mankind, emphasizing self-discipline and being
kind to other people.
</P>
<P>
Contents about family planning, environment protection, and the
importance of science are added to the song.

gambling, corruption, and drugs are also mentioned in the song.

it is easy for people to memorize the words and popularize it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Take Three Cuban Asylum Seekers To Guantanamo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
offered to take three Cubans who had requested asylum in Panama to
the U.S. military base in Guantanamo, Cuba, U.S. Consul General in
Panama Lynn W. Cuartain said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the U.S. diplomat said the decision to take the
Cubans to Guantanamo was made after the U.S. consulted with Panama
and efforts are being made to locate the three.
</P>
<P>
The three Cubans escaped from a refugee camp on the banks of
the Panama Canal one year ago. They were detained recently by
immigration agents in Alcalde Diaz because they could not produce
immigration documents but were later released.
</P>
<P>
Some months ago the Panamanian government said that thousands
of Cubans detained by the U.S. Coast Guard as they were trying to
reach Florida had been lodged at U.S. military installations on
Panamanian territory. Most were taken to Guantanamo and then on to
Florida.

and got a warm response from such organizations as the British
Chamber of Commerce, Roland Berger and Partner, Max Weishaupt, and
Jing An Hilton Hotel.

<P>
More than 30 foreign individuals also attended the party, which
collected nearly 80,000 yuan (around 10,000 US dollars) in
donations to help support 33 students suffering from illness or
from poor families.

The foreign friends have formed friendships with their
beneficiaries and visited with each other. Some foreign friends
gave writing materials to the students and some invited them to
spend the Spring Festival at their homes.

schooling, they decided to lend a helping hand.

<HEADLINE> State-owned Enterprise Reform Means Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Becoming involved in
state-owned enterprise restructuring is a shortcut for overseas
investors to enter China's markets, according to Mi Ki Yeung,
vice-president of Taiwan's Ta Fu International (Holdings) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Ta Fu established a joint venture, the Fujin Timber Trade
Company, with the Tianjin Veneer Board Plant five years ago, and
it is now the country's biggest timber-manufacturing enterprise,
with fixed assets of more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Before the joint venture was arranged, the plant was a
state-owned enterprise with about 1,000 employees, and had been
running in the red for years, with about 10 million yuan in
losses. It had had a glorious past, making profits of about three
to four million yuan annually, before 1991, but lack of equipment
and bad management hindered its operation, according to Yeung.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture started business in 1991 and showed a profit
of about 12 million yuan at the end of the year. It has by now
absorbed 16 loss-making state-owned enterprises and even opened
several overseas branches in Peru and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Its success has proven that state-owned enterprises have great
potential to be tapped, Yeung says, and reshaping key production
elements is essential for improving economic performance.
</P>
<P>
"China's present reform in state-owned enterprises means more
opportunities for foreign investors," Yeung said, "and everybody
taking part will be well rewarded."

<P>
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will introduce
a new honors system to distinguish itself from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the ruling National Party Thursday at
its caucus meeting now going on in Akaroa near the South Island
city of Christchurch.
</P>
<P>
The new system will sweep away most of the existing system
adopted from Britain, but only retain the titles of Knights and
Dames. The non-titular Order of New Zealand will be NZ's top
honor, and below it will be two ranks of the Order of Merit.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said the decision reflects NZ's
independence and marks "the next step of the journey" away from
the British honors system.

CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The federal coalition has promised extensive spending cuts
to deliver a 1.7 billion Australian dollar (1.28 billion US
dollar) improvement to the bottom line of its first budget if it
wins the election, but has backed away from a previous commitment
to delivering an underlying budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The lure of massive new gas demand from Japan, Korea and
Taiwan in the next two decades has provoked the world's major oil
companies to seek out Australia's liquefied natural gas potential.
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government's controversial withdrawal of
frequencies used for analog mobile phone services could leave the
way open for another type of analog service.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for End to Hostilities in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today called on the Afghan parties involved in
the armed conflicts to end the hostilities forthwith.
</P>
<P>
The council "deeply deplores" the continuation of armed
hostilities in Afghanistan, which have brought deaths and
destruction to the people and property of Afghanistan and threaten
the peace and security of that region, according to a presidential
statement.
</P>
<P>
Council president Madeleine Albright of the United States said
in her statement that the council is particularly concerned about
the recent intensification of shelling and air attacks in and
around the capital of Kabul and the blockade of the city.
</P>
<P>
By armed hostilities, the statement referred to the battles
between the forces of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the
Taleban Islamic militia. In recent months, Taleban, which emerged
more than a year ago, has been shelling and rocketing the Afghan
capital in its drive to unseat Rabbani and introduce strict
Islamic law throughout Afghanistan. Mujahideen groups have kept
that country at war since they ousted the previous regime in April
1992.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called on the parties involved not to
obstruct the delivery of humanitarian aid and other needed
supplies to the innocent civilians of the city.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is deeply concerned that the continued
conflict in Afghanistan provides fertile ground for terrorism,
arms transfers and drug trafficking, which destabilize the
whole region and beyond," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It calls on the leaders of the Afghan parties to put aside
their differences and to halt such activities," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The council also called on all states in a position to do so to
take steps to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan and to
refrain from interfering in its internal affairs and to prevent
the flow to the Afghan parties of weapons and other supplies that
can fuel the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The council urged Taleban to release the seven crew members of
the captured Russian plane "immediately and without any
preconditions." The Russian plane was forced by Teleban jets to
land at Kandahar in early August.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed its commitment to the full sovereignty,
independence, territorial integrity and national unity of
Afghanistan, the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic received Spanish Foreign Minister Carlos Westendorp here
today over bilateral issues and the situation in the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Serbian presidential office after the
talks said the two sides had devoted their great attention to the
further development of bilateral relations, particularly in
continuing high-level political dialogue between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had agreed that a consistent implementation of the
peace agreement for Bosnia would enable an all-round normalization
in the region and would eliminate one of the most dangerous
crisis-spots in Europe, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the current official visit by Westendorp opened
genuine prospects for improving cooperation in the economic,
cultural, scientific-technical, sports and other domains in which
mutually beneficial results had been recorded in the past.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic also
held talks with his Spanish counterpart Westendorp today.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two foreign ministers emphasized the
importance of an equal treatment of all the former warring sides
in Bosnia and of preventing provocations that could obstruct the
implementation of the peace agreement, the Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the importance of the consistent
implementation of all provisions in the peace agreement, the
timely holding of elections in the two entities and the need for
greater humanitarian aid for refugees in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Spain is expected to support the speedy normalization of
relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
European Union and OSCE, which is in the interest of peace and
integrationist processes in the Balkans and in Europe, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp arrived here Wednesday on a two-day official visit,
heading a delegation of government officials and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls For Renewed Cease-fire in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council today called upon the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of
Sierra Leon to renew its cease-fire and to enter into a full
dialogue for peace without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made less than two weeks before the scheduled
elections to return that country to civilian rule. The RUF has
threatened to disrupt the elections if they go ahead on February
26.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council welcomed the results
of the meeting of the National Consultative Conference on February
12, 1996 that overwhelmingly supported the decision to maintain
February 26, 1996 as the date of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its belief that the holding of free and
fair elections as scheduled is of critical importance to Sierra
Leone's transition to democratic constitutional rule.
</P>
<P>
"Any delay in the elections or interruption in this process is
likely to erode international donor support for Sierra Leone," the
council warned.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed its continued concern about the
humanitarian situation and suffering of the people resulting from
the conflict in Sierra Leone and called upon member states to
continue to provide humanitarian assistance to address the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The civil war of Sierra Leone between the government and the
RUF began in 1991. Since then, some 10,000 people have been killed
in the war.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Wally N'Dow,
Secretary-General of United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements (Habitat II), announced here today that China will
host observance of the World Water Day 1996 in Beijing on March
22.
</P>
<P>
The activities include an international conference on water --
a major theme to be discussed at the U.N. conference in Istanbul,
an international children's event and an exhibition, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in developing countries some one billion people
lack access to safe drinking water, and 1.7 billion people lack
access to adequate sanitation. Today four million children under
the age of five die each year due to lack of safe drinking water
and unsanitation. The use of contaminated water causes 80 percent
of all diseases and contributes to 30 percent of mortalities in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhendong, Deputy Minister of Construction of China, said
that the Chinese government has cooperated with the preparatory
committee of Habitat II and made various preparations for
observance of the World Water Day and other activities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to
protection and conservation of water resources as two-thirds of
Chinese cities do not have enough water supply, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to host the activities above to strengthen
international cooperation in water conservation, he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The personal income in U.S.
Southwest and the Rocky Mountain regions rose stronger than other
regions last summer, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a report on states' personal income of last summer, the
department said that Seven of the 12 states with the fastest

percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the other five fast-growing states were:
Nevada and Delaware, up 2.3 percent each; Florida, 1.7 percent;
and Oregon and Louisiana, 1.6 percent each.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the personal income growth in U.S. Far West was only

<P>
Only in Hawaii did inflation exceed income growth.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Husband of 13-Year-Old British Girl Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Musa Komeagac, 18, husband of
Sarah Cook, a 13-year-old British girl, was released from prison
today by a court in the Southeastern city of Kahramanmaras, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the court adjourned and Musa would be at
liberty until the next hearing.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mevlut Yildirim said that Musa had been charged with the
statutory rape of Sarah Cook, and his father Ali Komeagac had
been charged with being an accessory to the crime.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Isa Firat Kupeli demanded the release of Musa
Komeagac, saying some of the evidence had been collected. He
requested that copies of the identity cards of Sarah and her
family be obtained through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Musa Komeagac's attorneys said they had presented the court
with a report testifying that Cook's physique was that of a
16-year-old.
</P>

Musa explained they met on holiday in the Mediterranean city
of Antalya last year, and married in a Moslem ceremony with the
permission of Sarah's mother.

He pointed out that he would wait for Sarah until they could
have an official marriage, adding that she would be allowed to
marry legally in September with parental consent. His father said

Musa and she married.

Kahranmanmaras, returned to Britain on February 6 with her
mother.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends Division of Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today recommended a
division of labor between the United Nations and regional
organizations in maintaining international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the second meeting between the
United Nations and regional organizations, he said that U.N.
cannot, by itself, deal with all of the threats to international
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"Vast responsibilities have been placed upon the United
Nations. But, we have not been given the political, military,
material and financial resources required to accomplish the
objectives that have been established," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the outstanding contributions to U.N. amounted to over three
billion U.S. dollars, the U.N. chief said that he could not
predict how the most severe crisis in U.N. history would be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
"But it is clear that the United Nations will be very
constrained in undertaking new tasks. Indeed, some activities and
missions may have to be phased out because of lack of resources,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"A division of Labor between the United Nations and regional
organizations -- or delegation from the United Nations to regional
organizations -- has thus become more urgent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of a dozen regional bodies attended today's meeting.
They include the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),
the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), the Arab League, the Commonwealth,
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).

<HEADLINE> Turkey Hopes Iraq-UN Oil-for-Food Talks Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey hopes that the
Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food talks would succeed for Iraq would import
food and basic products from this country if the talks succeed.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted Turkish
diplomats as saying that the U.N. could insert an article on
Iraq's food purchases into a possible agreement. "Food and basic
goods could easily be supplied from Turkey, if relations between
Turkey and neighboring Iraq are considered," the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
After Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the U.N. Security Council
imposed trade sanctions, which barred oil exports, Iraq's chief
source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has maintained that the embargo will
remain in place until the council is satisfied that Iraq has
complied with U.N. demands to dismantle its programs to build
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But the embargo had brought immense suffering to the Iraqi
people and the U.N. proposed the oil-for-food formula last April.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the U.N. and Iraqi negotiators that started
last week in New York center around a U.N. offer to allow Iraq to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolution 986, some of the money would go to the
U.N. to finance its post-Gulf war operations in Iraq, and some
toward war reparations which iraq has been ordered to pay.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had repeatedly rejected the offer, saying it refringed on
its sovereignty. But amid increasing hardship it agreed to discuss
the offer last month.

<HEADLINE> Anglo-Irish Summit May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A planned summit between
British Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart John
Bruton to discuss the stalled Ulster peace process may be delayed,
reported BBC TV this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Anglo-Irish summit had been expected to go ahead in London
in the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
But government sources both in London and Dublin have indicated
that the meeting is more likely to take place the following week.
</P>
<P>
Senior civil servants from both governments have to work out a
formula which has to contain Britain's notion for elections in
Northern Ireland as well as Ireland's idea for "proximity talks"
among various parties in the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
At present there is a big gap between Britain and Ireland on
how to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Britain emphasizes elections in Northern Ireland as the best
way forward to all-party negotiations and this notion has gained
support from the Protestant unionists who defend British rule over
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Ireland insists that any election in the conflict-torn province
be preceded by "proximity talks" in which political opponents
would meet under the same roof to ease tension and suspicion and
this position has been supported by the Social Democratic and
Labour Party, the largest Roman Catholic party, and Sinn Fein,
both in favor of reunification of the whole Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It is generally considered that prospects for all-party talks
are remote in the short term, but peace talks is urgently needed
now.

CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

summit to back the Palestinian stance in the final stage of the
PLO-Israeli peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Suggests Extending UN Mission in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali proposed today that the
mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) be extended
for further six months until August 29.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali said that
Rene Preval, newly elected president of Haiti, had requested the
extension of the UNMIH.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that the timely holding of the
presidential election was a significant step in the consolidation
of constitutional order in Haiti. The polling took place in a
peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
On the social order, Boutros-Ghali noted that the security
situation in Haiti had improved markedly last September and
October. However, it deteriorated abruptly in the wake of an
attack on two deputies on November 7 and following violent
demonstrations in Les Cayes, Department du Sud, to which the two
deputies belonged.
</P>
<P>
Common crime remains a very serious problem throughout Haiti
and a major concern for the population, especially the poorer
section.
</P>
<P>
As for the Haitian national police, more than 3,600 of the
designated force of 5,000 officers have been deployed and Haitian
police officers have a visible presence on the roads and in
various communities. But, they are young and inexperienced, and
lack proper infrastructure and equipment, according to the
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious concern is the absence of competent senior
officers and overall leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that widespread unemployment and underemployment,
inadequate or non-existing services and infrastructure and other
economic hardships are weighing on the people of Haiti who are
getting restive with a growing number of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council authorized establishment of the UNMIH in
September 1993 to help Haiti build up the public security service,
the judiciary and the civil service and create other conditions
for economic and social development. At present, the UNMIH
consists of 4,815 troops and 349 civilian police officers.
</P>
<P>
As much remains to be done before it can be said that the
democratic rule is secure in Haiti and its people have embarked
irreversibly on the road to peace, tolerance and prosperity, the
secretary-general asked the Security Council to give a positive
response to the proposal for the extension of the UNMIH.

JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's

violence in the strife-torn Kwazulu/Natal province.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on their behalf after a one-day meeting

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanese Premier Vows to Investigate into Collapse of SOLIDERE Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al Hariri vowed here tonight that investigations will be
conducted into the Thursday collapse of a four-story building
owned by SOLIDERE, the multi-million dollar company in charge of
rebuilding central Beirut.
</P>
<P>
At an Iftar (breakfast during the Moslem fasting month of
Ramadan) held by an Islamic religious group in a five-star hotel
in western Beirut, the Sunni prime minister expressed his
"sorrow" for the victims of the incident.
</P>
<P>
"This incident has shaken hearts of all of us," the
billionaire-turned premier stressed in his speech to the guests.
</P>
<P>
"And I confirm my complete desire of conducting investigations
into it, until those responsible are limited, and rights of the
innocents are guaranteed," Hariri underlined.
</P>
<P>
The state-run National News Agency quoted the "official
security informations" as reporting that the number of victims
has increased to 13 after five bodies were found today under the
rubbles. It also quoted "unofficial information" as saying that
the number of death has risen to 14 until this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In addition, seven people were reportedly injured in the
accident. While the rescuing work was still under way later this
afternoon, Red Cross officials believed that there were persons
still buried under the ruins.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the building, located at the Wadi Abu
Jamil neighborhood, collapsed when more than a dozen of workers
of the SOLIDERE company were dismantling pavement lights, doors
and windows in preparation for the final destruction.
</P>
<P>
The building had been evacuated by most of the families that
had squatted in it for a long time after they had been
compensated by a special national fund for people who had been
displaced during the civil war or as a result of repeated Israeli
attacks on their villages in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A proportion of the compensation was paid by SOLIDERE, which
was masterminded by Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri as part of its
ambitious blueprint to rehabilitate the war-devastated Beirut
downtown, and in which Hariri himself is a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
According to SOLIDERE's high-ranking official sources, only one
 family refused to be evacuated from the building, demanding more
compensation from the national fund and the SOLIDERE company.
</P>
<P>
Having been paid a total of 120,000 U.S. dollars to leave the
building, the Ayyad family demanded 10,000 dollars more, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers pointed out that the incident
couldn't have come at a worse time for Hariri's government,
already reeling under trade union and political opposition
pressure over its economic and social policies.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr
ordered an immediate investigation amid a massive public uproar
which mainly targeted the prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Among the most acrimonious reactions was one coming today from
President of the Lebanese Engineer Association Asim Salam, who
called the building collapse a "sorry and painful incident."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two main Moslem Shiite groups, Amal, headed by
House Speaker Nabih Berri, and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party
of God), have also expressed their outrages.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident occurred, Berri called Prime
Minister Hariri and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr, and asked
for an "immediate and comprehensive investigation."
</P>
<P>
MP Mohammed Berjawi, member of Amal's politburo, Haj Ali
Al-Khalil, Amal's official for the district of Beirut, and
Mohammed Yasin, member of the Higher Shiite Council, were among
the first to arrive at the scene.
</P>
<P>
In statement published by the press today, they all condemned
the incident and held SOLIDERE directly responsible.
</P>
<P>
Beirut Deputy Najah Wakim, a Christian Orthodox and outspoken
critic of Hariri and his government, vowed to sue SOLIDERE and
Premier Hariri personally in court. He demanded an urgent
meeting of the Council of Deputies, and called for a "national
day of mourning."
