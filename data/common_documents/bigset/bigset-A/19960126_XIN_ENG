<HEADLINE> South Mogadishu Celebrates 5th Anniversary Of Barre's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 350 supporters of
South Mogadishu faction leader General Aideed gathered at
October 21 Parade Ground here today to mark the fifth anniversary of
the fall of late President Mohamed Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony, which lasted for more than three
hours, were senior officials of Mohamed Farah Aideed's government including
Interior Minister of Aideed's government Mohamed Qanyare Afrah,
and Mohamed Farah Abdullahi Hasharo, the faction leader's deputy
president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 40 armed wagons took to the streets of
south Mogadishu to mark the occasion. Armed militiamen were
strengthening security in south Mogadishu during the festival.
</P>
<P>
A written message from Aideed, who is currently in Huddur
of southern Somalia, was read at the meeting.
In his letter, Aideed said all those who attended the
struggle would be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
A loose confederation of rebel groups succeeded in
overthrowing Barre on January 26, 1991, after a brutal siege of
Mogadishu. However, the confederation splintered along clan
lines.
</P>
<P>
Barre, who fled to Kenya in May 1992 but left for Nigeria two
weeks later, died in Lagos in January 1995. The country has been
without government since his flight.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting erupted in Mogadishu between supporters of
Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed after Barre's fall, which carved the
city in two. Aideed and Mahdi have both claimed to be president
of Somalia and formed their own governments, but neither has
gained international recognition.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed
did not mark the day.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tourism growth
declined to an average 5 percent annually in the 90's from an
average growth of 10 percent recorded in the previous decade,
Kenyan Tourism Minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister Katana Ngala attributed the decline to the unfavourable
worldwide economic situation, increased competition and adverse
publicity abroad.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of Kenya Association of Tours Operators
(KATO) at a Nairobi hotel, Ngala called on members of KATO and
other firms involved in management of Kenya's tourism industry to
pool resources to improve the quality of service and re-assess
tourism operations in a bid to revamp the sector.
</P>
<P>
He warned that his ministry will take stern action against any
company or individual found to have obtained money from tourists
by fraudulent means, adding that such acts are "unethical and
criminal".

the implementation and consolidation of peace in bosnia," Pangalos

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the on-going
strike in Swaziland today demanded that the government meet key
conditions of the strikers.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise the strike, already the longest in the kingdom,
would be intensified if conditions of the strikers are not
met," said a statement released by the Swaziland Federation of
Trade Unions (SFTS) in Mbaban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they agreed to negotiate a political solution.
</P>
<P>
The SFTS leaders also called for South African President
Mandela to intervene in the crisis, according to a South Afrian
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela should become involved in the negotiation
to seek a solution to the crisis," said SFTU Secretary-General
Jan Situole.
</P>
<P>
He said the five-day strike would continue until the
government or King Mswati III repealed a 1973 decree which
suspended the 1968 Constitution and banned political activities
in the tiny southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the strike was a turning point in Swazi history
which had garnered support from former prime minister Obed
Dlamint.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, a popular union leader before becoming Swaziland's
most respected prime minister, has called for the formation of a
caretaker government to manage a transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
As least one senior Swazi senator is known to have sent
messages of support to the unions and advised them to continue
their action while they have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU represents about 83,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Sithole, SFTU president Richard Nxumalo and other officials of
the trade union were arrested on Monday.

</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister Ronald
Penza unveiled this afternoon a new budget for 1996, which is
characterized by a banance of financiae expenditure and revenue.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the new budget at parhiament, Penza said the total
expenditure in the budget stands at 1161.6 billion Kwacha (about
1.2 billion US dollars) which is equivalent to the porjected
revenue, leaving no deficit.
</P>
<P>
Of the total revenue, the government expects to raise 740
billion Kwacha from the value added tax and other taxes and
duties while 421.6 billion Kwacha come from external
assistance,the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the government has allocated substantial resources to
priority areas to stimulate economic growth, enhance investment
opportunities, create employment and promote social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the economic performance last year, Penza said many
tangible improvements were made in the fields of transport and
communications, construction, real estate, trade, tourism and
non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
However, he said preliminary estimates show that real output
in the economy fell by 3.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Since the population has been growing rapidly, real per
capital income continued to decline in 1995, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some of the developments in 1995 indicate that economic reform
is never easy and straightforward, he said.

appealed today to the Ulster Unionist Party which is opposed to
the international commission's report on Ulster's peace process to
start talks with Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said that he could understand Ulster Unionists' fear

But peace could only come about by talking to adversaries, he
stressed.

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister John Major is also seeking to
meet John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party

Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Major was prepared to discuss next week with Hume his notion of
elections in Northern Ireland, BBC TV reported this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But Hume strongly opposed the elections notion and he has
accused Major of buying votes from Ulster's Protestant legislators
at Westminster to ensure the survival of the crisis-torn
Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SDLP was opposed to a new elected body in
Northern Ireland and had made its opposition on this issue very
clear.

<HEADLINE> IBM Decides to Build System to Suit Intel Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machines Corp. has decided to put aside its ambitious plan to
create a version of its OS/2 operating system for its PowerPC
chip, according to a report of the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The company began to sell its OS/2 operating system earlier
last year, hoping to replace the popular DOS system installed on
many personal computers.
</P>
<P>
However, end users and experts soon found OS/2 has a high
demand on the hardware, the speed of CPU and the size of memory in
particular. And some of its claimed functions could be felt only
on IBM's PowerPC chip.
</P>
<P>
After denying for months that OS/2 for PowerPC had failed to
achieve its goals and missing numerous shipping dates, IBM
officials told employees that the company planned no further
versions for the system in 1996, the Wall Street Journal said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it said, IBM will focus on developing versions of OS/2
for personal computers that run on Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
"The market has moved on and it's developed around Intel on the
desktop," said John M. Thompson, IBM's head of software, adding
that he doesn't see a huge market for any PowerPC mdesktop.

</P>
<P>
"We are expecting much more," Felix George, one of the

Nations agencies and the Interim National Electoral Commission

bilateral peace offers", to convene another consultative
conference and to postpone the date for elections.

RUF continues to hold.

"We have not received any report of any violation for the past
72 hours," a senior frontline commander in Bo in the south said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the east said the ceasefire by the RUF has made a
major impact on the on-going voter registration exercise in
Kailahun and Kenema districts.
</P>
<P>
Elections officer in Kailahun district Osman Kamara said the
"ceasefire has made it possible for voter registration to be
extended" to the remaining four chiefdoms in the Kailahun
district "previously considered unsafe".
</P>
<P>
In another develoment, the militant assistant to the head of
state, Lt Colonel Karefa Kargbo, announced on Friday that the

<HEADLINE> ANAP Turns Down Ciller's Coalition Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The executive committee of
Turkey's Motherland Party (ANAP) today decided to reject the
proposal submitted by caretaker Prime Minister and True Path Party
(DYP) leader Tansu Ciller for rotating premiership between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP executive committee made the final decision after the
two-and-half-hour meeting held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz will hand over the decision to Ciller
on Saturday when they hold talks on whether to form coalition
between the ANAP and DYP.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ANAP parliamentary group rejected Ciller's offer after
 a 7-hour meeting. Almost all the ANAP deputies rejected a
coalition government under the first half of the term to be led by
Ciller during the meeting chaired by Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
ANAP insisted that its chairman Yilmaz should serve the first
term.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ciller proposed to Yilmaz that they share the
premiership on a rotating basis in a coalition between their two
parties, which differ only slightly.
</P>
<P>
The DYP has 135 seats and the ANAP 132 in the Turkish
parliament, each far short of a majority needed to govern alone.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel appointed Ciller to form a
coalition government last Friday after pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan failed to seek a coalition
partner.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Reduces Import Duty for 428 Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government today
announced that the country will reduce import duties of 428
commodities, six percent of the 7,284 total commodities which
taxes will be paid on.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the Indonesian government's new economic
deregulation package on finance, industry and trade management and
the continuation of the country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In May 1995, the government reduced import duties of over 6,000
commodities by 20-25 percent. In 1994, Indonesia reduced import
duty of over 700 commodities and expanded fields for foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to two decrees announced by Finance Minister Mar'ie
Muhammad, the 428 commodities include 400 industrial commodities,
26 agricultural products and two mine and energy products.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the majority of products
enjoying import duty cuts are those capital materials or raw
materials directly or indirectly related to export.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Indonesian government will continue to practise a
series of reforms on various fields.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Boost Investments in Oil Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
decision to cut tariff rates on crude oil is expected to spur more
investments in oil refinery plants.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet last week approved cuts in tariff rates on crude
oil and petroleum products starting this year.
</P>
<P>
Tariff on crude oil, the raw material of petroleum products,
will be lowered from 10 percent to three percent.
</P>
<P>
Tariff on petroleum products will be reduced from 20 percent to
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In line with the tariff reform program, all petroleum products
would have a uniform tariff rate of five percent by January 1,
2004.
</P>
<P>
Trade Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today that the seven
percent tariff deferential on crude oil and petroleum products
would allow refineries to be financially viable.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet is now pushing congress to adopt the proposed
change in import duties for oil," he said, saying it was part of
the government's moves to fully deregulate the industry by the end
of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
considering taking steps to revise some existing investment
procedures at local administrations, which have hampered
investment projects, according to from the Investment Coordinating
Board today.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Investment Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo recently
acknowledged that apart from unprofessional personnel, some
regulations issued by local administrations have resulted in
complicated procedures, thereby hampering new investment projects
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
There are currently at least five local institutions under the
supervision of the Ministry of Home Affairs which issue permits
for the establishment of investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The Investment Coordinating Board cited two examples to explain
the urgent need for revising investment rules for local
administrations.
</P>
<P>
The construction of 10 cement factories in central Java has
been delayed due to problems related to land appropriation in the
province.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 companies committed to establishing new oil
refineries in Indonesia, but none of them have started their
projects due to various problems, including complex procedures at
local administrations.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Women Appeal to US to Remove Bases From Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Japanese
women sponsored an advertisement in the New York Time today,
appealing to the people of the United States and the world to
remove all U.S. bases from Japan.
</P>
<P>
These women said in the advertisement that Japanese women are
"greatly shocked and infuriated" by the incident that a young
schoolgirl was sexually assaulted by three U.S. servicemen on
September 4, 1995, in Okinawa, where 74% of the 136 U.S. bases in
Japan are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to prevent another rape case of an Okinawa girl
is to remove all U.S. bases from Japan," they said.
</P>
<P>
The women noted that there are average 205 criminal cases per
year involving U.S. servicemen reported to police authority in
Okinawa, of which over 110 are sexual assaults against women.
Further, more women who suffered such insults remain silent.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing number of Japanese people are raising their
voices against this situation," they said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 47,000 American soldiers stationed in
Japan. Japanese taxpayers are paying for 70% of the cost of the
U.S. forces in Japan -- 14 million yen per head.
</P>
<P>
The women accused the United States of "infringing the
sovereignty of Japan" and keeping Japan "as the important keystone
of its military strategy in the Pacific and Asia."
</P>
<P>
"Is it a right thing to station armed forces in foreign
countries and make other people suffer?" they questioned.

LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
made a new attack today to the election plan in Northern Ireland
announced by British Prime Minister John Major, saying that the
British government was putting politicalp power before peace in the
troubled province, according to reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Major called for an elected body in Ulster as an alternative to
the report compiled by the international commission in charge of
arms decommissioning process which suggests that twin-track
approach to the peace process be carried out simultaneously and
rejects Britain's demand that the Irish Republican Army must start
to decommission at least some weapons before its political wing
Sinn Fein can be admitted to all-party negotiations on the future
of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
Adams pledged that his party remained committed to the
twin-track peace strategy designed by the UK and Ireland, but he
argued that Major held the key to peace.
</P>
<P>
He accused Major of +binning+ the international commission's
report on the peace process and embraced a unionist agenda.
</P>
<P>
He declared that his party was totally opposed to the notion of
any election in Ulster and "Sinn Fein's opposition to this
implacable".

<HEADLINE> Cypriot, Maltese FMs Holds Talks in Nicosia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides held talks here today with Malta's Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Guido De Marco on bilateral issues
and their countries' bid to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views regarding
developments in the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, De Marco said that the purpose of his
visit to the island "is to discuss aspects of our own foreign
policies which have a common background and a common vision".
</P>
<P>
"Our common background is belonging to the Mediterranean sea
and our common vision is that of joining the EU," he explained.
</P>
<P>
De Marco, who arrived here Thursday night on a two-day
official visit to Cyprus, stressed the need for peace and
stability in the Mediterranean region, which he described as "the
essence of our future".
</P>
<P>
"For this reason Malta has proposed a Council of
Mediterranean States believing that a strong Mediterranean region
will help in making it a safer place for us to live in,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
De Marco noted that Malta and Cyprus are two strong countries
in the Mediterranean with good economic performance. "We believe
that our presence to the EU will add to the Mediterranean
dimension of the EU," he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Michaelides said the interest shown by the EU in
the Mediterranean region makes the role of Cyprus and Malta more
important, as the former constitutes a bridge with the Middle
East and the later with the southern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
He expected the EU accession talks with Cyprus and Malta will
begin in the second half of 1977, as it is estimated that the EU
Intergovernmental Conference will be held in the first half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The EU Ministerial Council decided last March to start
accession talks with Cyprus and Malta six months after the EU
Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides held a meeting
with the Maltese foreign minister, during which they discussed the
developments of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
De Marco is going to leave the island this evening.

King Moshoeshoe II was held today at Thaba Bosiu, the Lesotho
National Shrine near Capital Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The late King Moshoeshoe II was killed in a car accident on
January 15 in Maluti Mountains when his vehicle veered off the
road and went down the hillside.
</P>
<P>
Moshoeshoe's remains, placed on a Cannon Carrier, moved from
the King's ancestral home at Matsieng to Thaba Bosiu Church
Grounds early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
His cortege was met by Royal Lesotho Mounted Police and
Lesotho Defense Force Parade.
</P>
<P>
Attending the funeral were Queen Mamohato Regent, successor to
the throne Crown Prince David Mohato and Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhele, Diplomatic Corps in Maseru and Royal Family members.
</P>
<P>
After a series of memorial service, Moshoeshoe II was buried
at the top of Thaba Bosiu, where his father former King
Moshoeshoe I was buried.
</P>
<P>
The funeral was also attended by South African President
Nelson Mandela, Botswana President Ketumile Masire, Zimbabwean

</P>
<P>
In his tribute to the late king, Masire spoke highly of
Moshoeshoe's role in maintaining peace and stability in Lesotho
and the southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the condolences at the tragic death of the late
King, saying his untimely death was a great loss to both Lesotho
and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Moshoeshoe II, born on May 2, 1938, was the eldest son of
Seeiso Griffith, late Paramount Chief of the then Basutoland.
</P>
<P>
Moshoeshoe became Paramount Chief in March 1960 and assumed
the title of King in 1966 when Lesotho gained its independence
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
He was deposed by the then military government in November
1990 and replaced by his eldest son King Lestie III.
</P>
<P>
However, Moshoeshoe II regained the throne in January 1994
after the abdication of Letsie III.

foreigners who were on a scientific research expedition. So far,
13 of the hostages had been released and the remaining 13 have
been in the hands of the OPM kidnappers for the third week.
</P>
<P>
The military and local church officials had negotiated with the
OPM for the release of the 13 hostages. But two churchmen came
back empty-handed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The abductors had earlier made it clear that their demand is
for recognition of a separate West Papua State.
</P>
<P>
The government has rejected the demand, saying that the
majority of Irian Jaya's people have already decided to be part of
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> New York City Increases Taxi Fare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The New York City Taxi and
Limousine Commission approved on Thursday a 20 percent increase in
taxi fare, and imposed the mandatory retirement age for the cabs.
</P>
<P>
The fare increase, the first since 1990, will take effect
March 1. The charge for the first 1/5 of a mile will rise to two
dollars from 1.50 dollars, and each additional 1/5 mile will
cost 30 cents, up from 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
But the night charge of 50 cents and the rate of 20 cents a
minute stuck in traffic were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the fare for an average ride will
rise to six dollars from five dollars.
</P>
<P>
The taxi fare increase was announced less than three months
after the city announced a 20 percent hike in subway and bus
fares. The city's subway and bus riders started from November 12
to pay 1.50 dollars, instead of 1.25 dollars, for a token.
</P>
<P>
In the new move, the city's transportation authorities also
imposed a maximum five years of service age for cabs and banned
the common practice of converting used cars for taxi use.
</P>
<P>
However, the rule was opposed by many taxi drivers who own
their cabs -- a group representing about half of the city's
11,787 taxis. They said that it would be too expensive for them
to buy a new car for about 23,000 dollars rather than buying a
two-year old car for about 10,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Gold Surges To Five-year High On Huge Fund Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Gold price soared today to
a five-year high since the Gulf crisis as U.S. investment
funds switched their targets from stocks and bonds to
precious metals.
</P>
<P>
Gold was once fixed in London at 407.40 U.S. dollars an
ounce, the highest level since September 28, 1990, when Iraq
invasion of Kuwait provoked panic buying.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices have increased by 5.5 percent since the
beginning of this year, after struggling between 370 to 390
U.S. dollars throughout 1995.
</P>
<P>
The price surge was prompted by the fund buying as well as
growing demand for fabrication in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The fall of production in South Africa, the world's
largest gold mining country, also contributed to the price
boom.
</P>
<P>
Last year South Africa mined only 522.40 tons of gold, a
drop of 61.5 tons and the lowest since 1957.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed there are no signs of global inflation,
usually a prelude of gold rush.  They stressed that the
market is both active and fragile, with possibilities of a
pause or retreat, provided that the funds took immediate
profits.

<HEADLINE> Deworming Campaign in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
launch a deworming campaign in elementary schools this year.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the campaign will target around 18,000
elementary schools outside Java and Bali, according to a release
by the Ministry of Health available here today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign includes a program to improve the nutrition of
children by giving them nutritional supplements and administering
medication for worm-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
A government survey of 20,000 elementary schools conducted last
year found that the physical growth of about 50 percent of the
pupils have been stunted, largely because of worms.
</P>
<P>
According to the Health Ministry, the government has allocated
62.8 billion rupiah (27.3 million US dollars) for the purchase of
additional food, 1.03 billion rupiah (435,000 US dollars) for
medication against worm-related diseases, and 3.58 billion rupiah
(1.56 million US dollars) for carrying out the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Government Celebrates 10th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan National
Resistance Movement (N.R.M.) government today celebrated its 10th
anniversary by hailing a 10 percent economic growth it has
gained since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Kampala, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said that Uganda's gross domestic product (GDP)
increased from 0.2 percent in 1984-85 to 10 percent in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Inflation came down from 240 percent in 1984-85 to 3.4 percent
in 1994-95, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves have increased from 14 million U.S.
dollars in 1984-85 to the present 450 million, with the country's
foreign exchange inflows up from 300 million dollars in 1984-85
to 1200 million dollars in 1994-95, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Uganda rehabilitated and constructed
7,000 kilometres of feeder roads and 3,900 kilometres of trunk
roads, he said.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue also saw an increase from 5.2 percent in
1988 to 10.9 percent in 1994, Museveni told the rally.
</P>
<P>
It is because of these developments that Uganda has gained
self-sufficient in food, beer, bread, edibale oil, milk and
animal feeds, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the cooperation in east Africa, Museveni expected the
revival of the East African Community which collapsed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The date has arrived for the reestablishment of the community
comprising Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, Museveni said, predicting
"very soon the Secreariat in Arusha will begin function and shall
move quickly to catch up the time we have lost in last 19 years".
</P>
<P>
Visiting Kenyan and Tanzanian presidents Denial arap Moi and
Benjamin Mkapa also made speeches at the rally.
</P>
<P>
They urged for strengthened unity in the regional cooperation
after years of common struggle for independence.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese national soccer
team took their first training session this afternoon, just hours
after their arrival here, for next week's Asian Cup Group Two
qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese players seemed relaxed during the two-hour
session, Qi Wusheng, the head coach, declined to talk to the
reporters waiting at the field side after the training finished.
</P>
<P>
And Wang Junsheng, the team manager, promised to answer
questions as to what the reporters might be interested in at an
official press conference scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team won a warm-up tournament back in Meixian, in
south China's Guangdong Province, before coming here, beating the
Shandong provincial team 7-0 and the Beijing side 3-1.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Hong Kong players were not fit enough at the
match," said Fan Zhiyi, the star of the Chinese team. He was
referring to the annual Shanghai-Hong Kong Cup tournament here
three weeks ago. The Shanghai team, of which Fan was a member,
defeated their Hong Kong counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong team's defense seemed much less effective than
before, with a lot of loopholes," he said. "There were few
stand-out players at the time on the team," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Other teams in the Asian Cup qualifying tournament slated here
for January 30-February 4 are Macao, the Philippines and hosts
Hong Kong.

JAKARTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta police have
arrested an Iranian man for trying to sell 200 grams of heroin to
an undercover City Police detective at a hotel in central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
According to a TV program tonight, police sources said that the

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Funds to Be Used for Transport Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to use more
overseas funds to improve transport infrastructure in the next
five years, according to a top transportation official.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, minister of communications, said that China
used 3.4 billion US dollars during the 1991-1995 period for
highway and water transport facility construction, mostly obtained
from foreign governments and international financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
Since transport projects require a large investment and take a
long time to show a profit, overseas commercial investments have
been small, and limited mostly to economically developed areas,
Huang explained.
</P>
<P>
Two projects now underway are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Highway,
funded by Hong Kong's Hopewell Holdings Ltd., and the first phase
of construction of Yantian Port in Guangdong, financed by
Hutchison Whampoa Group Ltd., another HK giant.
</P>
<P>
As part of China's move to introduce more commercial
investment, a comprehensive development strategy that includes
projects such as real estate development for transport facilities
projects, is being encouraged, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said China plans to use the BOT (build-operate-transfer)
method, which is popular for infrastructure projects world-wide,
for more projects in 1996-2000. It is now being used in building
two bridges in Hubei and Jiangsu provinces, southern China.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that China will experiment with issuing
stock for companies involved in transport infrastructure projects,
to raise more capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
pledged to provide more support to the agricultural sector to
ensure the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day meeting on food security, President Fidel
Ramos outlined a nine-point integrated action plan to cope with
any possible food crisis in the future.
</P>
<P>
The nine-point Action Plan includes following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- To extend immediate sources of easy credit to farmers;
</P>
<P>
-- To intensify effort to rehabilitate and develop
reforestation areas in national and communal irrigation systems;
</P>
<P>
-- To establish local councils on food security and
environmental protection;
</P>
<P>
-- To reassess priorities for infrastructure, specifically, to
fast track the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation and
post-harvest facilities;
</P>
<P>
-- To maintain a strategic rice reserve enough for 15 days'
consumption;
</P>
<P>
-- And to ensure a nationwide rice buffer stock for at least 90
days by July 1.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, the country's rice production has
fallen short of its consumption requirements by an annual average
of some 150,000 metric tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, due to the rice shortage, the higher rice prices
pushed the country's inflation rate to the double-digit level from
September to December.

<HEADLINE> Support for Swedish Social Democratic Party Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Moderate
Coalition Party has obtained 30.5 percent of the voters' support,
outbeating the ruling Social Democratic Party, which has won only
29 percent, an opinion poll showed today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the Moderate Coalition Party has
gained more support than the ruling party in an opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
This has constituted a sharp contrast against the elections in
1994 when the Social Democratic Party won 45.3 percent of votes,
while its main rival, the Moderate Coalition Party, got 22.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the support for the Social Democratic Party,
which had dominated the Swedish political arena for decades, is
mainly attributed to the increasing contradictions inside the
party, the upcoming retirement of its chairman Ingvar Carlsson and
the discontent arising from the party's policy of slashing social
welfare.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll, jointly conducted by Dagens Nyheter and the
Testhuset Market Opinion polling office on January 17-24, was
based on a survey of 1,039 voters above 18 years old.

<HEADLINE> German Prosthetics Expert Honored in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A German expert was honored
with the devoted servant of the people award today by China's
Ministry of Civil Affairs for his efforts over the past several
years in helping China with prosthetics and orthopedics.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Heim is the second foreigner to receive the award which is
given to foreign experts for outstanding achievements in their
work in China.
</P>
<P>
In December 1992, the ministry gave the award for the first
time to Kwan Sook Lee, an American specialist in prosthetics and
orthopedics who had been working in China for several years.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Heim has been working as a senior advisor to the German
Agency for Technical Cooperation, to which he submitted a
feasibility report after an inspection tour in China in April 1988.
</P>
<P>
He later managed to convince the German government that it
should offer free financial assistance to China for setting up the
China Prosthetics and Orthopedics Technical School in Wuhan,
capital city of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
In September 1992, along with other German experts, he went to
Wuhan to manage the school. With hard work, the experts helped the
school establish contacts with international institutions involved
in teaching and in manufacturing artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the profound understanding and cooperation between the
Chinese and we Germans, we overcame difficulties and succeeded in
managing the school," he said at the award ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering, minister of civil affairs, congratulated Sepp Heim
and thanked him for his persistent efforts at improving China's
knowledge of prosthetics and orthopedics.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed the wish that the German expert
will continue to show his concern for the school in the future.

<HEADLINE> Polish President Accepts Premier's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski accepted today the resignation of Prime Minister Jozef
Oleksy, who was accused of passing Polish state secrets to Moscow
from 1982 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has two weeks to name a successor, asked
Oleksy to remain as caretaker until a new government is formed.
</P>
<P>
The two ruling coalition parties, Oleksy's Democratic Left
Alliance (SLD) and the smaller Polish Peasant Party (PSL), have so
far suggested several candidates for the prime minister's post,
but failed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The SLD opted for Marek Borowski, head of the Cabinet office
and a former finance minister, or deputy parliament speaker
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz.
</P>
<P>
But the PSL's candidate was Miroslaw Pietrewicz, head of the
Central Planning Office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of the centrist opposition Union for Freedom
(UW) who met Kwasniewski, said they had suggested a government led
by the non-party former foreign minister Wladyslaw Bartoszewski.
</P>
<P>
"The president promised to carry out talks to this effect," UW
chief Leszek Balcerowicz said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Warsaw Military Prosecutor's Office Wednesday opened an
investigation into the allegations against Oleksy, who denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy, a 49-year-old former communist, told the nation on
television Wednesday night that he would resign and fight to clear
his name.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Musicians Offer Challenge to Viennese New Year Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Culture Ministry said here
today that China will hold an annual concert that will rival the
famous Vienna New Year's Concert.
</P>
<P>
The concert will not follow the Viennese one, but will be held
just before the Spring Festival, the beginning of the Chinese
lunar new year.
</P>
<P>
It will feature not western instruments, but traditional
Chinese musical instruments, and a repertoire of classical Chinese
musical works -- not western symphonic works.
</P>
<P>
The concert will be the work of the Central Ensemble of
National Music, which has a strong background in traditional
Chinese music.
</P>
<P>
"We will make the concert as famous as the Viennese one," said
Yu Songlin, head of the ensemble.
</P>
<P>
"The Viennese concert is famous because it exhibits western
cultural traditions. We also have a fine culture of our own," said
conductor Hu Bingxu.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese became familiar with the Viennese New Year Concert
after it was broadcast live by television. Some scholars feel,
however, that China, with its several-thousand-years musical
history, should create a national concert of its own.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, several troupes have held new year's concerts
on January 1, playing only western pieces.
</P>
<P>
This year's Spring Festival concert will be held February 9,
ten days before the holiday.

<HEADLINE> Czech Trade Deficit Hits New High in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's foreign
trade deficit reached 101.7 billion korunas (3.9 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1995, the highest in recent years, due to the
koruna's revaluation and the lack of a positive policy for export.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Ministry said the country's trade volume totaled
38.7 billion dollars last year, with imports accounting for 21.3
billion dollars and exports 17.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports increased 28.6 percent in 1995 over the
previous year, of which machinery and telecommunication equipment
rose 31 percent, making up 36 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The inflows of foreign chemical products also went up 30
percent, taking up 13 percent of the entire imports.
</P>
<P>
Exports jumped 10.3 percent over 1994, with almost one-third of
them being semi-finished products. But the exports of industrial
goods fell by 2.3 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say the increased deficit was mainly caused by
the continued revaluation of the Czech currency, which is now
traded at 26 korunas against the dollar, compared with the 1:29
rate in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was also a result of a less positive government
policy, which did not give sufficient support to exports, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Arms Industry Turning to Peace-time Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's weapons manufacturers
have been fairly successful in their structural readjustment, with
both sides of its production developing quickly during the Eighth
"Nine-Year Plan" (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
According to a conference on the arms industry held here today,
production value of civilian-use products accounted for 80 percent
of total production value of the industry, which has turned from
exclusive military production to a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
For civilian-use, the industry has developed a structure for
three major items, machinery, chemicals and photo electronics.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the arms industry produced a total of 2.53 million
motorcycles, accounting for one-third of the total motorcycle
production in China. It also produced 89,600 minicars, accounting
for 16 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
It has made great progress in auto parts manufacturing, with
over 100 companies now involved in automobile or parts production.
</P>
<P>
According to central government guidelines, the industry will
continue to adjust its industrial structure to combine the two
aspects over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
While making further use of its advantage in motorcycle
production, it will look for new breakthroughs in auto parts
production.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 major enterprises will be given a boost to encourage
their participation in auto parts production in order to
co-operate and compete internationally.

<HEADLINE> European Monetary Union Plans May be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The German and French
governments would admit within weeks the European Monetary Union
(EMU) may have to be postponed, according to senior British
government sources.
</P>
<P>
The recession in Germany and social unrest in France have made
it impossible for EMU to go ahead in 1999 as planned in the
Maastricht Treaty, The Independent newspaper quoted government
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
They made it clear that mounting public criticism by European
political and financial leaders would force Paris and Bonn to
clarify their intentions in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany would need to announce either a change to
the date set for the EMU or a change to the rigid financial
criteria for the single currency imposed by the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
All will depend on whether German Chancellor Helmut Kohl could
be forced to relax the financial conditions, they said.
</P>
<P>
The German leader, who holds the key to the EMU, would not be
able to overcome monetarist resistance by the Bundesbank and
doubts by German public opinion, they added.

<HEADLINE> Laboratory Approval Committee for Import-Export Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Establishment of a committee to
approve import and export goods inspectors, as a means of
improving foreign trade, was announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Laboratory Accreditation Committee on Import and Export
Commodity Inspection of China (CCIBLAC) consists of
representatives from ministries, laboratories, and experts in the
business.
</P>
<P>
CCIBLAC's forerunner was the committee on import and export
commodity inspection set up in 1989. CCIBLAC is responsible for
registration, approving, and overseeing laboratories and their
personal, both at home and abroad, who inspect goods for import
and export.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, vice minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said that during the past ten years or more, China's
Import and Export Inspection Administration has approved nearly
900 laboratories from various parts of China, mostly along the
coast.
</P>
<P>
He said that 70 of the laboratories have also gotten
accreditation from the US, Germany, Japan, Italy, and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among agencies in this field can reduce overlapping
inspections of imports and exports, thereby facilitating
international trade.

<HEADLINE> French National Debt Surpasses 600 Billion Dollars in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- French national debt had
surpassed 3,000 billion francs (600 U.S. billion dollars) by the
end of 1995, reported Le Figaro today.
</P>
<P>
Although the debt has risen by 138 billion francs (28 billion
dollars) from 1994, the growth rate was the lowest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The French national debt accounted for 40 percent of the gross
domestic product, which is lower than the 60-percent ceiling set
for a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the government had raised 2,692 billion
francs (538 billion dollars) worth of negotiable debt on financial
markets, and the borrowings from the national treasure by local
governments and state-run institutions amounted to 350 billion
francs (70 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that 14.8 percent of the state budget will be
allocated for debt repayment this year, while the figure was 14.2
percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Children in Beijing Get Savings Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 students from
over 500 elementary schools in Beijing collected deposit slips
today from post office-run savings banks around the city.
</P>
<P>
These students' teachers got them to deposit their money at
these savings banks. Zhang Lixin, a teacher from Beijing's Wang
Fujing Primary School, led more than 100 students to the
Wangfujing P.O.-run savings bank to deposit their money there.
</P>
<P>
"To be frugal is the traditional virtue of the Chinese nation,"
Zhang said, adding that developing a good habit of wasting nothing
can help children be independent and take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
In China, children often receive cash wrapped in red paper from
elders on the lunar New Year's Eve. As people's standard of living
improves, a singlee child in the family will easily collect quite
a bit of money from parents or relatives.
</P>
<P>
Children who have money of their own, from several yuan to
several thousand yuan, often don't know how to handle it. "Some
students just waste money," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
All P.O.-run savings banks here now have a special counter to
serve children who come in to save money, and the special
promotional activity will last for a month.

<HEADLINE> Positive Results in China's Anti-Corruption Campaign (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Jiang Zemin said here today that
China has seen positive results in its ongoing anti-corruption
compaign.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee has "paid special attention to Party
building, clean government, and the anti-corruption struggle"
since the Party's 14th National Congress, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a series of important measures and have achieved
positive results periodically," Jiang who is also Chinese
president said at the sixth plenary session of the CPC Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
"Especially last year, the growing trend toward passivity and
corrupt practices in the country was curbed to some extent" after
the central authorities directly dealt with the Wang Baosen and
Chen Xitong cases, and Party and government offices at various
levels stepped up enforcement of anti-corruption measures of the
CPC Central Committee, Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-corruption drive is being carried out more
extensively," Jiang continued, emphasizing that to make it work,
all officials must observe the self-discipline requirements set by
the CPC Central Committee "to the letter".
</P>
<P>
"Officials will not only have to have stricter restraints, but
should also have better control over all members of leading
groups, and be responsible for anti-corruption efforts in their
own regions and work units," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that "every single case of serious infringement of
the law or of discipline, no matter who is involved, will be
investigated thoroughly," and "the leading officials will be
investigated, if an incident which takes place in the area or work
unit he's in charge of is not handled."

<HEADLINE> Unidentified Gunmen Attack Train in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen attacked a
train in southern Egypt today, injuring one person.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place only one day after President Hosni
Mubarak said that the security forces are winning a battle against
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony marking Egypt's Police Day Thursday, Mubarak
expressed certainty that the wave of terrorism in Egypt will be
put to an end.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen fired at the train when it was passing through Abu
Qorqas in the province of Minya, about 260 kilometers south of
Cairo, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) said. The train was
going on its way from the country's resort city of Aswan to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The train's security force opened fire at the gunmen, who
managed to escape, MENA quoted an Interior Ministry source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic fundamentalist militants have launched a campaign
since 1992 to topple the secular government and install strict
Islamic rule. They have often targeted policemen, Christians and
Western tourists in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
The government's fierce crackdown on militants has largely
reduced their terrorist activities. Recently there has been only
sporadic clashes between policemen and militants in a few southern
provinces.

<P>
The center has completed more than 2,000 application projects,
and developed more than 80 kinds of special integrated circuits
over the past three years, with a two billion yuan output value.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the center has been involved in a number
of key projects in China. All optical transmission equipment
modelss of China's trunk lines, the Beijing-Shanghai optical cable
and the Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou optical cable, are products of the
center.

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
total exports reached 115.3 billion HK dollars (14.78 billion US
dollars) in December 1995, an increase of 13.2 billion HK dollars
(1.69 billion US dollars) or 13 percent over the same month of
1994.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the Census and Statistics Department
show that both re-exports and imports continued to grow
significantly, while domestic exports registered a marginal
increase.
</P>
<P>
As the value of total exports in December 1995 was smaller than
that of total imports, a visible trade deficit of 12.4 billion HK
dollars (1.59 billion US dollars), equivalent to 9.7 percent of
the value of imports, was recorded.
</P>
<P>
For 1995 as a whole, the value of total exports grew by 15
percent over 1994. Among this, the value of re-exports rose by 17
percent, while that of domestic exports increased by 4.3
percent. The value of imports showed an increase of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The visible trade deficit for 1995 as a whole was 147 billion
HK dollars (18.85 billion US dollars), equivalent to 9.9 percent
of the value of imports. This compared with a deficit of 80.7
billion HK dollars (10.35 billion US dollars), equivalent to 6.5
percent of the value of imports, recorded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest trade figures, a government spokesman
said both re-exports and imports maintained double-digit growth in
 1995, while domestic exports also showed a small increase after
declining for two consecutive years.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urged to Compensate for Downing of S. Korean Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today reiterated that
Russia should take responsibility for the downing of a South
Korean passenger plane in 1983, urging Moscow to compensate for
the victims.
</P>
<P>
A final report released in 1993 by the International Civil
Aviation Organization revealed that the former Soviet Union's Air
Force had failed to observe standard procedures before downing the
plane, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suh Dae-won said.
</P>
<P>
Suh was responding to the recent remarks by the Russian Foreign
Ministry that Korean Air should compensate for the death of the
passengers since its crew members were responsible for the
mistakes which led to the mishap.
</P>
<P>
A Korean Air Boeing 747 strayed into the Soviet airspace and
was shot down by a Soviet fighter on September 1, 1983. All 269
crew and passengers on board died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Despite the following storm of international protests, Moscow
insisted the flight had been part of a joint spying mission of the
United States and South Korea. The event plunged Moscow into a
prolonged and bitter political confrontation with Washington at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Suh urged the Russian government to take steps as soon as
possible to resolve the issue of compensation for the victims.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed recent reports which quoted a U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency report as saying that some passengers on the
ill-fated plane are still alive.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai securities market
has expanded its influence to other parts of the country,
according to the latest statistics released by the Shanghai Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the number of companies listed at the bourse increased
from 171 to 188. Firms from outside the city jumped from 77 to 93,
while local companies rose to 95 from 94.
</P>
<P>
Of the bourse's 553 members, only 49 are local securities
firms, the rest being from other provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions who traded shares valued at 8.5 trillion yuan
in 1995, over four times the amount traded by local agents.
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly seven million investors involved in the Shanghai
securities market, 68 percent are not Shanghai residents.
</P>
<P>
When it was inaugurated in 1990 the Shanghai Stock Exchange had
plans to grow into a national securities market even though seven
of the first eight stocks listed were from Shanghai, and only nine
of the bourse's first 25 members were from outside Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Replaces Ban with Fines on Spurs and Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- English premier league clubs
Tottenham Hotspurs and Wimbledon won their appeal against
one-season European bans on Friday, but they had to pay heavy
fines for fielding under-strength teams in the Intertoto Cup
soccer tournament last year.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham and Wimbledon were ordered by European soccer's
governing body to pay 150,000 Swiss francs (120,000 U.S. dollars)
and 100,000 Swiss francs (80,000 U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Both clubs appealed to UEFA after the one-season ban decision
was announced, on the grounds that they had got permission from
the English Football Association to field junior and on-loan
players in the Intertoto Cup.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA board of appeal decided to reduce the penalty to
hefty fines after they looked into the case and considered the
sanction too harsh.

</P>
<P>
Initiated in 1985, the contest is organized by the China

<HEADLINE> Indian Foreign Minister Arrives in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian Minister for External
Affairs Pranab Mukherjee arrived here today for a three-day visit
to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the airport, Mukherjee said that he
would discuss with Nepali officials a lot of subjects of mutual
interest, especially the cooperation on water resources
development.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nepal, the Indian foreign minister would
meet King Birendra, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and high
ranking government officials and hold talks with his Nepali
counterpart Prakash Chandra Lohani, according to the Nepali
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Nepal hopes that Mukherjee's visit would usher in a new model
of economic and trade relations between the two countries, Lohani
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has long sought transit facilities for
Nepal's exports from its eastern border to Bangladesh ports
through Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
"Since India has agreed in principle for Nepal's third country
trade through Bangladesh, we hope the new route (for exports)
could be provided by India,' Lohani told a local newspaper
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials here said that during the talks the Nepali
side would raise the issue of the 1950 Friendship Treaty, which
was asked to be reviewed by former Nepali prime minister Man Mohan
Adhikari while visiting India last April.
</P>
<P>
India has maintained that the treaty would either be retained
entirely or abrogated in accordance with its provisions, ruling
out any possibility of revision.
</P>
<P>
According to Nepali officials, the lingering Bhutanese refugee
problem would also feature the bilateral talks. More than 100,000
Bhutanese refugees have flooded into Nepal in the last six years,
causing employment and security problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has urged India, who handles Bhutan's foreign and defense
affairs, to help solve the refugee problem. But India has
contended that this problem was a bilateral issue between Nepal
and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
So far, the six rounds of talks between the two Himalayan
countries at the home ministerial level has made no progress in
solving the refugee problem.

KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Cigarettes illegally
imported from neighbouring Kenya and Zaire are flooding the
market in the northwestern Ugandan district of Arua, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled cigarettes are drastically affecting sales of
the locally made British-American Tabacco (BAT) brands, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan made Sportsman cigarette is sold at a price of
0.025 US dollars per stick, 50 percent lower than that of the
local BAT brand, the report revealed.
</P>
<P>
Local officials were quoted as saying they could not stop such
dealings because they were backed by some security personnel.
</P>
<P>
Some trucks loaded with the smuggled goods are arriving at
Arua town even with armed escorts, the report added.

HONG KONG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed
in industrial accidents in Hong Kong rose by 12 percent last year
despite a 7.2 percent fall in the number of accidents, according
to today's "South China Morning Post".
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Labor Department showed that 77 people were
killed, 63 of them in the construction industry. This compares to
67 deaths in 1994, of which 51 were in the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall number of industrial accidents fell to
41,000 last year, the lowest level for more than 10 years,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commissioner for Labor Lee Kai-fat blamed the high
number of deaths on a shift away from civil engineering, such as
the heavily-mechanized field of reclamation, to building, where
there was more risk of workers falling.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The first plenary session of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and
chairman of the Preparatory Committee, said that during the
two-day meeting, their topics will center on the relevant specific
concrete matters of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, will be a crucial one for the work of the
HK SAR, and the work ahead will be heavy and time pressing.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the principle of "taking ourselves as the
mainstay" and "catering to the Hong Kong people and relying on
them" must be adhered to, although the Preparatory Committee is
different from the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region in term of function and tasks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the committee members will make
concerted efforts to fulfil the historic task.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-British co-operation on the Hong Kong issue, Qian said
that "we have been always conscientious and sincere on it. During
the British Foreign Secretary Rifkind's visit to Beijing recently,
the main topic in our talks was focused on the issue of
co-operation during the transitional period."
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased at the progress made so far by both
sides and he hoped that this momentum would be maintained as there
were still quite a lot of matters concerning the transfer of power
and stable transition of Hong Kong that were required to be
resolved through consultations.
</P>
<P>
Ann Tse-Kai, vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee, also
spoke at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Preparatory
Committee, made explanations relating to the work agenda for the

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan African Children In Suffering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- It is not only weapons which
kill children in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also "lack of food and
medical services, combined with the stress of flight, have killed
about 20 times more people than have armament."
</P>
<P>
This is a remark made in the annual report -- "the State of
the World's Children 1996" officially launched here today by the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) regional office here
today.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF report gives the example: in Somalia, during 1992,
half or more of all the children under five on January 1 were
dead by december 31 -- and around 90 percent of these died from
the interaction of malnutrition and disease. Most such deaths
arise from disruption of the normal production and distribution
of food in that country, the report adds.
</P>
<P>
On progress for children in Africa, the report says that it
has been slower and more uneven than in other regions in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Risk of dying before age of five is still higher than in any
other region despite the decline in U5MR from 25 percent in 1960
to 18 percent in 1993. In recent years, it appears to have
increased in several countries, including Madagascar, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, the UNICEF report says.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa, which increased from 37
to 51 between 1950 and 1990, remains the lowest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The number of children in primary school has quadrupled since
1960. The girls' enrollment ratio is more than doubled from 18
percent to 46 percent between 1960 and 1990. Nevertheless, only
half of eligible children in the region are enrolled in primary
school, and the gender gap remains wide.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition has not declined, and one third of children in
the region suffer from stunting.
</P>
<P>
On average, the number of children per mother in Sub-Saharan
Africa has barely declined in 40 years: it is still more than
six, the highest of all regions.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finance East African States to Clean up Hyacinth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will fund a
five-year program to help Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania to clean
Lake Victoria of pollution and the killer water hyacinth,
according to an official announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the bank would provide 20 million US
dollars to help the three states to rehabilitate and strengthen
the management of the lake's resources.
</P>
<P>
The program includes improved management of water quality and
fisheries in the lake as well as the control of the hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The three east African countries are collaborating with the
World Bank, United Nations Development Program (undp), United
Nations Environment Program (unep) and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (fao) to save Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake.
</P>
<P>
The widespread weed, allegedly originated from South America,
grows fast. It kills fish by exhausting the oxygen and is one of
the major problems faced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
It said after the collapse of the East African Community in
1977, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya failed to cooperate in cleaning
up Lake Victoria, whose waters they share.
</P>
<P>
The lake has also suffered from pollution, over-fishing and
the introduction of the Nile perch, which swallows up the smaller
species.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the sub-regional secretariat for this program
will be based in Dar Es Salaam. Kenya will host the water quality
and land-use secretariat while Uganda will host the secretariat
to deal with the hyacinth and fisheries.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Rises by 13.2 Pc in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The total trade of Singapore
expanded by 13.2 percent in nominal terms to reach 344 billion
Singapore dollars (about 244 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995, with
non-oil trade leading the growth, The Singapore Trade Development
Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that thanks to the buoyant global demand for electronic
components, computers and related products, non-oil domestic
exports increased by 14 percent in the year 1995.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports remained weak, declining further by 1.9
percent after a contraction of 3.9 percent in 1994, the TDB said,
adding that this downward trend came mainly as a result of
depressed oil prices and competition from refineries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports rose by 17 percent in 1995, reflecting the buoyant
regional economies, it said.
</P>
<P>
The TDB noted that the United States, the European Union,
Malaysia, Japan, and Hong Kong remained as Singapore's top five
major markets for non-oil domestic exports in 1995, accounting for
a share of 76 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Of these markets, the U.S., EU and Japan did well, with non-oil
domestic exports to Japan recording even a strong growth of 36
percent, boosted mainly by the strong yen, it said.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to Hong Kong and Malaysia however
recorded lower growth of 7.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively.
 It explained that the growth of Hong Kong market was in line with
its weak economy, as the bulk of Singapore's non-oil domestic
exports to Hong Kong were consumed within the economy.
</P>
<P>
For Malaysia, the slower growth stemmed mainly from the
relocation of some manufacturing activities from Singapore to
Malaysia, it said.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said the outlook for Singapore's trade in 1996 remains
positive, with total trade growth expected to moderate to nine-11
percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with the assessment of world trade by the
International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development for 1996, which is expected to grow at
a slower rate of 7.1 percent, compared to 8.6 percent in 1995 and
9.6 percent in 1994," it said.

JAKARTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is

makers next month.
</P>
<P>
February will see the Muslim holiday, Idul Fitri, at the end of

<P>
JAKARTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Property construction in
Jakarta and its surrounding areas will remain active in the
following few years.
</P>
<P>
Although high interest rates reduced residential sales last
year, developers' plans to build commercial projects have not been
curbed because many of them have access to overseas financing
sources, according to latest issue of 'property market outlook'.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the general market performance, represented
by average occupancy rates, was strong and the demand is expected
to remain high in forthcoming years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, if all planned projects proceed to completion, the
effect of oversupply will adversely affect overall occupancy
rates, prices and rental levels, the outlook added.
</P>
<P>
The outlook said that the net absorption of office space last
year was 244,000 square meters, indicating a 27 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Net demand came from relocation from non-central business
district areas and newly established joint venture companies as
well as representative offices.
</P>
<P>
The outlook predicted that the market performance will
temporarily decline toward the end of 1996 due to higher
additional supply during the year. This will make it difficult
for the owners to increase rentals despite expected high demand.
</P>
<P>
It added retail prices for office space were likely to fall by
10 percent by 1998 because of tight competition.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Meet HK SAR Preparatory Committee Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li
Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren
met here this morning with members of the Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) attending the
meeting for the founding of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Jiang said there is less than one year
and a half from now to July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The task of preparing the founding of the Hong Kong SAR is
arduous and time pressing. As the Preparatory Committee includes
people from various strata and sectors of society in Hong Kong and
has a wide representation, we should unite with all the forces
that can be united with and make concerted efforts to establish
the SAR, sustain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and
ensure its smooth transition," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Deng Xiaoping has pointed out that Hong Kong should be
governed by the Hong Kong people, with the patriots as the
mainstay. He also gave a distinct and incisive definition of a
patriot: one who "respects his own nation and whole-heartedly
supports the motherland's efforts to resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong without undermining its prosperity and
stability".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, "We should rely on the support of all the
Chinese people, as the scope of love of the motherland and Hong
Kong is very extensive."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the work for the Preparatory Committee is to
implement the Basic Law. All the issues concerning Hong Kong must
be handled in accordance with the Basic Law and the people all
over the country should be imbued with this sense of law-abiding,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He cited the preparations for the establishment of the Hong
Kong SAR as a major event for the whole country and said that it
is also the first step toward the reunification of the motherland,
with the issues of Macao and Taiwan yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
As a model of "one country, two systems", Jiang said, the
successful resolution of the Hong Kong issue will surely have a
splendid and broader prospects for the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Jiang expressed his conviction that the work will be
surely crowned with success.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Preparatory Committee's Guideline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Qian Qichen said here today that the
principle of "taking ourselves as the mainstay" and "catering to
the Hong Kong people and relying on them" must be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the first plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee held at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
He said that this principle has been proven to be correct by
facts and must be observed.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that "taking ourselves as the mainstay" is to rely on
ourselves to complete the preparations for the establishment of
the Hong Kong SAR. He explained it as to rely on the support of
the central authorities and all the people of the country on one
hand, and to cater to the Hong Kong people and rely on them on the
other hand.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR did much work to
improve the understanding with the Hong Kong people and absorb
them into the work, and the Preparatory Committee must stick to
this principle so as to realize the goal of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy for the region
after 1997.
</P>
<P>
During this session, he said, the Preparatory Committee will
discuss how to do its work. As the committee's members represent
all circles, it will be able to listen to opinions from various
sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the committee members should put forth more
suggestions, have wide-ranging discussions and, more important,
make decisions.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-British co-operation on the Hong Kong issue, Qian said
that he was pleased at the progress made by both sides and that he
hoped that this momentum would be sustained.

<HEADLINE> Moi Affirms Cooperation among East African States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Kenyan president
Daniel Arap Moi has said there should be no obstacles to the
newly regained spirit of cooperation among Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Moi said this after a closed-door summit meeting here among
him, President Ben Mkapa of Tanzania and President Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Kenyan president said today Moi who
chaired the summit, had this time made an unequivocal commitment
to the revival of East African cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Efforts for reviving the regional cooperation have been
impeded in the past mainly because of apparent problems between
Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
One of the advanced stages for working out cooperation had
hitherto stalled because Kenya delayed the nomination of a Kenyan
to head the cooperation's secretariat in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
However, President Moi this time was quoted as committing
Kenya to the appointment of an official to it before March and to
the efforts of reviving the cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Hrawi: Just, Comprehensive Peace Becomes Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
announced here last night that Lebanon has completed "files for
the negotiations related to a liberation of our land" and that a
chance for the just and comprehensive peace has become close.
</P>
<P>
At a Al-Eftar in Ramadan (a dinner after every sunset in the
Islamic fasting month) held in the Dar Al-Fatwa, the Maronite
Catholic Lebanese president stressed that the Lebanese army and
the security forces are "in a maximum readiness" to ensure the
stability on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi's remarks came on the eve of a conference of the
Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council (SLHC), which is scheduled to be
held in Damascus on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Presidents, house speakers, prime ministers and their deputies
and key ministers in the governments in Lebanon and Syria are
members of the SLHC which was established under a "Treaty of
Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination" signed in May, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts speculate an indication in Hrawi's
statement that the Lebanese-Israeli peace negotiations is to
resume soon in case that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations result
in a tangible progress.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel restarted their peace talks in Maryland state
near Washington on Wednesday, in the presence of military experts
from both sides, an outcome of U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher's shuttle in the Middle East region earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Credible official sources expected that the Lebanese-Israeli
track will be on the top of the agenda of the SLHC
conference. Lebanon upholds a position refusing a separation
between the Lebanese and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
"Any interior difference serves Israel," said Lebanese
President Hrawi, "and any extremism serves the aggressive
activities against our people and the properties."
</P>
<P>
"We never give up our right in our land and our sovereignty,"
the president addressed dozens of local political and religious
leaders, "so we will never be negligent of our duties to retrieve
our land, our sovereignty and our independence."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, we announced here that the state has
completed files for the negotiations related to a liberation of
our land in the South and Western Bekaa based on the
(U.N. Security Council) resolution 425," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"And an opportunity for a just and comprehensive peace has
become close, as an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon,
Western Bekaa and Golan Heights is anticipated."
</P>
<P>
"So our land is for us, and we are defending our land and our
entity," the President added, "and our army and our security
forces themselves are in a maximum readiness to consolidate our
security and our sovereignty there on the border."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Mexico Need to Strengthen Relations:  Mexican Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Mexico need
to strengthen relations to face the economic and political
globalization, a Mexican legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
After attending a briefing on Malaysia's economic development,
Rosario Guerra Diaz, member of the Mexican House of
Representatives, said both Mexico and Malaysia were taking the
same path in their development and had many things in common which
could mutually benefit each other.
</P>
<P>
"Both of us are trying to preserve and conserve our entity and
national unity in a very challenging world," Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
Diaz arrived here yesterday for a two-day visit to Malaysia to
observe Malaysia's macroeconomic development and the employees'
provident fund system.
</P>
<P>
Diaz said she was impressed with Malaysia's economic policies
and planning which she described as "very clear" towards achieving
the status of a developed country.
</P>
<P>
She said Mexico was slowly recovering from the "peso crisis"
that nearly crippled the country a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Diaz said Mexico was interested in learning about Malaysia's
employees' provident fund system because it was taking steps to
set up a compulsory savings scheme based on a social security
system to strengthen domestic financial institutions and to lessen
the dependence on foreign financial institutions.

BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Qian Qichen expressed his hope here
today that the members of the Preparatory Committee will make
concerted efforts to fulfil the historic task.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the first plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee, held in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Preparatory Committee is an institution set up
by the National People's Congress (NPC).

<P>
According to the relevant stipulations in the Decision of the

</P>
<P>
He described the work of the committee as of great significance.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year will be a key period for the
Preparatory Committee's work.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he said, a 400-member selection committee
composed entirely of permanent Hong Kong residents will be
established. Afterwards the first chief executive of the SAR will
be recommended through local consultations or through nomination
and election after consultations, and the recommended candidate
will be reported to the central government for appointment, he

<P>
Then the chief executive will set out to prepare for the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Dollar Stabilises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe dollar, which was
under severe pressure four months ago, has stabilised amid
indications of reduced demand on foreign reserves by local
companies, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason is that there are not enough imports to run
down foreign reserves and thereby weaken the dollar," an analyst
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe was currently estimated to have between four
and five months' import cover, and that this was helping to
stabilise the local unit, which fell by an average of 11.6
percent against major currencies during the first nine months of
1995.
</P>
<P>
On a trade-weighted exchange rate basis, the Zimbabwe dollar
fell nine percent during 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank was forced to intervene in the interbank
market to help stabilise the dollar, which was now pegged at
about 9.3858 against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its latest statistical report that the dollar
should be stable during the early part of this year.
</P>
<P>
But Standard Chartered Bank Zimbabwe Ltd predicted the dollar
could depreciate as long as Zimbabwe's inflation rate, measured
at 25.8 percent in December, continued to be higher than that of
the country's main trading partners.
</P>
<P>
"As long as inflation remains well above trading-partner
inflation levels, the Zimbabwe dollar will continue its decline,"
the bank said in a bulletin.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Gains All-Round Bumper Harvests in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, a leading grain
base in China, registered double-digit growth in the output of
grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, meat and aquatic products in
1995.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Anhui's agriculture has got out of a
wavering situation and ushered in a period of steady development,
a provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
The province's output of grain amounted to 26.5 million tons
last year, cotton reached 300,000 tons and oil-bearing crops
climbed to 1.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As the third-largest grain exporter in China, Anhui provided
other Chinese provinces with 2.5 million tons of grain last year.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the all-round bumper harvests to
implementation of the Party's rural policies, more investment in
agriculture, rural reforms and farmers' rising enthusiasm for crop
growing.
</P>
<P>
Investment in agriculture through various channels totalled 23
billion yuan during the 1992-1995 period. The provincial budget
for agriculture increased at an annual rate of 11.4 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The harnessing of big rivers and the construction of water
control projects have helped to expand farmland by 278,000 ha,
reduce waterlogged lowlands by 104,000 ha and improve medium and
low-yielding farmland by one million ha.
</P>
<P>
The province also gave priority to spreading agro-science,
which raised the output of grain by three million tons, rapeseed
by four million tons and cotton by 20,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Shilling Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling has
plummeted to 59.1 shillings to the U.S. dollar from between 55-56
shillings in the past few days, it is the sharpest fall within
nearly one year.
</P>
<P>
Since the middle of last year the shilling has been stabilized
at 56 shillings to the dollar, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
But in the last few days it has dropped several points, and at
the close of trading yesterday it hovered around 59 shillings.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks bought the dollar at 55.7 and sold it at
59.7, a gap of about four shillings.
</P>
<P>
Report says the unfolding trend is attributed to the high
demand for foreign exchange by importers. It is also due to the
announcement by the world Bank that it will postpone a decision
on new loans to Kenya until a joint mission with the IMF has
decided.
</P>
<P>
However, the Central Bank of Kenya said there is no cause for
worry. The drop is gradual, as a response to market influences,
it pointed out.

NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Minister for Education Joseph
Kamotho has warned that men who make school girls pregnant will
be taken to court to cut down the number of pregnant girls in the
schools.
</P>
<P>
"Research findings show that 10 to 12 percent of girls drop
out of primary and secondary schools annually due to pregnancy,"
Kamotho said, adding this translates to 27 girls who get pregnant
daily.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks when launching a national task
force on gender and education in Nairobi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho called on the government to formulate harsh penalties
for adults and boys who make school girls pregnant.
</P>
<P>
He cited the case in the United States where harsh penalties
are meted out to those who do the same thing to school girls.

<HEADLINE> Thai Garment Sector Faces Tough Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's textile and garment
manufacturers will face another difficult year in 1996 and may
have no chance of regaining their position as the country's top
export earner.
</P>
<P>
Textiles and garments were the country's top export earner for
seven years until last year, according to central bank export
earnings rankings.
</P>
<P>
The sector's overseas earnings have been eclipsed by hi-tech
and less labor-intensive electronics and electrical component
industry, which emerged as the country's top export category last
year.
</P>
<P>
Punitive import tariffs on raw materials and rising labor costs
are factors that continue to undermine the textile and garment
industry, according to Thaval Chanpornpong, president of the Thai
Synthetic Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
Cotton prices look set to remain high while upstream producers
of synthetic fibers still have to pay 7 percent duty on their
caprolactum and purified terepthalic acid ((PTA) supplies,
although neither chemical is now being produced locally.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian competitors can buy their supplies duty-free,
according to Thaval.
</P>
<P>
At the start of last year, Thailand reduced import duties on
4,000 items, but tariffs on raw materials of the textile and
garment industry were retained.
</P>
<P>
Thaval said his association intends to step up pressure on the
Finance Ministry to scrap the tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Deficit on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a trade
deficit of 1.6 billion Malaysian Ringgit (0.64 billion US dollars)
in October last year compared with a deficit of 254.2 million
Ringgit (101.6 million dollars) in the previous month and a
surplus of 247.1 million Ringgit (98.8 million dollars) in
October, 1994.
</P>
<P>
A report issued here today by the Statistics Department said
that for the first 10 months of last year, the country's trade
deficit amounted to 9.8 billion Ringgit (3.92 billion dollars)
compared with 1.3 billion Ringgit (0.52 billion dollars) in the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, which increased by 8.5 billion Ringgit (3.4
billion dollars) in the 1995 January-October period, was due to a
26.6 percent increase in imports to 160.6 billion Ringgit (64.24
billion dollars) compared with a 20.1 percent increase in exports
to 150.7 billion Ringgit (60.28 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said Malaysia's major trading partners during the
January-October,1995 were Japan, the United States, Singapore,
Taiwan, Germany, Hong Kong, United Kingdom and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The department said that among exports, thermionic valves and
tubes, photocells and parts, remained the largest export items
representing 17.6 percent of total export value.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil, with an export value of 8.8 billion Ringgit (3.52
billion dollars) or 5.8 percent of total exports, continued to be
the second largest revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
Other major commodities that registered significant increases
in export were rubber, petroleum products, and liquefied natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, machinery and transport equipment which represented
96.4 billion Ringgit (38.56 billion dollars) or 60.1 percent of
the total import expenditure remained the largest contributor to
the import increase.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's imports were mainly from Japan, the United States,
Singapore, Taiwan, Germany, the United Kingdom and France, the
reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice-president Godfrey Miyanda
has urged Zambian police to resist bribery in order to maintain
their professionalism.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president made the call at a pass-out parade of 146
graduates at Lilay police training school here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda warned the police officers to refrain from corrupt
practices, saying they instead should strive to achieve
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
He advised the police to develop a closer working relations
with members of the public.
</P>
<P>
"Information is the life span of policing and you need to
share mutual understanding with the community if you want members
of the public to supply you with the information you need," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda also warned that law-breakers will be dealt with
seriously regardless of their political affiliations so as to
maintain peace and tranquility in the nation.

the police is geared to maintain law and order during this year's
general elections.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his warning to all political parties that the
police will deal firmly with all those intending to break the
law.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Initiates Old-Age Pension Insurance Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- To date, 4.27 million
employees and 1.8 million retirees from 28,000 units, including
some 90 percent of all employees and units, have taken part in a
mutual assistance program in this east China metropolis.
</P>
<P>
One of the prominent characteristics of the old-age pension
insurance system in Shanghai is that it has a mechanism which
helps pensions increase regularly, safeguarding the basic needs of
the retirees and giving them access to the benefits from social
development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years retirees have been provided with all
sorts of subsidies. As a result, their pensions have been
increased, even allowing for inflation.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the insurance system has helped eliminate
the burden of some old state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Shanghai's textile industry, with 373,000
working employees and nearly 300,000 retirees, it used to find
itself permanently short of funds.
</P>
<P>
But since the adoption of the new system, 300 million yuan
(about 37 million U.S.dollars) or even more in pensions the
industry's retirees received in 1994 and 1995 came from the mutual
assistance program.

<HEADLINE> Member of Team Searching for "Big Foot" killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A member of a scientific team
searching for the legendary Wild Man, or China's "Big Foot", was
killed in a recent traffic accident after exploring in central
China.
</P>
<P>
Yu Gong, 40, was killed on January 18 this year when the team's
truck collided with a farmer's tractor. The team was on its way
back to Beijing after two weeks searching for the creature in the
Shennongjia Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Yu Gong was driving the truck when the accident took place near
Xinxiang, north of Shennongjia.
</P>
<P>
This was the first casualty in China's search for the Wild Man,
which has been going on since the 1950s, according to the
non-governmental Committee for Research into Strange and Rare
Animals, which held a memorial service for Yu here today.
</P>
<P>
The committee was also the sponsor of a highly-publicized Big
Foot hunt last spring, which ended without any important findings.
</P>
<P>
The members of the team had a plan to begin the second phase of
the search in the autumn of 1995 by launching several big balloons
carrying infrared cameras which could detect the half-man,
half-ape creature.
</P>
<P>
However, the preparations failed owing to "many factors",
according to Wang Fangchen, head of the team, without going into
details.
</P>
<P>
The new exploration was carried out secretly earlier this month
and obtained "valuable clues", Wang said, which are indications
that the Big Foot problem will probably be solved in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
"But the death of Yu Gong is a great loss," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu first took part in China's Big Foot hunt in the early
1980s. He found hairs, footprints, feces and nests said to be left
by the mysterious animal, a relative of human beings, some
scientists suggest.
</P>
<P>
In last year's operation he was a member of the tracing group
of the team, and hid in the forest many nights waiting for the
appearance of a Big Foot.
</P>
<P>
He leaves a widow and a ten-year-old son. His two brothers are
also members of the search team.

dropped bombs at Oraba parish in Koboko county in northwestern
Uganda on Sunday, reported the local daily "the New Vision"

</P>
<P>
A senior military source was quoted as charging that
Sudan-based Ugandan rebels, the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) of

territory in the north in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bombing and shelling had not caused any damage so

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kabul Faces Difficult Winter (by Hu Xiaoming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan capital of Kabul
is facing the most difficult winter in recent years with the
blockade of supply roads to the city.
</P>
<P>
Prices of various commodities, particularly those of heating
fuel and staple foods, shot up about 60 percent in recent weeks in
the city following the shutdown of the last key supply road
linking Kabul to Pakistan's border city of Peshawar earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The blockade, which entered into the 12th day today, also
caused the devaluation of Afghani, the Afghan currency, by 17
percent, bringing the exchange rate of US dollar to 8,000
Afghanis.
</P>
<P>
The Kabul authorities have shut down the city's 1,000 or so
butchers' shops in punishment for profiteering after meat prices
soared by 100 percent, resulting in the total disappearance of
meat from bazaars.
</P>
<P>
The last supply road was closed because of an intra-factional
dispute over road taxes among Hezb-i-Islami led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, an arch rival of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
All the four main arteries to Kabul have been closed by various
warring factions opposed to the Kabul government.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Islamic student militia has been besieging Kabul
from the south and west since last October in a bid to topple
President Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kabul is in the grip of its worst winter for four
years with temperature going down to 20 degrees Centigrade,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
About 150 disabled victims of Afghan war held a demonstration
in Kabul on Wednesday in protest against the blockade of the
city's main supply routes.
</P>
<P>
The protesters presented a petition to a UN office calling on
UN envoy Mahmud Mesteri to pressure the warring factions into
opening the roads.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has warned that food stocks will run out in
the besieged capital in two weeks time.
</P>
<P>
UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan Martin Babar said
Thursday that Kabul would be gripped by a humanitarian
"catastrophe" soon if the road blockade is not lifted.
</P>
<P>
He said even the UN emergency humanitarian aid in Kabul would
come to a halt as supplies were running out.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers have warned that widows, orphans, the disabled and
the elderly are at great risk.
</P>
<P>
The most vulnerable, including children and the old, have
already begun to die as a result of malnutrition, icy temperatures
and almost constant shelling and rocketing, reports say.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 100 million yuan
(about 12.04 million US dollars) is expected to be poured into the
construction of harbors on and the dredging of parts of the
Lancang River to cope with the growing volume of international
transportation on the river.
</P>
<P>
The river flows through southwest China's Yunnan Province and
is linked with the Mekong River flowing through five countries in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The construction projects will enable the Lancang River to
handle 700,000 tons of cargo and 1.05 million passengers annually
by the end of this century. In 1995 the river saw the shipment of
30,000 tons of foreign trade cargo and 10,000 international
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Communications and the Yunnan Province
have jointly started a dredging project on the 200-km section
between Nandeba and Ganlanba. When the project is completed, the
260-km section in Yunnan will be able to accommodate 100-dwt
passenger ships and 300-dwt cargo vessels in the high-water period.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has over 60 domestic and international
passenger and cargo vessels on the river. Ten more vessels are
expected to be added to the fleet this year, doubling the cargo
volume to 60,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin's Machinery Industry in High-Growth Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The machinery industry of
Tianjin, a port city in north China, has registered rapid
development over the past five years, with an output growth rate
of 18.7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the "China Machinery and Electronic News" reported,
the city witnessed the industry's sales and combined turnover of
profits and taxes rise at annual growth rates of 24.2 percent and
40 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the rapid development to a comprehensive
technical renovation and readjustment of production structure over
the past five years, which brought 1,660 technical achievements to
large-scale production, and created profits of 680 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of enterprises with annual sales
volumes surpassing 100 million yuan has jumped to 23, compared
with seven at the start of this decade.
</P>
<P>
Another major catalyst is the swelling foreign investment, the
paper commented. Over the past five years the city has contracted
to use 127 million US dollars to establish 53 joint ventures,
which involve 410 million dollars of combined investment.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, statistics show that the city's exports of
machinery products have been increasing by a large margin since
the beginning of the 1990s. The accumulative export volume in the
past year reached 1.64 billion yuan, three times that of the
1986-1990 period.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- During the past five years
northeast China's Jilin Province, an important industrial base in
China, has invested nearly 400 million yuan to develop 300 items
of electronic technology.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in the speeding up of the technological
development of the province's traditional enterprises and enabled
the local industrial sector to earn a total of more than 1.2
billion yuan in profits during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The number of computers installed has grown by 25 percent
annually, bringing the total in the province to 770,000.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has meanwhile invested more than 100 million yuan in
upgrading about 100 production lines and sets of equipment.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Refutes Containment of China Bid (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the steady development of worldwide and regional
integrated economic co-operation in recent years, China's economy
has become an important component of the world economy and
interwound with the latter, the article said.
</P>
<P>
China recorded a total foreign trade value of 280 billion US
dollars in 1995 and the amount of foreign investment in China has
climbed to 135.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it is impossible to artificially
separate China from the rest of the world. Those who try to harm
China will harm themselves, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has achieved remarkable progress in all fields
with a high economic growth rate, improved comprehensive national
strength and high status in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
Attempting to contain China, which has a population of 1.2
billion, is tantamount to risking the destiny of one's own country
and a daydream, as described by former US Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War peace and development have become
the main themes worldwide. All countries give priority to economic
growth and the improvement of their people's lives. Worldwide,
many problems neglected during the Cold War, such as unemployment,
poverty and drug abuse, have been brought to the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
However, resolving these problems needs a peaceful and stable
international environment and extensive international
co-operation. People of all countries are making endeavors and
have achieved great achievements in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Preaching containment of China runs counter to the people's
will and the historical tide. It will inevitably lead to tension,
confrontation, splits and war, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
In handling state-to-state relations, it said, it is necessary
to follow the principle of respecting the sovereignty of other
countries and not interfering in their internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
It is a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and
international norms to wave the stick of containment and even
advocate subverting the government of another country, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
Such acts are the result of the smashing of the dream of
unifying the world under the political and economic mode and with
the values of some people and the result of their reluctance to
see a powerful and unified China.
</P>
<P>
From ulterior motives, certain people try to put pressure on
and constantly create troubles for China and curb its development
in various ways such as by making use of issues of Taiwan, Tibet,
human rights, disarmament, nuclear testing, trade, ethnic groups
and religion. One of their latest tricks is to preach about the
"China threat" and "containment of China" in a bid to sabotage the
relations between China and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that the efforts to contain China are doomed
to failure. Though tiny, such clamor will undermine international
trust and be detrimental to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, we should guard against it and curb its spread, the
article said.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Company Sees Strong Growth in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-Cola Company, a
leading beverage producer in the world, witnessed strong sales in
Asia, especially in China and India, but a shrinking market in
Latin America over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The company announced in its annual report today that it sold
about 12.7 billion unit cases of products worldwide last year, an
increase of 8 percent, or almost 1 billion cases, over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Its annual net income grew by 17 percent to nearly 3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"China is one of our fastest growing markets," Kathryn Norton,
a public relations official of the company, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Unit case volume in the Chinese market rose more than 38
percent in 1995 over the previous year, Norton said, in the Middle
and Far East regions, the increase hit 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"China's developing economy and its 1.2 billion consumers offer
enormous potential," Norton said. "We see the powerful momentum of
1995 continuing throughout 1996 and further."
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, Coca-Cola company has a 19-percent share
of China's soft drink market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Norton added other fast-growing markets included India with an
jump of 32 percent in the fourth quarter and Brazil with an
increase of 34 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, however, Coca-Cola recorded sluggish sales on
the whole. Increases in Brazil and Chile were offset by declines
in Mexico and Argentina. The company attributed the decrease to
continuing economic difficulties, which affected consumers'
"disposable income" in those countries.
</P>
<P>
Around the world, the company now boasts about 500 different
brands, many of which were created for specific taste preferences
of a particular market.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Marked on New Map of United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, China's
largest economic and technological development zone, is clearly
marked on the new edition of a world map published by the Atlas
Map Publishing House of the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
This suggests that the place name, referring to the area east
of Huangpu River, has been accepted by people not only in other
parts of China but also in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The principal reason for turning the spotlight on Pudong is its
rapid economic growth since it was designated as an economic and
technological development zone five years ago, said Zhao Qizheng,
director of the area's management committee.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 3,501 foreign-funded enterprises have been
set up in Pudong, involving 13.4 billion US dollars in foreign
investment. It has played host to government heads of scores of
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Pudong, other development zones in Shanghai such
as Lujiazui and Waigaoqiao also appear on the map.

<HEADLINE> Michael Chang Beats Agassi At Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Michael Chang of the United
States beat defending champion Andre Agassi with straight sets to
enter the finals of the Australian Open in Melbourne on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 23, who has never lost a single set in the tournament,
beat the new world number one 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1).
</P>
<P>
Chang, seeded fifth, took advantage of his swift movements and
consistent baseline play to make Agassi fight all the way
throughout the match, forcing the defending champion to hasten his
strokes and make errors.
</P>
<P>
Chang won the first set quite comfortably and went on to break
Agassi's serve in the second set. He was broken by Agassi early in
the third set, trailing at 2-4 when Agassi served. But he broke
back and held his own serve to level it at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who has already regained top position in the world
rankings from Pete Sampras with a win over Jim Courier in the
quarter-finals, seemed to be a far cry from the dream-runner, who
has been in a rising form since last year.
</P>
<P>
Chang continued to fight hard in the tiebreaker, giving Agassi
only one chance to hit a winner.
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to do one thing at a time. I continued to fight
and play good solid tennis," Chang said after the match.
</P>
<P>
He was not very excited about the prospect of becoming world
number one.
</P>
<P>
"To become world number one won't mean that you are safe," he
said. "You still have to fight hard. It's the same to lower
ranking players."
</P>
<P>
This is Chang's third time to reach the Grand Slam finals.
</P>
<P>
Chang became the youngest Grand Slam champion by winning the
French Open in 1989 at the age of 17. He lost to Thomas Muster of
Austria in last year's French Open final.
</P>
<P>
Chang will play the winner of another semifinal match between
fourth-ranked Boris Becker of Germany and Australia's Mark
Woodforde.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Refutes Containment of China Bid (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An article in the "People's
Daily", China's leading newspaper, today refuted the "theory of
the necessity of containing China" advocated by some people in the
West as "totally groundless".
</P>
<P>
The observer's article in the paper said that these people have
fabricated arguments for containing China such as as "China is so
big and powerful as to constitute a threat to other countries",
"With its national strength increasing, China will inevitably have
a greater influence in its own backyard and expand its sphere of
influence" and China is the "real source" of tensions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, these arguments do not hold water at all," the
article said.
</P>
<P>
It noted, "We have pointed out repeatedly that whether a
country constitutes a threat to other countries is not necessarily
related to its size, economic strength or development speed, but
is determined by what kind of foreign policies it pursues."
</P>
<P>
The fallacy that after becoming powerful a country will
inevitably pursue an expansionist policy and thus must be
contained is the logic of those advocating power politics.
</P>
<P>
According to them, China should be reconciled to being poor,
weak and bullied by others, and does not have the right to seek
development and become powerful.
</P>
<P>
It is entirely ridiculous to say that China is a source of
tensions in the region, the article said, adding that China has
maintained social stability and has not created any tensions
abroad in the present turbulent world.
</P>
<P>
China is concentrating on economic construction, is pursuing a
policy of promoting friendly relations with neighboring countries,
and constitutes a factor of stability with regard to regional and
world peace, it said.
</P>
<P>
"This fact, acknowledged by the whole world, cannot be
distorted by anyone or by any tricks," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Some Western media organizations have urged measures to contain
China, such as "maintaining economic contacts with China and
containing it strategically", "united efforts of Western and Asian
countries to deal with and encircle China", "excluding China from
the international community", "not letting China join the World
Trade Organization on its own terms", "pursuing a two-China
policy by granting Taiwan official status", and "It is not enough
just to contain China; more important is to subvert China's state
power."
</P>
<P>
The article repudiated these remarks as Cold War cliches.
</P>
<P>
"However, attempts to contain China will not work at all in
today's world," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
First of all, China's neighbors and the developing countries
are resolutely opposed to containing China.
</P>
<P>
A leader of a member country of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations warned that the pursuit of any policy to "contain
China" will "bring disastrous consequences".
</P>
<P>
Most Western countries have agreed that it is dangerous to try
to contain China, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago the European Union released a report on its
strategy concerning China, indicating its intention to further its
all-round co-operation with China.
</P>
<P>
The report stated: "Containment is not our policy on China."
</P>
<P>
In an article published this month an expert from a US national
strategy research institute stressed that the pursuit of a policy
to contain China would be erroneous, and that this is a policy
formulated at an inappropriate time and aimed at the wrong
target.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Venture to Produce New Meteorological Radar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and US companies will
join hands to produce a new generation of weather radar, known as
CINRAD, by using the technology used in the Toppler weather radar,
known as NEXRAD, which is currently the most advanced type of
radar in the world.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture between the China Huayun Technology Development
Corp. under the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the
Loral International Corp. of the U.S. was officially set up on
Thursday. It will produce the CINRAD also by co-operating with
other Chinese institutions that involve radar research, design,
manufacture or application.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the CMA, CINRAD is expected to
replace current radar systems across China to form a weather radar
network within about ten years. The designed production capacity
for the joint venture is 14 sets of CINRAD annually. The total
investment is around six million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
NEXRAD was specially designed and manufactured by Loral for the
US government.
</P>
<P>
The new radar setup will help China to monitor more closely and
accurately strong convex air currents and sudden changes of
weather in the future, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> China's Private Economy Advancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's private economy
developed soundly during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
(SAIC), the government watchdog of the private sector, the number
of private firms by the end of 1995 is expected to top 600,000
with employees totaling nine million; the individually-owned firms
(those employing no more than eight people) is estimated to reach
25 million.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years these individual and private firms
have generated a total output value of 666 billion yuan (about
80.24 billion US dollars), realized 1,471.9 billion yuan in total
transactions and paid more than 100 billion yuan in taxes to the
state.
</P>
<P>
"The healthy development of the private sector has helped
promote the productive forces, alleviate unemployment and transfer
surplus rural labor," a SAIC spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
Legislation in the private sector has been further
improved. SAIC has promulgated laws concerning the registration
procedures of the private enterprises and given its opinions
concerning the promotion of the individual and private economy.
</P>
<P>
The legal documents helped with the reforms on defining the
qualifications of employees, business scope, means of operation
and procedures concerning the registration and approval of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 23 of China's provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have issued stipulations concerning the promotion
of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
To direct the sector onto a healthy track, industry and
commerce authorities at various levels have dealt with a number of
law-breaking cases of private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The private and individual enterprises have expanded their own
social organizations. By the end of 1994 some 36 associations of
the self-employed at the provincial level, 374 at the prefecture
level and over 2,700 at the county level had been set up.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Sees Rural Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has invested 800 million yuan in improving 7.2 million ha
of low-yielding land since 1988, making it self-sufficient in
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
As a major industrial province, Liaoning has a large urban
population and has traditionally relied on other parts of China to
supply it with grain and non-staple foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
To boost agricultural production the province set aside a large
sum of money for the development of the Liaohe River Delta, Liaohe
River Plain and the eastern and western parts of the province. The
effort has turned these areas into important producers of grain,
fruit, meat and aquatic foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the funds has been spent on grain
production, pushing Liaoning's per unit grain output to the
second-highest in China.
</P>
<P>
Now excellent irrigation facilities are seen along the Liaohe
River Delta, and the arid land in the province's Chaoyang
Prefecture has been turned into high-yielding farmland. Three
major vegetable-production zones are taking shape along the
Shenyang-Dalian Expressway.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, comprehensive agricultural
development has brought about 700 million yuan in added value and
local farmers now earn an average of 300 yuan more each year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Mobilize Against Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition parties
have instructed their local units to mobilize forces against what
they called the unilateral holding of elections by the ruling
party, sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The local units of the opposition parties have also been
instructed to draw up local-based programs, including strikes,
demonstrations and barricades, against the polls and go for
all-out action programs during any visit of Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami (People's)
League, the Jatiya (National) party and the Jamaat-e-Islami -- are
also continuing their scheduled program of mass contact, exchange
of views with different professional groups and preparations for
massive showdown on February 14-15 to resist the elections, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are boycotting the election process
after their demands for Khaleda Zia's resignation and a neutral
caretaker government were rejected by the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition's boycott, the BNP has decided to go
ahead with the elections with some smaller political parties.
</P>
<P>
Bomb explosions have recently been reported in the country,
most of them in front of the residences of high-ranking government
officials and key BNP candidates for the upcoming polls.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Bill to Avoid Partial Government Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today overwhelmingly approved a bill to keep
federal agencies running through March 15, and the White House
said President Bill Clinton would sign it.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 371-42 for a stopgap measure that would
temporarily finance dozens of federal agencies, though at lower
levels than 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Senate was expected to approve the legislation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Let's quit wasting the taxpayers' money," House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bob Livingston said, adding, "Let's keep the
government open."
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied that a lot of give-and-take has produced an
agreement the president can live with," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers had faced a Friday night deadline, which, if not met,
would see civil federal workers furloughed for a third time since
November.
</P>
<P>
With this fall's elections on their minds, both sides indicated
willingness to settle immediate differences and leave the toughest
disputes over Medicare, Medicaid and welfare until next year.
</P>
<P>
The stopgap spending measure would finance many agencies whose
1996 budgets are incomplete, including the departments of Veterans
Affairs, Interior and Labor and the Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The bill covers 12 billion dollars for foreign aid for the rest
of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also provide, for the first time, that federal
workers could be furloughed or laid off by agencies looking for
savings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile White House chief of staff Leon Panetta and Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin met with moderate Senate Democrats and
Republicans and urged them to seek support for a full-blown
balanced-budget plan.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Visits Spain to Mend Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo arrived here today for an official visit to the country to
reinforce the economic and commercial ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo is scheduled to hold talks with his Spanish counterpart
Felipe Gonzalez with focuses on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade relations between the two countries suffered
major a setback in 1995 because of the fall of the market and the
entrance of Mexico into the Organization for Development and
Economic Cooperation, causing Mexico to lose the right to obtain
privileged credits.
</P>
<P>
Spanish investments in Mexico diminished in 1995 to 100 million
dollars, compared with 224 million dollars registered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During Zedillo's visit, the two sides will sign tow agreements
to promote financial, credit development and Spanish investments
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the first stop of Zedillo's European tour, which will
also bring him to Britain, Italy and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo is the first Mexican president to visit Spain since
1986 and also his first as president.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's former president
Hussain Muhammad Ershad has formally been charged with ordering
the murder of a major general in the port city of Chittagong on
June 1, 1981, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reading out the charge against Ershad and four other retired
army officers at a local court Thursday, Judge Abdus Salam said
that they "intentionally caused the death of Major General M.M.
Manzoor by shooting on the head."
</P>
<P>
The judge also brought a second charge against them "for not
delivering the body of Manzoor to his relatives and carrying false
propaganda that Manzoor was killed by unruly troops after forcibly
taking him away from army custody."
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who has been serving terms of imprisonment for
corruption cases in the Dhaka Central Jail not long after his
forced step-down in the late 1980s, pleaded "not guilty" and told
the court that he would appeal to the High Court.
</P>
<P>
The charge was made in the absence of defense lawyers who
boycotted the court in group for their "lack of confidence in the
court" and "doubt in getting justice."
</P>
<P>
The judge fixed February 7 as the date to start the record of
evidences. A total of 48 people have been named as prosecution
witnesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A railway bridge linking the Black
Sea and the Caucasian hinterland officially opened today, the
Rome-based World Food Program (WFP) announced.
</P>
<P>
The WFP Executive Director, Catherine Bertini, attended the
inauguration ceremony in Batumi Port, Georgia. The WFP was the
sponsor and a main donator of the project.
</P>
<P>
A WFP communique said since the outbreak of the conflict in
Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkey has closed its border with its
neighboring Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflict between Abkhazia and Chechnya further
worsened the transportation in the region, leaving Batumi and Poti
ports of Georgia the only transfer points to connect the Black Sea
and the inland of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, along with the WFP, spent
400,000 U.S. dollars on the bridge, which is 60 kilometers away
the Batumi port.
</P>
<P>
Bridge construction started last June and took six months to
finish.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has provided 23 million U.S. dollars worth of emergency
food aid to Georgia and another 15 million emergency aid to the
region to help restore its infrastructure rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> France to Mediate Yemeni-Eritrean Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- France agreed to mediate between
Yemen and Eritrea in their dispute over three Red Sea islands and
called for a peaceful solution to the dispute, an official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to Eritrea and Yemen to decide if they want to accept
these (France's proposals)," Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman
Yves Doutriaux said, without specifying the proposals.
</P>
<P>
"The one essential condition is that both parties abstain from
the use of force," he said.
</P>
<P>
In December, Eritrea took over Greater Hanish island from
Yemen, the largest of the three islands which are located midway
between the two countries and command vital shipping lanes to the
Gulf. The other two islands, Zuqar and Lesser Hanish, remained
under Yemeni control.
</P>
<P>
A fierce battle took place between the two countries across the
Bab el-Mandeb strait at the mouth of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Both sides maintain their claims on the island despite the
continued mediation by Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Nations.
Russia and the United States also offered mediation.
</P>
<P>
France decided to join them after its special mission to the
region returned and submitted a report to President Jacques Chirac
last week.
</P>
<P>
Many French oil companies have business in Yemen, which is rich
in oil resources.

<HEADLINE> German Expert Gave Iraq Key Nuclear Bomb-Making Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A German scientist supplied Iraq
with key technology for its secret program to build a nuclear
bomb, Germany's Bild-Zeitung newspaper said here today.
</P>
<P>
Bild-Zeitung quoted a report of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) as saying that the scientist smuggled key drawings
into Iraq before the 1991 Gulf War and even went to Baghdad
himself to help.
</P>
<P>
He sold information about enriching uranium through the
centrifuge, which was central to Iraq's nuclear program, and went
to Baghdad under a false name to help build a centrifuge machine,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based IAEA uncovered the German, whose name was not
revealed, while studying papers yielded by the Iraqis following
the defection of Hussein Kamel Hassam, Iraqi president Saddam
Hussein's son-in-law, to Jordan last August.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Saddam ordered a program to build a nuclear device
in September, 1990, a month after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, and
Hassam had directed the program.
</P>
<P>
Bild-Zeitung said the German engineer, a specialist in nuclear
centrifuge systems, had worked at the German-Dutch-British company
URENCO that manufactured equipment to enrich uranium, the key
ingredient in a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
Evidence against the scientist had been sent by the IAEA to
security sources in Germany and German federal prosecutors had
issued an arrest warrant for him on treason and spying charges.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in Germany were quoted by Deutsche Presse
Agentur as saying the expert was presumed to be living in Brazil
now, where he had real estate, and Interpol was searching for him.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source said the German scientist had been
investigated in 1991 but prosecutors did not have enough evidence
against him then.

PANAMA CITY, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Banking
Commission (CBN) of Panama announced today that it has taken over the
management of the Banco Agroindustrial Commercial (Banaic) because
of a liquidity crisis.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which regulates banks in the country, said it
had taken over administration of Banaic's assets as a temporary
measure to protect the interests of depositors and creditors.
</P>
<P>
Banaic is estimated to have deposits of 110 million balboas
(110 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank began operations in 1978 with assets of almost 140
million dollars and local deposits of 37 million dollars. A
substantial part of its capital came from Spain and other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Planning and Economic Policy Minister Guillermo
Chapman said the bank was not linked to money laundering or to any
other illicit activity.
</P>
<P>
He said that depositors would have to await the final decision
of the CBN, but the bank's national clients will have priority.
</P>
<P>
This is the first bank in which the CBN has intervened during
the administration of President Ernesto Perez Balladares, who took
office on September 1, 1994.

<HEADLINE> 10,000-Year-Old Fossilized Buffalo Skeleton Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vertebrate
paleontologists have restored a buffalo skeleton consisting of
fossils retrieved from the Taiwan Straits. The bones date from the
Quaternary Period, some 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that the buffalo, similar to one found at the
Zhoukoudian site in southwestern Beijing, which dated back some
400,000-500,000 years, again proves that the Chinese mainland
and Taiwan Island were a unit some 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Many buffalo fossils from the Quaternary Period have been
found on the mainland, yet no skeleton has been restored before,"
said Qi Guoqin, a deputy research fellow at the Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who
helped to restore the buffalo skeleton in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Qi,the newly restored skeleton consists of
fossils from different buffaloes that were of the same species.
</P>
<P>
"The fossils were collected separately from different Taiwan
fishermen who retrieved them from the Taiwan Straits," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades tens of thousands of Quaternary Period
animal fossils have been retrieved from the Taiwan Straits, mostly
from the Penghu Trench.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 separate fossils have been collected by the Taiwan
Museum of Natural Science. But they have not been appraised due to
a lack of experts on vertebrate paleontology in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qi Guoqin from the mainland was thus invited to Taiwan twice, in
1994 and 1995, to study the fossils.
</P>
<P>
According to Qi's studies, the fossils found in the Taiwan
Straits are similar to those found in the eastern parts of the
mainland, which indicates that in the late Quaternary Period the
sea receded because the climate turned colder, connecting Taiwan
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Qi will go to Taiwan again later this year to restore the
skeleton of an ancient elephant.

BONN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Western Europe
will slow down this year with unemployment rising slightly,
according to the Munich-based IFO Institute of Economics.
</P>
<P>
In an economic forecast released today, the institute said the

In 1996, the gross domestic product (GDP) in Western Europe is
expected to rise 1.5-1.7 percent, against 2.4 percent the previous
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unemployment will reach 11 percent, a 0.5 percentage
point increase over last year.

Exports will rise 4.5 percent, constituting the main impetus
for economic growth, the report said.
</P>

In addition, capital investment will rise 2 percent, and prices
of consumer goods will increase 2.6 percent compared with last
year's 2.7 percent.
</P>

the country's ports, airports and border checkpoints.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Attracts Record 10 Million Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of overseas tourists
to Hong Kong reached a new high of 10.1 million last year, an 8.5
percent increase over 1994, according to the Hong Kong Tourism
Association today.
</P>
<P>
The new record was mainly attributed to continued economic and
political stability in the British colony which has begun to count
down its return to China in 1997, a report distributed by the
Barcelona office of the Hong Kong Tourism Association said.
</P>
<P>
The office, which organizes trips to Hong Kong for Spanish and
Portuguese tourists, was taking part in an international tourism
fair being held in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
The report said about 1.2 million Europeans, including 55,000
Spaniards and Portuguese, visited Hong Kong last year, making up
more than 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Booming tourism, the second-largest foreign exchange earner for
Hong Kong, made about 70.7 billion HK dollars (9.8 billion
U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The director of the office told reporters that more tourists
will go to Hong Kong in the future as stability and prosperity
will be maintained after the territory comes under Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong tourist officials are planning to hold
a series of exhibitions across Europe to attract more tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today suggested a "Marshall Plan" for the reconstruction of the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in
Munich, who arrived earlier in the day for a brief visit, Kohl
said that Europe should provide assistance to Israel and
neighboring Arab countries modeled on the reconstruction of
post-war Germany.
</P>
<P>
"It would be wonderful for Europe and the Mideast to cooperate
extensively," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Marshall Plan, proposed by former U.S. Secretary of
State George Marshall in 1947, West Germany received a huge amount
of financial assistance from the United States, which played an
important role in its economic recovery after World War II.
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed his appreciation to Kohl for his efforts in
promoting the Middle East peace process.

The family basket of basic staples is beyond the reach of
workers and farmers and even of the middle class in the country.

Government and labor organizations have tried to negotiate a

Entrepreneurs have countered with a 24 percent increase
proposal.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Make Radical Changes in Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia will not make "radical
changes" in its current economic program and will maintain its
general anti-inflationary orientation and austere financial
policies, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here that the Russian government will not
amend its policies to conform to political trends and the
presidential elections scheduled for June this year.
</P>
<P>
"The strict budget and financial course pursued by the
government is determined by the need to carry out market reforms"
necessary for the country, Soskovets said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government aims to create favorable conditions for
investments, stimulate domestic production, form powerful
financial and industrial groups and tighten control over
monopolistic price-setting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that strict budget and financial policies, combined
with solutions to social and domestic issues, will ensure a
continued decline in the inflation rate and a sustained rise in
living standards.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, President Boris Yeltsin had ordered the
government to resolve social issues as soon as possible in the
coal industry, the defense industry and government-funded bodies
as well as to pay out overdue wages, currently standing at some 11
trillion roubles (some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"If energetic measures are not taken, social tensions in these
sectors may become political," Soskovets said.
</P>
<P>
The results of June's presidential elections will largely
depend on how the government manages to resolve social issues and
implement economic reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will announce his decision in mid-February on whether
he will run for a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, Yeltsin has urged the
government to pay more attention to industrial and social issues.
</P>
<P>
He sacked liberal reformer Anatoly Chubais from the post of
First Deputy Prime Minister on January 16. Chubais was the last of
the "radical democrats" headed by Yegor Gaidar, the architect of
"shock-therapy" economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, who was in charge of economic policy, had been
criticized for "mistakes" in implementing the privatization
program and delaying wage payments to workers.
</P>
<P>
Questioned by reporters, Soskovets said that mistakes committed
by "some leaders" would have to be corrected.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Kadannikov,
Director General of the state-owned AvtoVAZ carmaker, as first
Deputy Prime Minister to succeed Chubais.
</P>
<P>
He also named economist Alexander Kazakov to the posts of
Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Property Committee
which oversees the transfer of state property to private hands.

military forces will hold joint air exercises in Thailand.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia today welcomed the
Council of Europe's decision to let the country join its ranks.
</P>
<P>
A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official hailed the group's
decision as "unquestionably important" for Russia. The event was
no less so for Europe because a united Europe was impossible
without Russia, the Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Council of Europe had "risen above"
the doubts raised by Russia's membership and made the only
"reasonable choice."
</P>
<P>
After a day-long heated debate over whether Russia was fit for
membership, the Council' parliamentary assembly voted 163-35 to
admit Russia to the group Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Council was set up in 1949. It has 38 members.
</P>
<P>
Russia applied for its membership in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Boost Oil Output by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government today
approved a program aimed at stabilizing and boosting oil
production by the end of the century, a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the program will stabilize the country's
annual oil output at 300 million tonnes by 1997 and increase it to
310 million tonnes by 2000, Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri
Shafranik said at a government meeting.
</P>
<P>
The program would need some 702 trillion roubles (about 140
billion U.S. dollars) in investment, he said, adding that there is
a plan to develop 125 new oil fields.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who chaired the
meeting, said that "fuel and energy is the key at the given stage"
and all efforts should be exerted to fulfill the program.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the sale of oil and gas, Russia's main hard currency
earners, accounted for more than 30 percent of the country's
exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The White House and
congressional Republicans agreed today to keep the government open
through March 15, a move which will avert a third partial federal
government shutdown in three months.
</P>
<P>
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston said, "I
think we have a bargain." The White House had signed
off on their plan that will eliminate some minor programs but keep
federal programs funded for another six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The current temporary spending measure is to have expired at
midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
The House moved to pass the legislation Thursday, and the
Senate was prepared to act on it Friday.
</P>
<P>
The final details of the agreement were worked out over the
phone by Livingston and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also discussing an accord that would pave the
way for Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said today that
U.S. President Bill Clinton "remains confident that we will get
this necessary business of the nation accomplished in short
order."

<HEADLINE> Gritschuk and Platov Take Lead in Ice Dancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- World and Olympic champions
Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeny Platov continued their dominance of
ice dancing with a fiery paso doble at the European figure skating
championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rousing Spanish dance brought out the best in the Russians
and most of their rivals in a highly entertaining session of
skating.
</P>
<P>
But at the end of it Gritschuk and Platov had again been
judged the best after a passionate performance in which Platov
appeared to be snarling at his shy-looking partner.
</P>
<P>
Their superb acting helped them hold the lead from compatriots
Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov with two scores of 5.8 for
the composition of their dance and five 5.8s and a 5.9 for
presentation out of the maximum of 6.0.
</P>
<P>
Gritschuk and Platov have never won the European title. They
were second in 1993 and 1994 before taking the Olympic and world
titles that year.
</P>
<P>
But Ukrainians Irina Romanova and Igor Yaroshenko advanced one
place into the bronze medal position as French couple Marina
Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat dropped one place to fourth.
</P>
<P>
The ice dance final to decide the medals will be held on
Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Krabbe Ruling Fixed for March 28 </HEADLINE>

<P>
BONN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Munich appeal court on
Thursday fixed March 28 as the day it will rule on the legality of
the three year doping suspension on German sprint queen Katrin
Krabbe, who has appealed her punishment.
</P>
<P>
Exactly four years on from her first major brush with the
authorities in Stellenbosch, South Africa, the 1991 double world
champion again asked the court to throw out the ban imposed on her
by the IAAF and the German Athletics Federation (DLV).
</P>
<P>
Krabbe, cleared on a technicality over the switching of a urine
sample at Stellenbosch on January 24, 1992, wants more than a
million marks (650,000 dollars) in compensation for legal costs
and lost prize money and contracts after she was banned for taking
banned drug clenbuterol in July 1992.
</P>
<P>
She vowed Thursday to "keep going right to the end," although
she conceded it was unlikely she would ever return to top
competition.
</P>
<P>
Krabbe was banned for taking the banned substance clenbuterol
in a random test in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Australia Urges Clinton to Attend 1996 APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister Paul
Keating has made an early appeal to US President Bill Clinton,
urging him to attend the informal leaders' meeting of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) later this year.
</P>
<P>
Keating, making the appeal in a letter to Clinton, asked the US
president to take part in the meeting regardless of whether he
wins or loses the presidential election this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian prime minister himself is also expected to call
a federal election in the next few months, with speculations
focusing the election dates on March.
</P>
<P>
Keating mentioned the letter in an interview with The
Australian newspaper earlier this week and the full interview will
be made public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important for the (US) president to attend
and in fact I wrote to him urging him to attend the Subic Bay
meeting," Keating was quoted as saying by The Australian today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the APEC forum are scheduled to meet in Subic Bay of
the Philippines in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who had been deeply embroiled in a bickering with the
Republican-controlled Congress over the budget, failed to attend
the Osaka meeting last November.
</P>
<P>
The reason for Keating's appeal to Clinton, according to
observers, was out of fear that Clinton might not be attending the
meeting in the run-up to the US presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the US President to attend the APEC meeting in a
row will to some extent dent the US influences within the group,
the observers noted.

<HEADLINE> NATO Blames Own Soldier For Fatal Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO today blamed the overnight
explosion that killed three NATO soldiers in Sarajevo on a
Portuguese soldier who took a fragmentation bomb to his room.
</P>
<P>
"A Portuguese soldier attached to the Italian battalion brought
a fragmentation bomb into a room. He found it not far from the
base," Italian Lieutenant-Colonel Salvatore Giacomo told the
Sarajevo press.
</P>
<P>
The powerful blast at the barracks of the Italian brigade
killed two Portuguese soldiers and one Italian and wounded seven
others. The Portuguese are part of the Italian brigade.
</P>
<P>
The three were the first fatalities among the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia since they deployed to
enforce the Dayton peace agreement last month.
</P>
<P>
Giacomo did not say why the soldier had done taken the bomb
indoors, in breach of regulations. But another officer said he had
wanted to inspect the bomb in his room "and there was a big
explosion."
</P>
<P>
The soldier had found the bomb close to the former Volkswagen
factory in Vogosca, a Serb-held area that NATO bombed last year,
raising the possibility that the powerful device was left by
NATO.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ to Scale Down National Day Celebrations (by Chen Jinjun) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will celebrate
its national day this year in two separate venues, a departure
from the past practice that commemorations were held in the
northern town of Waitangi.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that the formal proceedings for the
national day, known as the Waitangi Day, will take place in the
Government House in Wellington on February 6 instead of at
Waitangi, where Britain and the aboriginal Maoris signed a treaty
in 1840, leading to the birth of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
While Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard and Prime Minister
Jim Bolger will stay in Wellington, another ceremony will also be
staged in Waitangi, with the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Don
Mckinnon representing the government. But the program will feature
sports events and cultural competitions.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the arrangements, Bolger said that a responsible
government could not hold Waitangi Day celebrations at Waitangi
this year because of the disruption of last year's event.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Maori protesters trampled down a New Zealand flag
and scuffled with diplomats and officials attending the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
With the focus of this year's activities moving away from
Waitangi to the fenced gardens of the Government House, Bolger
said that this year is unlikely to see a repeat of last year's
large-scale protests.
</P>
<P>
"The environment is entirely different and I think some of
those who created the problems last year would not want it
repeated themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the occasion would provide New
Zealanders with a chance "to feel comfortable and say we've
recognized events of 1840, we've done it in an appropriate
fashion, we've learnt a little during the course of the day and
we can go forward."
</P>
<P>
The government arrangements have drawn criticism from the
opposition parties. Labor Party leader Helen Clark said she would
attend the commemorations at Waitangi because the garden party is
elitist and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
The two MPs of the New Zealand First party will also head to
Waitangi, while the Alliance will boycott both ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maori protesters have indicated they will still
carry out protests this year.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that last year's protest is only the first
flash point of the tension in race relations in the country. Some
Maoris cannot "feel comfortable" about the Waitangi Treaty as they
lost much land after 1840.
</P>
<P>
The government certainly does not want to fan the fire of the
Maori grievances, particularly at a time when the country is to
hold the general election later this year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Recommends Extension of Mandate of Lebanon Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended today that the
peace-keeping force in Lebanon be extended for another six months
until July 31.
</P>
<P>
Following resolutions 425 and 426 adopted by the Security
Council in March 1978, the 4,649-member U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) was set up to restore the Beirut government's
authority over the south of the country after an Israeli incursion
against Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel and its allies of the South Lebanon Army militia
continue to control a so-called security zone along the Lebanese
side of the border so as to block attacks against northern Israel.
The zone was established in 1985 after most Israeli troops
involved in a 1982 invasion withdrew.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general, in a report to the Security Council,
noted that hostilities continued in south Lebanon between Israel
Defense Forces and its local Lebanese auxiliary on the one hand
and armed elements resisting against Israeli occupation on the
other though the targeting of civilians had decreased in the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the parties to continue to exercise restrain, with a
view to ending this practice altogether," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although there has been no progress towards the implementation
of mandate of UNIFIL, the force's contribution to stability in the
area and the protection it is able to afford the inhabitants
remain important," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he recommended that the Security Council accept the
Lebanese Government's request and extend the mandate of UNIFIL for
another six months.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations in the framework of Middle East peace
progress between Israel and Syria, which has some 30,000 troops in
Lebanon, deserved encouragement and support.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that they would quickly lead to tangible results.
It is equally to be hoped that progress will be made soon towards
resolving the situation in the Israel-Lebanon theater as well," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali also said U.N. member states owed some $203.5
million in assessments for UNIFIL and he appealed to all member
states to pay their assessments promptly and in full.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Liberian Parties to Abide by Abuja Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- In an open deliberations
of the U.N. Security Council today on the question of Liberia,
both the council members and non-member countries present exhorted
Liberian warring factions to abide by the Abuja Agreement of 19
August 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that only when the parties concerned truly
give up war and persist in peaceful negotiation can there be a
peace momentum of turning sword into ploughshare," said Ambassador
Qin Huasun, the Permanent Representative of China to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we strongly urge the Liberian parties to cooperate
with the U.N. and ECOWAS, strictly implement the agreement already
reached," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin was among more than twenty speakers urging
Liberian parties to abide by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that to create conditions for the final
realization of national reconciliation, the international
community should also take concrete actions to support the efforts
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and give
full play to its role in this process.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the Abuja Agreement on 19 August, 1995,
there has been great hope among Liberians that the six-year civil
war will come to an end.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent attacks by the United Liberation Movement
of Liberia for Democracy led by General Roosevelt Johnson
(ULIMO-J) against the ECOWAS peace-keeping force in Tubmanburg
raised concerns that the fighting might spread to other areas
under the control of ULIMO-J and derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations now has 82 military observers in Liberia,
whose mission is expected to expire on January 31, but is expected
to be extended until May. The U.N. observer mission is working
with a much larger ECOWAS peace-keeping troops to monitor the
country's scheduled 1996 general elections as well as the
disengagement, disarmament and reintegration of combatants into
civil society.

<HEADLINE> UK,Irish Officials to Hold Urgent Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- British and Irish officials will
hold urgent talks to try to resolve a fresh dispute over how to
negotiate a permanent peace settlement for Northern Ireland,
according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Quoting unnamed officials, the reports said that the talks was
requested by Irish foreign minister Dick Spring after British
Prime Minister John Major shocked Dublin by proposing elections in
Northern Ireland to break a deadlock caused by guerrillas' refusal
to hand in their weapons before being admitted to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Major announced plans for early elections to a Northern Ireland
assembly as a new road to peace yesterday after an international
commission dismissed the British demand that IRA giver up some of
its arms.
</P>
<P>
He sent later in the day a letter to Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton reiterating an assurance that elections would not be aimed
at resurrecting an old-style Protestant-dominated parliament in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
But Bruton complained that that he was not consulted in advance
about the elections idea, which he said could be interpreted as
threatening an agreed timetable for talks on a political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
+That will create distrust, perhaps unjustifiable distrust," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Spring and British Northern Ireland
Secretary Patrick Mayhew are "looking at their schedules" and that
the meeting is expected to be held early next week.
</P>
<P>
Major and Bruton will also hold a follow-up summit by
mid-February, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Reports 54 Percent Drop in Earning Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Seattle-based Boeing Co.
announced today its net earnings declined 54 percent last year due
to effects of a 10-week machinists strike and a long industry
downturn.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 39 percent pick-up in fourth-quarter profits, the
company said its performance was affected by a machinists strike
that hampered production toward the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's largest aircraft maker, earned 218 million
U.S. dollars in the three months ending December 31, compared with
157 million dollars in the same period a year ago. Revenues fell
nearly 12 percent to 4.54 billion dollars from 5.12 billion
dollars as a 10-week strike by the company's powerful machinists
--Boeing's largest union --delayed delivery of 30 of the 65 planes
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year, Boeing posted a 54 percent drop in profits
to 393 million dollars from 856 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The lower profits for 1995 were primarily blamed to fewer
commercial aircraft deliveries, and lower profit margins that were
partially attributed to the introduction of the company's new
twin-engine 777 jet.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for all of 1995 were 19.5 billion dollars, down from
21.9 billion dollars in the previous year. Boeing delivered 206
planes in 1995 as compared with 270 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The commercial aircraft unit posted revenues of 13.9 billion
dollars for the year, down from 16.9 billion dollars in 1994.
Meanwhile, defense and space revenues rose to 5.6 billion dollars
from 5 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Total sales in 1996 are set to some 22 billion dollars,
according to the company. Two recent sales accounted for about 8
billion dollars in new purchases.

MAPUTO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Sweden
have decided to suspend assistance to Mozambique in reaction to
their food aid being stolen or donated funds being diverted for
other purposes.
</P>

The U.S. last month granted Mozambique 23,000 tonnes of maize,
of which 1,400 tonnes disappeared mysteriously at Port Maputo,
the Mozambique Information Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insists that the Mozambican government should make
investigation into the case and recover the maize which was
stolen, before it resumes food assistance to the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Sweden halted aid to Mozambique after Mozambican Ministry of
Agriculture officials diverted for other purposes 2.3 million
U.S. dollars, which Stockholm offered to finance an agricultural
project in the country.

WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will join Syrian-Israeli peace talks at the Wye
Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore this afternoon and then
plans to dine with the delegations tonight.
</P>
<P>
Christopher told reporters here today that the Wye talks "have
gotten off to a good start" but no dramatic results should be
expected from the current round.
</P>
<P>
"I would counsel not expecting any dramatic results from the
Wye talks," the secretary said, "I am looking forward to my trip
in the hopes that I can at that time indicate some progress has
been made."
</P>
<P>
Christopher plans to visit Damascus and Jerusalem to assess the
next step with the two countries' leaders after the current talks
end next Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The pattern here is for there to be very wide-ranging
discussion, with some tentative approaches made, then when I go to
the region, I'm able to confirm the approaches and maybe move them
ahead," Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
With two military officers from both, the Syrian and Israeli
delegations began a new round of talks at Maryland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, Syria and Israel held two rounds of talks at
Maryland, which were described as "exploratory" by participants in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation, headed by Middle East envoy Dennis Ross,
has been attending all the negotiations between Syria and Israel
since December, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Sign Revised Defense Authorization Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will sign a revised defense authorization bill despite
reservations over the amount of spending and a provision to
discharge service members with the AIDS virus, the White House
said today.
</P>
<P>
The new version of the defense authorization bill was passed
287-129 by the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday. The
U.S. Senate is scheduled to approve the defense measure later this
week, Congress sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 265 billion U.S. dollars bill was vetoed by Clinton last
December because it was 7 billion U.S. dollars higher than the
Clinton administration's budget request and contained military
purchasing items beyond "real needs."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Republican-controlled Congress made some concessions
earlier in the month by agreeing to strip out provisions
objectionable to Clinton, including proposals to develop a
national missile defense system by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has insisted that the proposed
deployment of the national missile defense system would violate
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the United States and
the former Soviet Union in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The White House said in a memo released today that Clinton
"will sign the bill" although he is still disappointed with some
of the revised defense authorization bill.

</P>
<P>
The late Lesotho head of state was killed in a car accident on
January 15 in Maluti Mountains when his vehicle veered off the
road and went down the hillside.
</P>
<P>
Moshoeshoe II was lying in state at the royal palace. The Lesotho

late king.
</P>
<P>
Residents stood in long queue from early in the morning,
waiting patiently for their chance to pay their respects to the
king.
</P>
<P>
After a memorial service this afternoon, the remains of
Moshoeshoe II were carried to the king's ancestral home at
Matsieng, about 30 km outside Maseru.

<HEADLINE> About 10 Million Women Infected With HIV: Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Mrs Ibironke Akinsete, President
of the Nigerian Chapter of the Society for Women and AIDS in
Africa (SWAA), said today half of the 20 million people estimated
to have HIV infection globally are women.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first biennial conference of SWAA here, she
said that most of the infected women live in Africa with about 25
percent of them sexually active.
</P>
<P>
The society focuses on women because of the great threat posed
to their lives by HIV/AIDS infection, she said.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, she said, studies carried out in 17 states in 1993
and 1994 showed that three million people had HIV, representing
3.8 percent of the nation's some 100 million population.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Akinsete attributed this to a lack of information on the
disease and the insufficient efforts to prevent the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
SWAA was founded in 1988 in Stockholm, Sweden, by a group of
African women concerned about the disproportionate and adverse
effect of AIDS on African women. The Nigerian chapter came into
existence in 1989.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's export earnings
reached 1.25 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, representing an 18
percent increase over the 1994 figure of 1.07 billion dollars, a
Zambian minister announced today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1996 budget in parliament, Minister of Finance
Ronald Penza said this good performance in the export sector
resulted from the sharp increase in non-traditional export
earnings and favorable copper and cobalt prices.
</P>
<P>
The value of visible non-traditional exports rose to 215.7
million dollars from 156.5 million dollars in 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to the conducive enrironment created by
the government's liberalized economic policies and the
aggressiveness of producers in finding new markets for Zambian
products, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the mining sector, Penza said the average price of copper in
1995 was pegged at 1.19 dollars per pound, an increase of 18
percent over the 1994 price.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the overall balance of payments deficit in 1995
reduced to 84.1 million dollars from 242.5 million dollars in
1994, he added.
