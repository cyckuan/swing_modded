<HEADLINE> Drug Arrests of Juveniles Increase Sharply in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of juveniles
charged with narcotics-related crimes across the United States has
more than doubled since the beginning of the decade, the Federal
Investigation Bureau (FBI) said.
</P>
<P>
The number of arrests has jumped from 64,740 in 1990 to 147,107
by 1995.
</P>
<P>
The capital Washington area was among the regions with greatest
increase in the arrests. In Fairfax County, the number of
juveniles charged with drug violations last year was more than
seven times more than five years ago, The Washington Post quoted
FBI as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in Loudoun County, the number of youths arrested in
1995 was nearly 12 times the number at the beginning of the
decade. Some other areas, such as Arlington, Montgomery and Prince
George's counties, in the Washington area also have the number
doubled or nearly doubled since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, 40 percent of juveniles convicted of serious
crimes in Ohio had drug abuse problems, but today, the percentage
has risen to 70.
</P>
<P>
About 16 percent of juveniles arrestees tested positive for
drug use in 1990 in the District of Columbia, but it rose to 55
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of juveniles being arrested for
drug-related crime was a result of the increase in drug use among
youths.
</P>
<P>
A recently published survey showed that drug use among eighth
graders has more than doubled since 1991, from 11 percent to 24
percent. Among the 10th graders,it has risen from 20 percent to 38
percent. And for 12th graders it has risen from 27 percent to 40
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- British engineering industry
has received more export orders in the past three months in spite
of a rise in the value of the pound, according to a survey by the
Engineering Employers' Federation.
</P>
<P>
With domestic demand also strengthening, the federation said
the sector was poised to enter the new year on a healthy note,
with overall output in 1997 likely to be up 3 percent on this
year.
</P>
<P>
The findings, from a survey of 1,758 engineering companies,
showed 31 percent of businesses had experienced an increase in
export order books in the final quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The engineering sector has output of some 170 billion pounds
(280 billion U.S. dollars) a year and employs 1.8 million people,
about half the manufacturing workforce.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India have
agreed to mutually release detained fishermen, a spokesman from
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> CBK Introduces New Trading System for Treasury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) is scheduled to introduce a new trading system for the
auction of Treasury bills, according to a Daily Nation report
today.
</P>
<P>
The first auction under the new system named as the Central
Depository System (CDS) will be held on January 2 next year, the
paper quoted Chief Banking Manager Reuben Marambii as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CDS is an electronic and paperless trading system which
works through immobilizing securities and financial instruments
by placing them in a centralized location.
</P>
<P>
Once the system is in place, investors will be able to buy and
sell financial instruments without the need to present physical
proof of ownership as the transfer of title will be linked to the
payment of cash electronically.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently-held seminar on the CDS, the new
system will reduce cost by up to 50 percent while considerably
increasing the volumes of transactions.
</P>
<P>
Marambii disclosed that under the new system, a minimum one
million Kenyan Shillings (about 18,000 U.S. Dollars) investment
is allowed to participate in the auction.
</P>
<P>
Investors of less than this amount can place their investments
in the new one-year floating bond facility for a minimum of
10,000 Shillings or purchase T-bills in denominations of 50,000
Shillings in the secondary market.

<HEADLINE> British Central Bank Chief Warns of Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the British
central bank has warned of a rise in interest rates early next
year to counter inflation.
</P>
<P>
As the British economy has enjoyed a fairly strong recovery,
interest rates should be further raised to slow down the growth,
Bank of England Governor Eddie George said in an interview
published here today.
</P>
<P>
"For the fifth consecutive year we are seeing solid growth of
the economy," George told the French newspaper, Le Figaro. "In
order to contain this growth, it will be necessary, sooner or
later, to increase interest rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative government, facing strong challenge by the
Labor Party in the general elections scheduled for next May, is
anxious to avoid raising rates as it would anger millions of
voters who need home loans.
</P>
<P>
The Tory party, led by John Major, lost its overall majority in
parliament last week. Opinion polls now gave Labor a comfortable
lead.
</P>
<P>
The basic interest rates were raised by a quarter point to 6
percent on October 30, when Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance
minister) Kenneth Clarke yielded to pressure from the central bank
to cool down the buoyant economy and meet the government's target
of 2.5 percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the bank's quarterly inflation report said that
further rises would be necessary before the elections. The remark
was echoed by the Confederation of British Industry.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the single European currency to be introduced in
1999, George said difference among European Union (EU) member
states over interest rates could cause tension which could weaken
the currency Euro.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem lies in the fact that some EU countries
with weaker economy, in a bid to join the monetary union in the
first wave, are trying every means to meet the strict qualifying
criteria for the common currency.
</P>
<P>
George warned against such moves and said, "The risks that
things could go wrong are real and considerable."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that his remarks are likely to further
press Clarke, enthusiastic supporter for Britain's participation
in the monetary union in the first batch in 1999, to give in to
other Cabinet members and the Tory party who oppose Britain's
active engagement in the EU.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Buy Egyptian Goods With Oil Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will buy at least 21
million U.S. dollars worth of Egyptian vegetable oil and soap in
one of its first purchases of food and other daily necessities
since resuming oil exports recently.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) today reported that
the Egyptian Holding Company for Food Industries has just
concluded a deal on providing Iraq with the edible oil.
</P>
<P>
The 8 million U.S. dollar deal, which is to be signed next
week, will bring the total sum of agreements between Egypt and
Iraq up to 21 million dollars, the MENA quoted a business source
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The company signed two days ago a 13-million-dollar deal to
export vegetable oil and soap to Iraq under the United Nations
oil-for-food agreement.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 countries and regions have offered to sell food and
medicine to Baghdad, following the six years of international
embargo since the 1990-1991 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
It has made 13 contracts with about 20 companies the world
over for exporting oil under the deal with the United Nations,
which allows Iraq to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil in six
months to help alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will use 1.2 billion dollars to purchase food, medicine
and other daily necessities, which is much lesser than the 8
billion dollars it used to buy food and medicine every year
before the U.N. imposed sanctions in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reappeared as a marketing force in the oil-rich Gulf
after exporting two supertankers from its Mina al-Bakr terminal
since the deal took effect on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's first customers in the Gulf are U.S. firms.

<HEADLINE> US Charged with Interference in Singapore's Domestic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore today charged the
United States with interfering in Singapore's domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
"The statement of the US State Department press officer on the
conduct of the election campaign in Singapore is an undisguised
interference in Singapore's domestic politics," a spokesman of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to a local television report, a US State Department
press officer said in Washington on Wednesday that the candidates
of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), including Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, had warned that constituencies that elect
opposition candidates would receive low priority in their house
upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The press officer said that the United States believed voters
everywhere should be able to vote without fear of repercussions
from the government.
</P>
<P>
Goh said today that the comments were totally absurd. "I was
furious, flabbergasted, floored. This is a local election and what
we offer the people as a program is no different from what any
candidate anywhere else will offer their electorate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry spokesman noted that this is not the first
time the US officials have tried to influence domestic politics in
Singapore. In 1988 the Singapore government protested to the US
government over the improper behavior of a diplomat of the US
Embassy for interfering in the domestic politics of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"In the US, the use of political advertisements to scare voters
with the prospect of losing health and welfare entitlements if
they should vote for the wrong party has been honed to a fine art.
Singapore does no more than the same thing, but without political
advertisements," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore has not commented on the conduct of elections in the
US. American election campaigns will provide endless opportunities
for comment should the Singapore government choose to so comment.
But this is not how countries should conduct relations with each
other. We expect US officials to accord us the same courtesy," the
spokesman stressed.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Tighten Control on Illegal Timber Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 26 (Xinhua)-- Cambodia will impose a ban
on log and timber export, effective from 1997, in a bid to halt
illegal trade activities.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers has approved a clear-cut forest policy
and tougher measures to curb illegal logging and forest business
activities across the country, according to a communique issued
today
</P>
<P>
The ban on all log and timber export is a response to rampant
illegal forest businesses in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Any timber export without prior government approval in the
future will be seen as an infringement of the law of Cambodia, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of Finance, Defense, Interior, Agriculture,
Environment, Commerce and General Chief of Staff of the Royal
Cambodian Armed Forces will be responsible for the implementation
of the ban.
</P>
<P>
The government has ordered regular troops to replace armed
units of forest companies to handle matters of security. The
company-owned security teams will be disbanded completely.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Cuts Hospital Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- An acute shortage of
professional staff has forced the health authorities in Gauteng
Province of South Africa to cut services at Kemptong Park
Hospital, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kemptong Park Hospital, one of the major hospitals in
Johannesburg, will only offer services for out-patients and
antenatal women as of January 1, 1997, the report quoted a
statement by the Gauteng Health Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The municipal hospital, assessed as "non-cost effective" due
to low utilization, is one of the three hospitals in Gauteng
Province that are proposed for closure in terms of the Health
Department's structural transformation plan.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Director-General of the Gauteng Health
Department Eric Buch said: "the reason to cut services at Kempton
Part Hospital is that staffing levels at this hospital have
dropped so low that it is impossible to keep a full range of
hospital services going".
</P>
<P>
Buch said a suggestion that Kempton Park Hospital should
become a joint private-public sector venture is under serious
consideration by the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts have noticed that South Africa has been making
efforts to carry out structural transformation in the medical
care field ever since the abolition of apartheid in 1994 in hope
to improve the public health.
</P>
<P>
Under new regulations made by the Pretoria government,
hospitals, which used to serve the white people before 1994, must
be open to the blacks.
</P>
<P>
An informed source, who asked not to be identified, said that
thanks to the ongoing social transformation, the black people have
been able to enjoy low-price medical services for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the medical change has also led to dramatic
subsidy-cut by the government, thus having remarkably restrained
income of the white medical staff.
</P>
<P>
"Many doctors and nurses have either gone abroad or shifted
to private clinics to make a good living," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Kempton Park Hospital is apparently one of the hospitals that
are suffering most from the shortage of doctors and nurses, he
added.

<HEADLINE> CBK Introduces New Trading System for Treasury  Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) is scheduled to introduce a new trading system for the
auction of Treasury bills, according to a Daily Nation report
today.
</P>
<P>
The first auction under the new system named as the Central
Depository System (CDS) will be held on January 2 next year, the
paper quoted Chief Banking Manager Reuben Marambii as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CDS is an electronic and paperless trading system which
works through immobilizing securities and financial instruments
by placing them in a centralized location.
</P>
<P>
Once the system is in place, investors will be able to buy and
sell financial instruments without the need to present physical
proof of ownership as the transfer of title will be linked to the
payment of cash electronically.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently-held seminar on the CDS, the new
system will reduce cost by up to 50 percent while considerably
increasing the volumes of transactions.
</P>
<P>
Marambii disclosed that under the new system, a minimum one
million Kenyan Shillings (about 18,000 U.S. Dollars) investment
is allowed to participate in the auction.
</P>
<P>
Investors of less than this amount can place their investments
in the new one-year floating bond facility for a minimum of
10,000 Shillings or purchase T-bills in denominations of 50,000
Shillings in the secondary market.

<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major on Thursday won the BBC Today programme's annual Personality
of the Year poll with 23 percent of the 140,000 votes cast,
according to a BBC television report today.
</P>
<P>
In second place was Lisa Potts, a Wolverhampton nursery nurse
who saved her children from a machete attack.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the poll was surrounded by controversy this
year after Tony Blair, the main opposition Labor Party leader, was
disqualified after a party official had urged Labor supporters to
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
Although the procedures were tightened, the poll conducted by
telephone remained open to manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's percentage was reduced after attempts at
multiple calls for him, but he was still the clear winner after
being the runner-up for two years.
</P>
<P>
The poll was dominated between 1982 and 1990 by Mrs Thatcher
who won every year except for 1985. And after 1990, the award was
rested for four years and was revived in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last year it was won by headteacher Philip Lawrence who was
stabbed to death outside his west London school while attempting
to protect a pupil.

attract more tourists between now and the year 2005 through a
strong strategy worked out by it.
</P>
<P>
TTB Managing Director Credo Sinyangwe said today that the laid
down strategy would be financed by the World Bank and the
European Union under a Five-Year Tourism Infrastructure Project
and a 10-Year Integrated Tourism Master Plan respectively.

He further said by the year 2005, it is projected that a total
of 400 million U.S. Dollars would have been invested in tourism,
approximatedly two-thirds of those invested by the private
sector.

The TTB boss said by the year 2000, tourist arrivals would
surpass 500,000 per annum and the rate of their expenditures in
the country was expected to rise accordingly.

Sinyangwe said apart from marketing the tourist attraction
centers in the North and Southern part, the board is also now
striving to market the waters of the Great Lakes for sports.
</P>
<P>

board has recorded sound developments in terms of income
earnings. He said the TTB earned 258.15 million Dollars in 1995

MOGADISHU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid today accused Ethiopian forces of invading
into the Southwestern Gedo region of Somalia and urged them to

</P>
<P>
In a statement, Aidid described the Ethiopian "aggression as
unacceptable", saying although his government is opposed to any
group destabilizing the security of any of the neighboring
countries, referring to the Al-Itihad Moslem fundamentalists in
Somalia.

Reports said Ethiopian troops have in the past week crossed
into Somalia 20 kilometers and taken the border town of Dolow in
pursuit of Moslem extremists.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid also said an official letter has been sent to
the government of Ethiopia over the matter concerned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation at the war ravaged border between
Somalia and Ethiopia remains calm for the second day today
following simultaneous clashes that occurred between the forces
of Ethiopia and those of the Islamic extremist group of Al-Itihad
in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali Abdi, Deputy Chairman of the Somali National Front

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- About 23 million Bangladeshis
are exposed to arsenic poisoning by drinking arsenic-contaminated
water, according to experts here.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted recently by doctors and scientists from India
and Bangladesh revealed that arsenic presence has been found in 44
out of total 107 thanas (police stations, lower-level
administrative body under the district) in 16 districts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that the 44 thanas covering an area of 12,420
square kilometers where the study was conducted are located in
different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The arsenic calamity of Bangladesh can only be brought under
control if the withdrawal of ground water is restricted and proper
utilization of surface water is made," the study suggested.

<HEADLINE> China Spells Out New Measures for Development of Coal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Coal
Industry Wang Senhao said today that China will realize the goal
of producing 1.45 billion tons of coal annually by the year 2000
by adopting new measures.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national meeting on coal industry in Zhengzhou,
capital of central China's Henan Province, the minister said that
in the years to come China will succeed in the building of seven
large mines, including Pingshuo Open-Cut Mine in north China's
Shanxi Province and Shenfu Open-Cut Mine in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Locally-owned mines will also accelerate the construction of 15
bases for production of open-market coal, while a good job must
also be done in the construction of 100 major coal production
counties to advance the upgrading of rural and township-owned coal
mines.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that his ministry would continue to list 300
large projects, involving coal mine construction and sideline
production of coal mines, to seek overseas cooperation and adopt
more open policies to create a broad investment arena for overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the coal minister, the coal industrial sector has
asked 16 large coal mines and 39 coal-burning thermal power
plants, as well as 180 sideline production and comprehensive
development projects, to seek cooperation and attract overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking Chinese official noted that currently China
should first guarantee the implementation of strategic startup
programs in the coal industry, with the focus going to making a
success of building pit power stations, using pipelines to
transmit coal, developing coal gas and developing clean coal
technology.
</P>
<P>
Different coal mines are also being urged to build power
plants, coking and coal-chemical factories, to fully develop and
utilize regenerated mineral resources, while trying hard to adjust
industrial structures, and to conduct comprehensive development
and sideline production businesses.

<HEADLINE> China to Accelerate Development of Coal Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China is to offer
preferential treatment for the development of coal gas, known as
coalbed methane, said a senior official with the Ministry of Coal
Industry today.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the development of the new energy, the government
will not collect a compensation fee for the development of coal
gas for a period of time, and will give priority in extending
loans to key development projects, said the official who is
attending a national conference on coal production.
</P>
<P>
Coal gas is a "green energy" with large development potential,
the official said, adding that the development of coal gas is of
great significance to the improvement of China's energy structure,
environmental protection, and the improvement of safety conditions
in coal mining.
</P>
<P>
China has a huge deposit of coal gas resources. In the
northern, northeastern and the southern parts of the country
alone, exploitable coal gas resources amount to 3.5 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
With state investment and foreign loans, China has set up more
than 50 coal-gas development projects, building gas-holders with a
total volume of 650,000 cubic meters and transportation pipelines
with a total length of 620,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The country currently uses more than 400 million cubic meters
of coal gas annually, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China has developed a complete set of
coal gas technology. More than 20 items of technology have met
world-advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
Sino-foreign cooperation is an important driving force behind
the development of coal gas, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the United Nations Development Program has
provided 10 million US dollars in financial assistance for the
country's three model coal gas projects, and another project for
appraising the country's coal gas resources.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A showpiece club that boasts
its own ballet troupe and orchestra has opened in China's largest
city Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Golden Age International Business Membership Club,
based in Huaihai Road, a major commercial street in the city, is
the largest entertainment center in Shanghai, with investment
coming from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Built at a cost of 40 million yuan (about 5 million US
dollars), the club has an area of 2,000 square meters, which
includes a ballroom that can hold 300 guests and 21 karaoke suites.
</P>
<P>
It has also formed a 20-piece orchestra and invited 10 Russian
professional dancers to perform ballet classics for the guests
every night.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Y.T. Chang, board director of the club, expressed
confidence in the club's future.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to worry about our business, since there are
nearly 20,000 overseas-funded enterprises and about 10,000 foreign
households of permanent residence in Shanghai, as well as over one
million overseas tourists each year," claimed the Taiwan
businessman.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 5,810 entertainment centers attracting
nearly 200,000 visitors every day in Shanghai, which opened its

<HEADLINE> New Caledonians Agree on 'Shared Sovereignty' With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The two major political rival
parties in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia today
agreed to negotiate for a "shared sovereignty" with France, Agence
France Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence movement, Kanak Nationalist Socialist
Liberation Front (FLNKS), and the pro-French Rally for Caledonia
in the Republic (RPCR), used the same terms in respective
declarations made at the local congress.
</P>
<P>
An AFP report said the declarations could mean a new start of
talks on the future of the colony after a long-time deadlock
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed the Matignon Accords with France in 1988,
which called for the stop of violence on the island and a
referendum in 1998 on the future of the colony.
</P>
<P>
"A negotiated solution will pave the way after 1998 to shared
sovereignty with France," said FLNKS President Rock Wamytan.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Pierre Frogier, who is from RPCR, said that
new agreements, which are expected by the end of 1997 between
France, the FLNKS and RPCR, could allow the colony to have
political stability for at least 24 years, or four terms of the
local congress.
</P>
<P>
Both Wamytan and Frogier described the independence process of
the island as "irreversible."
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between France, the FLNKS and RPCR came to a halt
in April last year after the FLNKS pulled out.

MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin today agreed to hold a summit
meeting between the presidents of the two countries in Moscow next

WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- As Palestinian and Israeli negotiators pressed on with
efforts to hammer out an agreement on the West Bank city of Hebron
by next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept up
pressure on wavering ministers in his cabinet to prevent the deal
from splitting his government.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. population increased by an estimated 2.3 million
people in 1996, with immigration accounting for one-third of the
jump. On Wednesday, the first day of 1997, there will be
266,499,365 people living in the United States, according to the
census projection, a 0.9 percent increase since January 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The hostage standoff has cast a cloud over Peru's resurgence
as one of Latin America's more attractive destinations. The number
of tourists in Peru has tripled to 600,000 in the past four years,
but the Tupuc Amaru guerrillas have revived old concerns about

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Test New Planes Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is scheduled to carry out
the test flights early next year of the prototype An-70 and An-140
airplanes coming out of the assembly line on December 23.
</P>
<P>
Both planes are designed by Antonov Aviation Designing Bureau
in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
An-70, a wide-bodied military transport plane, can fly 5,000
kilometers nonstop with 30 tons of cargoes, at a cruising speed of
750 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
It is claimed to be capable of not only replacing the old
military transport plane An-12, but also carrying out specialized
missions of the An-76 civil planes.
</P>
<P>
Jointly made by Ukraine, Russia and Uzbekistan, An-70 is
installed with four new turboprops, which will use 20 to 30
percent less fuel than similar planes.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian experts claimed that An-70's outstanding performance
could counter any competition from other countries in next 10
years. They added that it could be a substitute to the U.S. C-130
transport plane, designed by Lockheed Martin 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
An-140 is a short-range passenger aircraft designed to
eventually replace the renewed An-24. In the former Soviet Union,
about 40 percent of passenger planes were An-24.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that An-140 is much more superior to An-24 in all
aspects. It can save fuel by up to 50 percent, and its take-off
distance is much shorter.
</P>
<P>
Antonov Aviation Designing Bureau estimated that the potential
sales of An-140 can reach 600 to 800 planes, mostly to the CIS
countries.
</P>
<P>
Although the government hails the successes of the new planes
as miracles, An-70 still faces much criticism.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Konov, a former chief engineer at the Antonov Aviation
Designing Bureau, said An-70's control system has adopted a
Russian electronic system far below international standards.
</P>
<P>
"Due to its low performance, unreliable equipment and engine,
the potential buyer of An-70 can only be Russia," said Konov, who
has worked with the designing bureau for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
The government is spending huge money on an unrealistic
project, Konov said. "The future of Ukraine's aviation industry
lies not in heavy planes, but in multi-purpose light aircraft for
agriculture."
</P>
<P>
He expressed doubts whether next year's test flight could be
successful, saying that the internal management at the designing
bureau has become so messy that an outsider will never believe
it.

</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Duan Xiaoxing, Deputy Director of State
Council Inter-Department Coordinative Group for Rural Financial
Reforms, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The rural financing bodies have appeared up since the early 80s
when the responsibility system was widely adopted by farmers with
the abandoning of the people's commune system, according to Duan.
</P>
<P>
These funds were set up by local governments in town and
township levels, and were first defined as financing organizations
only for the purpose of developing agricultural development and
making no profits, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
None of them have been granted licenses to do any kinds of
money-making businesses, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, due to its rapid expansion and ignorance by
the local authorities, most of the rural funds have turned away
from their original targets, and are now engaged in banking
businesses like handling deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
The illegal banking activities have led to many problems and a
large number of the funds are losing money, which has brought
losses for stake-holders of the funds. This is hampering local
agricultural production and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to disclose the number of the funds and
the amount of money involved, but he said the numbers were huge,
and the rectification should be implemented without any delay and
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
The rectification will be carried out strictly in line with the
Comments on Rectification of Rural Cooperative Funds, jointly
issued by People's Bank of China and Ministry of Agriculture, Duan
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the funds will be first registered, and then be
rectified in a classified way, noting that those that have
violated the law will have to stop their operations, and those
that meet the rules will be standardized in accordance with the
newly-issued "Regulations on Administration of Rural Cooperative
Funds".
</P>
<P>
"It will be a very tough job," he said.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Antiquities Survive Strong Tremor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The antiquities in central
Syrian Palmyra have survived a strong earthquake this week.
</P>
<P>
Khalid al Asaad, director of antiquities in Palmyra district,
said that Tuesday's tremor has caused no negative effects on the
ancient city monuments while the antiquity colonnades as well as
other sites remain intact, according to the Syrian News Agency
today.
</P>
<P>
The tremor took place 16 minutes after midnight Tuesday,
registering 5.3 degrees on the Richter scale. It lasted 15
seconds. It is believed that an earthquake above five degree on
the Richter scale can cause severe damage.
</P>
<P>
Al Asaad added that field surveys proved that no cracks had
been detected on Palmyra antiquities.
</P>
<P>
Palmyra is situated in the central part of Syria, some 235
kilometers northeast of Damascus, capital of the country. It
used to be a prosperous city during the second and third
centuries, being the pass as well as cross-roads between the East
and the West.
</P>
<P>
The ancient city has a host of antiquities, including ancient
temples, colonnades, arches, utilities, a theater, a citadel,

<HEADLINE> Top Lawmaker Calling for Solutions to Agricultural Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- In a year that has seen a
record crop harvest, a top Chinese legislator today called for
more money to be poured into agriculture and the lightening of
burdens on farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Ministries and localities must discuss and implement measures
to assure that there are enough agricultural funds, streamlining
circulation of farm produce, protecting limited farmland and
lessening the added burden on farmers," said Buhe, vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
His call came in an address in Beijing to the NPC's Agriculture
Law enforcement groups who have returned from Shaanxi, Henan,
Anhui and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, who also joined one of the enforcement groups, said that
in general the law's implementation has been better year by year.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that more funds have been invested in agriculture,
with local heads seeming to be more law-minded.
</P>
<P>
The price hikes on grain procurement in recent years have also
spurred farmers to plant and purvey farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Various levels of the government are underscoring issues of
irrational loads on farmers, accounting for 70 percent of China's
population, while most localities comply with the five percent
burden ceiling, a limitation set by the central government which
outlaws money collected of more than five percent of farmers' net
income in the previous years, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has set harvest record in two straight years. An
abundance of by-products, rapid flourishing of township
enterprises and farmers' increasing incomes, all this are largely
attributed to the implementation of the agriculture law, Buhe said.
</P>
<P>
Despite some advances in the basic sector, he still pointed out
problems which he claimed perplexed the most significant sector.
</P>
<P>
They are lack of added investment in agriculture, particularly
in some poverty-stricken areas; underdeveloped markets of some
farm produce, especially for grain and cotton; lack of strict
management to protect farmland; rebounding of farmers' extra
economic loads and unreasonable taxation in a few areas; and a
lack of enough legislation on agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Petroleum Goods Prices to be Up in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The prices for petrol,
diesel and paraffin will be up throughout South Africa following
the rise of prices for petroleum goods in the international
market, a statement by the Central Energy Fund (CEF) said today.
</P>
<P>
The petrol price will rise by three cents a liter as of
January 1 next year while the price of diesel will be up by four
cents a liter.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the price-up is that the prices for petroleum
goods, such as gasoline, diesel and paraffin, in the
international market increased in late November, the CEF said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which fell into a retrenchment period in 1996,
has announced several pieces of price-up information before the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Telecommunications Company, suffering from
financial constraint, said early December it would rise telephone
fees by 28 percent beginning from mid-January next year.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources, who asked not to be identified, said other
state-owned industrial giants like Postal Services, National
Airlines and Transportation Network, which have been suggested by
experts to become private ones due to sharp subsidy-cuts by the
government, are also planning to charge more money for their
products and services in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Top Procurator Vows to Further Anti-corruption Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese law enforcer
today called on procuratorial organs at all levels to focus on
major corruption cases involving party and government officials in
a move to step up the country's anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Superme People's
Procuratorate (SPP), made the remark today in Beijing at the
closing ceremony of a five-day National Procurators' Conference.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in order to control major embezzlement and
bribery cases, procurators at all levels should learn to sum up
the characteristics of corruption cases in party and government
departments, law-enforcement and judicial organs, as well as
economic administrative organs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that attention should also be placed on cases
involving leaders of state-owned enterprises, and grass-roots
officials who abuse their power for personal gain at the expense
of people's interests.
</P>
<P>
The procurator-general urged procurators nationwide to keep a
close eye on problems emerging after the country adopted the
reform and opening-up policy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
He said that procurators should take full advantage of all
legal weapons, in a bid to strike a hard blow to crimes which
hamper the country's reform, and safeguard the healthy development
of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang asked procuratorial organs nationwide to strengthen their
awareness of investigation and evidence, and grasp the
characteristics of major corruption cases to help them adapt to
the needs of the country's anti-corruption drive.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Needs to Increase Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines needs to raise
annual investments in the infrastructure sector to 5.8 billion
U.S. dollars to sustain its economic growth, a senior official of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 2.9 billion U.S. dollars poured into the sector
every year was insufficient to upgrade existing infrastructure in
the country, said David Nellor, IMF representative to Manila.
</P>
<P>
Based on IMF estimates, the Philippines allots, on the average,
2.8 percent of total capital expenditures or about 268 U.S. dollar
of per capita income to infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Thailand, whose economy grows at an average rate
of 8 to 9 percent, invests 3.9 percent of its total capital
expenditures or about 757 U.S. dollars of per capita income in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
To clear "infrastructure bottlenecks" and lure more foreign
capital into the sector, the Philippine government has in recent
years drawn up and carried out innovative schemes such as the
build-operate-transfer and build-own-operate arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Manila also hopes to improve its energy, telecommunications and
transportation infrastructure through regional trading
arrangements such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth of foreign investments was still influenced
by the inadequate infrastructure across the country.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, Nellor urged the Philippine government
to pursue policy and structural reforms despite fierce opposition
from non-governmental organizations and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government must ensure that fiscal
accounts are placed on a sound footing by completing the
comprehensive tax reform program and ensuring the passage of
legislation trimming down the size of bureaucracy.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up New Agricultural Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a new
insurance system to protect its agricultural sector, which is huge
but vulnerable to natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Duan Xiaoxing, Deputy Director of State
Council Inter-Department Coordinative Group for Rural Financial
Reforms, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Along with the deepening of China's market-oriented economic
reform, the existing insurance companies in the country are
increasingly reluctant to sell policies to farmers, due to
the vulnerability of farm production which is easily exposed to
natural disasters like floods and drought.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic agricultural insurers are running at loss, and it
will further hamper the development of the country's fledgling
insurance industry if no solutions are found, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
The methods for founding a new farming insurance network are
still under consideration, but the new agricultural insurers are
expected to be run locally and adopt a cooperative system in terms
of administration and management, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-made household
electrical appliances have taken the lead in the domestic market,
a survey has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out in 100 department stores in 35 major
cities across China, has found that more Chinese brand household
electrical appliances were sold by the end of November this year,
compared with imported models.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by China Economy Consultancy Company
under the State Statistics Bureau, found that Chinese-made air
conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines have taken a
market share of between 58 percent to 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ten most sought after refrigerators were all from China.
</P>
<P>
In the field of color TV sets, the survey found, Changhong,
Kongka, Beijing, Panda and other Chinese brands have jointly taken
65 percent of the market share.
</P>
<P>
The survey also noted that the monopoly of video players and
hi-fi systems marketed by overseas brands has been broken by
Chinese brands, and that Chinese companies control half of the
laser video CD players market.
</P>
<P>
However, experts warned Chinese companies of any premature
optimism, saying that big companies from abroad have switched
their ways of entering the Chinese market from selling their
products, technology and equipment, to selling their brands and
building factories in China, a more powerful way of enlarging
their market share.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that Chinese companies, in the course of
strengthening scientific research, readjust their assets and form
group companies in order to confront major foreign competitors.

<HEADLINE> Strikers Not to Be Paid Under New Law in Australia </HEADLINE>

<P>
CANBERRA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Australian employees,
including Commonwealth public servants, taking part in industrial
action, will no longer be paid under a federal workplace law,
which will take effect on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Federal Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith said today
the Workplace Relations Act, passed by the Senate last month, made
payments to workers taking any form of industrial action illegal.
</P>
<P>
From now on, public servants who breached their agreements and
disrupted customer services would not be paid for the period they
failed to carry out duties, the minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the provisions would apply equally to federally-covered
public and private sectors, and it aimed to ensure that workers
and employers alike abide by their agreement obligations.
</P>
<P>
Reith said that while the new law provided for a right to
strike during negotiations for an agreement, employers should not
be forced to foot the bill for that industrial action.
</P>
<P>
It will also be illegal for unions and their members to make
claim for pay in respect of any period of industrial action or to
organize or threaten industrial action for such pay, he added.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on HK-Taiwan Air, Shipping Services After 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Air and shipping links between
Hong Kong and Taiwan after China's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 will be treated as
special regional routes under the "One China" principle.
</P>
<P>
The air and shipping services between the two places should be
handled in accordance with the principle of mutual benefits, said
a spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua in Beijing today, the spokesman
said that connections between the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and Taiwan after 1997 is a special part of the
cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
In June of last year Vice-Premier Qian Qichen announced the
basic principles and policies of the Central People's Government
on handling relations between Hong Kong and Taiwan after 1997.
</P>
<P>
These principles and policies will help maintain the existing
non-governmental exchanges in economic, cultural, transportation
and other fields and personnel contacts between the two places on
the basis of the "One China" principle, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said arrangements have been made on air services beyond
1997 between Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On shipping services, the spokesman said, vessels registered in
Taiwan, when entering Hong Kong ports, cannot show a flag that
would suggest a "two Chinas" situation.
</P>
<P>
While vessels registered in Hong Kong should be treated
according to the mutually beneficial principle when entering ports
in Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the normal operation of shipping
services between the two places under the "one China" principle
after 1997 will be helpful to their common economic development,
which is in the interests of compatriots both in Hong Kong and
Taiwan.

The other threat is water pollution with major rivers, streams
and large stretches of the coastal marine environment being
polluted by municipal and industrial waste, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Great Number of Slips Found in 1,700-year-old Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of bamboo
and wooden slips bearing 200,000 characters have been unearthed
from a 1,700-year-old well in a downtown area of Changsha city in
central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the slips, surpassing the total number of
their kind ever found in the country, is one of the most
significant archaeological finds in China this century, according
to China's leading archaeologist at a press conference today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He declared that this latest find is as important as the
discoveries of the world-renouned oracle bones and shells from the
Shang Dynasty (16-11th century BC) in central China's Henan
province and the Dunhuang documents in the Mogao Grottos in
northwest China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
The expert is Yu Weichao, Curator of the Museum of Chinese
History. He said that the well, three meters in diameter, was
actually a cellar which served as an archives of the Changsha
Prefecture under the Wu State (222-280) during the Three Kingdoms
Period (220-280).
</P>
<P>
The originally dry cellar was submerged in the past centuries
with the uplifting underground water level. This prevented the
slips from breaking up in a dry environment.
</P>
<P>
"The well-preserved slips will cover the shortage of historical
documents of the Three Kingdoms Period, a warring era," Yu
said. He made a special trip to Changsha to see the slips recently.
</P>
<P>
The slips are detailed records of the political, economic,
military, cultural and geographic situation of Changsha
prefecture, covering taxes, renting, registration, legal system,
administration positions, rites and storage.

<HEADLINE> Wine to Replace White Spirits in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing may soon have much in
common with Bordeaux if supporters of fine wines have their way.
</P>
<P>
They want wine to replace the tradition toast of strong white
spirit as the favored tipple at banquets and gatherings.
</P>
<P>
Even the Chinese premier, Li Peng, has expressed the view that
wine should take over from traditional Chinese 'firewater' at
official functions.
</P>
<P>
Wine, it seems, will gradually replace white alcoholic spirits
in China as the country's material civilization and cultural and
ethical progress continues to improve.
</P>
<P>
Whether China ever rivals France as a nation of wine lovers
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
But Liu Changxi, Chairman of China Great Wall Wine Company
predicted the switch to wine at a seminar on wine culture in
China, which opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly sponsored by four organizations,
including China Great Wall Wine Company, is the first of its kind
in China.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of spirits distilled from sorghum and maize during
festive seasons and at gatherings and banquets has long been a
tradition in China, especially in rural areas. The
strong 'firewater' is also viewed as a source of many serious
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, China has vigorously advocated "no
consumption of white spirit at official banquets, and starting a
common practise of saving grain".
</P>
<P>
Early this year, some 30 ministries and commissions of the
State Council issued a joint document calling for ending the
consumption of white spirit in all official banquets.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng has also put forward a proposal for
consuming more wine instead of white spirits during festive
seasons, or at gatherings.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and experts at the seminar believed that
China has great market potential for wine-making industries which
is also an efficient way to help poor areas quickly become
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
China set up its first winery in 1892 in Yantai, a coastal city
in east China's Shandong Province, and is now capable of producing
200,000 tons of wine a year.

<HEADLINE> Sasakawa Japan-China Friendship Fund Awards Chinese College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Chinese college
students each received 2,000 yuan (240 U.S. dollars) in
scholarships in Beijing today for their excellent performance in
learning Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The scholarships were provided by Sasakawa Japan-China
Friendship Fund, the largest fund involving in non-governmental
exchanges between China and Japan, with a total fund of 100
million yen (nearly one million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fund was founded in 1989 by the Japan Sasakawa Peace
Foundation (SPF) and the China Association for International
Friendly Contact (CAIFC).
</P>
<P>
Sasakawa Japan-China Friendship Fund has rewarded nearly 200
Chinese college students since it was founded last year. It has
set up special scholarships for Chinese students studying the
Japanese Language in six colleges and universities, including the
Shanghai Foreign Studies University, Sichuan Institute of Foreign
Languages, Northwest University, and Guangxi University.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship was designed for the training of "couriers" for
Sino-Japanese friendship in the 21st century, said Chen Hua,
vice-president of the CAIFC. He added that it would promote
bilateral understanding between young people of the two countries,
and help encourage the training of professionals majoring in the
Japanese language.
</P>
<P>
Sasakawa Japan-China Friendship Fund was founded in 1989 by the
Japan Sasakawa Peace Foundation (SPF) and the China Association
for International Friendly Contact (CAIFC).
</P>
<P>
More than 100 projects have been conducted between China and
Japan since then, such as personnel training, cultural exchanges,
research and study, staff exchanges, and the holding of
international seminars.
</P>
<P>
The Sasakawa Japan-China Friendship Fund, an essential channel
for Sino-Japanese friendly contact, has been playing an active
role in promoting bilateral understanding and cooperation in the
fields of politics, economy, culture, and education.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yuan, an official at CAIFC, said that the Sasakawa
Japan-China Friendship Fund has decided to include the Scholarship
as one of its 10-year projects in China. The scholarship would
cover major foreign languages institutes in China which open
courses of Japanese language.
</P>
<P>
The Scholarship would also give preference to colleges and
universities located in remote and inland areas of the
country. Sasakawa Japan-China Friendship Fund is also considering
sending some of the rewarded students on visits to Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China's President Jiang Zemin
has written an important chapter in the country's literary
heritage.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has been the driving force behind plans for the building
of the world's biggest archives in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The showpiece building will become the new home of hundreds of
thousands of original manuscripts, books, translations, letters,
diaries and even electronically produced materials of the
contemporary Chinese writers, the country's written and spoken
heritage captured on pages and in modern electronic media.
</P>
<P>
The foundation for the new Archives of Modern Chinese
Literature was laid in Beijing four weeks ago. Its launching was a
frequent subject of discussion among Chinese writers at the
recently-ended Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Writers
Association (CWA).
</P>
<P>
The largest literature construction project in China has won
accolades from China's top writer, Ba Jin, and also received great
interest of Chinese President and General Secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The new archives will become the world's largest literature
archives after its completion. Its first-phase construction will
be finished by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The original and existing archives was initiated in 1981 by Ba
Jin, who is also CWA President. It opened to the public in 1985,
and has served as the state information and research center on
modern Chinese literature. It is located in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It has collected 260,000 modern Chinese writers' manuscripts,
editions, translations, books, letters, diaries, as well as audio
and visual products.
</P>
<P>
The archives has set up special library collections of the
works of 33 top Chinese writers, which serves to demonstrate the
main achievements of modern Chinese literature, and to allow
research on the literary treasures.
</P>
<P>
However, as an increasing number of books and other literary
pieces are piling high at the archives, its space and facilities
can no longer meet the necessary standards to adequately preserve
the treasures.
</P>
<P>
The archives started to fall into its overcrowding position,
and this aroused wide concern among the country's writers.
</P>
<P>
Ba Jin, as the country's most famous writer, came forward and
urged the solving of the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Ba wrote to Jiang Zemin for help, saying "I feel
uneasy about the present difficulties the archives has
encountered. I wish the construction of a new archives to be put
onto the agenda and be approved."
</P>
<P>
He said in the letter, "This archives is my last piece of work
in my lifetime. But it is not for myself. I am willing to devote
all my remaining energy to the archives, as it has a bright future
and serves as a rich mine to show the refined souls of Chinese
people. I wish we have all the people's support and your
excellency's help."

<P>
Xie Bingxin, Honorary President of the CWA, also wrote to a
leading figure of the State Council, saying China needs a new
archives to collect the literary treasures of modern China. He
said it will be a window to show China's profound culture and
literature.
</P>
<P>
Ba Jin's letter and the archives' difficulties have come to
Jiang's keen attention. According to his personal instructions, an
investigation team was sent to look into the matter, report to him
and offer preliminary proposals on a solution to the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In April 1993, Jiang wrote to officials of relevant
departments requiring more care about the construction of a
new archives.
</P>
<P>
He said: "All civilized countries in the world are always
willing to offer an amount of money to support their literary
cause."
</P>
<P>
Under his direct and personal concern, relevant departments,
after a thorough study and research, approved the construction of
a new archives.
</P>
<P>
On November 25, 1996, the foundation of the new archives was
laid in the northern suburbs of Beijing, involving a total
investment of 96 million yuan (about 11.6 million US dollars) and
covering 24,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Shu Yi, son of the late famous writer Lao She and executive
deputy director of the archives, was moved to say: "This is a
great event that the literary circle has long awaited. Almost all
the writers present at the recent writers' congress were inspired
by the good news. It also serves as an practical accomplishment in
socialist cultural and ethical progress."
</P>
<P>
Li Zhun, well-known Chinese writer and Vice-President of the
CWA, said: "From this event, we have come to fully know the
General Secretary's keen concern for China's modern literary cause
and for Chinese writers."
</P>
<P>
"The archives, as a historical monument of modern Chinese
literature, displays the refined literary accomplishments of
modern China," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhe Taifeng, Deputy Head of the Propaganda Department of the
CPC Central Committee, said the new archives will be a
treasure-house for the safekeeping of the refined literary works
of modern China.
</P>
<P>
"It will continue to play a great role in giving full play to
our national culture, in inspiring our future generations, and in
making further contributions to the world civilization," said Zhe,
who also heads the writers' association.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that all relevant sectors will make every effort to
accomplish this literary project at an early date."
</P>
<P>
This is the wish of Ba Jin. And it also demonstrates the great
concern Jiang Zemin has shown for the country's writers.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Call for "Absolute Party Leadership" over Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators today
called for stronger leadership by the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) over the nation's armed forces. Their proposal came during a
discuss in Beijing on a draft law on national defense.
</P>
<P>
"It must be made clear in the law that `absolute party
leadership over the military must be strengthened,' to ensure a
correct political path for the People's Liberation Army (PLA),"
said Huang Yuzhang, Jiang Shunxue, Wang Yuefeng and many other
members of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) which is now in session.
</P>
<P>
Huang also suggested that an addition be made to the draft
saying that "China will not pose any threat to the security of
other sovereignties" to illustrate China's defense policy of
"active defense."
</P>
<P>
Most lawmakers expressed the view that formulation of the
national defense law is crucial for the rule of law in the
military field.
</P>
<P>
The draft, after several revisions, has emerged as mature and
feasible, according to the committee members. They agreed to
submit the draft after further reviews and revisions to the annual
NPC plenum for deliberation and final approval.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yuzhang proposed a ban on the military from businesses
for profit, and guarantee military expenditure with government
allocations, in order to make the armed forces focus on their
major task of protecting state security.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Shouliang, an NPC deputy from the PLA, and Standing
Committee member Shen Xinsun, said the state should provide
sufficient funds for the development of military technologies,
research and production of new military equipment.
</P>
<P>
Cheng added that more military technicians should be trained to
transfer new hi-tech achievements in the military into combat
power.
</P>
<P>
It should also be written into the law that the PLA should
inherit the glorious traditions of serving the people, austerity
and tight discipline, said Zhou Zhanao, another lawmaker.

<HEADLINE> China to Make Assets Administration Market-Oriented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China should set up
state-owned holding companies to make its state assets
administration more market-oriented by the turn of the century, a
senior official has urged.
</P>
<P>
Reform of China's state assets administration system will
follow the direction of establishing a management, supervisory and
operational mechanism that well defines its rights and
responsibilities, vice minister of Finance Zhang Youcai said.
</P>
<P>
In management, the government's social and economic function
must be separated from that of the owner of state assets, said
Zhang, who is also director of the State Administration of State
Property, the industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments should administer state assets at
different levels, he said, adding that specialized state assets
administration agencies must strictly perform their duties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that supervision of state assets administration is
an all-round, multi-tier issue that should be tackled by
supervisory bodies at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress, China's legislative body, is mainly
responsible for supervision of the government's work in state
assets administration, while specialized assets administration
agencies should keep a watchful eye on investor subjects and the
operation of state assets.
</P>
<P>
The intermediary agencies should be responsible for supervision
of state assets operations and changes in property rights, and
enterprises should exercise self-restrain in state assets
management, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang warned that, except with some exceptions, government
departments must not operate state-owned assets directly.
</P>
<P>
He said that companies specializing in the operation of state
assets should be set up, adding that such firms should include
state-owned holding companies, state investment companies and
enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
The companies, which are different from enterprises in the
ordinary sense, should be responsible for the safety and value
appreciation of state assets, Zhang noted.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Prospects Vary After Elections in Asia, Oceania (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
INDIA -- The United Front (UF) government led by Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda in neighboring India is, likewise, not free from
trouble. For all its seeming stability, the UF, formed in June by
14 smaller disparate parties after the April-May general election,
is still struggling to hold its ground, relying on support from
the Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
The UF coalition became one of the three major political forces
in India after the five-yearly election during which Congress, led
by then prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, suffered its worst
defeat at general polls. Rampant corruption, slack organization
and indiscipline, internal strife in Congress' ranks as well as
Rao' arbitrary style were blamed for the party's ouster.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which took
over from Congress as India's largest party with 171 seats in the
545-member parliament, formed a government but resigned after just
two weeks in power, becoming the shortest-lived government in
India's history.
</P>
<P>
The UF and Congress, abhorring the BJP's preached supremacy of
Hinduism and its bias against minority Muslims, joined hands in
bringing down the BJP government.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, which offered vital support to the UF coalition
in order to keep the BJP from power, has since repeatedly
threatened to withdraw its backing. Their "alliance" has been
beset with quarrels, and both Congress and the BJP are biding
their time, eager to regain one-party rule in the future.
</P>
<P>
Deve Gowda last week ruled out snap elections and said his
government would complete its five-year term.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts predict that a mid-term election is
still likely some time next year.
</P>
<P>
The UF coalition has by and large kept unchanged the previous
government's policies, including economic reform measures,
although its efficiency is marred by parochial views of its
members.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty is turning away foreign investments,
slowing down economic growth. However, one thing is clear:
Whoever is in power, the economic reforms launched five years ago
will continue.
</P>
<P>
THAILAND -- The formal swearing in early this month of a
six-party coalition led by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
brought to an end a government crisis which had plagued the
previous Banharn Silpa-archa administration.
</P>
<P>
Three cabinet reshuffles amidst an ailing economy caused by
slowing exports growth and sluggish foreign investment failed to
save Banharn's unpopular government which was accused of having
mismanaged the once robust economy and condoning corruption.
</P>
<P>
Banharn was forced by his own coalition allies to agree to
resign during a September debate on an opposition no-confidence
motion which he survived. But instead of actually resigning, he
dissolved the parliament and called fresh elections for November
17.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's New Aspiration Party (NAP) won the most seats and he
formed the six-party coalition of 221 seats in the 393-member
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government of Chavalit, who campaigned on setting up a
"dream team" of technocrats to run key economic ministries, and
his NAP have been hit by internal dissension fueled by
dissatisfaction over the allocation of some key government posts.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators say the Chavalit coalition, an unlikely
"marriage of convenience," may not be able to stay longer than the
previous government -- just over a year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chavalit lost no time in announcing major policy
initiatives to tackle national economic woes and the government is
working in earnest to restore confidence in Thailand among local
and foreign investors, eroded by political instability and
economic difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Prospects Vary After Elections in Asia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUSTRALIA -- In Oceania, Australia's electorate gave Liberal
Party leader John Howard the mandate to form a conservative
coalition government in the March election, ending 13 years of
Labor Party rule under prime ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.
</P>
<P>
Many voters shifted their choice from Keating, whose handling
of the country's economy had been under constant criticism despite
the good score internationally, to Howard just for a change.
</P>
<P>
Howard made adjustments to policies pursued by his predecessor.
The new government's austerity measures appeared to be paying off
with the economy expected to grow by 3.4-four percent this year.
</P>
<P>
But a major row over race and immigration and the new
government's stance towards Asia have aroused great concern both
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Pauline Hanson, an independent MP, triggered a nationwide
debate on race and immigration in September when she said that
Australia risked being swamped by Asians. Her anti-Asian comments
drew wide criticism and condemnation from Australia's ruling and
opposition parties in parliament, as well as from Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
But Howard repeatedly refused to openly condemn Hanson. Local
press reports said his silence implies support for her views.
</P>
<P>
In its policy towards Asia, what the Howard administration
actually does is starkly different from the Asia-focused Labor
government. The new government attaches priority to Australia's
traditional relationship with America and West Europe, by raising
the level of its military alliance with Washington and preaching
the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government's decision to cut soft loan programs to
Asia and its willingness to ape the U.S. in international affairs
contrast sharply with the previous administration's policy of
Australia's "integration into Asia" and the active role it played
in the region.
</P>
<P>
NEW ZEALAND -- New Zealand's first general election on October
12 under a mixed member proportion (MMP) system instead of the
first-past-the-post system ended the traditional domination of
government by either National Party or Labor and heralded a new
era of coalition in New Zealand politics.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling National and the opposition Labor managed
to retain their positions as the country's two largest political
forces with 44 and 37 seats respectively in the 120-member
parliament, the New Zealand First Party emerged as the biggest
gainer.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the newly elected MPs are Maoris. NZ First,
dominated by Maori MPs and led by Maori leader Winston Peters,
fared impressively in the election, benefiting from sharing many
of the conservative National's economic measures and at the same
time the left-leaning Labor's social welfare policy.
</P>
<P>
Peters, whose NZ First held the balance of power after the
inconclusive election, ended two months of political suspense by
choosing National as his coalition partner over Labor, and became
deputy prime minister and gained the powerful post of treasurer.
</P>
<P>
The results of the election did justice to the policies
implemented by the country's political parties since economic
reforms were launched in the early 1980s, and also showed that
more and more New Zealanders tended to favor the centrist line in
politics.
</P>
<P>
The MMP electoral system resulted in a new political pattern in
New Zealand politics which will have a bearing on future policies
of the parties and the government. For all its fairness, the
jitters during the long-drawn-out coalition talks prompted people
to question the wisdom of it.

<P>
ROME, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian striker Roberto Baggio
has lost up to six billion lire (about four million U.S. dollars)
in an alleged investment swindle, according to a local newspaper
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The former Italian international was one of at least 200 people
who placed money in a finance company based in Rimini, which
promised enormous returns on foreign investments in tax havens.
</P>
<P>
But the money has vanished and 16 people from a finance company
were arrested just before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The soccer star, 29, who plays with Italian champion AC Milan,
was not willing to make comment about the issue. "It's all in the
hands of my lawyers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources were quoted as saying that other Italian
soccer players had put money into the fund but said Baggio was the
single biggest investor, with between three and six billion lire
entrusted to the firm.

<HEADLINE> Macao Announces Price Cuts for IDD Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The price for international
direct dialing (IDD) calls in Macao will be reduced by some 10
percent as of January 1, 1997, the Macao Telecommunications
Company (CTM) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The service charge for mobile phones will also be reduced some
five percent, said CTM.
</P>
<P>
IDD calls to Thailand, the Philippines, Japan, the Republic of
Korea and Portugal will have preferential price treatment during
non-busy hours. The price of IDD calls to Hong Kong will be
reduced from three patacas (about 0.38 US dollars) per minute to
2.6 patacas (about 0.33 US dollars) per minute.
</P>
<P>
Preferential price treatment will also be given to mobile phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CTM said that it will raise the price of rent
for domestic phones. Non-commercial telephone users will have to
pay an extra 10 patacas (about 1.27 US dollars) per month, and
commercial users will have to pay 15 patacas (about 1.9 US
dollars) more each month.
</P>
<P>
The charge for IDD telephone calls has become a hot topic among
local residents over the past several years. The monopoly
operation by the CTM in the past 15 years has brought a fast
modernization of telecommunications in Macao, and many complaints
of high charges as well.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there had been about one phone for an
average of three residents in Macao, with total lines of telephone
topping 150,000. There are also more than 36,000 mobile phone
users. All phones in Macao can reach 219 countries and regions
around the world.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants to Improve Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has said that Iraqi-Turkish relations should be improved as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He expressed this belief in a message to Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan who met Thursday with visiting Iraqi Oil
Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid in Ankara, according to the local
newspaper Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
No details of the message were made available so far.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that he supported the removal of the United
Nations sanctions imposed on Baghdad following the 1991 Gulf War
to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, describing the opening of the
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline as a festive occasion.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamist prime minister complained that the
U.N. sanctions have caused Turkey great economic losses, which
were estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, the embargo on Iraq means an embargo on Turkey,"
Erbakan claimed.
</P>
<P>
Rashid, who is heading a Iraqi government delegation for a
meeting of the Turkish-Iraqi Joint Economic Commission in Ankara,
said that the two countries should exchange views over both
political and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iraq are planning to launch joint studies on the
development of gas fields in a bid to help Iraq buy badly needed
food and medicine with the sales of gas products.
</P>
<P>
A cooperation protocol is expected to be singed at the end of
the ongoing meeting.

HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Pollution-related
respiratory diseases killed 22,192 people and sent almost half a
million to hospital from 1991 to last year in Hong Kong, and last
year's deaths of the disease were nearly 1,000 more than at the
beginning of the 1990s as air pollutants soared.
</P>

Today's South China Morning Post reported that over the past
five years pollutants which have been blamed for respiratory
disease rose 14 percent, while other toxic gases increased by 27
percent in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Last year's death toll of 5,707 caused by respiratory disease
was 20 percent higher than the 4,746 deaths recorded in 1991. Eye
doctors and dermatologists said their crowded waiting rooms also
reflected the state of the air, according to the report.
</P>

The Hong Kong authorities warned heart and lung patients to
stay indoors on five occasions this year due to high pollution
levels. Dermatologists say people with eczema may soon receive the

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Issues New Law on News Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has issued new law on
satellite broadcast to protect the country's international image,
according to Daily Star here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, all news on Katyusha rocket firing by guerrillas
from the Lebanese territory are banned from appearing in satellite
news programs.
</P>
<P>
The Katyusha rocket has been used by Muslim guerrillas in their
fightings against the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon,
but a cease-fire understanding reached on April 26 bans any
Katyusha launch into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Another issue prohibited from being mentioned is the presence
of a 35,000-strong Syrian force in Lebanon, which constitutes the
backbone of Syria's influence in this country, noted the only
English-language daily published in the Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
The Information Ministry Thursday outlined the satellite
broadcast law, which also bans news release relating to detentions
of suspects and those wanted by security forces.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Obeid, director general of the ministry, was quoted as
saying that censorship is needed to "protect Lebanon's
international image and refrain from serving Israel's interests
during this crucial post-civil war phase."
</P>
<P>
Obeid said that the regulations were crafted in particular for
Arab audience because other Arab states lack Lebanon's "political
pluralism" and would therefore misinterpret the often turbulent
political scene in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Other news banned by the satellite broadcast law include those
instigating sectarian problems, harming Lebanon's relations with
Arab and foreign countries, and relating to drug cultivation and
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, all news and footages on details of guerrilla
operations against Israel and its backed South Lebanese Army (SLA)
are also banned from being broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, the militia group trained and armed by the Jewish
state to help police an Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
in south Lebanon, was referred to as "the militia collaborating
with Israel" in the new law.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses Canada, US, S.Africa of Derailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria accused Canada, the
United States and South Africa of planning to derail its
on-going transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Abuja, capital of Nigeria on Thursday,
Special Duties Minister Alhaji Wada Nas said the three countries,
in conjunction with the Canada-based National Endowment for Democracy
(NED), plan to sponsor "human rights and pro-democracy" groups to
publish leaflits and posters, and organize anti-government rallies,
workshops and press conference in the country.
</P>
<P>
All this is aimed to "undermine the federal government, discredit
the transition program and present it to the internatioanl community
as a manipulative exercise that was devoid of any democratic content,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan was being hatched following "an unprincipled and
ill-conceived alliance being forged between some foreign diplomats and
the errand boys of Western imperialism namely the so-called
pro-democracy and human rights groups."
</P>
<P>
Only last week, he said, the head of African Affairs of NED visited
Nigeria and met with the leaders of 15 such groups, promising a grant
of 50,000 to 70,000 U.S. dollars to each of them.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Canadian High Commission in Nigeria provided
about 1.3 million dollars to these groups for the destabilization of
Nigeria, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister named seven of the groups and accused them of
clandestinely receiving money from foreign sources to publish leaflets
that "are nothing but fabrications on the human rights situation in
Nigeria and intended to cause chaos and disaffections among the
populace."
</P>
<P>
He recalled the visit of the United Nations fact-finding mission to
Nigeria in March this year, saying that it has put to rest all the
fabrications about the human rights situation in the country and the
federal government's commitment to the implementation of the
transition program.
</P>
<P>
"The government is faithfully implementing the recommendation of
the UN facting-finding mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the recommendation of the mission to the then UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was in favor of Nigeria and
has been under the attack of Western countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- South African black
youngsters, who have fortunately finished their courses in
universities, are disappointedly facing a reality -- no ideal
jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Central Statistical Service say the total
number of South African graduates is 411,353 with blacks making
up 7.5 percent only.
</P>
<P>
However, of all the poor number of the black graduates, nearly
one fourth of them are unemployed. Such percentage is even far
below that of the unemployed Asian and colored graduates
</P>
<P>
The statistics shows that the unemployment rate among the
Asian and colored graduates registered between three percent and
5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Even the few who are employed constitute less than three
percent of managerial and executive posts", said Vukite Nkabinde,
President of the South African Graduates Development
Assoiciation.
</P>
<P>
Nkabinde complained bitterly about the lack of employment for
black graduates, noting that those doing unchallenging jobs are
paid far less than they are worth.
</P>
<P>
"This might be attributed to the legacy of appartheid,"
Nkabinde said, adding that the effects and consequences of the
large number of unemployed graduates have tended to show in the
crime statistics that have swollen rapidly.

XIAMEN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The regional cooperation
between east China's Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, and south
China's Guangd has made a substantial breakthrough, according to a
conference held here.
</P>
<P>
At the second joint conference of leaders from 13 cities and
prefectures of the provinces, officials have agreed to set up an
office in charge of the regional cooperation affairs, and elected
a permanent president and an executive president of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The specific moves signify that the provinces, which are an
important passage for goods from central and western China to
enter the world market, have upgraded the level of regional
operation,
</P>
<P>
At the conference, experts from the State Planning Commission
have divided the three provinces into four regional areas,
including special economic zones -- Xiamen and Shantou cities,
coastal areas -- Shanwei, Jieyang, Chaozhou, Zhangzhou and
Yingtan, central areas -- Meizhou, Longyan and Sanming, and
interior areas -- Ganzhou, Fuzhou and Yingtan.
</P>
<P>
The areas will join hands in infrastructure construction, and
setting up conglomerates of industrial enterprises, market
systems, and export-oriented economic system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, since the first joint conference was held last year,
these provinces have made notable achievements in drafting joint
development plans, joint construction of traffic lines, and
transportation of goods between mountainous and coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shantou, Shanwei, Chaozhou, Jieyang and Meizhou are
building highways together.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, construction of the Shantou-Jieyang-Meizhou
expressway will start in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Zhangzhou-Chaoyang-Shantou Railway is being
prepared. Construction of the Xiamen-Quanzhou and Xiamen-Zhangzhou
expressways will be finished next year. And the the Guangdong and
Fujian sections of the 324 and 319 national highways have been
completed.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Currency May Appreciate Significantly in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian currency,Naira may
appreciate significantly against U.S. dollar in the coming 1997, as
the government is planning a merger of the current dual exchange
rates.
</P>
<P>
The "Daily Times" reported today that the government has taken
major steps towards the alignment of the offcial and the Autonomous
Foreign Exchange Market rates at 56 Naira to one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The currently official rate is 22 Naira to one Dollar, whereas the
rate at the Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market is 72 Naira to one
Follar.
</P>
<P>
The Naira has appreciated significantly in the last two weeks,
pushing the rate up from 80 Naira to one Dollar to 72 Naira to one
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The report said this is due to the injection of dollars into the
market by the Nigerian authorities. But the official News Agency of
Nigeria said in an earlier report that the large number of Nigerians
returning from overseas with foreign currencies for Christmas has
forced the Dollar to Naira rate down.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian industry insiders have expressed the fear that the
proposed merger at lower rate is likely to attract criticism from the
World Bank, which has earlier proposed the merger rate of 95 Naira to
one Dollar to promote export of non-oil products.

<P>
Johannesburg, December 27 (Xinhua) -- An anti-gun group in South
Africa has criticized President Nelson Mandela for giving toy guns to
children at a Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Broadcasting Assoiciation quoted a statement by
the Gun Free South Africa Assoiciation as saying on Friday that
presenting toy guns to children cannot be condoned at a time when
violent crime is escalating in the country.
</P>
<P>
The toy-guns handed over to children at the Christmas party
were said to be among donations from various companies.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is on a one-month holiday at his rural home at Qunu in
Transkei, shared Christmas cheer with under privileged children on
December 25. Some 6,000 to 10,000 children were invited to the grand
Christmas party, the local press reported. enditem

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Prospects Vary After Elections in Asia, Oceania (1) by Ya Tai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- General elections held in
five Asian and Oceanian countries this year all resulted in a
change of government, and in most cases there are signs of
political instability.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty has been dogging the governments in
Bangladesh and India ever since they were brought to power by
elections this year, while those who won national polls in
Australia and New Zealand seem to fare better.
</P>
<P>
And Thailand's new cabinet sworn in early this month after over
one year of unstable government may herald the beginning of a
fresh round of instability.
</P>
<P>
BANGLADESH -- The continued antagonism between the government
of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League (AL) which won
elections in June for the first time in 21 years, and the main
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by Begum Khaleda
Zia does not bode well for the South Asian country of nearly 120
million people, which, plagued by years of chaos, is battling
grinding poverty, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda, who became the country's first woman prime minister in
1991, won the February 15 election which was boycotted by the then
opposition AL. However, she was forced to step down in late March
amidst a stormy non-cooperation campaign launched by the
opposition, paying the way for fresh polls under neutral caretaker
authority.
</P>
<P>
The AL won the June 12 election which was peaceful and
generally regarded as fair. And riding on people's aspirations
for political stability and economic development, the government
has, among other measures, intensified its economic diplomacy to
attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Disturbances are dwindling and the sagging economy is beginning
to pick up. It is widely believed that if the government focused
its efforts on improving the economy to allow stability to persist
for just one year or two, with subsequent rising popularity for
the AL, the BNP may never be able to stage a comeback.
</P>
<P>
However, instead of seeking to ease the tension with the BNP,
the Hasina government is stepping up "reprisals" against former
BNP government officials in the name of anti-corruption, forcing
the opposition to shift tactics from moderate measures to street
agitation to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
The government's reprisal measures are a double-edged sword and
may become one of the flash points of new violence, and the
country's immediate future remains uncertain, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Non-Oil/Gas Exports Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Trade and Industry
Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said the country expects a sharp rise in
key non-oil/gas exports in 1997, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister told local press Thursday that non-oil/gas exports
are expected to reach 44.7 to 45.1 billion US dollars in 1997, up
from an estimated 38.8 to 39.1 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil/gas imports would be worth 43.8 to 44.2 billion dollars
in the year ahead, up from an expected 39.2 to 39.6 billion this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's largest exporting industries are electronics,
steel, machinery and automotive, palm oil processing, food and
beverage, and basic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
"The government will encourage the development of these
industries so that their export performance can be maintained," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Government officials have estimated the country's current
account deficit will widen to 8.7 billion US dollars in fiscal
year 1996/97 (April-March), or about 4 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), from 6.9 billion dollars, or about 3.2 percent of
GDP in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the country's economic growth was
expected to be between 7.6 and 8.0 percent in 1997 while inflation
was seen at below 7.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government predicted economic growth this year
will be 7.6 to 7.9 percent with inflation rate at 6.5 to 6.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> Four Tamil Women Arrested In Eastern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 27 (Xinhua)-- Four Tamil women who carried
over one million rupees (about 18,000 US dollars) strapped to
their bodies were arrested at Kithuhitiyawa in Eastern province
Wednesday, according to police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that large quantities of medicine were also
detected with them when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
On interrogation the suspects told the police that they were on
their way to north Jaffna city but were unable to explain how they
got the money, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations revealed that the suspects had traveled
to Trincomalee by ship and from there were attempting to go to
Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
Since their explanations were not acceptable, police detained
them for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that since the Tamil rebels are hard pressed
for cash and medicine to treat their injured cadres, the women may
be couriers for the Tamil rebels who have been fighting for a
separate state in the north-east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
It has been found that Tamil rebel sympathizers in Colombo had
remitted large quantities of money through couriers to Jaffna
city, once their stronghold in the north of the island.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that in this instance the police are yet
unable to find who had given the money to these women.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors to Meet on Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation monitoring
committee on Lebanese-Israeli cease-fire is scheduled to meet on
January 6 to assess complaints respectively filed by the two
countries, sources in the Lebanese Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the eighth meeting since its formation last
August. It comprises France, the United States, Syria, Lebanon and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Gaussot, head of the French delegation in the
committee and the current chairman of the five-nation group,
delivered a copy of Israeli complaint to the Lebanese team
Thursday, the well-informed sources said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Israel filed the complaint Wednesday over a road-side bombing
which killed two Israeli soldiers this week, an Israeli army
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Israel have exchanged accusations against each
other of violating a cease-fire understanding which they reached
on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire understanding bans Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas from targeting civilian-populated areas or launching
attacks from the areas.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the U.S., the understanding put an end to a 17-day
Israeli blitz in south Lebanon, which killed some 200 Lebanese,
mainly civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel charged that the Lebanese pro-Iranian Shiite militia
Hezbollah, or Party of God, spearheading a guerrilla campaign
against the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, broke the
agreement by detonating a roadside bomb in the village of Markaba
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were killed and two others seriously
wounded in the attack. One of the killed was an officer and
member of the elite commando unit "Sayeret Egoxz," according to
the Israeli army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"This activity by Hezbollah, in an area which is populated by
civilians, is another violation of the understanding," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese official sources said the Israeli complaint
was "baseless" because the April 26 agreement did not ban
Hezbollah from launching attacks from occupied villages.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel filed a complaint over a December 19
Hezbollah operation, claiming that the attack violated the cease-fire
understanding since it was launched from the village of Baraashit
at the north edge of the Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army General Eli Amitai was sightly injured in the leg
by shrapnel in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon also lodged a complaint over retaliatory Israeli
shelling of the village, in which two civilians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
More than 26 Israeli soldiers have been killed and nearly 90
others wounded so far this year in clashes with Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel established the so-called "Security Zone," a
1,100-square-kilometer border strip in south Lebanon, in a bid to
curb cross-border attacks at northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Operation for Sabah Storm Victims in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Search and rescue
operations for storm victims are in full swing today in East
Malaysia's Sabah which was lashed by a strong rainstorm Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four members of the Special Malaysian Disaster
Assistance and Rescue Team (Smart) today joined in the massive
search and rescue operation launched in Keningau on the state's
west coast, the worst affected by the tropical storm "Greg",
according to reports from Sabah's capital Kota Kinabalu.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the first time the Smart team, formed
after the Highland Towers collapse tragedy outside Kuala Lumpur in
1994, has moved into action.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Smart members, other rescuers are drawn from the
Police Field Force, border scout and the military.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Civil Defense Department personnel in Sabah have
already been ordered to take part in relief operations throughout
the state since early Thursday after the rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
Three main relief centers have been set up to house victims.
</P>
<P>
The search and rescue work is currently concentrated in
Keningau, Likas, Tanjung Aru and Kota Kinabalu as well as in the
coastal areas, the reports quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police confirmed 109 bodies had been recovered by
midday today.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead are some foreigners whose identities however
have not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
About 500 houses in nine villages along the Pampang, Bayayo,
Liawan and Sinagang rivers were washed away, leaving about 3,000
people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Road communications from the state capital to Keningau, about
131 kilometers southeast to the state capital, have been severed
after two bridges spanning the Sungai Liawan and Sungai Pegalan
were washed away, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad today extended his
condolences to the families of the victims of the rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
Shocked and sad over the loss of more than 100 lives and the
injuries and damages caused by the tropical storm, Mahathir said
in a statement that the government would help the victims and take
all necessary actions.
</P>
<P>
"The Sabah government and relevant federal agencies have been
directed to provide assistance to the victims of the disaster," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Amends Exchange Control Export Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian National Bank
today announced it has amended the current exchange control
procedures on export of goods effective from January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
These amendments arose from the implementation of the Port
Klang and Subang Airport community systems of the Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI) by the Royal Customs and Excise Department for
processing goods clearance, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments, an exporter who submits the relevant
Customs/Free Zone declaration forms through the EDI systems would
no longer be required to submit the exchange control form known as
Form KPW X, irrespective of the value.
</P>
<P>
New simplified forms known as Form 5A and Form 5B would be used
instead, with the former for reporting exports with partial or no
payment to be received due to permitted reasons and for changes in
value of export, and the latter for seeking approvals for exports
which do not comply with the normal rules and requirements on
export.
</P>
<P>
For an exporter who does not submit the relevant Customs/Free
Zone declaration forms through the EDI systems, Form KPW X shall
continue to be completed for each export where the value declared
in the relevant export declaration form of Customs/Free Zone
exceeds 100,000 ringgit (about 40,000 US dollars) free on board
(FOB) per shipment.
</P>
<P>
The bank said all other rules and requirements on export, for
exchange control purposes, remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
It said in particular, all payments for export must be received
in Malaysia by the exporter in full and in the prescribed manner
when contractually due, which in any case should not be later than
six months from the date of export.

<HEADLINE> Israel Annoyed by Italy's Pressure Over Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- In an evidence of unsound
relations with the European Union states, Israel has openly
complained to Italy about its support for a U.N. Security Council
plan to dispatch a team to investigate a projected Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel has informally, albeit unwillingly, put the Ras al-Amud
settlement issue on hold, asserting that it was not the time for
the Security Council to get involved in the matter, the local
newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Government officials are quoted as saying that the Italian
government was pushed to get involved in the issue by Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, who visited Italy lately. Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is expected to visit Italy and the
Vatican at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Officials say Israel is considering raising with the
Palestinians the idea of what they called a "code of conduct,"
whereby the two sides would agree on ground rules of action as
negotiations proceed. As is evidenced by this matter, Israel is
upset that Arafat is lobbying foreign governments to oppose the
Jewish state on specific diplomatic issues.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing Likud-led government has come under mounting
international pressure in recent weeks for its policy of
settlement expansion in the occupied territories. The EU,
enthusiastic in support for the Oslo Accords signed under the
previous Labor government, has been critical of the current
Israeli hardline policy on peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU has made it clear that it still adheres to the decision
by the U.N. on the status of Jerusalem and therefore disagree
with Israel's assertion that it has exclusive sovereignty over
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Exports From Industrial Manufactures Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' export
earnings from industrial manufactures rose 32.72 percent during
the first 10 months of this year, the Bureau of Export Trade
Promotion (BETP) said today.
</P>
<P>
Data from the BETP show that for the first 10 months, sales
overseas from this commodity group jumped to 10.688 billion US
dollars from 8.053 billion dollars recorded in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial manufactures accounted for 83.59 percent of the
total export earnings for the period which stood at 16.809 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Strong demand for electronics boosted the sales of industrial
manufactures, the BETP said. The electronics sector continued to
exhibit impressive sales performance in the 10-month period, as it
toppled all other groups under industrial manufactures.
</P>
<P>
For the past months, exports revenue from electronics continued
to swell by 41.06 percent. Exports of semiconductor devices
dominated the bulk by raking in 6.953 billion US dollars during
the period.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and transport equipment garnered the second highest
earnings which amounted to 617.311 million US dollars, up 8.4
percent from a year ago's level of 569.500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 10.17 percent drop in export revenues during the
period, metal manufactures made the third largest earnings valued
at 438.482 million US dollars, dipping from last year's 488.116
million.
</P>
<P>
Other groups which contributed considerable dollar receipts
were petroleum products, chemicals, construction materials,
textile yarns and fabrics.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Open Maritime Industry to Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's maritime industry
will be completely opened to foreign investors from January 1999,
the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will take necessary measures to give foreign
investors full access to sectors such as gas tanker and container
ferry operations, which have been partly or wholly off limits to
foreigners, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It added that foreigners will be able to own a stake in a South
Korean shipping firm or completely take over a South Korean firm
since 1999.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they will be allowed to set up local subsidiaries
instead of agent offices in the country, a move expected to rattle
the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot find any more excuses to bar foreign investment in
our maritime industry when South Korean shipping firms make
overseas investments, as was the case of Hanjin Shipping Company
which took over a stake in Germany's DSR-Senator Shipping
Corporation," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
However, like common practices in other countries, coastal
passenger and cargo transport operations will continue to be
barred from foreign investment, said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> 14 Local Telephone Networks Operational in Hubei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
has expanded 14 local telephone networks, and put them into formal
operation, according to the province's posts and telecommunications
administration.
</P>
<P>
Along with the launching of 14 local webs, the province's last
batch of six-digit telephone numbers, which are used in the
prefectures of Jingsha, Shiyan and Jingmen, was upgraded to seven
digits on the mid-night of December 15.
</P>
<P>
Liang Qingzhang, director of the administration, said that the
telephone number upgrading will greatly improve the operation of
local telecom networks, and provide more "phone number resource"
to the province's growing telephone market.
</P>
<P>
He said that these local networks will be accessible to such
new telecom functions as the intelligent, broadband and personal
communications services, and, most importantly, will largely cut
people's phone bill by calculating the long-distance calls on
the basis of local call charges.
</P>
<P>
So far, Hubei has more than 2.8 million phone subscribers, and
the telephone density rate increased from 0.68 per cent in
1990 to 5.5 per cent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Province Protects Bioresources with Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kunming, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the
undertaking of a Sino-Dutch project to protect forests and build
communities in southwest China's Yunnan Province are well under
way.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Jihai, director of the Provincial Forestry
Department, the Dutch government will contribute 15 million US
dollars to the project while the Chinese side, 7.5 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the effort of the province to introduce
overseas funds to protect its rich natural resources and boost
lits economy.
</P>
<P>
Located in southwestern China, Yunnan is known as a "kingdom of
flora and fauna".
</P>
<P>
The province has been utilizing foreign funds to the
bio-diversity and wildlife protection since it began to use funds
from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in 1988 to help study the
tropical rain forests in Xishuangbanna.
</P>
<P>
With 12 million Deutsche marks in assistance provided by the
German government to increase the income of farmers in forest
areas, trees have been planted on more than 8,000 hectares and
over 7,400 hectares of forest have been enclosed for natural
growth.
</P>
<P>
This year the Global Environment Fund of the World Bank has
contributed 1.72 million US dollars to a project to manage natural
reserves. The fund will be used for personnel training, scientific
research and improvement of management.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government is now discussing with the
German government about another project of cooperation in
restoring and protecting tropical rain forests in Xishuangbanna.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the use of foreign funds will focus on protecting the
bioresources and building communities.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Yunnan provincial government has
allocated nearly 20 million yuan (one RMB yuan equals about 8.3 US
dollars) for the protection of natural reserves.

<HEADLINE> Senior Officer: Army Prepared for Syrian Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli army
officer said that the Israeli army has increased its preparedness
for war following Syrian troops' redeployment along Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Matan Vilna'i, deputy chief of
Staff of the Israeli army, as saying that the army has
replenished ammunition supplies, introduced advanced artillery,
upgraded tanks and improved exercises.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i said the military has been preparing for a
confrontation with Syria since August when Syria moved a division
from Beirut, Lebanon's capital, to the slopes of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
Damascus said the troops movement was routine and had no
intention to start a war with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i said the army envisions a scenario whereby Syria
attempts a surprise attack on the Golan Heights with a massive
amount of ground troops and tanks.
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood of a war with Syria is greater than it was a
year or two ago," Vilna'i said.
</P>
<P>
The army has determined targets to attack within Syria should
war erupts and increased the level of its standing forces while
providing soldiers with more advanced equipment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The result is that the army has been able to respond to
threats on several fronts simultaneously, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy chief of staff stressed that the army has not been
on alert for war, instead, the military is improving its
capability in case of such a development.
</P>
<P>
The standing army has increased 30 percent over the last few
years, Vilna'i said, and the entire corps such as the air force
and intelligence depend solely on recruits.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the increased number of recruits has been
accompanied by a lack of motivation to serve in combat field
units among Israeli youths.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i said the benefits of a large standing army were
stressed during the recent tensions with Syria, adding such a
force could manage to repel a massive attack, including the use
of Syrian missiles, until the reserves are mobilized.
</P>
<P>
"A standing army is very expensive," he said. "But, we see the
benefits of large, trained standing army, equipped with the best
weapons. It is the first line of defense."
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i said that during 1997 the Israeli army will receive
several F-151 fighter-jets, Israel's most advanced warplane, Black
Hawk helicopters, Merkava III tanks and MRLS artillery.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that Vilna'i's remarks would add to the tension
between the two countries which were locked in bloody wars in the
past years. No comment was available here from Damascus so far.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors suspended their peace talks early this year
and their relations have deteriorated since the hardline Israeli
government took office in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan
Province has hit a target by purchasing nearly 3.2 billion
kilograms of grain from farmers this year, up 270 million kg over

<P>
Farmers in areas unaffected, or only slightly hit by the
disasters, have delivered nearly 73 million kg of grain to aid the
disaster-stricken regions, helping people overcome difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Gymnasts Need Consistency and Experience (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua/OANA) -- China's modest collection
at the Atlanta Olympics Games laid bare the fact that their
gymnasts need consistency and experience.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese gymnasts won one gold, four silver and one bronze
medals as against a 2-3-2 finish in the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Li Xiaoshuang, two-time world champions, China
lost the Olympic men's team title to the Russian squad by a gap of
1.239 points. They picked up the silver medal with 575.539 points.
</P>
<P>
Inconsistency and unsteady nerves cost the Chinese the
most-conveted gold medal as they made too many errors in the last
two of the six rotations to see the Russians pulling away on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, China found some solace from 1995 world champion
Li Xiaoshuang, who came from behind to score 58.423 points to lift
China's first Olympic all-around title, beating Russian star
Alexie Nemov with a slim margin of 0.049 points.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus, who swept six golds in the Barcelona
Games, finished third in 58.197. Chinese Zhang Jinjing and Shen
Jian took the fourth and fifth places respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the women's team competitions in Atlanta, 1995 world
championships runners-up China placed a poor fourth as the United
States, Russia and Romania filled the top three spots.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's nuclear power plants
generated 2.4 percent more electricity than planned in 1996, the
country's National Committee of Nuclear Energy said today.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's five nuclear plants produced 79 billion kilowatt
hours (kwh) this year, an increase of 12.7 percent over 1995, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
Although Chernobyl's No. 1 reactor was shut down at the end of
November, the five plants generated 43.8 percent of the country's
total electricity.
</P>
<P>
However, the installed capacity of the five nuclear plants as a
proportion within the national total is considerably less than
indicated by the electricity they generated.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 14 reactors running in these nuclear
plants, which include Chernobyl.

<HEADLINE> Protest, But No March in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Serbian opposition
supporters held a protest rally in central Belgrade Thursday
without walking on the streets as they have done over the past 36
days.
</P>
<P>
The protesters' move, apparently aimed at avoiding direct
confrontation with riot police, came after the Interior Ministry
issued a ban on Wednesday on marches which disrupted traffic.
</P>
<P>
They assembled in front of the headquarters of the Democratic
Party and listened to the President of the Serbian Renewal
Movement, Vuk Draskovic, who suggested a shorter "stroll" because
of the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The protesters all went home after the rally instead of
marching in the streets to protest against the government's
annulment of the results of local elections on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations by Serbian citizens and students against the
government started two days after the November 17 elections. On
Tuesday, government supporters and pro-opposition demonstrators
clashed in the streets, causing dozens of injuries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Install Bomb-Detection Equipment at Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) today announced a 52.2 million dollar
contract to install sophisticated X-ray equipment at major
airports in the United States to detect explosives in checked
baggage.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract with InVision Technologies of Foster City,
California, the installation of the equipment will start next
month and a total of 53 such machines will be put at U.S. airports
in 1997. But for security reason, the FAA would not disclose the
names of the airports that will have the equipment.
</P>
<P>
The contract is part of the government's efforts in tightening
security at airports after the explosion of TWA Flight 800 last
summer although investigators have yet to determine if the TWA
crash was a terrorist attack or mechanical malfunction.
</P>
<P>
The FAA also said that it was to hire 300 more special agents,
upgrade security requirements and improve background checks on
airport employees.
</P>
<P>
The government has the option to purchase additional systems in
1998. The system, called the CTX-5000, is the only detection
system to have passed the FAA's certification test.

<HEADLINE> Dabie Mountains Rich in Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Geologists have discovered
large deposits of non-ferrous metals, precious metals and other
minerals in the Dabie Mountains in central China.
</P>
<P>
The mountains have a complex geological structure, with good
conditions for the formation of minerals, geologists said.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of 700 geological workers in central China's Henan
Province have worked all round year to prospect and look for
mineral resources since 1950s, and conducted surveys in the
mountains, which have drawn the attention of geologists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In late 1960s, geologists discovered an unusually large
non-ferrous ore in the Xinyang County.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they discovered successively two high-grade silver
ore in Luoshan County, a number of small gold mines in Guangshan
County, and mines containing both gold and silver resources in
Shangcheng County over recent years.
</P>
<P>
This year, a copper mine with a three-km formation structure
and great potential for development, was found in Xinxian County.

<HEADLINE> ADB Says Private Sector Alone Cannot Provide Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The private sector alone cannot
deliver efficient public services, according to the latest issue
of the ADB Review, the bi-monthly publication of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
Public and private sectors must work together to inject greater
competition, increase efficiency and avert market failures.
Privatization program must be carefully designed and regulated in
light of many drawbacks experienced in privatization and private
provision of service, the Review said.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, privatized public institutions were put to some
other use or entered into monopolistic contracts for service
delivery, increasing fees while allowing services to deteriorate,
the Review said, pointing out the government intervention is thus
needed.
</P>
<P>
In a related article, an ADB-financed study of the social
sector in Asian transition economies showed the division of
responsibilities between the public and private sectors in social
service delivery is difficult but even more complex in transition
economies.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid growth in private sector activities in these
economies, the public sector still has a major role in ensuring
equity of access to these services.
</P>
<P>
Regulating the newly emerging private sector, ensuring fair
competition between public and private operations, and divesting
state enterprises of services that are better provided by the
private sector are issues that will have to be addressed in each
country, the Review concluded.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Acts to Break Budget Deadlock Between Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos is looking for a compromise on the 1997 national budget,
whose passage was blocked due to a deadlock between the House of
Representatives and the Senate, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made this indication after undergoing a successful
operation to remove a cholesterol block in his carotid artery. He
checked out of hospital and returned to work on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"President Ramos will talk to leaders of both chambers of
Congress to determine what is the problem and how we can help
solve the problem," Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said.
</P>
<P>
On the first day he returned to the Presidential Palace, Ramos
met with Senate President Ernesto Maceda who said later that Ramos
seemed to like the Senate's formula on how to solve the budget
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two chambers are giving two repaired versions of the 1997
draft budget and disagreed with each other. The core of the
standoff was the Senate's proposed 40-percent cut in the
Countrywide Development Fund (CDF) of all legislators.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the President, Maceda proposed to
reduce the CDF allocations by 20 percent instead of the 40 percent
cut the senate earlier stuck to.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Congress adjourned for the month-long
Christmas break without passing the 476.2-billion-peso (18.2
billion U.S. dollars) budget proposed for next year.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is supposed to meet today to discuss how to solve
the country's budget crisis.

SHANGHAI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A sample survey shows that
the real income of urban families in Shanghai, the largest
manufacturing center in China, will average 25,000 yuan (3,015
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, conducted among 500 families, the real
average income of urban families reached 21,000 yuan in the
first ten months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Total earnings of urban families consist of wages and the
non-wage income.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of 1996, wages accounted for 59 percent
of total earnings of Shanghai families, a rise of three percentage
points from the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, earnings from non-wage sources contributed 40.6
percent to total earnings, a drop of 3.1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The wage-oriented income of Shanghai's urban residents shot up
by 20.5 percent and the non-wage income rose by 5.9 percent only
in the first ten months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that with the success in the price reform, the
price increase range has decreased substantially, with the result
that local residents' incomes have been increasing steadily.

<P>
NANJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The realignment of the south
Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal is near completion after four
years' construction.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, more than 90 percent of the earthwork

<HEADLINE> Snowstorm Whips Up Romania, Bulgaria Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snow and blizzards
swept large areas of Romania and Bulgaria Wednesday and Thursday,
suspending road and water traffic and closing airports -- but the
weather brought an unexpected meeting between the two countries'
presidents.
</P>
<P>
The bad weather forced the aircraft of Bulgarian President
Petar Sroyanov, who was returning from a trip to Italy, to land in
Bucharest Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His aircraft had been heading for Sofia. But the heavy snow
that suspended road traffic in northern and eastern Bulgaria
closed Sofia airport and two others, forcing the aircraft to
divert to Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea ports of Varna and Burgas also closed because of
high waves caused by strong winds. Electricity was cut in nearly
400 villages across Bulgaria, and in some areas water supplies
were suspended.
</P>
<P>
The heavy snow was expected to last for another two days in
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Air transport in neighboring Romania was able to operate as
usual, except for one airport which cancelled flights because of
thick fog.
</P>
<P>
But snowstorms brought down wires, and delayed trains and
suspended road transport in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds brought blizzards and whipped up six-meter waves
along the Black Sea coast, forcing the port of Constanca to close
and paralyzing service on the Danube River.
</P>
<P>
The first snow of the winter in Romania came a month later than
usual and brought a snow blanket averaging 20-30 centimeters thick
to many areas. In some places, the snow was up to 70-80
centimeters deep.
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest, Sroyanov was invited by Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu to the presidential place, where the two discussed
issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Though not scheduled in advance, both sides believed the
meeting would help promote mutual understanding, said a spokesman
of Constantinescu's press office.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Sofia said Sroyanov left for Bulgaria by road on
Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Oil Production Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' oil fields
produced a measly 270,000 barrels of crude oil this year, a 75
percent decline from 1.067 million barrels last year, according
to the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
The department, in its year-end report, attributed the sharp
decline to the suspended oil production at the Linapacan oil
field, one of the country's major oil producers.
</P>
<P>
The Linapacan wells, which stopped production this January,
registered an output of a mere 5,312 barrels, a 99 percent drop
compared to 703,011 barrels last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's oil production went 45 percent below
the target of 600,000 barrels for 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the domestic oil production had been slow
also partly due to a drop in output in another oil field, Nido, in
the southern Philippines. Production at the Nido wells dropped by
14 percent to 174,821 barrels from 203,707 barrels a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But the report said the Matinloc field in the southern
Philippines produced a total of 94,1986 barrels of crude oil this
year, more than double the production of 45,908 barrels last year.

HEFEI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese University of
Science and Technology held a two-day job fair recently, inviting
hundreds of research institutes and enterprises to send people to
talk face-to-face with its graduating students on the campus.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 graduates signed contracts with their employers at the
fair, according to the school in east China's Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
"We hope graduating students will find jobs according to their
wish. That's the purpose of our fair," said Xu Ping, organizer of
the fair.
</P>
<P>
"We're more than willing to have face-to-face talks with
graduating students before considering their appointment," said an
employer.
</P>
<P>
The school, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is one of
the leading universities in the country.
</P>

Since 1984, the school has sent people around the country to
introduce its gradutes to institutes and enterprises in need of
personnel.
</P>
<P>
This time, it invited employers to its campus to have closer
contacts with their future employees.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GNP Growth to Outpace Inflation in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines expects the national economy to grow faster than the
inflation rate next year, with gross national product (GNP)
expanding between seven and eight percent against an inflation
rate of six to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank governor Cabriel Singson said in a report to
President Fidel Ramos that economic growth has actually outpaced
inflation since the third quarter this year, the Philippine Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Average inflation, Singson said, slowed down to 6.1 percent in
the second half of the year, compared with 11.1 percent in the
first half, while the economy grew by 7.1 percent in the first
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
"The strong economic results achieved in 1996 have by now
clearly established the ability of the economy to stay on a high
growth path without necessarily running into financial imbalance,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson attributed the achievement of high growth and low
inflation to the improvement in the government's finances, the
series of policy reforms, improved administrative capacity and
political stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines last experienced a higher growth, lower
inflation scenario in 1987 at a much lower level with a GNP growth
of 4.6 percent and an inflation rate of three percent.

<HEADLINE> Winter in Beijing Fails to Deter Keen Exercisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Cold and windy winter has
failed to frozen the enthusiasm of morning exercisers in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Every morning Beijingers, most of them middle-aged or elderly,
rally in parks, stadiums and open spaces. People walk, jog or
stretch, play badminton or foot-shuttlecock, or practise
traditional Yangko dancing, kungfu or qigong.
</P>
<P>
Yuyuantan Park, in western Beijing, attracts thousands of
fitness enthusiasts each day around the edge of its large
lake. Some arrive as early as 4 am, nearly two hours before dawn
in mid-winter.
</P>
<P>
Despite thick ice covering most parts of a big lake in the
park, swimmers plunge into the icy water to the amazement of
spectators in bulky winter clothes.
</P>
<P>
Other large Beijing parks also have 1,000 to 1,500 exercisers
each morning, said a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guanmin, 69, chooses an unique way to keep fit. While
practising a traditional breathing exercise, he whoops every four
or five steps.
</P>
<P>
"Yelling can let out both mental stress and internal physical
waste accumulating overnight," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the city has launched a campaign to encourage
all city residents to join in physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
Stadiums, track fields and fitness centers open to the public
day and night.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Welcomed to Upgrade Battery Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China's battery makers should
shift their focus to alkaline battery production to avoid losing
their potential market shares, According to "China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
With an annual output of more than 10 billion batteries, China
is the world's largest battery producer, accounting for one-third
of the total.
</P>
<P>
The country expects to export more than half of batteries this
year, earning 300 million yuan, nearly the same as in 1995, said
Wang Jingzhong, secretary-general of the China Battery Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
Domestic makers often find it hard to place their products in
the supermarkets in China's big cities. The supermarkets stock
foreign-brand alkaline batteries, including Duracell, Energizer,
Toshiba and National.
</P>
<P>
China expects to produce around 300 million alkaline batteries,
a small proportion of the country's total battery output, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
About 200 million alkaline batteries are for the domestic
market, leaving the remainder of the market demand to be met by
imports.
</P>
<P>
As people become more conscious of environmental protection,
low-capacity and low-power batteries will sooner or later give way
to pollution-free alkaline ones, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Many domestically made alkaline batteries made in east China's
Fujian Province are as high-quality as imported ones. Nanfu
alkaline batteries enjoy a good market for their high quality and
low price, with about 70 percent exported to the United States,
Japan and European countries.
</P>
<P>
But current alkaline battery production is too small-scale in
China. And the country welcomes foreign investment to upgrade
battery quality and to expand alkaline battery production, Wang
said.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Rebels Free Guatemalan Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian rebels occupying the
Japanese embassy residence here released Guatemalan ambassador
Jose Maria Argueta today in a gesture to recognize his country's
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The release left 103 people still held captive by members of
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), who have been
occupying the residence since December 17. Around 30 of the
remaining hostages are Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government and the rebel National Revolutionary
Unity are expected to sign a peace treaty on Sunday, putting an
end to the 36-year-old civil war, reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the release of Argueta, President Alberto Fujimori met
with Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who arrived
here Thursday to learn of government effort to free hostages,
including Malaysian ambassador Ahmad Mokthar Selat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a loud explosion occurred in the besieged residence,
causing fears for the safety of the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
A bishop who entered the compound told reporters that the
captives were not hurt in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross officials said an animal stepping on a mine near the
building might have been responsible for the mysterious blast.
</P>
<P>
The blast could have come from a homemade mine of the type the
rebels have allegedly placed around the building, police said.
</P>
<P>
After releasing hundreds of hostages, the rebels continue to
hold 103 captives they consider most useful as bargaining chips,
including Peruvian ministers, diplomats and Japanese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori has flatly rejected the rebels' demands that more than
400 of their jailed comrades be freed, telling them to hand over
their weapons and release their captives if they want to avoid the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began on December 17 when the rebels stormed the
residence during a gala reception honoring the Japanese emperor's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan ambassador Tabare Bocalandro was freed Tuesday, after
a Uruguayan court ordered the release of two suspected MRTA
members.

BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A sophisticated digital
telecommunications network will link all the cities and counties
of east China's land-locked Jiangxi Province next summer.
</P>
<P>
According the Beijing-based People's Posts and
Telecommunications News, the province's DDN (digital data network)
has been expanded twice this year.
</P>
<P>
The third expansion project which is scheduled for completion

province.
</P>
<P>
The number of the network's subscribers will increase by 1,000
this year, with the total reaching 2,000. The increase margin
will be 1,000 users next year, said a local telecommunications
official.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Internet branch will be launched in Jiangxi next
year. Through a local node, the branch will connect the province
with the global computer web, via Chinanet, an affiliate Chinese
network.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet subscribers will reach 250 in the
province next year, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, Muslim Rebels to Open Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to open
their overdue peace talks on January 7, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will be held in Sultan Kudarat province as
agreed earlier, will be at technical levels only, the reports
quoted Executive Secretary Ruben Torres as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The technical committees from both parties will discuss only
the details and parameters of their formal peace negotiations,
Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Torres said the MILF agreed to the date so as not to interrupt
the Ramadan, the Muslim's month-long fasting ritual which will
begin on January 9.
</P>
<P>
Torres said he is optimistic the MILF will honor the agreed
date. He did not explain why the MILF gave up the January 3 date
they proposed earlier.
</P>
<P>
The exploratory peace talks between the government and the MILF
have been delayed since early October because of tit-for-tat
attacks between the two sides, and disagreement over a temporary
truce and the venue of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is one of the several rebel groups still
fighting the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF refused to honor the peace deal forged in September
between the government and the MNLF, and wants its own peace
negotiations with the government.

</P>
<P>
The province has approved 2,500 Taiwan-funded businesses, with
a total investment worth more than five billion US dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Price War to Heat Microwave Ovens in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The microwave-oven price war
in major Chinese cities is likely to be more intense next year, as
the market expands and domestic producers grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
The price war is likely be as fierce as that in the
refrigerator market four years ago and more recent price wars in
the air-conditioner and color TV markets, China Daily quoted Pan
Weiji, deputy domestic sales manager for Galanz, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Microwave ovens have begun to enter ordinary Chinese urban
households in large numbers in recent years, prompting the
emergence of a huge market.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1994, imported microwave ovens, especially Japanese
ones, dominated the domestic market. But development of microwave
ovens by Chinese manufactures led to a 50-50 split last year
between domestic and foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
The price war on microwave oven began in August this year when
Guangdong Galanz Group, the largest domestic producer of microwave
ovens, cut the prices of its two most popular models by nearly 40
percent. Most domestic producers, including foreign-invested ones,
followed Galanz's lead.
</P>
<P>
Some domestic producers have won customers with low prices,
better services and good after-sales services such as one-year to
three-year guarantees or lifetime repairs. Other producers
launched campaigns to promote the making of traditional Chinese
dishes using microwave ovens.

<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
industry has used 6.56 billion US dollars in foreign loans over
the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The loans, accounting for one fifth of the fixed assests of the
whole industry, were used to import advanced telecom products and
technologies, and beef up the domestic telecom systems, according
to the Beijing-based "People's Posts and Telecommunications News."
</P>
<P>
China's first telecom import item was a 10,000-line switching
system which was installed in Fuzhou, capital of east China's
Fujian Province, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last November, China had increased its phone
switching capacity to 100 million lines, 16 times that of 1982,
and signed up more than 6.5 million mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the import of sophisticated foreign technologies in
the past decade, China now has 11 telephone switch makers with a
combined annual production capacity of 25 million lines.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 million lines of program-controlled switchboards
manufactured by these plants have been installed on China's public
telecom networks, accounting for 53 per cent of the country's
total.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Panama Congress to Legislate on Canal Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian Legislative
Assembly is discussing a bill which will regulate the appointment
of executives and the functions of the new Panama Canal Board of
Directors.
</P>
<P>
The bill was presented to the Legislative Assembly by Foreign
Minister Ricardo Arias.
</P>
<P>
Arias said the Board of Directors would have 11 members, and
the president and nine officials would be appointed by the
government, and another by the plenary session of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The law rules, among other measures, that the highest authority
in the Panama canal will have autonomy and minister's rank.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that with this law, Panama was
preparing the juridical framework to administer the important
interoceanic waterway which will revert to Panama on the last day
of 1999 from the United States, its present administrator.
</P>
<P>
The bill also stipulates that the new Canal authority will
function as a regime of planning and financial administration for
three-year periods.
</P>
<P>
When the all-Panamanian administrative board assumes direction
of the Canal installations, the Canal budget will be autonomous
and not part of the state general budget.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Assembly will only be able to approve or reject
it, but not modify it in any way.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of toll fees, the bill said they would be
determined to cover the costs of the operation and modernization
of the waterway, as well as payments due to the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
Some Canal users have expressed concern about toll raises
announced for next year by the present Canal Board of Directors.

director of the Shanghai Geological Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
 The new rule is aimed at controlling ground subsidence,
according to a report.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, with a total of 18 clauses, will help protect
ground subsidence monitoring facilities and promote the research
into geological hazards, ``China Geology and Mineral Resources"
reported.
</P>
<P>
With a population of some 13 million, the municipality's
consumption of drinking water and that used in industry has been
on the rise over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has taken preventative steps to halt
subsidence, such as controlling the amount of groundwater taken
from the shallow layer, replenishing groundwater, and drawing
water from a deep stratum.

<HEADLINE> Paper Packaging Industry Bridges Gap Between Shenzhen, HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The paper packaging industry
in China's first special economic zone of Shenzhen plays a vital
role in promoting the city's economic links with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has 700 packaging firms, accounting for half of the
total of Guangdong Province, where the city is located.
</P>
<P>
The annual output value of the industry in the city tops five
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
About ten percent of the city's paper packaging products are
exported to Europe, America, Japan and southeast Asia, while the
rest are packaging materials for export goods manufactured in
Shenzhen and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Packaging industry started in Shenzhen in the 1980s, when
95 percent of Hong Kong's packaging manufacturers had to move to
Shenzhen, as a result of skyrocketing land prices and expensive
labor services in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has made enormous investment in Shenzhen's packaging
industry and most of the city's goods orders are from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the packaging materials for the two
places are made in Shenzhen. And the ratio will shoot up sharply
after Hong Kong returns to the embrace of the motherland in July
next year.

<HEADLINE> Business News in Brief in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are business news
in brief in the Philippines today:
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Bank of the Philippines is lifting the ceiling
on domestic borrowings of foreign companies starting January.
According to an original rule enacted in 1977, foreign firms in
the country were required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of
7:3 or 6:4, depending on their industry category. This determined
the amount of loanable funds these firms can source from local
bank and nonbanks. With this rule repealed, foreign firms will now
be able to compete on equal footing with their local counterparts
for resources in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Bank of the Philippines said in its year-end
report that heavy private capital inflows and increased
remittances from overseas Filipino workers are expected to boost
the country's balance of payment surplus to four billion U.S.
dollars this year, up by more than 500 percent from 631 million
U.S. dollars last year. However, the bank said the country's
current account deficit is to widen this year to an equivalent of
4.2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) from 2.6 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Investments registered with the country's economic zones for
the year have soared to 65.3 billion pesos (2.5 billion U.S.
dollars), up by 24.3 percent from last year. However, the
Philippine Economic Zone Authority said the figure is still 14
percent below its 75 billion peso (2.86 billion U.S. dollar)
projection for the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, north China, has turned itself into the country's second
largest energy base, "Economic Information News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The region, the country's second largest coal producer after
Shanxi Province, is capable of producing 64 million tons of raw
coal a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is able to produce 1.76 million tons of crude oil
and generate more than 28 billion kilowatt hours of electricity
annually.
</P>
<P>
One third of the electricity produced by the region is sent to
northeast China, Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan cities, and even to
the country of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, one fourth of Beijing's power supplies comes
from the region.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has given priority to the development of energy
industry by giving preferential treatment in funding and
policies. Over the past five years, the region's output value
from the energy industry grew at an annual rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's biggest open-cut coal mine, Asia's largest
thermal power station, and several oilfields are under
construction in the region.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Ways to Reduce After-Quake Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The State Seismological Bureau
held a three-day conference in Shanghai on anti-earthquake
emergency measures in large Chinese cities, according to China
Daily today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 government officials and seismologists gathered
to discuss ways to reduce damages after a possible earthquake hits
a big city during the conference, which closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China Daily noted that the conference is the first of the kind
held since the founding of new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The conference participants have shared their experiences in
quake disaster reduction. They praised Baotou, a big industrial
city in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, for its post-quake
recovery.
</P>
<P>
On May 3, a quake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale jolted
areas west of Baotou, killing 26 people, injuring some 400
people and leaving 500,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia and Baotou governments have made great
efforts to reconstruct the damaged city and all 500,000 people
have left the makeshift shelters to move into houses equipped with
heating systems.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been paying close attention to the
emergency anti-quake work. The State Council has worked out a
10-year plan on earthquake disaster reduction, under which all
Chinese large and medium-sized cities should suffer reasonably
small property damages and casualties after a quake with a
Richter scale magnitude of 6 or more.
</P>
<P>
So far, 20 central government ministries and commissions, 23
provinces and 15 provincial capital cities have mapped out
emergency plans to deal with any possible earthquake.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Control Makes Progress in Songhua River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin and
Heilongjiang provinces have improved pollution control in the
Songhua river, one of the country's seven major rivers, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the Jilin Chemical Industrial Group and the
Jilin Paper Mill have spent more than 100 million yuan in
building and expanding sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province, has completed a major
waste-water treatment project.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the 1,840-kilometer-long Songhua River has
been contaminated by industrial waste water and untreated
household sewage.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Songhua was seriously
polluted by mercury and people's health was harmed by mercury
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
After decades of pollution treatment and preventive measures,
the sources of mercury pollution were effectively controlled.
</P>
<P>
Although mercury pollution was under control, other pollution
sources, like coal-fired power stations, textile-dyeing mills and
paper mills, remained a threat.
</P>
<P>
Cities in the Songhua valley also discharge large quantities of
untreated household sewage into the river.
</P>
<P>
Toxic substances in the untreated waste water have damaged the
river's aquatic resources.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1950s the river teemed with fish, but today few fish
remain.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution is also endangering drinking-water supplies for
many cities, including Harbin.
</P>
<P>
Four major construction projects by Songhua Lake, in the river
valley and near Jilin, have occupied or plan to occupy a total of
6.15 hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
Due to the destruction of forests for construction projects,
soil erosion has left 822.32 square kilometers of land barren,
16.2 percent of the total landspace in the lake area.
</P>
<P>
Jilin province has implemented regulations to enforce stricter
controls on construction projects around the lake, and initial
success has been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Early Development of "Death Canyons" in Mt. Changbai Urged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Mention Ganfanpen to people
in northeast China and they quiver. It's a place where few humans
have dared to tread and lived to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
Ganfanpen in Jilin Province, is known as China's 'death
canyon', an inland Bermuda Triangle where mysterious happenings
defy the laws of science.
</P>
<P>
Experienced hunters and collectors of precious ginseng have
headed into the arms of Ganfanpen, and never been seen again.
</P>
<P>
Compasses, a vital lifesaver for explorers, are useless in
death canyon - the needle will go haywire. And a bizarre
phenomenon disorientates people and affects their memories. They end
up going round in circles, unable to escape again to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the dangers, tourism experts believe that the
canyons could become a money spinning tourism attraction for China.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the mystery and the magic of Ganfanpen,
situated in the Changbai Mountains, could lure visitors to
experience one of the world's most unique attractions.
</P>
<P>
Ganfanpen, which was named by local residents, is a series of
special canyons consisting of similar mountains and gullies in
deep primeval forests in Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Even experienced local people often lose their way. People in
the canyons often head in the opposite direction to the correct
way, and no matter how far they go, they inevitably return to the
original place, unable to find a way out of a cruel maze.

Compasses also indicate wrong directions in the canyons.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that Ganfanpen, with its rarely seen
circular canyons without cliffs, are mysterious prehistoric canyon
relics.
</P>
<P>
Other experts claim that the canyons were shaped by falling
ancient meteorites. As the space-invading rocks formed strong
magnetic fields, the human biological clock becomes imbalanced,
and people's memories are disordered, causing visitors to lose
their way.
</P>
<P>
Several death canyons have been discovered in Changbai
Mountains, with the most famous located in Jiangyuan County,
126.50 degrees east longitude and 42 degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
The grand canyon, 20 kilometers long and 15 kilometers in
width, occupies a space of 300 square kilometers. The basin-shaped
canyon groups together 81 small basins.
</P>
<P>
The canyon is surrounded by many forest-covered mountains,
without a main peak.
</P>
<P>
As very few people have ventured into the canyon in thousands
of years, primeval forests are still well preserved, with many
wild beasts living there.
</P>
<P>
According to an old man living near the canyon, during the
eight-year Anti-Japanese War (1937 to 1945), an Anti-Japanese
troop stored their weapons and food in one canyon, and over 100
Japanese soldiers and their puppet army pursued them.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the old man said, all of the enemy troops died in
the canyon after losing their way, and two planes, sent by the
Japanese to rescue them also crashed to the ground when they flew
over the canyon.

<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 21 health promotion
clinics opened in the Chinese capital Thursday to provide guidance
on chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
A municipal committee of leading consultants in health
promotion was also launched yesterday, which is composed 18
experts from major hospitals in the city.
</P>
<P>
All the clinics and the experts are approved by the local
health bureau. They are part of a World Bank-backed program of
chronic disease prevention and control, according to today's China

</P>
<P>
Each of the clinics will be part of a local hospital and will
have equipment for speedy testing of blood sugar level and blood
pressure, plus information leaflets for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Experts will be on site to help diagnose disease and give
advice.
</P>
<P>
The local health bureau hopes to reform residents' unhealthy
living habits through various activities and to cut down the
incidence of chronic diseases in the city.
</P>
<P>
As in other Chinese cities, chronic illnesses, including
vascular diseases of the heart or brain and malignant tumors,
have become the major health threats in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that deaths from such chronic ailments
accounted for more than 64 percent of deaths from illness in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Riots Hit Tasikmalaya, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in
Tasikmalaya, West Java, Indonesia, have been on a rampage through
the town since Thursday morning and in the process damaged or
destroyed a number of cars, shops, churches and local
administration buildings.
</P>
<P>
The street actions were still going on Thursday afternoon with
the material toll reported to be at least five churches and two
cars damaged, official Antara news agency reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported the rioters had set fire to shops and
elementary school buildings and damaged the local police
headquarters and legislative council.
</P>
<P>
But until Thursday afternoon there was no report of human
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Dudung Abdul Halim, chairman of the Tasikmalaya chapter of the
Council of Indonesian Ulemas (MUI), meanwhile expressed his deep
regret as the riot was apparently related to an incident last
December 23 in which a few local police officers had maltreated
three Islamic preachers.
</P>
<P>
From Ciamis, capital of another district in West Java, it was
reported security personnel Thursday blocked the road connecting
Ciamis with Cijolang village to its east to prevent hundreds of
people from entering the town. Cijolang village is located on the
border between West Java and Central Java.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the riot, shops in Tasikmalaya and Ciamis
have been closed.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the mass violence was triggered by an
incident that occurred on December 23 involving four local
policemen, three Islamic preachers and students of the Condong
Islamic Boarding School in the Cibeureum sub-district.
</P>
<P>
The policemen had allegedly beaten up the three Islamic
preachers for having physically punished a student at the Condong
Boarding School accused of pilfering school property. The erring
student happened to be the son of a local police officer.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic boarding school teachers reportedly struck the
student's legs with a palm leaf rib and subsequently threw him
into a pond. The student was said to have stolen school property
at least three times.
</P>
<P>
on December 24, chief of the Tasikmalaya district police Lt.
Col. Suherman offered apologies to the Islamic preachers and
visited a number of other boarding schools to explain what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
Suherman also ordered the arrest of the four high-handed
policemen and a spokesman for the West Java provincial police
command, while Lt. Col. Istanto Judihardjo gave the assurance that
the guilty police officers would be duly disciplined.
</P>
<P>
Suherman's efforts and Judihardjo's assurance, however, proved
unable to prevent the happenings from eliciting the negative mass
reactions.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Should Neither Arbitrate Nor Mediate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Senior Yugoslav officials
said today that the recent visit of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to Belgrade was neither to
arbitrate nor to mediate in current political events in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The visit of an OSCE delegation last weekend "is a
confirmation of Yugoslavia's efforts to establish good relations
with the international community," Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic and Deputy Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic of
Yugoslavia told foreign reporters at a joint press conference in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Sainovic said Felipe Gonzales, head of the OSCE delegation and
the organization's representatives, had come to Yugoslavia not to
mediate nor to arbitrate the political developments in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno has been staging rallies and
demonstrations since November 19 to protest the annulment of
results of the local election in which it claimed victory in most
major cities in Serbia. The daily protests in Belgrade and
throughout Serbia have caused a political crisis in Yugoslavia and
aroused concerns from the international community.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Serbian government had invited an
OSCE team to visit Belgrade last weekend to find out the truth of
the election dispute between the government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Sainovic said many foreign representatives who had come to
Yugoslavia often changed their views under pressure from different
centers of power, despite what they had seen in the field.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Gonzales would reach conclusions in
accordance with what he had seen and what he had said during talks
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Jovanovic added that the idea to invite
the OSCE delegation was to contribute to normalization of relations
between Yugoslavia and the international community and speed up an
already advanced process of normalization of Yugoslavia's
relations with the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the visit will be conducive to that aim," said
Jovanovic, who also expressed the hope that the OSCE report would
reflect that principled stand.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE delegation is expected to submit a fact-finding report
to the Vienna-based organization Friday.
</P>
<P>
"However, should the case be otherwise, Yugoslavia will retain
its principled stands, because the issues concerned are the
internal questions of a sovereign state to be settled solely
within the institution of the political system, i.e., without
outside mediation or arbitration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to deal with our problems within the valid
constitutional order, because only these institutions provide for
democratic solutions," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all ambitions and wishes directed at seeking
solutions outside the institutions of the political system,
regardless of whether coming from within the country or outside,
were simply not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Serbian government supporters and opposition
coalition followers fought against each other with sticks and
flagpoles, causing injuries to dozens of people and further
strained relations between the government and the opposition.
Zajedno leaders have said they would not open dialogue with the
government until the annulled election results had been
reinstated.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Minister: Citizens Fed up with Daily Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Interior Minister
Vukasin Jokanovic said today that Belgrade citizens are fed up
with daily rallies and protests because they cannot go where they
want or use city traffic or even their own cars.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Serbian Interior Ministry statement that
police will no longer allow the arbitrary blocking of traffic,
Jokanovic said at a federal assembly session, "There are many
places where peaceful demonstrations can be held, and sidewalks
are for walks."
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Interior Ministry said Wednesday night that the
police will not allow the arbitrary blocking of traffic and
demonstration organizers are obliged to use their right to
peaceful demonstrations only in keeping with the laws.
</P>
<P>
It also underscored that police will intervene in agreement
with regulations and their duty in implementing the law and
protecting the rights of citizens in the event of breaches of the
law and further violations of public law and order.
</P>
<P>
The new measure was taken after incidents occurred Tuesday when
government supporters and opposition coalition followers clashed
in central Belgrade, causing injuries to dozens of people from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno has organized demonstrations
and rallies over the past 37 days to protest the alleged election
fraud by the government, blocking street traffic in Belgrade and
affecting local people's normal life.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the police did not come into the streets of
Belgrade earlier Tuesday, but only after incidents began,
Jokanovic said the police came out "the moment they deemed it
necessary, and they counted on the citizens having opted for
peaceful manifestations and rallies."
</P>
<P>
Jokanovic also stressed that police would never use force
against citizens who protest peacefully.
</P>
<P>
No one, not even the Belgrade police chief who is in charge of
regulating city traffic, would undertake anything outside the law,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, hundreds of riot police were deployed in the
streets to maintain smooth traffic and guard against possible
further clashes.

CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt no longer needs credit from international
financial establishments thanks to the rich influx of foreign
investments and improved economic situation in the country
following 15 years of economic reforms, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Weekly Al Ahram which was
published today, Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Youssef
Boutros-Ghali said that foreign investment this year amounted to 3
billion U.S. dollars, six times of the projected figure. In 1997,
it will reach 5 billion dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the International Monetary Fund has recognized Egypt as
a good performer in the world economic community.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Egypt no longer needs loans from outside
financial institutions especially when the economic growth rate
has reached a level making the soft loans unnecessary, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign currency reserve has risen to 19 billion
dollars, with stability facilitated in the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Iraq will buy at least 21 million U.S. dollars worth
of Egyptian vegetable oil and soap in one of its first purchases
of food and other daily necessities since resuming oil exports
recently.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) today reported that
the Egyptian Holding Company for Food Industries has just
concluded a deal on providing Iraq with the edible oil.
</P>
<P>
The 8 million U.S. dollar deal, which is to be signed next
week, will bring the total sum of agreements between Egypt and
Iraq up to 21 million dollars, the MENA quoted a business source
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The company signed two days ago a 13-million-dollar deal to
export vegetable oil and soap to Iraq under the United Nations
oil-for-food agreement.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 countries and regions have offered to sell food and
medicine to Baghdad, following the six years of international
embargo since the 1990-1991 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cairo -- Egypt and Saudi Arabia signed agreements on
investments worth more than one billion U.S. dollars during a
visit by an Egyptian delegation to Saudi Arabia recently,
according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Public Sector Minister Atef Obied, who headed the delegation,
told reporters here today that the biggest agreement involves
setting up a joint holding company with a capital of 500 million
dollars to invest in tourism, construction and factories in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Two other joint companies were agreed upon to produce steel and
glass, he said.
