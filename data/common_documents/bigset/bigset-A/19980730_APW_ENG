Japan's `genius' chimpanzee gives birth to stillborn baby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ To the disappointment of animal researchers,
Japan's ``genius'' chimpanzee has given birth to a stillborn baby,
a researcher said Thursday.
	   The chimpanzee, named Ai, gave birth early Wednesday, said
Kiyoaki Matsubayashi, an associate professor at Kyoto University's
Primate Research Institute in Inuyama, central Japan,
	   An autopsy showed there was a possibility the baby _ a male and
posthumously named ``Atom,'' _ had died inside its mother's womb
after suffering brain damage caused by unknown pressure,
Matsubayashi said.
	   Scientists at the institute had been hoping since the pregnancy
was confirmed in March to study the baby, anxious to see if its
mother's advanced mental capabilities could be passed on to her
offspring.
	   The 21-year-old Ai can recognize 100 Japanese characters and
other symbols. She had been artificially inseminated nearly every
month since December 1995, before finally getting pregnant.
	   Ai has also learned some abstract skills. For example, she match
the Japanese characters for ``hot'' and ``cold'' with the one for
``water.''
	   She can also recognize colors. When shown a red apple, she can
choose the red figure from a group of variously colored shapes.
	   Ai is similar to chimpanzees in Tanzania and other East African
countries that use leaves and twigs as tools to drink water and
scoop termites from underground nests.
	   Matsubayashi said research on Ai's abilities would continue as
would attempts to have her become pregnant and give birth again.

Japan's Hashimoto resigns; Obuchi to win Parliament vote for prime
</HEADLINE>
minister &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with voting starting in lower house; Lower house
results possible by 0440 GMT; Declaration of new prime minister
expected by 0730 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi faced a vote
for prime minister in Parliament on Thursday that was nearly
certain to put him at the helm of Japan as it struggles with
political turmoil and its worst recession since the end of World
War II.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party stalwart was expected to win the
vote in the 500-member lower house. The upper house threatened to
choose an opposition leader for the premier _ a move not likely to
derail his quest since the lower house can impose its choice.
	   Voting in the lower house started shortly after 1 p.m. (0400
GMT).
	   The soft-spoken Obuchi, 61, would succeed Ryutaro Hashimoto and
inherit Japan's stumbling economy, a banking system wallowing in
debt, divisions in his own party and an increasingly popular
opposition.
	   Hashimoto and his Cabinet resigned en masse Thursday morning,
paving the way for a vote in Parliament. He announced on July 13
that he would quit to take responsibility for the humiliating LDP
defeat in upper house elections the day before.
	   Obuchi, widely considered a cautious leader with few innovative
ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, boosted his standing
with the markets this week by tapping former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   ``I'm very thankful to have a veteran's wisdom and experience
... to overcome this difficult situation,'' Obuchi told reporters
after meeting with Miyazawa, 78, on Wednesday afternoon after the
elder statesman agreed to take the job.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993 and is an architect of the government's plan to
bail out its troubled banking system, triggered rallies in the
Tokyo markets this week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning share prices
moved higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a
sign the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   The ruling party is quickly losing the faith of the voters. The
party lost 13 seats in July 12 elections for the upper house, and
the party's approval ratings are at an all-time low.
	   Obuchi said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert in finance
and economics, to lead a clean up of Japan's troubled financial
sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left over from
the collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime stalwart in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``Miyazawa is not the guy who is
going to clean up, or radically change the system. He is the
ultimate insider.''
	   The national Asahi newspaper on Thursday called on Miyazawa to
account for missteps during his earlier terms as finance minister
blamed for inflating the speculative real estate bubble of the
1980s _ which burst earlier this decade, saddling the economy with
troubles.
	   ``Miyazawa is largely responsible for the economic mismanagement
that got the country into its present predicament,'' the newspaper
said in an editorial.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. Taichi Sakaiya, a writer and
former bureaucrat, was expected to be named director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A powerful earthquake shook part of
eastern Indonesia early Thursday, 200 miles (320 kilometers) from
an earthquake that caused a devastating tsunami a week ago.
	   There were no reports of damage or casualties in the tremor in
the remote jungles of the province of Irian Jaya, said Fauzi of the
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency in Jakarta.
	   Fauzi said the quake had a magnitude of 6.0. However, the U.S.
Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado. said the magnitude was 6.6.
There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
	   The epicenter of the quake was in a sparsely populated area, 125
miles (200 kilometers) west of the provincial capital of Jayapura.
It struck about 3 a.m. local time, or 1800 GMT.
	   The quake was 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of a magnitude 7.1
earthquake on July 17, which generated a tsunami in Sissano, Papua
New Guinea, that killed at least 1,600 people and caused extensive
damage.
	   Indonesia and Papua New Guinea share New Guinea Island. Irian
Jaya province comprises the western part.

American men swimmers beaten by Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late swimming, boxing, figure skating; CLARIFIES
that Davis lost 200-meter by .23 seconds &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ U.S. men have never lost a 400-meter
freestyle relay in the Olympics. At the Goodwill Games, it was the
scene of a German win for a narrow dual-meet victory over the
Americans.
	   The United States led by three points going into the final race.
But the relays are worth seven points for the winner and none for
the loser, and the Germans' time of 3 minutes, 21.48 seconds _ 1.25
ahead of the Americans _ decided a 63-59 victory.
	   Aimo Heilmann had a body-length lead over Josh Davis, a triple
gold medalist in the 1996 Olympics, after the first leg, and the
other three U.S. swimmers couldn't catch up.
	   Davis, of Austin, Texas, also finished last in the 100 freestyle
and second in the 200 Wednesday night.
	   The Americans led most of the meet thanks to breaststroke
specialist Kurt Grote.
	   Grote, of Palo Alto, California, won both the 100- and 200-meter
breaststroke and the breaststroke leg on the winning U.S. medley
relay.
	   ``I was hoping it wouldn't be this close up until the
(freestyle) relay,'' Grote said. ``I have confidence in our relay
team, but it would have been better to have had a bigger lead going
into it.''
	   Even Grote's desperately needed 17 points were not enough as the
Germans kept it close all night.
	   Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles got the U.S. team off to a good
start in the medley relay with a games record on the backstroke
leg, but the world champion was upset in the individual 100
backstroke as Stev Theloke of lowered Krayzelburg's record set only
a few minutes before.
	   Then Grote set a games record in the 100 breaststroke and
captured the 200 by more than three seconds.
	   The race that turned the meet was the 200. Davis won an Olympic
gold medal in the event, but this time he lost by .23 seconds to
Michael Kiedel, who also swam anchor on the Germans' winning
freestyle relay.
	   A U.S. highlight was the victory in the 200 individual medley by
Ron Karnaugh, a 32-year-old doctor from Maplewood, New Jersey.
Karnaugh set a games record of 2:02.18.
	   In the other men's dual meet, the World All-Stars defeated
Russia 66-56 behind games records in the 100- and 200-meter
butterfly by Denis Sylantiyev of Ukraine. Pieter van den Hoogenband
of the Netherlands set a U.S. open record of 1:47.34 in the 200
freestyle for the world team.
	   At Nassau Coliseum, figure skating began, with former world
champion Todd Eldredge taking the lead after the men's short
program ahead of Russia's Alexei Urmanov and Evgeni Plushenko.
Takeshi Honda of Japan was fourth, followed by Americans Michael
Weiss and Timothy Goebel in fifth and sixth place.
	   Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia led after the
short program in pairs, ahead of Olympic gold medalists Oksana
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev of Russia. Russians Anjelika Krylova
and Oleg Ovsiannikov were in front following the compulsory dance.
	   At Madison Square Garden, a one-day U.S. charge ended abruptly
in the semifinals. Bantamweight Waldemar Font of Cuba outpointed
Antonio Rodriguez, of Waianae, Hawaii, 21-5; another bantamweight,
Jose Santa Cruz, a 17-year-old from Monterey Park, California, lost
7-4 to Uzbekistan's Timur Tulyakov; and welterweight Miguel Espino,
of North Hollywood, California, was shut out 17-0, by Russia's
Andrei Mishin.
	   Central Park was back in Goodwill action as women's beach
volleyball opened, and defending champions Karolyn Kirby and Liz
Masakayan of the United States lost to Australia's Pauline Manser
and Kerri Pottharst, 15-10.
	   The Americans trailed 6-0 and 10-2 before running off six points
in a row to get within 10-8, and trailed 12-10 before Manser hit
three straight kills.
	   The Australians also got the benefit of two calls against Kirby
and Masakayan, including a reversal of a point that would have
pulled them within 10-9.
	   ``That was pretty crucial,'' Masakayan said.
	   The world's top-ranked women's team, Adriana Behar and Shelda
Bede of Brazil, beat Canada's Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont
15-1. Lisa Arce and Holly McPeak of the United States beat Laura
Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy 15-4. Maike Friedrichsen
and Danja Musch of German opened the tournament with a 15-4 victory
over Eva Celbova and Sona Dosoudilova of the Czech Republic.

Democracy leader returns home after five nights at roadblock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest government statement, some details changed
from earlier statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Described by colleagues as ill and
running low on food, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi returned home
Wednesday night after being stopped at a military roadblock for six
days, the government said.
	   A statement said top leaders of her political party went to the
roadblock site west of the capital, Yangon, and tried in vain to
persuade her ``to be less rigid, and give up her belligerent
stand.''
	   Later that night, after another ``follow up'' and the
implementation of a ``second phase,'' Suu Kyi returned to her
residence in Yangon at 10:20 p.m. (1450 GMT).
	   It was not clear whether she was forced to return home or left
the roadblock voluntarily.
	   The statement said the chairman of her National League for
Democracy Aung Shwe, Central Executive Committee members Than Tun
and Tin Oo, and her private doctor, Tin Myo Win, tried to persuade
Suu Kyi to end the stand-off.
	   Prior to her return, the military regime told diplomats in
Yangon that she had no health problems, and that the democracy
leader's trip outside the Myanmar capital had been stopped to avert
possible disturbances, diplomatic sources said.
	   Government officials stopped Suu Kyi, an associate and two
drivers Friday morning as the group headed toward Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) away to meet members of her party.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner refused to return to Yangon,
and the military would not let her proceed. This was her third
attempt this month to travel to the provinces.
	   Two of Suu Kyi's personal physicians, who examined her Tuesday
in her car, parked on a narrow bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west
of the capital, said she was showing signs of dehydration.
	   A press release Wednesday from her political party said her
health was ``failing.''
	   The military government, which has stopped her every time, said
she was trying to foment unrest.
	   After the briefing in Yangon, one diplomat quoted senior
military officer Lt. Col. Hla Min as saying: ``There is no health
problem with Aung San Suu Kyi. Necessary measures are being taken
in cooperation with the NLD leaders in Yangon to look after her
health.''
	   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hla Min
did not respond to questions by some ambassadors on whether they
would be allowed to visit her.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors asked that they be allowed to monitor her
condition twice a day and that she be provided with facilities to
wash, the NLD statement said.
	   The military said the doctors could visit Wednesday, and it has
provided her with drinking water.
	   ``It is the hope of the government that (Suu Kyi) will realize
the folly of her uncompromising and belligerent stand,'' a military
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The government refused a request by seven Western nations that
U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar also known as Burma, be
allowed to see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional grouping.
	   The military has allowed her to travel outside Yangon only once
since her release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She
visited a Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's Yangon home, refusing journalists entry
and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this week the United
States will hold Myanmar's military directly responsible for Suu
Kyi's health and welfare.
	   And at the Manila meeting this week, foreign ministers from
Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European
Union pressured Myanmar to end human rights abuses and let Suu Kyi
proceed.

United, Fusion, MetroStars and Burn post wins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Carey Talley scored the deciding shootout goal
and D.C. United, which blew a two-goal lead, came back for a 3-2
victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny in Major League Soccer on
Wednesday night.
	   D.C. United got two goals from Marco Etcheverry but failed to
clinch a playoff spot with two months left in the regular season
when Mutiny midfielder Mauricio Ramos tied the game in the 88th
minute.
	   United (19-5), which outscored the Mutiny 4-3 in the shootout,
has won six straight games.
	   Tampa Bay (6-17) led the shootout 3-2 when D.C.'s John Harkes
tied the score and it remained tied when United keeper Scott
Garlick stopped Paul Dougherty's attempt.
 &UR; Fusion 3, Crew 2
	   In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Marcelo Herrera scored two goals
and Brazilian forward Paulinho added two assists as the Miami
Fusion beat the Columbus Crew 3-2 on Wednesday night, its fourth
consecutive victory.
	   The victory was the Fusion's second straight without all-star
midfielder Carlos Valderrama, who was benched after skipping two
recent practices under new coach Ivo Wortmann.
	   Valderrama, who was fined dlrs 10,000 by Major League Soccer on
Tuesday, is expected to rejoin the Fusion after Sunday's all-star
game at Orlando.
	   Miami (10-11) is in fourth place in the MLS Eastern Conference.
The Fusion was last in the six-team conference before Wortmann took
over when Cacho Cordoba was fired last Friday.
 &UR; MetroStars 3, Wizards 2
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Tab Ramos and Giovanni Savarese
scored shootout goals and goalkeeper Tony Meola made two big saves
late in regulation and two more in the shootout Wednesday night as
New York-New Jersey beat the Kansas City Wizards 3-2.
	   The MetroStars (12-9) won their third straight game and are
three games over .500 for the first time in franchise history.
	   Meola sent the game to a shootout by making a kick save on Matt
McKeon in the 80th minute and then coming quickly off his line in
the 86th minute to force Mark Chung to shoot wide after the Wizards
striker had broken through the defense.
	   In the shootout, Meola allowed a goal by Precki but saved shots
by Brian Tinsley and Paul Rideout while forcing Chung and Digital
Takawira to shoot wide.
 &UR; Burn 3, Galaxy 0
	   In Dallas, Jason Kreis, Mickey Trotman and Dante Washington
scored goals and Mark Dodd recorded his third shutout of the season
as the Dallas Burn beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 3-0 Wednesday night.
	   Kreis opened the scoring in the sixth minute and Trotman and
Washington both scored in the second half on assists by defender
Jorge Rodriguez.
	   Los Angeles (16-6), which is in first place in the Western
Conference, has lost three straight games and four of five, scoring
just five goals in that span. The Galaxy has been shut out three
times over the five games.
	   The Burn (11-11) are 22-2 when Kreis scores, including 6-0 this
season. The team is 14-0 when Washington scores.
	   The game was played before a crowd of 9,720 in 100-degree
Fahrenheit (38-degree Celsius) temperatures.

More rains threaten flood-ravaged China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Millions of people kept vigil over sodden Yangtze
River embankments threatened with collapse, and weather forecasts
warned of further heavy rains Thursday in flood-ravaged areas of
China.
	   Health authorities, meanwhile, called for vigilance against
outbreaks of disease in flooded areas. Agricultural experts were
sent to some of the worst-hit provinces to help farmers get back on
their feet as soon as possible, the official newspaper China Daily
said.
	   Houses were flooded up to their eaves in central Hubei province.
	   Flooding already has killed 1,145 people in China this year and
the death toll is expected to rise as more reports drift in from
stricken areas. Floodwaters along the Yangtze have reached levels
unseen in more than four decades, threatening tens of millions of
people and rich farmland along the mighty river, the world's
third-longest.
	   A flood crest, the second-largest on the Yangtze since flooding
in 1954 killed more than 30,000 people, reached eastern Anhui on
Wednesday and was headed for neighboring Jiangsu, the China Daily
said.
	   Both provinces had already declared states of emergency.
	   One million soldiers and civilians were working night and day to
shore up a 143-kilometer (88-mile) stretch of levees in Anhui, the
China Daily said.
	   In Jiujiang city in neighboring Jiangxi province, which also had
declared a state of emergency, 3 million people were sent to guard
levees as the flood peak began passing through Wednesday, the
city's Flood Control Headquarters said.
	   Millions of people were guarding hundreds of kilometers (miles)
of dikes, watching for leaks that could cause water-soaked levees
to collapse, the China Daily said.
	   The floods have caused losses estimated at 39.7 billion yuan
(dlrs 4.78 billion) in Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi _ among the
hardest-hit provinces, the China Daily said. Worst hit was Hunan,
with losses of 15.15 billion yuan (dlrs 1.83 billion), the
newspaper said.
	   Wen Kegang, director of the State Meteorology Bureau, said heavy
rains were expected in flooded areas in coming days, the China
Daily said.
	   China's president, Jiang Zemin, spoke to Wen on Wednesday about
weather conditions in the swamped middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze, the newspaper said.
	   Heavy rains were expected in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces on
Thursday and Friday, the bureau said. In Jiangxi, heavy rains fell
Wednesday but were expected to diminish, said an official at the
provincial weather bureau, who gave his surname, Qi.
	   Meanwhile, water purification facilities, medicine and food will
be bought with U.S. dlrs 663,000 in donations collected by the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
the China Daily said.
	   While no epidemics of disease have been reported, the Ministry
of Health has asked medical workers to stay at their posts, the
China Daily said. It said around 100,000 medical workers have been
sent to flooded areas.

The 252-member upper house was also voting, and could choose

country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War

Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.

	   Obuchi was to name his Cabinet after being officially declared
prime minister later Thursday.
	   Widely considered a cautious leader with few innovative ideas to
reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Obuchi boosted his standing
with the markets this week by tapping former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   ``I'm very thankful to have a veteran's wisdom and experience
... to overcome this difficult situation,'' Obuchi told reporters
after meeting with Miyazawa, 78, on Wednesday afternoon after the
elder statesman agreed to take the job.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993 and is an architect of the government's plan to
bail out its troubled banking system, triggered rallies in the
Tokyo markets this week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning share prices
moved higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a
sign the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.

	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   The ruling party is quickly losing the faith of the voters. The
party lost 13 seats in July 12 elections for the upper house, and
the party's approval ratings are at an all-time low.
	   Obuchi said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert in finance
and economics, to lead a clean up of Japan's troubled financial
sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left over from
the collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime stalwart in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``Miyazawa is not the guy who is
going to clean up, or radically change the system. He is the
ultimate insider.''
	   The national Asahi newspaper on Thursday called on Miyazawa to
account for missteps during his earlier terms as finance minister
blamed for inflating the speculative real estate bubble of the
1980s _ which burst earlier this decade, saddling the economy with
troubles.
	   ``Miyazawa is largely responsible for the economic mismanagement
that got the country into its present predicament,'' the newspaper
said in an editorial.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statements from Albright in Sydney about Suu Kyi
being forced back in grafs 5-8, party history of nonviolence graf

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Described by colleagues as ill and
running low on food, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi returned home
Wednesday night after being stopped at a military roadblock for six
days, the government said.
	   A statement said top leaders of her political party went to the
roadblock site west of the capital, Yangon, and tried in vain to
persuade her ``to be less rigid, and give up her belligerent
stand.''
	   Later that night, after another ``follow up'' and the
implementation of a ``second phase,'' Suu Kyi returned to her
residence in Yangon at 10:20 p.m. (1450 GMT).
	   It was not clear whether she was forced to return home or left
the roadblock voluntarily.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, speaking in Sydney,
accused the military of forcing Suu Kyi back to Yangon against her
will.
	   The opposition party leader ``was all off a sudden taken in her
car by a military driver back to Yangon and thereby forbidden from
exercising a basic human right, which is the ability to travel
freely in your own country,'' Albright said. ``This is an
unacceptable violation of human rights.''
	   American officials accompanying Albright in Australia, said
their information came from on-the-scene diplomats in Yangon.
	   Albright said the move by the government ``will only contribute
to the further isolation of Burma.'' Myanmar is also known as Burma
and the U.S. government continues to use that name.
	   The government statement said the chairman of her National
League for Democracy Aung Shwe, Central Executive Committee members
Than Tun and Tin Oo, and her private doctor, Tin Myo Win, tried to
persuade Suu Kyi to end the standoff.
	   Prior to her return, the military regime told diplomats in
Yangon that she had no health problems, and that the democracy
leader's trip outside the Myanmar capital had been stopped to avert
possible disturbances, diplomatic sources said.
	   Suu Kyi's party follows a policy of nonviolence, and no riots or
other disturbances have ever been associated with her trips or
public speeches.
	   Government officials stopped Suu Kyi, an associate and two
drivers Friday morning as the group headed toward Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) away to meet members of her party.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner refused to return to Yangon,
and the military would not let her proceed. This was her third
attempt this month to travel to the provinces.
	   Two of Suu Kyi's personal physicians, who examined her Tuesday
in her car, parked on a narrow bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west
of the capital, said she was showing signs of dehydration.
	   A press release Wednesday from her political party said her
health was ``failing.''
	   The military government, which has stopped her every time, said
she was trying to foment unrest.
	   After the briefing in Yangon, one diplomat quoted senior
military officer Lt. Col. Hla Min as saying: ``There is no health
problem with Aung San Suu Kyi.''
	   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hla Min
did not respond to questions by some ambassadors on whether they
would be allowed to visit her.
	   The government refused a request by seven Western nations that
U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar, also known as Burma, be
allowed to see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional grouping.
	   The military has allowed her to travel outside Yangon only once
since her release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She
visited a Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's Yangon home, refusing journalists entry
and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police in northeastern Thailand are
looking for a man whose tongue was bitten off by a 17-year-old
woman who says he tried to rape her, officers said Thursday.
	   Police in Mukdahan Province, 640 kilometers (397 miles)
northeast of Bangkok, said the teenager appeared at their station
with a piece of tongue she said she had ripped out of her
assailant's mouth.
	   Sgt. Thawil Champarat said dozens of men from Khampong Village,
where the alleged attack took place Monday, were rounded up,
brought before the village headman Tuesday and ordered to stick out
their tongues.
	   The sergeant said police were looking for Yongyuth Somkanay, who
had suddenly disappeared from the village and did not show up at
the tongue inspection.
	   The woman, who could not be identified because of her age, was
reported in good physical and mental condition.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi was approved as
Japan's next prime minister by Parliament's lower house Thursday,
putting him on the threshold of power in a country suffering its
worst recession in decades. Final confirmation was expected later
in the day.
	   Obuchi garnered 268 votes of the 497 ballots cast in lower
house, a comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority needed to
win. Opposition leader Naoto Kan was the runner-up in the lower
house poll, winning 164 votes.
	   No candidate won a majority in the first ballot in the
252-member upper house. Obuchi won the most votes, but the chamber
was expected to endorse Kan in the immediate second ballot. Obuchi,
however, was almost certain to become prime minister, since the
lower house has the power to overrule any upper house decision.
	   Obuchi, 61, who served as foreign minister until resigning that
post Thursday morning, would succeed Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was
forced to quit after voter outrage over the stumbling economy dealt
the ruling party a painful defeat in July 12 upper house elections.
	   The long-time Liberal Democratic Party stalwart was to take over
a country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with record-high unemployment and spiraling bankruptcies.
Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   Obuchi was to name his Cabinet after being officially declared
prime minister later Thursday.
	   Widely considered a cautious leader with few innovative ideas to
reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Obuchi boosted his standing
with the markets this week by tapping former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   ``I'm very thankful to have a veteran's wisdom and experience
... to overcome this difficult situation,'' Obuchi told reporters
after meeting with Miyazawa, 78, on Wednesday afternoon after the
elder statesman agreed to take the job.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993 and is an architect of the government's plan to
bail out its troubled banking system, triggered rallies in the
Tokyo markets this week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning share prices
moved higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a
sign the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   The ruling party is quickly losing the faith of the voters. The
party lost 13 seats in July 12 elections for the upper house, and
the party's approval ratings are at an all-time low.
	   Obuchi said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert in finance
and economics, to lead a clean up of Japan's troubled financial
sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left over from
the collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime stalwart in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``Miyazawa is not the guy who is
going to clean up, or radically change the system. He is the
ultimate insider.''
	   The national Asahi newspaper on Thursday called on Miyazawa to
account for missteps during his earlier terms as finance minister
blamed for inflating the speculative real estate bubble of the
1980s _ which burst earlier this decade, saddling the economy with
troubles.
	   ``Miyazawa is largely responsible for the economic mismanagement
that got the country into its present predicament,'' the newspaper
said in an editorial.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

Strongman holds talks with king; election opponents terrorized

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition activists were fleeing
from the provinces to the capital Thursday, terrorized by police
controlled by strongman Hun Sen following his victory in
parliamentary elections.
	   Hun Sen flew to the northern town of Siem Reap for talks with
King Norodom Sihanouk likely to focus on the formation of a new
government as disputes with opposition leaders threaten to plunge
the tragedy-mired country into more turmoil.
	   The opposition, led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son,
and Sam Rainsy are blaming their defeat on electoral fraud and
threaten to paralyze formation of a new government. Hun Sen says he
could change the constitution to ensure he rules unfettered for the
next five years.
	   Trying to divide the opposition, Hun Sen also said Wednesday he
would be willing to forge a coalition _ though not a co-premiership
_ with the prince, whom he deposed as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year.
	   Foreign observers who had monitored voting day and initial
counting said the election was free and fair enough to reflect the
broad will of the Cambodian people.
	   But the Asian Network for Free Elections, an independent
monitoring group that has more regional experience, and
human-rights groups claimed that opposition activists were being
terrorized when Hun Sen's victory became apparent.
	   At least 23 activists have fled to Phnom Penh from outlying
provinces, ANFREL told a news conference Thursday, and reports were
on the rise of other violence and intimidation following a brief
lull when the presence of foreign observers was greatest.
	   In many cases, police surrounded meetings at party offices and
attacked or threatened those attending.
	   ``If massive violence or retaliation occurs, it will undermine
the limited success of the election,'' said ANFREL member Nobuhiko
Suto.
	   ANFREL urged the international community to keep a close eye on
Cambodia until the transition to a new government is complete.
	   The security forces are controlled by Hun Sen and his Cambodian
People's Party. In the pre-election period, violence, including
murder, was widespread against opposition activists.
	   The Cambodian People's Party claimed a landslide win Monday, but
many Cambodians disbelieve the figures. Full official results are
not expected from the Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee
before Sunday.
	   The fastest, most reliable results are coming in from the top
independent election monitoring group, the Committee for Free and
Fair Elections in Cambodia.
	   COMFREL reported that with 90 percent of the ballots counted by
communal authorities nationwide, Hun Sen's party looked set to get
a maximum of 59 of the 122 National Assembly seats, followed by 45
for FUNCINPEC and 18 for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   The popular vote was breaking down at 41 percent for the CPP,
32.4 percent for FUNCINPEC and 14.4 percent for the Sam Rainsy
Party.
	   Under the constitution, the National Assembly must convene with
two-thirds of its members to confirm a new government. Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy have threatened a boycott until their demands are
met for a recount and new balloting in some areas.
	   Hun Sen threatened Wednesday to change the constitution to lower
the threshold to 50 percent-plus-one, but even then, with just 59
seats for the CPP, the assembly would be unable to meet.
	   Or, Hun Sen said, he could stay for the next five years at the
head of the old government the vote was supposed to replace.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993 backed up by
20,000 peacekeeping troops. Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985
under the harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer
Rouge, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war.
	   Hun Sen kept control over the army and last year deposed
Ranariddh in two days of fighting in the capital.

U.S. planning to ambush Australian wheat market: Fischer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer
Thursday accused the United States of planning to ``ambush'' an
important Australian export market with a big humanitarian gift of
wheat to Indonesia.
	   The gift would breach the spirit of a pledge President Clinton
made during a visit to Australia in 1996, that the United States
would not move in on Australian markets, Fischer said.
	   He said senior American officials had made it clear that
President Clinton's donation of 2.5 million (metric) tons of wheat
to the world would be used to open new export channels for American
farmers.
	   He said that if the United States sent 500,000 tons of its
planned wheat aid to Indonesia, that would distort Australia's
market there.
	   Indonesia was an important and growing market for Australian
wheat, he said.
	   ``This, sadly, is about export penetration,'' Fischer told
reporters.
	   ``It is the quantum, the intention and the direction which irks
the Australian government,'' he said. ``(Indonesia) is a very
significant market for Australia.''
	   Australian representatives will raise the issue with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the annual diplomatic and
defense talks due to be held in Sydney Friday.
	   Albright and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen will meet
their Australian counterparts for what are the two countries'
highest-level regular talks.
	   ``We want them to renew the President Clinton commitment not to
ambush our traditional markets,'' Fischer said.
	   Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday the United States had
insulted Australian farmers by moving to subsidize agricultural
exports to traditional Australian markets, and that he would raise
the issue with the U.S. delegation.

Gangsters arrested for murder, kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chinese police have arrested 13 more members of
a cross-border gang for allegedly kidnapping two Hong Kong
businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
205 million) ransom, murder and armed robbery, reports said
Thursday.
	   The arrests brought the total under arrest to 32. Eighteen
others, including the 43-year-old Hong Kong gang boss Cheung
Chi-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' were arrested last week. Another
member already is in jail for theft, China's official Xinhua news
agency reported.
	   The gang members have been charged with kidnapping two Hong Kong
businessmen, Xinhua said. Although no official information was ever
released on the kidnapping, Hong Kong papers said they were
believed to be tycoons from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property
development companies.
	   Gangsters also have been charged with murdering a mainland
Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robbery at
seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, the news
agency said.
	   Police have seized about 40 million yuan (U.S. dlrs 4.8 million)
in cash, 11 vehicles, 50 properties worth 40 million yuan (U.S.
dlrs 4.8 million), guns and explosives, Xinhua reported. It said
the gang laundered the ransom money by buying mainland properties.
	   The members include 18 from Hong Kong and 14 from mainland
China, it said. They will be tried on the mainland, where they
could face the death penalty, it said.
	   Xinhua said that in 1995, gang members and Hong Kong gunman Yip
Kai-foon _ now serving a long jail sentence in Hong Kong _
kidnapped a businessman in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin,
and that the man suffocated on the way to the southern city of
Guangzhou. It said they also killed a Hong Kong man the same year.
	   This January, two men allegedly smuggled more than 800 kilograms
(1,760 pounds) of dynamite and more than 2,000 detonators into Hong
Kong at Cheung's request.

Obuchi wins vote in Parliament's lower house for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kan winning upper house election, quote from
Koizumi; Declaration of new prime minister expected by 0730 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi was approved as
Japan's next prime minister by Parliament's lower house Thursday,
putting him on the threshold of power in a country suffering its
worst recession in decades. Final confirmation was expected later
in the day.
	   Obuchi garnered 268 votes of the 497 ballots cast in lower
house, a comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority needed to
win. Opposition leader Naoto Kan was the runner-up in the lower
house poll, winning 164 votes.
	   In a sign of the political divisions in Japan's government, the
upper house endorsed Kan as premier with 142 votes of the 245 votes
counted. Obuchi, however, was almost certain to become prime
minister, since the lower house has the power to overrule any upper
house decision.
	   The split vote _ the first time that has happened since 1989 _
required a conference meeting between the two chambers later in the
afternoon. If no compromise is struck, the lower house winner _
Obuchi _ will be officially declared prime minister.
	   Obuchi, 61, who served as foreign minister until resigning that
post Thursday morning, would succeed Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was
forced to quit after voter outrage over the stumbling economy dealt
the ruling party a painful defeat in July 12 upper house elections.
	   The long-time Liberal Democratic Party stalwart was to take over
a country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with record-high unemployment and spiraling bankruptcies.
Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   Obuchi was to name his Cabinet after being officially declared
prime minister later Thursday.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   Widely considered a cautious leader with few innovative ideas to
reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Obuchi boosted his standing
with the markets this week by tapping former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993 and is an architect of the government's plan to
bail out its troubled banking system, triggered rallies in the
Tokyo markets this week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning share prices
moved higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a

	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi

replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

Spider wrestling banned for children in southern Philippine
</HEADLINE>
province

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Education officials in a southern
Philippine province have banned spider wrestling, a favorite
children's pastime in many rural areas, to discourage students from
skipping classes to catch spiders, an official said Thursday.
	   The ban began last week after education officials noticed that
an increasing number of absences among school children were traced
to the game, said Isidro Valeroso, superintendent of the Department
of Education in North Cotabato province.
	   Valeroso said spider wrestling, in which children collect
spiders and have them fight to the death on a stick, also
encourages children to gamble.
	   The spiders wrestle ferociously for a few seconds amid the
cheers of children. The battle ends when the champion completely
wraps the vanquished spider in a cocoon of webbing. Children often
bet on the outcome.
	   Children usually go to meadows or farms at dawn or dusk to catch
spiders, sometimes skipping classes or coming in late.
	   They usually house their best ``gladiators'' in matchboxes.
	   Many aficionados spend large amounts of time searching for the
best spiders. Most of the spiders are collected from trees but some
children say the best fighters are found on electric power lines.
	   A prized fighter sells for up to 100 pesos (dlrs 2.40).
	   ``We have to teach children that spiders are a farmer's best
friend because they catch insects that destroy or damage crops,''
Valeroso said. ``We really have to stop children from killing
spiders.''

 &UR; EDS: RECASTS and UPDATES with government admitting it forced Suu

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government admitted
Thursday it ended a six-day roadside standoff with opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi by forcing her back to her Yangon home.
	   ``The government had no choice but to take the initiative to
break the standoff by sending her to Yangon,'' government spokesman
Col. Hla Min, said at a press conference.
	   Described by colleagues as ill and running low on food, the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner was driven back to her compound by a
military driver who took the wheel of her white Toyota Mark II
sedan as it sat parked on a bridge outside the capital, according
to U.S. government officials.
	   She arrived back in Yangon about 10:20 p.m. (1450 GMT)
Wednesday.
	   Speaking in Sydney, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said Suu Kyi ``was all off a sudden taken in her car by a military
driver back to Yangon and thereby forbidden from exercising a basic
human right, which is the ability to travel freely in your own
country. This is an unacceptable violation of human rights.''
	   American officials accompanying Albright in Australia, said
their information came from on-the-scene diplomats in Yangon.
	   Albright said the move by the government ``will only contribute
to the further isolation of Burma.'' Myanmar is also known as
Burma.
	   Hla Min accused Suu Kyi of staging the incident so that ``Mrs.
Albright could berate Myanmar and induce other governments to put
pressure on Myanmar.''
	   Suu Kyi's ``objective has been achieved, and so it was time to
break the standoff,'' he said, adding the government had acted on
the advice of Suu Ky's doctors.
	   ``Although the health condition of (Suu Kyi) was not critical,
we take the physician's advice seriously,'' Hla Min said. ``We do
not wish to see anybody's life wasted for no good reason.''
	   The government statement said leaders of Suu Kyi's political
party, the National League for Democracy, and her private doctor,
Tin Myo Win, tried in vain to persuade Suu Kyi to end the standoff
on Wednesday evening.
	   Opposition leaders were planning a press conference for
Thursday.
	   Prior to her return, the military told diplomats that she had no
health problems, and that the democracy leader's trip outside
Yangon had been stopped to avert possible disturbances, diplomatic
sources said.
	   Suu Kyi's party follows a policy of nonviolence, and no riots or
other disturbances have ever been associated with her trips or
public speeches.
	   Government officials stopped Suu Kyi, an associate and two
drivers Friday morning as the group headed toward Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) from Yangon to meet party members.
	   Suu Kyi refused to return to Yangon, and the military would not
let her proceed. This was her third attempt this month to travel to
the provinces.
	   Suu Kyi's personal physicians, who examined her Tuesday in her
car, parked on a narrow bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the
capital, said she was showing signs of dehydration.
	   The military government, which has stopped her every time, said
she was trying to foment unrest.
	   The government refused a request by seven Western nations that
U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar be allowed to see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional grouping.
	   The military has allowed her to travel outside Yangon only once
since her release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She
visited a Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's Yangon home, refusing journalists entry
and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.

Seles, Graf advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Seles, Graf matches; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE M. PETERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Monica Seles used experience and
stamina to outlast unseeded challenger Fang Li 2-6, 6-2, 6-1
Wednesday night in the Bank of the West women's tournament.
	   Li came out strong, making some seemingly impossible shots
against the second-seeded Seles, who is ranked No. 6 in the world.
But the more experienced Seles appeared unruffled as she easily
took the next two sets.
	   In the other late match Wednesday, Steffi Graf defeated Mary Joe
Fernandez 6-4, 6-0. The fourth-seeded Graf, ranked No. 57, has a
15-0 career record against Fernandez.
	   Seles, who won this tournament in 1990 and 1992, had the crowd
on her side, especially after her frustrating first set. The
sellout crowd at Stanford University peppered her with shouts of
``C'mon Monica'' and enthusiastic applause.
	   Li, who won four satellite events in 1997, defeated No. 63
Nathalie Dechy of France to face Seles, who had a first-round bye.
	   Graf appeared to be frustrated in the first set against
Fernandez, shaking her head after missed shots. Her frustration was
enhanced by a fault call, which she briefly argued. In the second
set, the frustration was passed to Fernandez, currently ranked No.
49.
	   ``I just tried to stay with her and not try to do too much,''
Graf said. ``You have to wait for your chances and you have to be
patient.''
	   After an eight-month layoff because of knee surgery, Graf
returned to tennis in February at Hanover, then injured a hamstring
in her next tournament at Indian Wells. The Bank of the West is
just her eighth tournament this year.
	   ``Every match I play puts me a step further to where I want to
be,'' she said.
	   Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport, ranked third in the world, took
less than an hour to beat Kimberly Po 6-1, 6-3 Wednesday.
	   Davenport, who has reached the quarterfinals in all but two of
the 12 tournaments she has played this year, was never in trouble
against Po, who is ranked No. 56 in the world.
	   ``She's a dangerous opponent,'' Davenport said. ``I've lost to
her before. I was trying to mix it up a little and thought to do
some stuff different. That seemed to work.''
	   In other matches, fifth-seeded Natasha Zvereva of Belarus
defeated Tara Snyder 6-3, 6-4 and Joanette Kruger of South Africa
beat Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France 1-6, 6-2, 6-4.
	   Davenport beat Po 6-2, 6-2 in the first round of the French Open
this year.
	   ``I knew she would be better this time around,'' Davenport said.
``She's not at the same level she was last spring (Po was ranked in
the top 20) but I think she'll get back there.''
	   Davenport said she's trying not to rely on hitting the ball hard
all the time.
	   ``I still want to be aggressive, but I have to learn to be able
to do different things,'' she said. ``That can pull you through
some bad days.''

Man jailed for offering bribe in airport corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A man who offered bribes to cover up shoddy
construction connected to Hong Kong's new airport railroad was
jailed for 20 months, officials said Thursday.
	   A district court convicted Lau Yee-lai, a 50-year-old industrial
diver, of offering bribes totaling 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 25,600) in October 1997, Lisa Li, a spokeswoman for the
Independent Commission Against Corruption said.
	   Li quoted magistrate John Brennan as saying that Lau had damaged
the reputation of the territory's construction industry.
	   Lau offered the bribe to Mak Yiu-man, a building inspector from
Ove Arup and Partners, an engineering consultant firm, who
identified problems in the foundation work and discovered forged
concrete delivery documents, the anti-corruption commission said
earlier.
	   Shortly after Mak reported the problems, Lau offered him a bribe
to stop any more inquiries. Lau had said he was instructed by a
superintendent from another engineering company to offer the bribe.
	   The commission arrested 17 people in the bribery case. Three of
them are in custody pending further investigation, Li said.
	   The corruption case followed a string of problems since the dlrs
20 billion airport opened July 6. Passenger services are back to
normal, and cargo services also have improved markedly.
	   Three separate investigations have been launched to find out
what went wrong and who is responsible for the debacle.

Obuchi wins vote in Parliament's lower house for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMs; RECASTS with quote from Kan, details; Declaration of new
prime minister expected by 0730 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi won the lower
house of Parliament's vote for prime minister Thursday, all but
guaranteeing he would take the helm of Japan's government as it
struggles to pull the country out of its deepest recession in
decades.
	   In a decisive victory, Obuchi snared 268 votes of the 497
ballots cast in the ruling party-controlled lower house, a
comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority. Opposition leader
Naoto Kan was the runner-up with 164 votes.
	   In a sign of the political divisions in Japan's government,
however, the opposition-dominated upper house endorsed Kan as
premier with 142 votes of the 245 votes counted. Obuchi came in
second place in that race with 103 votes in the second ballot.
	   Obuchi, however, was almost certain to become prime minister,
since the lower house has the power to overrule any upper house
decision.
	   The split vote _ the first time that has happened since 1989 _
required a conference meeting between the two chambers later in the
afternoon. If no compromise is struck, the lower house winner _
Obuchi _ will be officially declared prime minister.
	   Obuchi, 61, who served as foreign minister until resigning along
with the rest of the Cabinet on Thursday morning, would succeed
Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced to quit after voter outrage over
the stumbling economy dealt the ruling party a painful defeat in
July 12 upper house elections.
	   The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart was to take over
a country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with record-high unemployment and spiraling bankruptcies.
Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   Obuchi was to name his Cabinet after being officially declared
prime minister later Thursday.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   The opposition, meanwhile, said the victory in the upper house
better represented the opinions of the voters.
	   ``The upper house results show that the vote in the lower house
does not reflect the will of the people,'' declared Kan, the
president of the Democratic Party.
	   The new prime minister's first priority would be the economy _ a
priority illustrated by the rapt attention the country has paid to
Obuchi's choice of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to head
the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   While Obuchi is widely considered a cautious leader with few
innovative ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Miyazawa,
78, is respected by many an economics expert and is an architect of
the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden banking system.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993, triggered rallies in the Tokyo markets this
week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning share prices
moved higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a
sign the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime powerbroker in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Hun Sen to discuss ``problems'' with
king, official election results for capital. Changes byline. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ With Cambodia verging on a new round
of instability, strongman Hun Sen met with King Norodom Sihanouk to
raise ``problems'' Thursday following challenges to the ruling
party's victory in parliamentary elections.
	   Meanwhile, terrorized opposition activists fled from the
provinces to the capital, Phnom Penh, as the Hun Sen-controlled
police retaliated for their challenges to his rule.
	   Hun Sen's talks with Sihanouk were likely to focus on the
formation of a new government amid disputes with opposition
leaders, including the king's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, that
threaten another crisis after decades of war, the Khmer Rouge
genocide and last year's coup.
	   Hun Sen, who recently underwent an appendectomy, was helped from
his helicopter after landing in the northern town of Siem Reap.
Reporters asked what subjects he would broach with the king.
	   ``A lot of problems,'' Hun Sen said. ``Especially, I will report
to the king about the general situation after the elections. The
king has played a determining role for stability.''
	   Hun Sen was accompanied by his ministers of defense and
interior, who control the security forces, and the secretary
general of his ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The opposition, led by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, are blaming
defeat on electoral fraud and threaten to paralyze formation of a
government. Hun Sen says he could change the constitution to rule
unfettered for the next five years.
	   Hun Sen said Wednesday he would be willing to forge a coalition
_ though not a joint premiership _ with the prince, whom he deposed
as co-prime minister in fighting in the capital last year.
	   Foreign observers who had monitored voting day and initial
counting said the election was free and fair enough to reflect the
broad will of the Cambodian people.
	   But the Asian Network for Free Elections, an independent
monitoring group that has more regional experience, and
human-rights groups claimed that opposition activists were being
terrorized after Hun Sen won.
	   At least 23 activists have fled to Phnom Penh from outlying
provinces, ANFREL told a news conference Thursday. In many cases,
police surrounded meetings and attacked or threatened those
attending.
	   ``If massive violence or retaliation occurs, it will undermine
the limited success of the election,'' said ANFREL member Nobuhiko
Suto.
	   ANFREL urged the international community to closely monitor
Cambodia until the transition to a new government is complete.
	   In the pre-election period, violence, including murder, was
widespread against opposition activists. The Cambodian People's
Party claimed a landslide win Monday, but many people disbelieve
the figures.
	   Full official results are not expected from the Hun Sen-packed
National Election Committee before Sunday.
	   Four days after counting began, the committee gave final results
for Phnom Penh. Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC won with 159,482 votes,
trailed by the CPP with 140,108 and 132,127 for the Sam Rainsy
Party.
	   The top independent monitoring group, the Committee for Free and
Fair Elections in Cambodia, said its figures showed that with 90
percent of the ballots counted, the CPP looked set to get 59 of the
122 National Assembly seats, followed by 45 for FUNCINPEC and 18
for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   Constitutionally, the National Assembly must convene with
two-thirds of its members to confirm a new government. The
opposition says it will boycott until demands are met for a recount
and new balloting in some areas.
	   Hun Sen threatened Wednesday to lower the threshold to 50
percent-plus-one, or to simply stay for the next five years at the
head of the old government the vote was supposed to replace.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Hun Sen, who
came to power in 1985 under the Vietnamese occupation that followed
the Khmer Rouge, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war. He deposed Ranariddh last year
in two days of fighting in the capital.

Southeast Asia appeals for international aid to fight haze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations appealed
to the international community Thursday to quickly release
financial aid to fight haze-causing fires and prevent the repeat of
``a regional catastrophe.''
	   ``The next few months are indeed very crucial to us,''
Malaysia's Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding told regional
environment ministers, gathered for the fifth time to discuss the
hazardous smog that blanketed the region last year.
	   As Malaysia readies for the Commonwealth Games in September,
Indonesia has entered its dry season, heightening concern that
wildfires like last year's will shroud Malaysia in dark clouds.
	   ``I would like to see the international community doing more in
terms of providing assistance to fight and prevent the fires in
this region,'' Law told his counterparts from the nine-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Law commended the group for its ``comradeship in the face of a
regional catastrophe.'' But he said the regional economic crisis
had left the group with inadequate resources to tackle the fires.
	   Although the end of the El Nino weather pattern is expected to
ease a months-long drought that fueled the fires, Indonesia's dry
season, which lasts until October, has raised fears that the fires
will return, officials said.
	   It is during the dry season that local farmers and large
plantation companies clear land by setting crops on fire. This
practice is blamed for the burning of more than 500,000 hectares
(1.2 million acres) of Indonesian forest and covering the region in
haze from last July through April of this year.
	   Law said some relief and progress had come as a result of
funding from the United Nations Environment Program, the Asian
Development Bank and the United States.
	   The United Nations Environment Program recently released a dlrs
30,000 disbursement of a dlrs 750,000 fire fighting aid package.
	   Using that money, Indonesia launched its first aerial
surveillance flight Monday to scout fires in Riau province on
Sumatra island. The area is covered with plantations and potential
hot spots.
	   Ministers, in a closed-door meeting Thursday, were expected to
review progress reports on a regional haze action plan headed by
the countries hardest-hit by last year's disaster. Under the plan,
Indonesia is responsible for firefighting, Singapore for monitoring
the fires and Malaysia for preventing new fires.

Over Myanmar and openness, a divide among Southeast Asian nations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Their international stature and
bargaining power sapped by economic crisis, Southeast Asian nations
can hardly afford more divisions.
	   But that is what emerged from a week of foreign ministers'
meetings as the region flirted with a proposal for more open
dialogue on contentious issues and tried to deal with a problem
ally, Myanmar.
	   Publicly, the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations
said it was stronger and more united.
	   But the divisions were evident at a concluding news conference
Wednesday. Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw of Myanmar, ASEAN's newest
member, listened as colleagues criticized his country for refusing
to allow diplomats to visit opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi,
whose car was blocked by police for a sixth day.
	   ``It's unbearable and regrettable,'' said the European Union
representative, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
	   ``We are very disappointed,'' said Australia's Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer, who was sitting next to Ohn Gyaw and leaned
forward to look directly at him as he spoke.
	   Despite warnings from the West, ASEAN admitted military-ruled
Myanmar last year. That has not only hampered relations between
ASEAN and the West, but also opened some fissures within ASEAN.
	   The group's two democracies, Thailand and the Philippines, want
ASEAN to exert more open pressure on Myanmar's government to begin
a dialogue with Suu Kyi. Other countries _ Singapore, Indonesia and
Malaysia among them _ want the traditional quiet persuasion to
continue.
	   A frustrated senior Thai diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Myanmar problem is now dominating ASEAN
meetings, diverting attention from more pressing issues and
damaging the image of ASEAN as a whole.
	   ``We can't hide our heads in the sand,'' he said. ``We must
address this issue.''
	   Diplomats said the problems provoked by Myanmar's membership
have made ASEAN more cautious about admitting Cambodia, the only
country in the region which does not currently belong.
	   ASEAN once was eager to embrace Cambodia to fulfill its dream of
``one Southeast Asia.'' But Cambodia's entry has been put on hold
until ASEAN is assured that its election last Sunday produces a
legitimate government. As in Myanmar, Cambodia's political
opposition accuses authorities of widespread violence and
intimidation following a coup last year.
	   These worries over the possible costs of bringing in new
members, such as how to respond if internal conflict breaks out,
are similar to those in the European Union as it prepares to bring
the former Soviet satellites into the group.
	   In Southeast Asia, the differences over Myanmar also reflect a
more fundamental divide over just how far countries should go in
speaking out on human rights abuses and repression in neighboring
countries.
	   At the Manila conference, Thailand proposed, with Philippine
support, a shift toward more open and frank discussions within
ASEAN when policies in one member country cause problems in
neighboring countries. Other ASEAN members accepted the general
principle but demanded that ASEAN maintain its policy of
non-interference in members' domestic affairs.
	   Most of the opponents of the shift were authoritarian
governments that fear they will one day come under outside pressure
to adopt democratic reforms. The strongest opponent was Myanmar.
	   Discussing border disputes, drug trafficking, environmental
damage and the like are fine, said Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas. But be careful you don't cross the thin line of
interference, he said.
	   ``If you start telling another country `this is how you should
run your country, you should do more of this and more of that,'
that is intervention and that is not accepted,'' he said.
	   Diplomats said Thailand probably would not have made its
proposal if former President Suharto were still in power in
Indonesia and exercising his strong conservative influence on the
region. But the resistance put up in Manila showed that ASEAN is a
long way from becoming a liberals-only club like the European
Union.
	   Nor can ASEAN rely on rich countries to empty their coffers to
save Southeast Asia from financial collapse. No new aid packages
were announced in Manila, even though Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan raised the specter of a region engulfed by ``violent
rebellion and insecurity'' as poverty and unemployment take their
toll.
	   Instead, the United States, the EU, Japan and other countries
said Asia should keep its belts tightened and speed up recovery by
continuing to reform economic and political systems _ no matter how
painful that may be.

After low election profile, Sihanouk returns to stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ After keeping an unusually low
profile during the recent, violence-marred parliamentary elections,
King Norodom Sihanouk returned Thursday to Cambodia's political
center stage.
	   The 75-year-old monarch received strongman Hun Sen, the apparent
election winner, at his palace in the northern town of Siem Reap,
near the spiritual center of Cambodian power, the ancient Angkor
temples.
	   Both men exchanged traditional greetings and smiled for
photographers as they entered the palace, where they were expected
to discuss a solution to the country's latest turmoil.
	   The opposition, which accuses Hun Sen's party of winning by
fraud, has said it will boycott the National Assembly and block
formation of a new government. Hun Sen has threatened to change the
constitution to rule without them.
	   The king, who is in poor health, has walked a tightrope since
Hun Sen deposed his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as co-prime
minister in a coup last year and dispelled any pretense of
power-sharing.
	   Hun Sen, a peasant's son, has said many times that the royal
family should stay out of politics. Sihanouk has expressed fears
that Cambodia's constitutional monarchy will end with his death.
	   Still, following the death of infamous Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, Sihanouk remains the world's best-known Cambodian and Hun Sen
needs his tacit blessing to win back the international legitimacy
and aid he lost after last year's coup.
	   Sihanouk has little formal power, but his symbolic importance
dates from his coronation as a teenager under the French colonial
regime in 1941, continuing a royal tradition dating to the
Angkorian god-kings.
	   In 1955, he abdicated, resumed his title as prince and took
charge of day-to-day politics during a period of relative peace and
prosperity now remembered only by his older subjects.
	   Ultimately failing to keep his small country out of the Vietnam
War next door, Sihanouk was deposed in a U.S.-backed military coup
in 1970. To regain power, he linked up with the little-known Khmer
Rouge.
	   The Khmer Rouge's strength mushroomed thanks to the monarch's
presence and the U.S. carpet-bombing of eastern Cambodia, which led
to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
	   But Sihanouk became a prisoner in his palace after the
Maoist-inspired revolutionaries took power in 1975 and turned the
country into a vast forced labor camp.
	   Several of his children and relatives were among the 2 million
Cambodians who died over the next four years. Sihanouk survived
only because of the intervention of China, the Khmer Rouge's
biggest ally.
	   Vietnamese troops invaded and toppled the Khmer Rouge in 1979.
Sihanouk eventually came to lead a Khmer Rouge-dominated resistance
against the decade-long occupation by Cambodia's historic enemy.
	   Sihanouk regained his throne under the 1991 peace accords that
led to U.N.-sponsored elections two years later.
	   They were won by Ranariddh, but the prince was forced into a
joint premiership with Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge officer who
defected in 1977 to Vietnam and came to power under the
Hanoi-backed communist regime seven years later.

Strongman, king meet; election opponents terrorized
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. envoy demanding halt to retaliation attacks,
grafs 2-3 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ With Cambodia verging on a new round
of instability, strongman Hun Sen met with King Norodom Sihanouk to
raise ``problems'' Thursday following challenges to the ruling
party's victory in parliamentary elections.
	   Meanwhile, terrorized opposition activists fled from the
provinces to the capital, Phnom Penh, as the Hun Sen-controlled
police retaliated for their challenges to his rule. The top United
Nations human rights envoy to Cambodia said the international
community wanted it stopped.
	   ``It's very important that the political leadership make very
clear they will take a strong stance against attempts to settle
scores,'' Thomas Hammarberg said.
	   Hun Sen's talks with Sihanouk were likely to focus on the
formation of a new government amid disputes with opposition
leaders, including the king's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, that
threaten another crisis after decades of war, the Khmer Rouge
genocide and last year's coup.
	   Hun Sen, who recently underwent an appendectomy, was helped from
his helicopter after landing in the northern town of Siem Reap.
Reporters asked what subjects he would broach with the king.
	   ``A lot of problems,'' Hun Sen said. ``Especially, I will report
to the king about the general situation after the elections. The
king has played a determining role for stability.''
	   Hun Sen was accompanied by his ministers of defense and
interior, who control the security forces, and the secretary
general of his ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The opposition, led by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, are blaming
defeat on electoral fraud and threaten to paralyze formation of a
government. Hun Sen says he could change the constitution to rule
unfettered for the next five years.
	   Hun Sen said Wednesday he would be willing to forge a coalition
_ though not a joint premiership _ with the prince, whom he deposed
as co-prime minister in fighting in the capital last year.
	   Foreign observers who had monitored voting day and initial
counting said the election was free and fair enough to reflect the
broad will of the Cambodian people.
	   But the Asian Network for Free Elections, an independent
monitoring group that has more regional experience, and
human-rights groups claimed that opposition activists were being
terrorized after Hun Sen won.
	   At least 23 activists have fled to Phnom Penh from outlying
provinces, ANFREL told a news conference Thursday. In many cases,
police surrounded meetings and attacked or threatened those
attending.
	   ``If massive violence or retaliation occurs, it will undermine
the limited success of the election,'' said ANFREL member Nobuhiko
Suto.
	   ANFREL urged the international community to closely monitor
Cambodia until the transition to a new government is complete.
	   In the pre-election period, violence, including murder, was
widespread against opposition activists. The Cambodian People's
Party claimed a landslide win Monday, but many people disbelieve
the figures.
	   Full official results are not expected from the Hun Sen-packed
National Election Committee before Sunday.
	   Four days after counting began, the committee gave final results
for Phnom Penh. Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC won with 159,482 votes,
trailed by the CPP with 140,108 and 132,127 for the Sam Rainsy
Party.
	   The top independent monitoring group, the Committee for Free and
Fair Elections in Cambodia, said its figures showed that with 90
percent of the ballots counted, the CPP looked set to get 59 of the
122 National Assembly seats, followed by 45 for FUNCINPEC and 18
for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   Constitutionally, the National Assembly must convene with
two-thirds of its members to confirm a new government. The
opposition says it will boycott until demands are met for a recount
and new balloting in some areas.
	   Hun Sen threatened Wednesday to lower the threshold to 50
percent-plus-one, or to simply stay for the next five years at the
head of the old government the vote was supposed to replace.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Hun Sen, who
came to power in 1985 under the Vietnamese occupation that followed
the Khmer Rouge, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war. He deposed Ranariddh last year
in two days of fighting in the capital.

Indonesia's lagging tourism industry tries giving it away
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Cheap deals for tourists are plentiful
in Indonesia these days. On Thursday, some were free, all part of a
bid to lure visitors back to the troubled nation.
	   In a government campaign dubbed ``Let's Go Indonesia!,''
foreigners arriving in the country were treated to vouchers for
free hotel rooms and meals as well as free or discounted air
tickets.
	   Asia's currency crisis and recent riots over price increases in
Indonesia have battered the once-robust tourism industry in the
nation of 200 million people. Political turmoil forced former
President Suharto to quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   Some foreigners have stayed away, fearing more violence. Many
tourists from economically struggling Thailand and South Korea no
longer have the cash to vacation abroad.
	   ``What we faced was a crisis of confidence,'' said Alistair
Speirs, manager of the dlrs 10 million promotional campaign. ``Some
markets have dried up pretty drastically.''
	   Officials predict that 3.6 million tourists will visit Indonesia
by the end of 1998, 30 percent down from last year.
	   Under the deal, tourists flying into the international airports
in Jakarta and the resort island of Bali received a free night in a
hotel, a free meal, a free tour and free entry to recreational
parks.
	   Tourists arriving on the national carrier Garuda got a
complimentary return ticket to any destination in Indonesia.

to announce a huge drop in profits for the first half of 1998
because of the regional economic crisis, analysts said Thursday.
	   United Overseas Bank Ltd. will likely post a 60 to 70 percent
fall in net profit when it announces it half-year results later
Friday, the first Singapore bank to unveil interim results this
season.
	   The plunge in profits is primarily due to large provisions for
bad loans and investments in the region, as economic and financial
conditions deteriorate in Asia, market observers told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   The bank will probably write off about 200 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 116 million) for the first half of this year,
dragging down its total earnings, said DIR Singapore analyst Tony
Raza.
	   The provisions are ``due to poor loan quality within the region
and due to the tougher economic environment in Singapore,'' Raza
said.
	   He added that most of the bank's loans in countries hardest hit
by the crisis, such as Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, will
take a significant write-off.
	   In the first half of 1997, United Overseas Bank posted a 13
percent rise in net profit to 397 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
231 million).

Thai hospital won't send Swiss banker home after paralyzing him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Bangkok hospital has refused a demand
by a retired Swiss banker its doctors paralyzed that it send him
home and pay for his medical treatment in Switzerland, a hospital
official said Thursday.
	   The hospital has offered instead to provide free medical
treatment in Bangkok. Doctors at Samitivej Hospital denied they had
committed any malpractice.
	   Earnst Wynistorf, 54, was paralyzed in January after receiving
an injection of dye at Samitivej prior to undergoing an x-ray
analysis. He had sought treatment there after getting nosebleeds
following a motorcycle accident in December.
	   The hospital said they had conducted a test before injecting the
dye, called a contrast media, but claimed that the patient was not
allergic to anything. But he became paralyzed following the
injection.
	   His Thai wife Pensak was quoted in The Nation newspaper as
saying her husband is scared of returning to the hospital. The
couple has accused Samitivej doctors of negligence.
	   The couple said they have not filed a lawsuit against the
hospital because Thai law heavily favors doctors and the case would
take years to wind its way through the courts.
	   Pensak said her husband would probably be dead before the case
reached its conclusion.
	   Instead, they filed a complaint and testified before the Thai
Parliament's Human Rights Committee and the Medical Council.

First Islamic banking service to be launched in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's first Islamic banking service will
be launched Friday by one of the island republic's largest
financial institutions, the bank said Thursday.
	   Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., otherwise known as OCBC Bank,
will initially introduce two types of accounts in its newly formed
Islamic Banking Unit, which conforms to Muslim law.
	   The Islamic code prohibits usury, the practice of charging or
earning interest on money. About 15 percent of multi-ethnic
Singapore's 3.1 million people are Muslim.
	   In practice, Islamic banks provide for profits or dividends
instead of interest, though returns are not guaranteed and any
losses must be shared by the bank and depositor.
	   Such accounts must also invest only in certain products,
companies or financial instruments that conform with Islamic law,
said a spokeswoman for the bank.
	   According to a Thursday report in The Straits Times newspaper,
the potential market in Singapore for Islamic banking comprises
200,000 Muslims above 12 years of age, thousands of Muslim
companies and organizations and more than 70 mosques.
	   In late 1995, Finance Minister Richard Hu approved the
establishment of Islamic banking services in Singapore, according
to the newspaper.

Death toll from Moscow building collapse rises to six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from a gas explosion and the
collapse of a 10-story building has risen to six, as rescuers
retrieved more bodies from the rubble, officials said.
	   A column of apartments in the building in eastern Moscow was
demolished from top to bottom after an apparent gas explosion
Wednesday.
	   Rescuers have pulled nine people from the rubble, only three of
whom were alive, Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Natalia
Shakhgedanova said Thursday morning.
	   The six dead included a child and a couple engaged to be married
in three weeks, officials and neighbors said.
	   Several passerbys were also hurt by falling parts of the
building, Shakhgedanova said.
	   At least one of the injured was taken by helicopter to Moscow's
main trauma center, the Sklifosovsky Hospital. The chief doctor at
the hospital, Alexander Shcherbyuk, said that the injured woman was
in critical condition, with burns over 90 percent of her body.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who went to the site Wednesday to
personally direct the rescue efforts, said investigators believed
the blast was caused by a gas leak or buildup.
	   But neighbors challenged the investigators' conclusions, saying
there had been no smell of gas before the collapse.

United, Fusion, MetroStars and Burn post wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Clash-Fire, Rapids-Revolution games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Carey Talley scored the deciding shootout goal
and D.C. United, which blew a two-goal lead, came back for a 3-2
victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny in Major League Soccer on
Wednesday night.
	   D.C. United got two goals from Marco Etcheverry but failed to
clinch a playoff spot with two months left in the regular season
when Mutiny midfielder Mauricio Ramos tied the game in the 88th
minute.
	   United (19-5), which outscored the Mutiny 4-3 in the shootout,
has won six straight games.
	   Tampa Bay (6-17) led the shootout 3-2 when D.C.'s John Harkes
tied the score and it remained tied when United keeper Scott
Garlick stopped Paul Dougherty's attempt.
 &UR; Fusion 3, Crew 2
	   In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Marcelo Herrera scored two goals
and Brazilian forward Paulinho added two assists as the Miami
Fusion beat the Columbus Crew 3-2 on Wednesday night, its fourth
consecutive victory.
	   The victory was the Fusion's second straight without all-star
midfielder Carlos Valderrama, who was benched after skipping two
recent practices under new coach Ivo Wortmann.
	   Valderrama, who was fined dlrs 10,000 by Major League Soccer on
Tuesday, is expected to rejoin the Fusion after Sunday's all-star
game at Orlando.
	   Miami (10-11) is in fourth place in the MLS Eastern Conference.
The Fusion was last in the six-team conference before Wortmann took
over when Cacho Cordoba was fired last Friday.
 &UR; MetroStars 3, Wizards 2
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Tab Ramos and Giovanni Savarese
scored shootout goals and goalkeeper Tony Meola made two big saves
late in regulation and two more in the shootout Wednesday night as
New York-New Jersey beat the Kansas City Wizards 3-2.
	   The MetroStars (12-9) won their third straight game and are
three games over .500 for the first time in franchise history.
	   Meola sent the game to a shootout by making a kick save on Matt
McKeon in the 80th minute and then coming quickly off his line in
the 86th minute to force Mark Chung to shoot wide after the Wizards
striker had broken through the defense.
	   In the shootout, Meola allowed a goal by Precki but saved shots
by Brian Tinsley and Paul Rideout while forcing Chung and Digital
Takawira to shoot wide.
 &UR; Burn 3, Galaxy 0
	   In Dallas, Jason Kreis, Mickey Trotman and Dante Washington
scored goals and Mark Dodd recorded his third shutout of the season
as the Dallas Burn beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 3-0 Wednesday night.
	   Kreis opened the scoring in the sixth minute and Trotman and
Washington both scored in the second half on assists by defender
Jorge Rodriguez.
	   Los Angeles (16-6), which is in first place in the Western
Conference, has lost three straight games and four of five, scoring
just five goals in that span. The Galaxy has been shut out three
times over the five games.
	   The Burn (11-11) are 22-2 when Kreis scores, including 6-0 this
season. The team is 14-0 when Washington scores.
	   The game was played before a crowd of 9,720 in 100-degree
Fahrenheit (38-degree Celsius) temperatures.
 &UR; Clash 3, Fire 0
	   In San Jose, California, San Jose's Jeff Baicher had a goal and
an assist and Eddie Lewis added two assists as the Clash beat the
Chicago Fire 3-0 Wednesday night.
	   Braeded Cloutier chest-trapped a pass from Baicher in the 32nd
minute and scored from 20 yards (meters) out to give the Clash its
first goal of the game.
	   Baicher later scored his shot on an empty net after San Jose
forward Ronald Cerritos collided with Chicago goalkeeper Jorge
Campos, taking Campos out of position.
	   Eric Wynalda added the Clash's third goal in the 77th minute,
scoring from 15 yards out on a pass from Lewis.
	   The Clash (8-13) earned its first victory in regulation since
May 23.
	   The Fire, struggling without injured playmaker Peter Nowak,
dropped to 13-9.
 &UR; Rapids 3, Revolution 1
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, Paul Bravo scored the game-winning
goal in the 66th minute Wednesday night and the Colorado Rapids
beat New England 3-1, the Revolution's eighth straight loss at
home.
	   Marcelo Balboa and Wolde Harris also scored for Colorado
(11-10), which is above the .500 mark for just the third time in
franchise history.
	   Ross Paule sent a diagonal pass to Bravo on the right side and
he converted from six yards (meters) out to make it 2-1.
	   Rapids goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann, tested only a handful of
times, made a crucial save in the 76th minute on Joe-Max Moore of
the Revolution (6-16). Hahnemann made the save at the base of the
right post.
	   Colorado opened the scoring in the third minute when Balboa was
fouled by New England's Carlos Pareja about 22 yards (meters) out.
On the ensuing indirect kick, Balboa took a short pass from Chris
Henderson and drilled the ball to the left side, beating Jeff
Causey for the 1-0 lead.
	   In the 35th minute, New England tied the score when a cross by
Imad Baba was headed home by Raul Diaz Arce at the right post.

Dollar, stocks higher at mid-afternoon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar remained higher against the yen at
mid-afternoon Thursday as ruling party president Keizo Obuchi was
elected prime minister by Parliament's lower house. Tokyo stocks
advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 142.33 yen, up 1.24 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 142.35 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency, however, slipped from highs earlier Thursday,
dragged down on profit-taking by overseas players and Japanese
exporters, said to have already factored in news on the new
government and its selection of finance minister.
	   The final confirmation of Obuchi, ruling Liberal Democratic
Party president, as Japan's new prime minister was expected later.
But votes in early afternoon by the two houses of Japan's
Parliament had little impact on the currency market, traders said.
	   The lower house, where the LDP holds a solid majority, elected
Obuchi, while the upper house, where opposition members outnumber
Liberal Democrats, nominated Naoto Kan, president of the largest
opposition Democratic Party.
	   The split required consultations among representatives of both
houses, but was only a formality as the lower house decision takes
precedence.
	   Incumbent Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his Cabinet
resigned earlier in the day. Hashimoto quit to take responsibility
for a devastating loss in July 12 upper house elections.
	   The yen was sold after news Wednesday that former prime minister
Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, will serve as the new finance minister.
	   Miyazawa, the key figure in the government's plan to bail out
its banking system, is seen by some, however, as being part of a
conservative old guard reluctant to carry out bold reforms to solve
Japan's economic woes.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices moved higher, as
investors welcomed the Miyazawa appointment on hopes that the
incoming government will take new measures to boost the economy.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 43.51 points, or 0.27
percent, ending the day at 16,201.60 points. On Wednesday, the
average gained 43.55 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 7.49 points, or 0.60 percent, to 1,248.19
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.52 points, or 0.12 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.220 percent, down from Wednesday's
finish of 1.275 percent, driving up its price to 111.67 yen from
111.27 yen.

Women's bypass risk greater than for men
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to CORRECT that women over 70 on first
elective surgery had 4 percent death rate, sted 4.4 percent and to
show that men had 3 percent death rate sted 2.4 percent. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Graphic &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Heart bypass surgery is significantly riskier
for women than men, says a massive study that found women die from
the operation up to twice as often as men who are just as old and
sick when they go under the knife.
	   Now doctors must figure out why.
	   ``I don't know the answer, and I don't think anyone does,'' said
Dr. Fred Edwards, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of
Florida, who reported the bypass findings Wednesday in the Annals
of Thoracic Surgery. Now he's preparing to research just what kills
these women so that perhaps it can be prevented.
	   The risk of death from bypass surgery, immediately or within a
few days, is very low for both men and women, so the study
shouldn't scare anyone away from what often is a lifesaving
operation, said Dr. Sidney Smith, past president of the American
Heart Association.
	   But Smith said the finding that women fare worse is disturbing
and must be explored quickly. Bypass surgery may not be the only
problem: Doctors are finding early signs that women also do more
poorly after angioplasties, in which a balloon clears clogged
arteries, he said.
	   ``The next step is very much to understand whether the cause of
death is different, because that could hold the clue as to why it's
occurring,'' said Smith, cardiology chief at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ``Heart disease in women is an issue
we need to take very seriously, and we really need to understand a
lot more about it.''
	   Women's survival of heart bypasses has long been a thorny issue.
Some studies indicate they do as well as men, while others conclude
women are twice as likely to die because they're older and sicker
than the average male patient by the time they have surgery.
	   Heart disease is the leading killer of U.S. women, but it
typically strikes women 10 years later than men.
	   To clear the confusion, Edwards tapped the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons' national database for the medical records of 344,000
patients _ 97,000 of them women _ who had heart bypasses between
1994 and 1996.
	   Some 4.5 percent of the women died from surgery compared with
2.6 percent of the men, Edwards concluded.
	   Overall, the women were older, had a higher incidence of
diabetes, high blood pressure and other complicating illnesses, and
were less likely to have undergone elective surgery _ when patients
have a choice between bypass and less invasive treatments.
	   But unlike previous research, the database was big enough so
that Edwards could test whether any of those risks explained
women's vulnerability. When he compared men and women with
identical risk factors, more women died each time, sometimes twice
as often as men.
	   Take one of the least risky groups: people under 70 having their
first bypass as elective surgery. Some 2.2 percent of the women
died vs. 1 percent of the men, the study found. In cases where a
first bypass was required for people older than 70, about 4 percent
of the women died vs. 3 percent of the men.
	   In a riskier case, when an elderly patient required a repeat
bypass, 16 percent of women died vs. 14 percent of men.
	   Even the strength of youth didn't help: 2.4 percent of women
under 50 died vs. 1.1 percent of men, the study found.
	   The only time women didn't have a significantly greater chance
of death was among patients whose risk from operating approached 30
percent, Edwards concluded.
	   His next step is to look at the actual causes of death. If women
appear more prone to die of specific problems _ say, irregular
heartbeat _ after bypass surgery, then doctors could look for ways
to protect them.
	   Smith says the study indicates that women should understand the
risks of heart disease sooner, so they can take steps to prevent
ever needing bypass surgery. The American Heart Association is
starting a campaign to do just that.
	   But one question Edwards' study did not address is whether
estrogen helped women survive bypass, Smith said. Women become more
at risk for heart disease after menopause, when their estrogen
levels plummet, and taking hormone supplements helps stave off the
disease. But no one knows if it helps women who ultimately need
heart surgery anyway.

Official tells people to prepare for early elections

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior official of the ruling
party said Thursday new elections could be announced any time and
allies of the party should be prepared to face voters, the national
news agency reported.
	   Although no election date has been fixed yet, the 14 component
parties of the Barisan National coalition should get ready, said
Mohamed Rahmat, secretary-general of the coalition and Malaysia's
information minister.
	   ``During these economically difficult times, we have to retain
the present government and give it stronger support so that it
could tackle increasingly serious external threats,'' Mohamed was
quoted as saying by Bernama news agency.
	   Mohamed is the first official to have indicated an early
election as Malaysia tries to deal with its worst economic crisis,
which is threatening widespread unemployment and rising food
prices.
	   He urged component parties to resolve all internal problems
before the elections.
	   Although there is no threat of a split in Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's United Malays National Organization, the
coalition's chief constituent, observers say that the top
leadership differs on issues of political reform and economic
policy.
	   The last general election was held in April 1995 and the next is
due by 2000.
	   Earlier this month, the ruling party lost a crucial by-election
to an Islamic party.

Clashes kill 14 Tamil rebels in northern Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government troops ambushed and killed
14 Tamil Tiger guerrillas in the northern jungles while the
military remained on high alert during a summit of South Asian
leaders in Sri Lanka's capital, officials said Thursday.
	   Thirteen rebels were killed on Wednesday near the guerrilla-held
town of Mankulam in Kilinochchi district, which has been besieged
by government troops for nearly a year, the military said in a
statement.
	   The area is 275 kilometers (170 miles) north of Colombo, the
capital, where the heads of government of India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives were holding their
annual meeting.
	   Another guerrilla also died in an ambush in the northern Mannar
district on Wednesday, the statement said.
	   No incidents were reported in Colombo, where the police are
maintaining tight security.
	   The summit has great international significance as it has
provided the opportunity for the first meeting between the Indian
and Pakistani prime ministers since their countries conducted
nuclear tests in May.
	   The Tamil Tiger rebels are fighting for a homeland for the
country's minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the 18 million
population. More than 54,000 people have been killed since fighting
began in 1983.

Chinese police detain sister of artist based in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police searched the house and detained
the sister of an artist based in Germany who held an exhibition to
commemorate the crushing of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy
protests, a human rights group said Thursday.
	   Police went to Lin Hangsheng's family home in Wuxi, eastern
Jiangsu province, on Monday and seized photos of paintings and
other materials Lin had mailed to the family of an exhibition he
held in Germany, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Police also detained Lin's younger sister, Lin Wei, for four
hours for questioning, the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   The police action followed an exhibition Lin mounted in Bonn to
mark the ninth anniversary of the bloody June 4, 1989, crackdown on
protests centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the Information
Center said.
	   Police told Lin's family officers were searching their home
because he had taken part in an organization overseas that was
opposed to China's ruling Communist Party, but police did not
specify which group, the Information Center said.
	   Lin moved to Germany from China five years ago and requested
political asylum, but he is not a member of any pro-democracy
organization, the Information Center said.

 &UR; Angels 10, Yankees 5 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Anaheim, California, Garret Anderson extended his hitting
streak to a franchise-record 26 games, and had two of his four hits
in an eight-run fourth inning as the Anaheim Angels pounded Orlando
Hernandez.
	   The loss was just the eighth in the last 31 games for the
Yankees, whose 74-27 record is the best in the major leagues.
	   The Angels tied a club record by getting seven straight hits in
the fourth _ the last a single by Anderson immediately after Tim
Salmon hit a two-run homer to cap the rally and knock out
Hernandez.
	   The performance was the worst for Hernandez (5-3) since the
Cuban defector made his big-league debut on June 3. Hernandez, who
entered the game with a 2.43 ERA, allowed 13 hits and 10 earned
runs in 3 1-3 innings.
	   Steve Sparks (4-2) went 7 2-3 innings and gave up five hits,
including solo homers by Darryl Strawberry, Derek Jeter and Tino
Martinez.
 &UR; Red Sox 10, Athletics 2 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Mo Vaughn, Nomar Garciaparra and Scott
Hatteberg homered as the Boston Red Sox handed the Oakland
Athletics their ninth straight loss.
	   The losing streak is the longest for the A's since they lost
their last nine games of the 1995 season. Boston is 7-0 against
Oakland this season.
	   Garciaparra went 3-for-5 with two RBIs and Vaughn was 2-for-5
with two RBIs for the Red Sox, who had 15 hits.
	   John Wasdin (5-3) gave up two runs on five hits over the first
three innings before settling down to hold the A's scoreless on
three hits over the next three innings. Derek Lowe pitched the
final three innings.
 &UR; Indians 8, Mariners 7 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, as the Randy Johnson trade watch heated up, Jim
Thome hit his 29th homer in the eighth inning to give the Cleveland
Indians a victory over the Seattle Mariners.
	   Rumors were rampant that Johnson was about to be traded to the
New York Yankees as the Indians, who also covet Johnson, were
beating Seattle for the sixth time in seven games this season.
	   Near the end of the game, Mariners president Chuck Armstrong
said there would be no trade announcement Wednesday night. Johnson
sat on the bench during the game.
	   Thome's homer off Greg McCarthy (0-1) gave the win to reliever
Chad Ogea (4-2). Ogea worked three scoreless innings, not allowing
a hit and walking one. Mike Jackson pitched the ninth for his 27th
save.

Indonesia's former president hands over ownership of hospitals

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto, who faces
investigations into his business dealings, on Thursday gave
ownership of three hospitals to the government.
	   Suharto, whose family built a huge economic empire during his 32
years in power, also handed over 75 billion rupiah (dlrs 5.7
million) from the Our Hope Foundation, a charitable organization he
runs.
	   Government prosecutors are investigating more than a dozen
charitable foundations set up and controlled by Suharto, who
resigned in May after a wave of protests and riots.
	   Critics have alleged that the charities were used for corrupt
purposes.
	   The foundations reaped special levies on thousands of civil
servants and enjoyed other government privileges.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing.
	   In a ceremony at his residence, Suharto handed over ownership of
the Children and Maternity Hospital, the Heart Hospital and the
Cancer Hospital to the health minister, Dr. Farid Anfasa Muluk.
	   ``I hope that these three hospitals, which were built by the
foundations with sincere intentions to serve all Indonesian people,
will be useful for all,'' Suharto said.
	   The Suharto clan, which amassed a fortune worth billions of
dollars over the years, has come under pressure to relinquish some
of its holdings. The new, reform-minded government has pledged to
curb corruption and nepotism at the highest levels.
	   Critics say the Suharto family's monopolistic practices
contributed to Indonesia's economic crisis, which has forced
millions of people out of work and pushed up prices.

Janzen begins honing his game for PGA Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM SHARP &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Most of the 156 players in the FedEx
St. Jude Classic are looking for a win, any win. Lee Janzen is in a
position to just work out the kinks.
	   Janzen, who won his second U.S. Open championship five weeks ago
and is seventh on the money list, is looking ahead to the PGA
Championship in two week at Sahalee in Redmond, Washington.
	   ``I'm really thinking about getting my game ready for the PGA,''
Janzen said Wednesday on the eve of the dlrs 1.8 million tournament
at the TPC at Southwind.
	   Janzen was already having a good year before outlasting the
field at The Olympic Club in San Francisco, with seven top-20
finishes in 17 tournaments so far this season.
	   ``I had a couple of other tournaments if I had just played the
back nine better I could have won,'' he said. ``I knew I was
playing well enough to win a tournament. The U.S. Open just made it
special.''
	   Wednesday's pro-am was washed out by heavy morning rains. Janzen
came in early and played a round Tuesday.
	   ``The soft greens will give more people a chance to win,'' he
said. ``We might see 20 or 25 guys with a chance to win on Sunday.
	   ``I think it's harder to win a regular tour event because there
are more guys gunning for it. With a major you can eliminate more
guys because the courses are set up that much harder, and the guys
who are playing average are eliminated.
	   ``With the wet conditions there will be more people firing at
the flag to shoot as low a score as they can. I think it's tougher
to win when you have those kind of conditions.''
	   If history is any guide the winner will have to go low. The
tournament record was set two years ago by John Cook at 26-under
par. The highest winning score in the 10 years the tournament has
been played at Southwind was 12-under by John Mahaffey in 1989.
	   Other previous winners in the field include Cook, Jim Gallagher
Jr., Dicky Pride, Nick Price, Jay Haas and Tom Kite.
	   Janzen, Justin Leonard and Scott Hoch are the only three players
in the top 10 on the money list in the tournament.
	   Greg Norman, the 1997 winner, is sidelined by a shoulder injury.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Two more teams angrily quit the
Tour de France on Thursday, bringing to five the number that have
left the competition after one was thrown out in a widening drug
scandal.
	   Since 1903, the only things have have halted the world's most
prestigious cycling competition have been the two World Wars.
	   Now, the Tour is verge of stopping again. Race organizers are
scrambling to find solutions to save this year's edition with the
angry reaction over the police tactics threatening to disrupt the
race.
	   Early Thursday the teams of Kelme and Vitalcio joined ONCE,
Riso-Scotti and Banesto in quitting.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi says she was kidnapped by government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with comments from Suu Kyi's party &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Myanmar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi accused
the military government of kidnapping her as Myanmar authorities
admitted Thursday they ended a six-day roadside standoff with the
opposition leader by forcing her back to her Yangon home.
	   ``The government had no choice but to take the initiative to
break the standoff by sending her to Yangon,'' government spokesman
Col. Hla Min said at a news conference.
	   Described by colleagues as ill and running low on food, the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner was driven back to her compound by a
police driver who took the wheel of her white sedan as it sat
parked on a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital.
	   Authorities had stopped her there Friday morning as she tried to
drive to the provincial city of Bassein to meet party members.
	   ``I was kidnapped. They even stole my car,'' U Lwin, a member of
her party, quoted Suu Kyi as saying after returning home. He added
that she was furious.
	   She arrived back in Yangon at about 10:20 p.m. (1450 GMT)
Wednesday.
	   After examining Suu Kyi, her doctors said she had a large bruise
on her wrist from being manhandled by police, but her spirits are
high.
	   She also vowed to continue her attempts to travel outside Yangon
to meet party members as soon as she is well, they said.
	   According to leaders of Suu Kyi's political party, the National
League for Democracy, who gave a news conference Thursday, two
policewomen grabbed Suu Kyi inside her car to restrain her
Wednesday night as she lay in the back seat with a high fever.
	   At the same time, policemen forcibly ejected Suu Kyi's
colleagues from the front seat and took the wheel of her car so
they could drive her back to the capital.
	   Asked at Thursday's government news conference to describe how
Suu Kyi was taken back to Yangon, Hla Min told reporters to ask the
opposition.
	   Suu Kyi did not attend her party's news conference because ``she
is not well enough. She is still very, very weak,'' said Tin Oo,
the NLD vice chairman, adding there had been no contact or
negotiations between the military and the party.
	   Speaking in Sydney, Australia, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called the government's actions ``an unacceptable
violation of human rights,'' and added it ``will only contribute to
the further isolation of Burma.'' Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   Hla Min accused Suu Kyi of staging the incident so that ``Mrs.
Albright could berate Myanmar and induce other governments to put
pressure on Myanmar.''
	   Suu Kyi's ``objective has been achieved, and so it was time to
break the standoff,'' he said, adding the government had acted on
the advice of Suu Ky's doctors.
	   ``Although the health condition of (Suu Kyi) was not critical,
we take the physicians' advice seriously,'' Hla Min said. ``We do
not wish to see anybody's life wasted for no good reason.''
	   Prior to her return, the military told diplomats that she had no
health problems, and that the democracy leader's trip outside
Yangon had been stopped to avert possible disturbances, diplomatic
sources said.
	   Suu Kyi's party follows a policy of non-violence, and no riots
or disturbances have been associated with her trips or public
speeches.
	   Suu Kyi has attempted to travel outside Yangon three times this
month, and been stopped each time by the government.
	   The military has allowed her to leave Yangon only once since her
release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She visited a
Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's home, refusing journalists entry and
restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.
	   The government refused a request this week by seven Western
nations that U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar be allowed to
see Suu Kyi.

Tajikistan official injured in bomb attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's deputy customs chief
was seriously injured Thursday when a bomb blew up his car near the
presidential palace in this Central Asian nation.
	   The official, Ali Emomnadzarov, and his driver were in a car
parked 100 meters (yards) from the residence of President Emomali
Rakhmonov when the bomb exploded, the Tajik Interior Ministry said.
	   The driver was also seriously hurt, and five passersby were

	   Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Tajikistan has been torn by violence since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. The government and mostly Islamic opposition formally
ended a five-year civil war last year, but sporadic clashes have
continued.

	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After starting out in Albertville and going through the motions
for the first hour or so, the pack slowed and stopped -- ironically
just past one of the sprint banners which usually has some of the
fastest action of the race.
	   After dicussion, the pack restarted, only to stop again.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the Tour's director, assured the riders that
further police action would be carried out ``with a maximum of
dignity ... at the hotels of the concerned teams and not at police
stations.''
	   Riders ``merit reaching the apotheosis Sunday in Paris on the
Champs Elysees,'' Leblanc said.
	   With that the riders took off again only to please the public.
	   However the public had mixed emotions. Some shouted at the
riders and made angry gestures. Others cheered.
	   The riders ended the day's stage more than two and a half hours
behind schedule in Aix-les-Bain. Many of the riders were holding
hands as they crossed the finish line with the Dutch team TVM
leading the pack.
	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annulled. He
said only the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the
competition Thursday. The three-week Tour is set to end Sunday in
Paris.
	   The TVM affair was the latest focal point that caussed the rider
revolt.
	   TVM riders were searched and had to give blood and urine samples
in lengthy medical tests that lasted until midnight with the riders
set to go off on another mountain stage on Wednesday
	   ``We're not animals. Everyone, including police, should treat us
like normal people,'' said the Dane Bjarne Riis of the Deutsche
Telekom team and winner of the 1996 Tour.
	   ``What we did today was to save the Tour, save cycling because
it's our life,'' Riis said, referring to the slowdown protest.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the TVM team. ``I have the impression the Tour is finished. I'm
sick.''
	   Riis has turned into the rider's spokesman after Laurent
Jalabert, France's top rider, quit.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said on France Info radio.
	   Jalabert had led the riders' protest on Friday when the race was
delayed two hours in starting.
	   Even after the protests the police came.
	   About 100 police descended on team hotels around the Alpine town
of Chambery for searches of the Casino team, ONCE, La Francaise des
Jeux and Polti.
	   On Wednesday night, police in nearby Chambery detained Casino
team coach Vincent Lavenu following a search of the team hotel.
	   Police were seen removing garbage bags full of objects from a
van bearing the ONCE insignia during a four-hour investigation of
the team that ended at nearing midnight.
	   By that time the ONCE team was no longer on the Tour, not even
being part of the slowdown. Two other teams, Banesto and
Riso-Scotti, followed ONCE out of the race.
	   Other riders protested by removing their numbers but still were
in the race.
	   Italian Marco Pantani, the overall leader at the start of the
stage, was one of the first to remove his number, at the 32nd
kilometer (20th mile). ``The pack stopped because they are
continuing to persecute the riders ...,'' he said.
	   This year's Tour has been plagued with doping allegations since
its July 11 start in Dublin, Ireland.
	   TVM entered the police spotlight when it emerged that EPO was
found in the car of a team official in March.
	   Festina was thrown out of the Tour after its director admitted
an organized plan to administer banned substances to the riders to
improve performances.
	   Since, at least five Festina riders admitted using EPO. Festina
star, Richard Virenque, has denied using drugs.

More rains threaten flood-ravaged China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in graf 12 that heavy rain predicted just for
Thursday; UPDATES with flood peak reaching Jiujiang in grafs 5-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Millions of people kept vigil over sodden Yangtze
River embankments threatened with collapse, and weather forecasts
warned of further heavy rains Thursday in flood-ravaged areas of
China.
	   Health authorities, meanwhile, called for vigilance against
outbreaks of disease in flooded areas. Agricultural experts were
sent to some of the worst-hit provinces to help farmers get back on
their feet as soon as possible, the official newspaper China Daily
said.
	   Houses were flooded up to their eaves in central Hubei province.
	   Flooding already has killed 1,145 people in China this year and
the death toll is expected to rise as more reports come in from
stricken areas. Floodwaters along the Yangtze have reached levels
unseen in more than four decades, threatening tens of millions of
people and rich farmland along the mighty river, the world's
third-longest.
	   A flood crest, the second-largest on the Yangtze since flooding
in 1954 killed more than 30,000 people, reached Jiujiang city in
eastern China Thursday morning, raising the river's level to a
record 22.95 meters (75.7 feet), some 3.45 meters (11.4 feet) above
the danger line, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Jiujiang's Flood Control Headquarters said 3 million people had
been sent to guard levees protecting the city, in Jiangxi province.
	   One million soldiers and civilians also were working night and
day to shore up a 143-kilometer (88-mile) stretch of levees in the
neighboring province of Anhui, the China Daily said.
	   In all, millions of people were guarding hundreds of kilometers
(miles) of dikes, watching for leaks that could cause water-soaked
levees to collapse, the newspaper said.
	   The floods have caused losses estimated at 39.7 billion yuan
(dlrs 4.78 billion) in Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi _ among the
hardest-hit provinces, the China Daily said. Worst hit was Hunan,
with losses of 15.15 billion yuan (dlrs 1.83 billion), the
newspaper said.
	   Wen Kegang, director of the State Meteorology Bureau, said heavy
rains were expected in flooded areas in coming days, the China
Daily said.
	   China's president, Jiang Zemin, spoke to Wen on Wednesday about
weather conditions in the swamped middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze, the newspaper said.
	   Heavy rains were expected in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces on
Thursday, the bureau said. In Jiangxi, heavy rains fell Wednesday
but were expected to diminish, said an official at the provincial
weather bureau, who gave his surname, Qi.
	   Meanwhile, water purification facilities, medicine and food will
be bought with U.S. dlrs 663,000 in donations collected by the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
the China Daily said.
	   While no epidemics of disease have been reported, the Ministry
of Health has asked medical workers to stay at their posts, the
China Daily said. It said around 100,000 medical workers have been
sent to flooded areas.

Prosecutor to complete corruption probe of Ukrainian opposition
</HEADLINE>
leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's new chief prosecutor vowed to
complete a corruption investigation of a prominent opposition
leader and to bring him to court if there is sufficient evidence, a
news report said Thursday.
	   Mykhailo Potebenko, appointed to the post earlier this month,
said he was focusing his efforts on investigating Pavlo Lazarenko,
a former prime minister and now head of the centrist opposition
Hromada party.
	   Lazarenko's group captured 44 seats in the 450-member parliament
in legislative elections last March, and he is viewed as one of the
most serious challengers to President Leonid Kuchma in the 1999
presidential ballot.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain when he was premier in 1996-97, and the chief
prosecutor's office has been investigating the allegations.
	   ``Everybody is interested in the case. Therefore, I've
strengthened the investigative team and ordered it to complete the
investigation within three months,'' Potebenko said Wednesday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   If there is sufficient evidence against Lazarenko, the
prosecutor-general's office would appeal to the Verkhovna Rada, or
parliament, to lift his parliamentary immunity and allow him to be
put on trial, Potebenko said.

Estrada's carabao breeding project shows success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ When he was a senator six years ago,
President Joseph Estrada was laughed at for authoring a law to save
the Philippine carabao. Now, he may have the last laugh.
	   Visiting the Philippine Carabao Center in northern Nueva Ecija
province established by his law, Estrada was proud to hear Thursday
the progress made in breeding sturdier breeds of carabao that
produce more milk.
	   ``This is very sentimental to me,'' he said. ``I know that at
that time (the law was proposed), they were laughing at me, but now
this is a reality.''
	   The carabao, or water buffalo, the main Philippine farm animal,
has declined over the years because of neglect and indiscriminate
slaughtering for food.
	   Native carabaos produce three liters (.8 gallons) of milk daily
but the new type that was crossed with Bulgarian buffaloes produces
up to four times that amount.
	   Mature native carabaos weigh about 400 kilograms (880 pounds),
while the crossbreeds are almost twice as heavy, officials say.
	   ``This is not only poverty alleviation, but also income
generation'' for poor farmers, Estrada said.
	   Estrada said he favored carabaos over tractors because they are
more appropriate for small farms of peasants who will benefit from
the land reform program he has promised to pursue.
	   Estrada has also said his administration's priorities include
increasing agricultural production and food security.
	   The carabao center has produced about 350,000 doses of frozen
semen for distribution nationwide. About 93,000 artificial
inseminations have been carried out since 1993.
	   Officials of Central Luzon State University, host to the center
and the National Water Buffalo Gene Pool, have voted to confer an
honorary doctorate degree on Estrada, a former actor and college
drop-out who won the presidency on a pro-poor platform.

Two more teams quit Tour de France in rider revolt

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Two more teams angrily quit the
Tour de France on Thursday, bringing to five the number that have
left the race after one was thrown out in a widening drug scandal.
	   Since 1903, the only things have halted the world's most
prestigious cycling competition have been the two World Wars.
	   Now, three days away from the Paris finish line, the Tour is
verge of stopping again. Race organizers are scrambling to calm a
rider revolt over repeated police searches and testing in the drug
investigation.
	   Early Thursday the Spanish teams of Kelme and Vitalcio joined
ONCE, Riso-Scotti and Banesto in quitting the competition.
	   ``The riders were insulted in the climb to Revard by the Spanish
public,'' said Alvaro Pino, director of the Spanish team Kelme,
referring to one of the Alpine peaks in Wednesday's segment. ``We
received some threats.''
	   The team's Fernando Escartin was in fourth place in the overall
standings in the three-week race.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
With Thursday's pullouts, all four Spanish teams were out of the
race.
	   The 18th stage was scheduled to start in Aix-les-Bains and head
to Neuchatel, Switzerland, 218 kilometers (135.5 miles).
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After starting out in Albertville and going through the motions
for the first hour or so, the pack slowed and stopped -- ironically
just past one of the sprint banners which usually has some of the
fastest action of the race.
	   After discussion, the pack restarted, only to stop again.

	   The riders ended the day's stage more than two and a half hours

	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annulled. He
said only the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the

	   The TVM affair was the latest focal point that caused the rider
rebellion.
	   TVM riders were searched and had to give blood and urine samples
in lengthy medical tests that lasted until midnight with the riders
set to go off on another mountain stage on Wednesday.
	   ``We're not animals. Everyone, including police, should treat us

Moody's lowers outlook for Sumitomo Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Thursday it has
lowered its rating outlook for Sumitomo Bank Ltd., one day after
the bank announced a tie-up with Daiwa Securities Co. in investment
banking.
	   The U.S. credit rating agency said it lowered its outlook for
Sumitomo's credit rating to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' It said
the tie-up was risky for Sumitomo because of ``Daiwa's very weak
financial condition.''
	   Moody's also said it would continue to review Daiwa's ``Baa3''
rating for a possible downgrade. A cut would drop Daiwa's debt into
the ranks of ``speculative'' or ``junk'' investments.
	   Moody's did not change its ``A2'' rating on Sumitomo's deposits,
but the ``negative'' outlook means there is a greater chance the
agency will lower it sometime soon. A lower rating is associated
with higher risk and could force Sumitomo to pay higher interest
rates to attract depositors.
	   The decision followed the bank's announcement Wednesday that it
will put up 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.05 billion) to form joint
venture companies with Daiwa.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa said they will establish three joint venture
companies that will start operations next April.
	   The tie-up is the latest move in a continuing consolidation in
Japan's financial industry following a series of reforms, dubbed
the ``Big Bang,'' aimed at invigorating the economy by opening up
markets to greater competition.
	   But Moody's seemed to question the choice of Daiwa as a partner.
	   ``The transaction will significantly raise Sumitomo's total
exposure to Daiwa,'' Moody's said in a press release. The tie-up
``could expose Sumitomo to contingent risks,'' it added.
	   Moody's rates companies according to their ability to repay
their debts, assigning grades from ``Aaa'' for the strongest firms
to ``C'' for the riskiest ventures.
	   Sumitomo's ``A2'' rating on Sumitomo puts it in the middle of
the upper half of Moody's scale.

Packers head overseas for first time ever

	   GREEN BAY, Wisconsin (AP) _ Masafumi Kawaguchi and Tamon
Nakamura often found themselves the object of their new teammates'
undivided attention after signing 10-day contracts with the Green
Bay Packers.
	   ``They all want to know where the nightclubs are in Tokyo,''
Kawaguchi explained.
	   Hardly what coach Mike Holmgren needed to hear.
	   Just because the two temporary players from Japan didn't
understand curfew doesn't mean the rest of the Packers can get away
with it this weekend.
	   Before boarding a Japan Airlines flight for their 15-hour trip
to Tokyo Thursday, Holmgren had a little chat with his rambunctious
quarterback Brett Favre and several of his teammates who were
looking forward to sampling a Japanese beer or maybe several.
	   ``I want Japan to really like the Packers after we leave
there,'' Holmgren said.
	   After all, the Packers are big in Tokyo.
	   ``Believe it or not, we are,'' said Favre, who flew there this
spring to promote the ninth American Bowl, between the Packers and
the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday night at the Tokyo Dome.
	   ``They couldn't speak great English, but they knew the
Packers,'' Favre said. ``They had a lot of Packers jerseys and
sweatshirts and stuff like that.''
	   Another publicity stunt involves having two Japanese players who
played in NFL Europe suit up for each team. They are the first
players from Japan to participate in NFL training camps.
	   The Chiefs were assigned tight end Nachi Abe and wide receiver
Masato Itai, both of the Scottish Claymores. Kawaguchi, a
linebacker for the Amsterdam Admirals, and Nakamura, a fullback
with the Rhein Fire, will stay behind after the game.
	   ``We're going to play them. They've worked very hard,'' Holmgren
said. ``They've been a pleasure to have with us. And I hope they've
had fun. We're going to get them in the game in special teams
situations for sure and then hopefully some offense and defense,
too.''
	   That is, if they can stay on schedule.
	   ``They missed curfew one night, both of them,'' Holmgren said.
``So, I had to fine them. And I'm not sure they understand that yet
_ but they will when they get their paychecks.''
	   Favre said the Packers only want to be gracious guests in the
first overseas excursion in the team's 80-year history.
	   And checking out the night spots in Tokyo couldn't hurt, right?
	   ``This trip is about having fun,'' Favre said. ``We want to win
the ballgame, but we also want to go and have fun. This may be the
first and last time a lot of guys get over there.''
	   Holmgren and Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer plan to play
their starters up to a quarter.
	   Holmgren decided not to take six injured players, including wide
receiver Robert Brooks, sidelined by a broken right pinkie.
	   ``To go over there and sit around and eat sushi and all that and
not play? It doesn't make much sense,'' Holmgren said.
	   The Packers and Chiefs will practice against each other Friday.
	   ``It'll be fun because they have a lot of guys on their team
that played here,'' Favre said.
	   Former Packers now trying to take Kansas City to the Super Bowl
include linebacker Wayne Simmons, wide receiver Andre Rison,
running back James Bostic, defensive lineman Darius Holland and
cornerbacks Matt Dorsett and Bucky Brooks.
	   That doesn't mean everybody was looking forward to the reunion.
	   ``It's a loooong flight,'' defensive tackle Santana Dotson said.
``It's the middle of training camp. We're tired, sore. So, I'm not
looking forward to sitting for so long.''
	   After their arrival, the Packers had a two-hour bus ride to the
New Otani Hotel in Tokyo before a team meeting _ and free time
until their midnight curfew.
	   Holmgren said the overseas excursion is worth the wait.
	   ``It's a long trip, but I've asked for an overseas trip,''
Holmgren said. ``I think it's a valuable thing. Forget about the
football for a second. It's a good thing for the players to
experience other places, other people, other customs. That's all
part of learning and growing up.''
	   For Kawaguchi, it's the closet thing he'll ever get to a real
NFL game.
	   ``I don't want to be embarrassed in front of my people,'' he
said. ``I just want to have a chance to show what I can do.''
	   He'll get that chance, don't worry.
	   ``Unless they miss curfew again,'' Holmgren said with a wink.

Oil pipeline leaks in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 500 metric tons (550 tons) of oil leaked
into a dry riverbed in Russia's Far East after construction workers
accidentally gouged a hole in a major pipeline, officials said
Thursday.
	   A bulldozer inadvertently opened a 15-centimeter (6-inch) hole
in a section of the pipeline near Komsomolsk-on-Amur, 6,000
kilometers (3,700 miles) east of Moscow, said Marina Ryklina, head
of the press service for Russia's Emergency Ministry.
	   Local emergency workers plugged the leak and built two small
dams to prevent the oil from spreading into the nearby Machtovayta
river, which flows into the Amur river.

Party official: Allies should prepare for early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ruling party said
Thursday that new elections could be announced any time and called
on allies to be prepared to face voters.
	   Although no election date has been fixed, the 14 component
parties of the Barisan National coalition should get ready, said
Mohamed Rahmat, secretary-general of the coalition and Malaysia's
information minister.
	   ``During these economically difficult times, we have to retain
the present government and give it stronger support so that it
could tackle increasingly serious external threats,'' Mohamed told
the state news agency, Bernama.
	   Mohamed is the first official to have indicated an early
election as Malaysia tries to deal with its worst economic crisis
since the 1980s, which threatens widespread unemployment and
inflation.
	   The last general election was held in April 1995 and the next
nationwide vote was due by 2000.
	   The final decision on election dates rests with Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who would have to formally resign and dissolve
Parliament before a snap election is announced by Malaysia's
constitutional monarch. Political parties must be given a minimum
of two weeks to campaign.
	   Mohamed urged component parties to resolve all internal problems
so that they could remain unified during elections.
	   Although there is no threat of a split in Mahathir's United
Malays National Organization, the coalition's chief constituent,
observers say the party is divided between those who support
Mahathir and those who back his younger deputy, Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   During an annual convention of UMNO last month, Mahathir crushed
dissidents, widely seen as backed by Anwar, who had raised issues
of political reform.
	   Led by a powerful youth leader, they spoke loudly about the
threat of cronyism, nepotism and corruption ruining the party's
popularity.
	   Anwar and Mahathir have differed widely on how to handle
Malaysia's recession-bound economy. While the finance minister has
preferred austerity and backed the central's bank's tight monetary
policy, Mahathir has pushed measures to boost government spending
and increase lending by banks.
	   ``UMNO must remain united. There is only one captain, be loyal
to the captain,'' Mohamed said.
	   He rejected the notion that the party was divided between ``the
president's men'' and ``the deputy president's men.''
	   The threat of a crack within the party widening into a vertical
split could be one of the triggers for a snap poll, said one
political analyst.
	   Observers also speculate that Mahathir may call general
elections before the UMNO party internal elections, allowing him to
rule out a leadership challenge before he faces the electorate.
UMNO elections are scheduled for mid-1999.

Clinton is a fine president, says Britain's Tony Blair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday offered Bill
Clinton his continuing ''100 percent support'' as the U.S.
president agreed to face questioning about his relationship with a
former White House intern.
	   Blair has had several meetings with Clinton, whom he described
as a ``very, very fine president'' and ``someone I've got a great
deal of time and respect for.'' The pair have worked closely on a
plan to bring peace to Northern Ireland.
	   ``I found him a tremendous person to work with, not just in
Northern Ireland but across a range of international issues and I
believe the American people are making the judgment that they are,
which is that he's elected to tackle the things that are
important,'' Blair said in an interview with British Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   Blair visited Washington in January, soon after news broke that
former intern Monica Lewinsky was claiming to have had an affair
with the president.
	   Under an agreement with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
announced Wednesday, Clinton will answer questions about the
relationship on videotape Aug. 17 from inside the White House with
his lawyers present. He is expected to repeat his denial of any
sexual relations.
	   ''What Bill Clinton does is a matter for Bill Clinton. I'm not
here to give advice,'' Blair told the BBC.
	   ``But I made it clear in January that he's someone that I have
100% support for and that is the case and will be the case.''
	   The two leaders are expected to meet in September, when Clinton
visits Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   Blair said political leaders need to keep focused. ``In
politics, you have got to make a decision ... You don't bother with
what's in the next day's papers, that is not what's important,'' he
said.
	   ``What is important is governing for the long-term, doing the
things the country wants and expects,'' he said.

Obuchi wins vote in Parliament's lower house for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with upper house conceding defeat in election for
prime minister in 5th graf; Declaration of new prime minister
expected by 0830 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi won the lower
house of Parliament's vote for prime minister Thursday, all but
guaranteeing he would take the helm of Japan's government as it
struggles to pull the country out of its deepest recession in
decades.
	   In a decisive victory, Obuchi snared 268 votes of the 497
ballots cast in the ruling party-controlled lower house, a
comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority. Opposition leader
Naoto Kan was the runner-up with 164 votes.
	   In a sign of the political divisions in Japan's government,
however, the opposition-dominated upper house endorsed Kan as
premier with 142 votes of the 245 votes counted. Obuchi came in
second place in that race with 103 votes in the second ballot.
	   Obuchi, however, was almost certain to become prime minister,
since the lower house has the power to overrule any upper house
decision.
	   The split vote _ the first time that has happened since 1989 _
required a conference meeting between the two chambers later in the
afternoon. After the meeting, the upper house announced that no
compromise candidate was agreed on, and the lower house was to
officially declare Obuchi the winner shortly afterward.
	   Obuchi, 61, who served as foreign minister until resigning along
with the rest of the Cabinet on Thursday morning, would succeed
Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced to quit after voter outrage over
the stumbling economy dealt the ruling party a painful defeat in
July 12 upper house elections.
	   The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart was to take over
a country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with record-high unemployment and spiraling bankruptcies.
Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   Obuchi was to name his Cabinet after being officially declared
prime minister later Thursday.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   The opposition, meanwhile, said the victory in the upper house
better represented the opinions of the voters.
	   ``The upper house results show that the vote in the lower house
does not reflect the will of the people,'' declared Kan, the
president of the Democratic Party.
	   The new prime minister's first priority would be the economy _ a
priority illustrated by the rapt attention the country has paid to
Obuchi's choice of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to head
the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   While Obuchi is widely considered a cautious leader with few
innovative ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Miyazawa,
78, is respected by many an economics expert and is an architect of
the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden banking system.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993, triggered rallies in the Tokyo markets this
week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning share prices
moved higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a
sign the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime powerbroker in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

Minneapolis woman stabbed to death in hotel room
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A 35-year-old Minneapolis woman was
stabbed to death in her hotel room in the Ugandan capital, the East
African nation's largest newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said employees at the Hotel
Equatoria found the body of Maria Cecilia Goetz Tuesday night lying
in a pool of blood in room 321 in the downtown Kampala hotel which
she had occupied since July 26.
	   ``The motive of the murder has not been established, but
investigations are in progress,'' police spokesman Bob Ngobi told
the New Vision.
	   He said Goetz body bore deep knife wounds on the lower left
abdomen and on the left side of the mouth.
	   A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy said diplomats were meeting to
discuss the case but would likely not release a statement.
	   ``We do not have anything else other than what you have from the
police,'' he said, requesting anonymity.
	   A family friend said Goetz's parents, Dr. and Mrs. Frederick
Goetz of Minneapolis, had flown to Kampala to claim her body.
	   The newspaper said Goetz, who was a programmer for East Africa
Minnesota Information Health Volunteers, had reportedly gone to a
Chinese restaurant with friends who later drove her back to the
hotel.
	   Ngobi said the hotel staff became concerned when the telephone
operator tried in vain to connect an incoming call from the United
States to her room.
	   ``There were signs of persistent struggle,'' Ngobi said. He
added that it was probable that Goetz's assailants attacked her
immediately she entered the room. He said police had found a
leather sheath that might fit the knife used to kill her.
	   Although since the beginning of the year there have been half a
dozen deaths in bomb attacks on Kampala bars and restaurants that
police attributed to rebels, the Ugandan capital is not known for
violent crime.
	   But earlier this month, a South Korean man and his wife and
their housekeeper were hacked to death in a case the police have
not yet solved.

Commerzbank profits rise 5.4 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Commerzbank's pretax profits rose 5.4
percent to 1.48 billion marks (dlrs 840 million), the bank reported
Thursday.
	   The six-month earnings were the first calculated according to
international accounting standards, and the bank did not provide
comparable 1997 figures.
	   Like most other German banks' first-half earnings performance,
Commerzbank's was negatively affected by a decline in trading
profits in the second quarter.
	   Commerzbank's first-half trading profits fell 5.3 percent to 396
million marks (dlrs 224 million) in the period, after a 2.2 percent
increase in the first quarter. A bank spokesman said the bank's
trading portfolios in stocks, bonds and foreign exchange alike all
performed more weakly.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistan air force plane crashed in a
crowded Karachi neighborhood Thursday, killing at least six people,
police said. Casualties were expected to rise.
	   Three houses burst into flames immediately after the crash, and
the fire quickly spread to other homes, trapping an unknown number
of people.
	   At least three people were injured.
	   The pilot and copilot bailed out before the plane crashed in the
western Orangi district, a densely populated, lower-middle class
neighborhood in Karachi, the port city that is Pakistan's financial
hub.
	   Rubina Abdullah, an eyewitness, said the plane crashed with a
``massive bang'' and immediately caught fire.
	   Rescue teams arrived within minutes. Military troops cordoned
off the area.
	   Air force officials confirmed the crash, but had few other
details.

	   In a decisive victory in the powerful lower house, Obuchi snared
268 votes of the 497 ballots cast in the ruling party-controlled
chamber, a comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority.
Opposition leader Naoto Kan was the runner-up with 164 votes.
	   In a sign of the political divisions in Japan's government,
however, the opposition-dominated upper house endorsed Kan as
premier with 142 votes of the 245 votes counted. Obuchi came in
second place in that race with 103 votes in the second ballot.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split over who
should be premier since 1989.

	   Obuchi, 61, who served as foreign minister until resigning along
with the rest of the Cabinet on Thursday morning, succeeds Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who was forced to quit after voter outrage over the
stumbling economy dealt the ruling party a painful defeat in July
12 upper house elections.
	   The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart takes over a
country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with record-high unemployment and spiraling bankruptcies.
Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   Obuchi was to name his Cabinet later Thursday.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   The opposition, meanwhile, said the victory in the upper house
better represented the opinions of the voters.
	   ``The upper house results show that the vote in the lower house
does not reflect the will of the people,'' declared Kan, the
president of the Democratic Party.

Dollar, stocks higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late afternoon dollar, bond, comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar gained against the yen Thursday in
trading little affected by Keizo Obuchi's march toward confirmation
as Japan's next prime minister. Tokyo stocks advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 142.30 yen at late afternoon, up 1.21 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 142.35
yen overnight.
	   It ranged between 142.02 yen and 142.55 yen in Thursday's
trading, when it was brought down from its highs by profit-taking
by overseas players and Japanese exporters.
	   After the market closed, Parliament confirmed Obuchi, the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's president, as prime minister.
	   Traders said there was little impact on the market from votes
earlier in Parliament's lower house, where Obuchi won, and in the
upper house, which chose Naoto Kan, president of the largest
opposition Democratic Party.
	   The split required consultations between representatives of the
two houses, but these were only a formality since Japanese law
gives the lower house the deciding vote on the prime minister.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his Cabinet resigned
earlier in the day. Hashimoto quit to take responsibility for a
devastating loss in July 12 upper house elections.
	   Investors are now shifting their focus away from Japanese
politics, traders said.
	   ``The results are totally in line with our expectations. We are
losing interest in politics as a trading factor since the lineup of
the new Cabinet has basically been decided,'' said Ryuichi Takami,
a senior trader at Sanwa Bank.
	   Tokyo stocks finished higher Thursday as bank shares rose on
hopes that the next government might not be so aggressive about
reforming the banking sector.
	   Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, who is expected to be
the new finance minister, is praised by many for his financial
experience and internationalism. But analysts say Miyazawa, as part
of a conservative old guard, may be reluctant to carry out bold
reforms to solve Japan's economic woes.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 43.51 points, or 0.27
percent, closing at 16,201.60. On Wednesday, the average had gained
43.55 points, also 0.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 7.49 points, or 0.60 percent, to 1,248.19. It
had slipped 1.52 points, or 0.12 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 365 million shares,
up from 347.71 million Wednesday. Advances outnumbered retreats 647
to 416, with 175 issues unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.225 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.275 percent, driving up its price up to 111.63 yen from 111.27
yen.

Henman advances in Mercedes Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Henman-Tarango match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tim Henman made the most of his dominant
service game in the second round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
	   The second-seeded Englishman had 13 aces and won 82 percent of
his first-serve points Wednesday night a 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 victory
over Jeff Tarango.
	   ``I'm pleased with the way I played,'' Henman said. ``It's ideal
to have a tough match and win. ... One of my good points is that
I'm able to turn it around. Tarango was returning a lot better and
I just put the pressure on him.''
	   Tarango led 4-3 in the first set and held on until the 10th game
when Henman broke him by aggressively covering the court with long
sweeping passing shots down the line. Henman's first serve of the
tiebreaker was the fastest of his aces, clocked at 137 mph (219
kph).
	   In the second set, Tarango was ahead 4-2, but Henman broke back.
Tarango then broke his racket across his knee and threw it into the
crowd in frustration. Henman was serving for the match when Tarango
fought back and tied it at 5. Henman won the last two games,
breaking Tarango in the 11th game.
	   Earlier Wednesday, seventh-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe beat
Gianluca Pozzi of Italy 6-3, 6-2 in just 56 minutes.
	   Guillaume Raoux of France outlasted Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark
7-6 (9-7), 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-3) in a match that lasted 2 hours, 47
minutes in temperatures that reached the high 90s Fahrenheit (mid
30s Celsius). Raoux, a semifinalist last year, upset third-seeded
Goran Ivanisevic in the opening round.
	   In another match, Michael Joyce eliminated Sargis Sargsian of
Armenia 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.
	   Black, a former collegiate star at Southern California, credited
his consistency and experience for the win.
	   ``I have a good record against him. I've beaten him five times
in a row, three times this year,'' Black said. ``I know how to play
him. I think he's psyched out against me.''
	   Black, 28, is ranked 31st in the world and has a 5-2 record
against the 33-year-old Pozzi, who is ranked 58th. He is the oldest
player currently ranked in the top 200 by the ATP Tour.
	   Black was a three-time All-America in singles and four times in
doubles and helped Southern Cal to a national title in 1991.

	   The new prime minister's first priority will be the economy _ a
priority illustrated by the rapt attention the country has paid to
Obuchi's choice of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to head
the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   While Obuchi is widely considered a cautious leader with few
innovative ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Miyazawa,
78, is respected by many an economics expert and is an architect of
the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden banking system.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993, triggered rallies in the Tokyo markets this
week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday share prices moved
higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a sign
the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime powerbroker in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

U.N. arms inspector in Beijing for discussions on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler began
discussions with Chinese officials Thursday on how to maintain
pressure on Iraq to reveal more about its weapons programs, China's
Foreign Ministry said.
	   Butler met Wang Guangya, an adviser to Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, and will hold further talks Friday with Vice Premier Qian
Qichen before leaving Beijing, the ministry said.
	   Butler was seeking China's support for continuing sanctions on
Iraq until his team can answer remaining questions about Baghdad's
nuclear and biological weapons program.
	   China has urged Iraq to cooperate with Butler's team. But along
with Russia and France, it has called for a speedy conclusion of
weapons inspections and an end to sanctions imposed on Iraq after
the 1990 Gulf War.
	   One of five permanent U.N. Security Council members, China has
defended Iraq's right to limit U.N. access to some sites and
opposed using military force to compel Iraq to comply with
inspectors' demands.
	   That has pitted it against the United States and Britain _ other
permanent Security Council members that have taken a much harder
line on Iraq _ and propelled it into a struggle to win support from
the council's 10 non-permanent members.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Two more teams angrily quit the
Tour de France on Thursday, bringing to five the number that have
left the race after one was thrown out in a widening drug scandal.
	   Since 1903, the only things have halted the world's most
prestigious cycling competition have been the two World Wars.
	   Now, three days away from the Paris finish line, the Tour is
verge of stopping again. Race organizers are scrambling to calm a
rider revolt over repeated police searches and testing in the drug
investigation.
	   Early Thursday the Spanish teams of Kelme and Vitalcio joined
ONCE, Riso-Scotti and Banesto in quitting the competition.
	   ``The riders were insulted in the climb to Revard by the Spanish
public,'' said Alvaro Pino, director of the Spanish team Kelme,
referring to one of the Alpine peaks in Wednesday's segment. ``We
received some threats.''
	   The team's Fernando Escartin was in fourth place in the overall
standings in the three-week race.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
With Thursday's pullouts, all four Spanish teams were out of the
race.
	   The 18th stage was scheduled to start at 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT)
in Aix-les-Bains and head to Neuchatel, Switzerland, 218 kilometers
(135.5 miles).
	   But the drug probe was pressing on. Shortly before midnight
Wednesday, police detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team,
the Francaise des Jeux team director Marc Madiot, and an unnamed
doctor, judicial sources said.

	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Monica Seles used experience and
stamina to outlast unseeded challenger Fang Li 2-6, 6-2, 6-1
Wednesday night in the Bank of the West women's tournament.
	   Li came out strong, making some seemingly impossible shots
against the second-seeded Seles, who is ranked No. 6 in the world.
But the more experienced Seles appeared unruffled as she easily
took the next two sets.
	   In the other late match Wednesday, Steffi Graf defeated Mary Joe
Fernandez 6-4, 6-0. The fourth-seeded Graf, ranked No. 57, has a
15-0 career record against Fernandez.
	   Seles, who won this tournament in 1990 and 1992, had the crowd
on her side, especially after her frustrating first set. The
sellout crowd at Stanford University peppered her with shouts of
``C'mon Monica'' and enthusiastic applause.
	   ``I just think it was pure luck. I just hung in there and few
points went my way,'' Seles said. ``My timing was so late. I knew
that would happen after playing on clay in Spain.''
	   Li, who won four satellite events in 1997, defeated No. 63
Nathalie Dechy of France to face Seles, who had a first-round bye.
	   Graf appeared to be frustrated in the first set against
Fernandez, shaking her head after missed shots. Her frustration was
enhanced by a fault call, which she briefly argued. In the second
set, the frustration was passed to Fernandez, currently ranked No.
49.
	   ``I just tried to stay with her and not try to do too much,''
Graf said. ``You have to wait for your chances and you have to be
patient.''
	   After an eight-month layoff because of knee surgery, Graf
returned to tennis in February at Hanover, then injured a hamstring
in her next tournament at Indian Wells. The Bank of the West is
just her eighth tournament this year.
	   ``I try to improve from game to game,'' Graf said. ``There are
certain things that you can continue to work on. I need to continue
to show that kind of tennis.
	   ``Every match I play puts me a step further to where I want to
be,'' she said.
	   Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport, ranked third in the world, took
less than an hour to beat Kimberly Po 6-1, 6-3 Wednesday.
	   Davenport, who has reached the quarterfinals in all but two of
the 12 tournaments she has played this year, was never in trouble
against Po, who is ranked No. 56 in the world.
	   ``She's a dangerous opponent,'' Davenport said. ``I've lost to
her before. I was trying to mix it up a little and thought to do
some stuff different. That seemed to work.''
	   In other matches, fifth-seeded Natasha Zvereva of Belarus
defeated Tara Snyder 6-3, 6-4, and Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France
defeated Joanette Kruger of South Africa 6-3, 7-6 (8-6).
	   Davenport beat Po 6-2, 6-2 in the first round of the French Open
this year.
	   ``I knew she would be better this time around,'' Davenport said.
``She's not at the same level she was last spring (Po was ranked in
the top 20) but I think she'll get back there.''
	   Davenport said she's trying not to rely on hitting the ball hard
all the time.
	   ``I still want to be aggressive, but I have to learn to be able
to do different things,'' she said. ``That can pull you through
some bad days.''

Keizo Obuchi declared Japan's new prime minister

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi was declared
Japan's next prime minister after a vote in Parliament on Thursday,
taking the helm of Japan's government as it struggles to pull the
country out of its deepest recession in decades.
	   In a decisive victory in the powerful lower house, Obuchi snared
268 votes of the 497 ballots cast in the ruling party-controlled
chamber, a comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority.
Opposition leader Naoto Kan was the runner-up with 164 votes.
	   In a sign of the political divisions in Japan's government,
however, the opposition-dominated upper house endorsed Kan as
premier with 142 votes of the 245 votes counted. Obuchi came in
second place in that race with 103 votes in the second ballot.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split over who
should be premier since 1989.
	   Obuchi, 61, who served as foreign minister until resigning along
with the rest of the Cabinet on Thursday morning, succeeds Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who was forced to quit after voter outrage over the
stumbling economy dealt the ruling party a painful defeat in July
12 upper house elections.
	   The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart takes over a
country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with record-high unemployment and spiraling bankruptcies.
Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   Obuchi was to name his Cabinet later Thursday.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   The opposition, meanwhile, said the victory in the upper house
better represented the opinions of the voters.
	   ``The upper house results show that the vote in the lower house
does not reflect the will of the people,'' declared Kan, the
president of the Democratic Party.
	   The new prime minister's first priority will be the economy _ a
priority illustrated by the rapt attention the country has paid to
Obuchi's choice of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to head
the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   While Obuchi is widely considered a cautious leader with few
innovative ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Miyazawa,
78, is respected by many an economics expert and is an architect of
the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden banking system.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993, triggered rallies in the Tokyo markets this
week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday share prices moved
higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a sign
the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime powerbroker in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

Police detain suspect in bar shooting in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police in the Black Sea city of Odessa
detained a man suspected of killing three people in a bar quarrel,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The shooting last month was apparently triggered by the refusal
of the ``To and From'' bar owners to serve the man, 32-year-old
Vyacheslav Yarlykov, who turned up when a private party was
underway.
	   The drunken suspect first threatened the owners with a pistol,
which they seized, authorities said. The man then ran to his home
nearby, returned with another pistol and began firing
indiscriminately, killing the bar owner, his son and their friend,
according to authorities.
	   Odessa police officials said a 40-man investigative team was
involved in the capture of Yarlykov, who managed to avoid arrest by
hiding in at least nine different houses provided by city
residents, Kievskiye Vedomosti reported.

Daimler-Benz earnings jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz AG reported earnings of
3.8 billion marks (dlrs 2.1 billion) in the first six months of the
year, more than twice 1997's first half results of 1.8 billion
marks and much higher than expected.
	   ``In the first half year, Daimler-Benz achieved the best results
in the history of the firm,'' chairman Juergen Schrempp said in a
statement. ``That means we are extremely well prepared for the
merger to DaimlerChrysler.''
	   Germany's biggest industrial group said all its divisions
reported double-digit sales growth, led by Daimler-Benz sales in
the United States, which jumped 43 percent to almost 16 billion
marks (dlrs 8.9 billion).
	   At a news conference in Frankfurt, the Stuttgart-based company
said the positive trend should continue in the second half. It also
revised upwards for the second time this year its 1998 group sales
target to 140 billion marks (dlrs 79 billion), from 134 billion
marks.
	   Operating profit in the group's commercial vehicle division
outperformed that of all other units in the first half, swinging to
a 870 million mark (dlrs 487 million) profit from a 9 million mark
loss a year earlier, Daimler said.
	   ``Next to the strong growth in sales in almost all business
areas, instrumental for the renewed climb in profits was the
program we started last year to increase productivity, which since
then has been almost completely implemented,'' said Manfred Gentz,
Daimler's chief financial officer.
	   Daimler said it will publish a report late next week that will
detail the planned merger with Chrysler Corp, announced in May.
Shareholders of both companies will vote on the link-up at separate
meetings on Sept. 18.
	   Daimler said its shareholders will be able to exchange shares in
the old Daimler for those of the merged DaimlerChrysler from Sept.
24-Oct. 23.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistan air force plane crashed in a
crowded Karachi neighborhood Thursday, killing at least six people
on the ground, police said.
	   At least three people were injured, and casualties were expected
to rise.
	   Three houses burst into flames immediately after the crash, and
the fire quickly spread to other homes, trapping an unknown number
of people.
	   The six bodies were pulled from the houses, burned beyond
recognition. They appeared to be the bodies of children. The
afternoon crash came at a time when mostly women and children would
be home.
	   The pilot and co-pilot bailed out before the plane crashed in
the western Orangi district, a densely populated, lower-middle
class neighborhood in Karachi, the port city that is Pakistan's
financial hub.
	   Dozens of fire trucks rushed to the scene. Troops cordoned off
the area as hundreds of residents rushed from work, anxious about
relatives.
	   Rubina Abdullah, an eyewitness, said the plane crashed with a
``massive bang'' and immediately caught fire.
	   Air force officials confirmed the crash, saying the plane was a
Chinese-made fighter trainer. They had few other details.
	   Earlier Thursday in neighboring India, a commercial propeller
aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Cochin, 2,000
kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of New Delhi. All six persons on
board were killed, Indian news agencies reported.

Minister cautions Asian countries against turning inward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ New Zealand's minister of trade and foreign
affairs cautioned Asian countries Thursday against turning inward
in reaction to the region's economic problems.
	   Don McKinnon told a meeting of the Asia Society that New Zealand
was not sure that all Asian countries would withstand a series of
risks stemming from the crisis.
	   ``The first is the real risk that, as those countries most
affected by economic downturn focus on their domestic problems,
they will lose the courage needed for continuing trade
liberalization,'' McKinnon said.
	   While the temptation to slow trade liberalization to focus on
domestic problems was understandable, it was counterproductive, he
said.
	   ``To do this would be to ignore the most important lesson of the
crisis _ that in today's globalized and information-linked world,
no economy is an island,'' he added.
	   Turning inward also could invite a backlash from the United
States and Europe, seeking to protect themselves from being swamped
by cheap Asian exports, he said.
	   Asian countries also should avoid the temptation to blame the
influence of Western management and markets for Asia's problems, he
said.
	   Later, the minister told reporters that New Zealand would reduce
tariffs by 2005, well ahead of a 2010 deadline for members of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping.

Ukrainian opposition activist wounded in shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An assailant shot and wounded an opposition
activist whose group has been sharply critical of the Ukrainian
government, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Serhiy Odarych, chairman of the private Ukrainian Perspective
group, was shot in the leg before dawn Wednesday in the capital
Kiev as he was returning home, the Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper
said.
	   Odarych told the newspaper that a man approached and introduced
himself as a ``well-wisher,'' but then told him to stop his
political activities. When Odarych refused to talk to the man, he
opened fire, wounding Odarych, the paper said.
	   ``I rushed to the entrance as quickly as the wound would allow
me and called my wife. Luckily, we live on the first floor, so she
immediately came out,'' Odarych told Kievskiye Vedomosti from his
hospital bed.
	   The attacker fled and no one has been arrested in the case.
Odarych told the newspaper he did not know who was responsible for
the attack.
	   Odarych's group is often critical of the Ukrainian government
and President Leonid Kuchma.
	   Police were investigating the attack but had no immediate
comment.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With an estimated plunge of 80
percent in car sales in Southeast Asia, Japanese car makers plan to
boost the export of auto parts outside Asia.
	   Japanese automobile executives also said they would depend less
on imported parts from the United States and instead spur
industrial activity within Asia by purchasing car components made
by countries within the region.
	   Senior automobile officials from Japan and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations met Thursday to discuss the region's auto
industry.
	   ``Automobile production in Asia has reached a critical
situation,'' said Masao Omichi, director of the automobile division
in Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
	   ``Private Japanese companies operating in Southeast Asia are
striving ... to urgently expand export performance and to maintain
employment,'' he said, but did not specify which countries Japan
would be targeting for exports.
	   Big Japanese car companies such as Toyota, Nissan and Mazda have
900 factories overseas, 60 percent of these in Southeast Asia.
	   Car sales in the region have dropped precipitously since the
prolonged economic crisis sweeping through Asia has caused stock
markets and currencies in various countries to tumble by more than
50 percent.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Thursday it has
lowered its rating outlook for Sumitomo Bank Ltd., one day after
the bank announced a tie-up with Daiwa Securities Co. in investment
banking.
	   The U.S. credit rating agency said it lowered its outlook for
Sumitomo's credit rating to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' It said
the tie-up was risky for Sumitomo because of ``Daiwa's very weak
financial condition.''
	   Moody's also said it would continue to review Daiwa's ``Baa3''
rating for a possible downgrade. A cut would drop Daiwa's debt into
the ranks of ``speculative'' or ``junk'' investments.
	   Moody's did not change its ``A2'' rating on Sumitomo's deposits,
but the ``negative'' outlook means there is a greater chance the
agency will lower it sometime soon. A lower rating is associated
with higher risk and could force Sumitomo to pay higher interest
rates to attract depositors.
	   The decision followed the bank's announcement Wednesday that it
will put up 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.05 billion) to form joint
venture companies with Daiwa.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa said they will establish three joint venture
companies that will start operations next April.
	   The tie-up is the latest move in a continuing consolidation in
Japan's financial industry following a series of reforms, dubbed
the ``Big Bang,'' aimed at invigorating the economy by opening up
markets to greater competition.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's first Islamic banking service will
be launched Friday by one of the island republic's largest
financial institutions, the bank said Thursday.
	   Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., otherwise known as OCBC Bank,
will initially introduce two types of accounts in its newly formed
Islamic Banking Unit, which conforms to Muslim law.
	   The Islamic code prohibits usury, the practice of charging or
earning interest on money. About 15 percent of multi-ethnic
Singapore's 3.1 million people are Muslim.
	   In practice, Islamic banks provide for profits or dividends
instead of interest, though returns are not guaranteed and any
losses must be shared by the bank and depositor.
	   Such accounts must also invest only in certain products,
companies or financial instruments that conform with Islamic law,
said a spokeswoman for the bank.
	   According to a Thursday report in The Straits Times newspaper,
the potential market in Singapore for Islamic banking comprises
200,000 Muslims above 12 years of age, thousands of Muslim
companies and organizations and more than 70 mosques.
	   In late 1995, Finance Minister Richard Hu approved the
establishment of Islamic banking services in Singapore, according
to the newspaper.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ One of Singapore's big four banks is expected
to announce a huge drop in profits for the first half of 1998
because of the regional economic crisis, analysts said Thursday.
	   United Overseas Bank Ltd. will likely post a 60 to 70 percent
fall in net profit when it announces it half-year results later
Friday, the first Singapore bank to unveil interim results this
season.
	   The plunge in profits is primarily due to large provisions for
bad loans and investments in the region, as economic and financial
conditions deteriorate in Asia, market observers told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   The bank will probably write off about 200 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 116 million) for the first half of this year,
dragging down its total earnings, said DIR Singapore analyst Tony
Raza.
	   The provisions are ``due to poor loan quality within the region
and due to the tougher economic environment in Singapore,'' Raza
said.
	   He added that most of the bank's loans in countries hardest hit
by the crisis, such as Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, will
take a significant write-off.
	   In the first half of 1997, United Overseas Bank posted a 13
percent rise in net profit to 397 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
231 million).\

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Cheap deals for tourists are plentiful
in Indonesia these days. On Thursday, some were free, all part of a
bid to lure visitors back to the troubled nation.
	   In a government campaign dubbed ``Let's Go Indonesia!,''
foreigners arriving in the country were treated to vouchers for
free hotel rooms and meals as well as free or discounted air
tickets.
	   Asia's currency crisis and recent riots over price increases in
Indonesia have battered the once-robust tourism industry in the
nation of 200 million people. Political turmoil forced former
President Suharto to quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   Some foreigners have stayed away, fearing more violence. Many
tourists from economically struggling Thailand and South Korea no
longer have the cash to vacation abroad.
	   ``What we faced was a crisis of confidence,'' said Alistair
Speirs, manager of the dlrs 10 million promotional campaign. ``Some
markets have dried up pretty drastically.''
	   Officials predict that 3.6 million tourists will visit Indonesia
by the end of 1998, 30 percent down from last year.
	   Under the deal, tourists flying into the international airports
in Jakarta and the resort island of Bali received a free night in a
hotel, a free meal, a free tour and free entry to recreational
parks.
	   Tourists arriving on the national carrier Garuda got a
complimentary return ticket to any destination in Indonesia.

	   CHIOS, Greece (AP) _ Anti-terrorist police investigated the
death Thursday of a soldier killed when a hand grenade exploded in
his car near the airport on this eastern Aegean island, an army
announcement said.
	   Authorities became suspicious after a search of Sgt. Maj.
Constantinos Karelis' home revealed two clocks and wires which may
have been intended for use in an explosive device.
	   The search took place after Karelis, 24, was found dead in his
car early Thursday. The hand grenade that caused the explosion was
``an old type not used by the Greek army,'' the army said.

Villages in flames: Serbs roust Albanian rebels -- and civilians
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Everyone is gone.
	   The cafe loungers, vegetable vendors, cigarette peddlers and
their towers of cartons, the doctors and patients in the hospital
down the dusty road: by Wednesday, all had fled the Serb police
blistering of Albanian rebels who just days ago controlled this
town as a headquarters.
	   The vacancy and silence of Malisevo were stark evidence of how
Serb forces fighting to keep control of Kosovo province have wiped
the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army from strategic towns and
roads in recent days.
	   Malisevo (Mal-ee-SHAVE-o) is just part of the picture. The smell
of charcoal filled the air Wednesday from smoldering Albanian
villages along 60 kilometers (37 miles) of road, and fresh flames
leaping from rooftops late in the day indicated a burning operation
was still underway.
	   Ethnic Albanian civilians fleeing the recent fighting have
swelled a refugee population already estimated at more than 100,000
after five months of fighting. Some KLA rebels apparently fled into
the hills east of Malisevo, where the crack of artillery fire could
be heard from the road.
	   The six-day Serb offensive, which drove the rebels from this
town, followed frustration by American and European diplomats in
convincing the rebels to join moderate Albanian politicians in
peace talks with the Serb-led government.
	   The absence of any Western condemnation of the Serb operation
indicates major powers are not altogether displeased with the KLA
rout.
	   Serbs were vague about how many police took part in the
fighting, saying only ``a sufficient number.'' They claimed no
civilians had been killed.
	   Compared to the burning villages, Malisevo was relatively
undamaged. Serb police said they encountered little resistance, and
the KLA had apparently started retreating as early as Monday.
	   Rebel headquarters -- usually guarded by stern-faced men in
black uniforms -- was empty Wednesday except for sacks of green
peppers, jugs of gasoline and boxes of aid from the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Broken glass covered the sidewalks. A wedding apparel store had
been ransacked, its accounting book open in the street and its
mannequin grotesquely stripped of its arms and its aqua dress.
	   Out on the road between the cities of Pec and Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, cars vibrated from the ruts cut by Serb tanks. KLA
blockades had been bulldozed aside, leaving a mess of sandbags,
bricks and wrecked cars.
	   Red, white and blue Serb flags flew from telephone poles at
empty gas stations. But even as Serb forces claimed victory, they
warned that sections of the road were unsafe from KLA guerrillas
and land mines.
	   In the town of Kijevo, grinning young boys helped police unload
green crates of ammunition and boxes of food for newly established
Serb posts. Under police guard, an Albanian family of five sat in
the beds of two open trucks -- three men in one, women huddling
arm-in-arm in the other.
	   Sacer Krasniqi, the father, said his family was feeling its home
village when Serb police stopped their car. Police found a gun --
``just a hobby thing'' Krasniqi explained -- and 700 German marks.
	   ``When police shot at us, we ran away (from the village). There
were bombardments, children were crying,'' he said. ``My son ran
with his children but I don't know where he is. I don't know if my
house is burned or anything about the fate of my family.''
	   Serb police said they were not ``mistreating'' their captives,
whose destination was not explained.
	   Down the road a few kilometers (miles), in the village of
Drenovac, an elderly Serb stood in his yard. He was one of the last
of 2,000 people left.
	   ``Every day there's still shooting,'' he said, waiving his arms
to indicate his Albanian neighbors had all fled.
	   In the city of Pec, European Union vehicles stood parked outside
a hotel, part of a diplomatic mission that has been weighing the
damage in Kosovo for about three weeks.
	   On Wednesday, representatives of Austria, Britain and Germany
met with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose pacifist ways
have put him at odds with the bellicose KLA.
	   Back on the road to Pristina, a tractor pulled a flatbed with 11
Albanian refugees, their faces smudged with dirt and the elderly
women wearing head scarves.
	   They were headed for their relatives in a village near the
capital. ``Right now, they're shooting in the hills above my
house,'' said Mehmed Isufi.
	   The tractor puttered down the road. Going the other way were two
buses packed with Serb police, headed for Malisevo in an apparent
move to repopulate the town as a Serb stronghold.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ South Asian leaders met privately
Thursday in a seaside resort to discuss how they can increase trade
among themselves and move closer toward setting up a regional
common market.
	   Officials fear it may take up to 10 years to set up a free trade
zone in South Asia, along the lines of the European Union, given
the low volume of business among the seven member countries of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC.
	   The leaders are expected to approve recommendations by their
foreign ministers to ease visa restrictions to promote tourism,
establish direct air links between their capitals, and simplify
customs formalities.
	   The other proposals deal with uniform environmental standards,
cooperation in dealing with natural disasters, improving
telecommunication links, and promoting women's and child welfare.
	   Discussion on economic ties was expected to dominate the meeting
at Bentota, 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of Colombo, now that a
crucial meeting between the region's two largest nations is over.
	   Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif
of Pakistan met on the sidelines Wednesday to resume discussions on
their nations' 50-year-old dispute over the Himalayan territory of
Kashmir and other differences.
	   The two leaders had sought a neutral country for their meeting
rather than meet in each other's capitals following the nuclear
tests in both countries in May.
	   Leaders of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, the
Maldives and Bangladesh began a daylong meeting at Bentota mostly
without aides. Details of their discussions were not immediately
available.
	   India and host Sri Lanka, the main proponents of the free trade
zone, called for urgent steps to at least put a treaty in place by
the year 2001.
	   India, the largest of the SAARC nations, unilaterally announced
Wednesday a lowering of tariffs and import quotas to allay the
fears of Pakistan and other smaller countries that their markets
will be swamped by Indian goods.
	   Addressing the inaugural session of the SAARC summit Wednesday,
Vajpayee offered free trade agreements to neighbors interested in
moving faster in that direction. He also announced the lifting of
import restrictions on 2,000 goods and offered speedy clearance of
investment proposals in India of up to dlrs 15 million.

Keizo Obuchi declared Japan's new prime minister

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi was declared
Japan's next prime minister after a vote in Parliament on Thursday,
defeating a challenge from a popular opposition leader and taking
the helm as Japan struggles with its deepest recession in decades.
	   In a decisive victory in the powerful lower house, Obuchi snared
268 votes of the 497 ballots cast in the ruling party-controlled
chamber, a comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority.
Opposition leader Naoto Kan was the runner-up with 164 votes.
	   Signalling the political divisions in Japan's government,
however, the opposition-dominated upper house endorsed Kan _
considered the country's most popular politician _ as premier with
142 votes of the 245 votes counted. Obuchi came in second place in
that race.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   Obuchi, 61, who served as foreign minister until resigning along
with the rest of the Cabinet on Thursday morning, succeeds Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who was forced to quit after voter outrage over the
stumbling economy dealt the ruling party a painful defeat in July
12 upper house elections.
	   Obuchi grinned in satisfaction during the vote and later
announcement. He later made the rounds for traditional greetings at
the offices of political parties. After announcing his Cabinet
later Thursday, the group will go to the Imperial Palace to present
themselves before Emperor Akihito.
	   But the longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart takes over a
country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with record-high unemployment and spiraling bankruptcies.
Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing threat
of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   The opposition, meanwhile, said the victory in the upper house
better represented the opinions of the voters.
	   ``The upper house results show that the vote in the lower house
does not reflect the will of the people,'' declared Kan, the
president of the Democratic Party.
	   The new prime minister's first priority will be the economy _ a
priority illustrated by the rapt attention the country has paid to
Obuchi's choice of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to head
the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   While Obuchi is widely considered a cautious leader with few
innovative ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, Miyazawa,
78, is respected by many an economics expert and is an architect of
the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden banking system.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993, triggered rallies in the Tokyo markets this
week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday share prices moved
higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a sign
the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime powerbroker in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi
Sakaiya, a writer and former bureaucrat, was expected to be named
director-general of the Economic Planning Agency.

Japan plans to boost car exports from Southeast Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With car sales in Southeast Asia
expected to plunge 80 percent this year, Japanese car makers plan
to boost the export of auto parts outside Asia.
	   Japanese automobile executives also said they would depend less
on imported parts from the United States and instead spur
industrial activity within Asia by buying car components made by
countries within the region.
	   Senior automobile officials from Japan and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations met Thursday to discuss the region's auto
industry.
	   ``Automobile production in Asia has reached a critical
situation,'' said Masao Omichi, director of the automobile division
in Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
	   ``Private Japanese companies operating in Southeast Asia are
striving ... to urgently expand export performance and to maintain
employment,'' he said, but did not specify which countries Japan
would be targeting for exports.
	   Big Japanese car companies such as Toyota, Nissan and Mazda have
900 factories overseas, 60 percent of these in Southeast Asia.
	   Car sales in the region have dropped precipitously since an
economic crisis began sweeping through Asia a year ago. It has
caused stock markets and currencies in various countries to tumble
by more than 50 percent.
	   The number of cars sold in Southeast Asia is expected to plunge
as much as 80 percent in 1998 from the 1.5 million sold last year,
according to statistics compiled by the ASEAN Automotive
Federation.
	   Industry executives estimate sales this year will amount to
fewer than 500,000 vehicles.
	   ``If this slowdown continues, it could do major damage to the
future of the (region's) auto industry,'' Omichi warned, adding
that the regional market should support at least 1 million vehicles
to ensure efficiency and keep costs down.
	   ``The prime challenge confronted by the Southeast Asian auto
industry is how to bring the market back,'' he said.
	   Japanese car executives at the conference, attended by more than
160 companies from nine countries, have pledged to help their
Southeast Asian counterparts improve the quality of products so
they can be sold in developed countries.
	   Some of these measures include training more than 2,000 people
from around the region, strengthening the links between Japanese
and Southeast Asian suppliers and dealers, Omichi said.

Seven Kosovo Albanians killed in road accident as they flee border
</HEADLINE>
officers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A driver trying to smuggle a truckload of Kosovo
Albanians into Germany sped through a road block at 120 kilometers
(75 miles) an hour, crashing the truck against a stone wall and
killing at least seven refugees.
	   At least 15 other Kosovo Albanians were seriously injured.
	   Germany border officials erected a road block to stop the truck
about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the Czech border early Thursday
after noticing that the truck's windows had been covered with foil.
	   Instead of stopping the driver sped up, crashing through the
blockade then losing control on a curve, officials said.
	   A Czech man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling refugees, and
a second man was being sought.
	   A few hours after the crash, another Czech driver with four
refugees from Yugoslavia were arrested south of Dresden when the
driver broke through another road block. No one was injured.
	   The number of ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia seeking asylum in
Germany has jumped in recent months as Serb police crackdown on the
Albanian majority in Kosovo province.

Hyundai Motor issues `final offer' to striking workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co. on Thursday issued
what it said was its final offer for 1,820 striking workers to take
early retirement or face outright dismissal.
	   But the workers, along with some 3,000 sympathetic colleagues,
kept the company's main plants in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, idle for the 11th day, vowing to continue their
struggle until they are granted job security.
	   The company's offer was contained in thousands of leaflets
dropped by helicopter over the plants where the workers have been
picketing since July 19.
	   ``Today is the last day you can apply for voluntary
retirement,'' the leaflets said. ``Tomorrow, you will be fired.''
	   Thursday was the deadline set by the company for the 1,820
workers to take early retirement with extra bonuses, or face
outright dismissal.
	   Hyundai's management said it has no alternative but to eliminate
redundant manpower to save the country's No. 1 automaker from its
deep financial problems.
	   Hyundai has been pushing to lay off 2,687 workers since June. Of
that number, 867 workers have taken early retirement with higher
benefits in the past week, reducing the number to be laid off to
1,820.
	   Some 5,000 workers were holed up in the plant grounds, sleeping
in tents and shouting slogans demanding job security in daily
rallies.
	   ``What the management calls voluntary retirement is not
voluntary at all. We are not giving up our fight,'' said a
statement from the 26,000-member union, one of the nation's most
militant.
	   Thousands of riot police were deployed around the plant to guard
against violence.
	   Hyundai plants have a combined capacity of 1.25 million cars a
year. But its plants are operating at 40 percent of that capacity
amid a severe economic slowdown.
	   The company shed some 5,000 workers in early retirement earlier
this year. It also plans to put an additional 530 employees on
unpaid two-year leave this weekend.
	   South Korea's economy was bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund in December, under strict conditions aimed at making
business more efficient. With bankruptcies mounting, more than 1.5
million workers have been driven out of their jobs.

Two Britons killed in fall at Zimbabwe cascade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Police Thursday were investigating how
two Britons plunged to their deaths at the 100-foot (33-meter) high
Sohwe Falls, 110 miles north of here in the Mavuradonha Mountains.
	   A British official said Deborah Coleman, 31, a teacher for the
past two years at Harare's International School, was killed
together with visitor George Irwen, 33, from Kent, when they fell
from the top of the falls Tuesday afternoon.
	   The official Zimbabwe Information Service said Irwen was
attempting to take photographs of the sheer precipice when he lost
his footing and fell with Coleman.
	   Irwen's wife Emma and 1-year-old son William were with the pair
but were uninjured.
	   Coleman's Zimbabwean husband, Anton Bourdillon, a member of the
staff at Harare's College of Music, went to the scene. Searchers in
a helicopter and police divers were trying to recover the bodies
from a deep rock pool.
	   The falls are one of many along the course of the Sohwe River as
it cascades into Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley, and signs warn visitors
of the danger from loose and slippery rocks.

Prime Minister admits underground economy is flourishing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prime Minister Radu Vasile has accused
authorities of failing to stem the rise of the underground economy,
which accounted for up to 35 percent of economic activity last
year, the daily Adevarul reported on Thursday.
	   Vasile accused the police, justice and finance officials as well
as politicians of ``standing in the way of reforms, privatization
and ... a balanced budget.''
	   He spoke Wednesday in the central city of Ramnicu Valcea during
national festivities. Vasile, who was appointed four months ago
after his predecessor resigned, vowed to reorganize the justice and
police departments because official have not carried out their
duties.
	   In the past couple of years intelligence chiefs said the
underground economy was amounting to up to 38 percent of the
overall economy and billions go untaxed.
	   Since the 1989 overthrow of communism, Romania has been plagued
by corruption and red tape. Reformists won elections in 1996,
promising to clean up corruption, but have not done so.
	   The average salary in Romania is about 850,000 lei (dlrs 100),
inflation was 24 percent for the first half of 1998, and purchasing
power has slumped in the past two years. The local currency, the
leu, is overvalued, causing a drop in exports.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi says she was kidnapped by government

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi accused
the military government Thursday of kidnapping her to end a six-day
roadside stalemate, saying police held her down, took the wheel of
her car and forcibly drove her back to the capital.
	   A spokesman for the military government admitted it had ended
Suu Kyi's protest against her will.
	   ``The government had no choice but to take the initiative to
break the standoff by sending her to Yangon,' Col. Hla Min said at
a news conference Thursday.
	   Described by colleagues as ill and running low on food, the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner was driven back to her compound by a
police driver who took the wheel of her white sedan as it sat
parked on a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital.
	   Authorities had stopped her there Friday morning as she tried to
drive to the provincial city of Bassein to meet party members.
	   ``I was kidnapped. They even stole my car,'' U Lwin, a member of
her party, quoted Suu Kyi as saying after returning home. He added
that she was furious.
	   She arrived back in Yangon at about 10:20 p.m. (1450 GMT)
Wednesday. Party leaders said Thursday she had been determined to
continue the standoff until the government agreed to open a
dialogue with her and her party, something the generals have
refused to do.
	   After examining Suu Kyi, her doctors said she had a large bruise
on her wrist from being manhandled by police, but her spirits were
high.
	   She also vowed to continue her attempts to travel outside Yangon
to meet party members as soon as she is well, they said.
	   According to leaders of Suu Kyi's political party, the National
League for Democracy, who gave a news conference Thursday, two
policewomen grabbed Suu Kyi inside her car to restrain her
Wednesday night as she lay in the back seat with a 104-degree
Fahrenheit (40 C) fever.
	   At the same time, policemen forcibly ejected Suu Kyi's
colleagues from the front seat and took the wheel of her car so
they could drive her back to the capital.
	   Asked at Thursday's government news conference to describe how
Suu Kyi was taken back to Yangon, Hla Min told reporters to ask the
opposition.
	   Suu Kyi did not attend her party's news conference because ``she
is not well enough. She is still very, very weak,'' said Tin Oo,
the NLD vice chairman.
	   Tin Oo denied a government statement that he and party leaders
tried to persuade Suu Kyi to return home Wednesday evening. He said
they went to try to give her food and were prevented by police.
	   Speaking in Sydney, Australia, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called the government's actions ``an unacceptable
violation of human rights,'' and added it ``will only contribute to
the further isolation of Burma.'' Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   Hla Min accused Suu Kyi of staging the incident so that ``Mrs.
Albright could berate Myanmar and induce other governments to put
pressure on Myanmar.''
	   Suu Kyi's ``objective has been achieved, and so it was time to
break the standoff,'' he said, adding the government had acted on
the advice of Suu Ky's doctors.
	   NLD Chairman Aung Shwe vehemently denied that Thursday, saying
the doctors never told the authorities to send Suu Kyi home.
	   Prior to her return, the military told diplomats that she had no
health problems, and that the democracy leader's trip outside
Yangon had been stopped to avert possible disturbances, diplomatic
sources said.
	   Suu Kyi's party follows a policy of non-violence, and no riots
or disturbances have been associated with her trips or public
speeches.
	   Suu Kyi has attempted to travel outside Yangon three times this
month, and been stopped each time by the government.
	   The military has allowed her to leave Yangon only once since her
release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She visited a
Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has blocked Suu Kyi's home,
refusing journalists entry and restricting access by diplomats and
party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.

Israel considering release of 100 Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid efforts to restart peace talks, Israel is
considering a goodwill gesture: the release of 100 Palestinian
prisoners, officials said Thursday.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is looking into the
request for a prisoner release made earlier this week by Yasser
Arafat's top deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, Kahalani's spokeswoman said.
	   According to the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu supports the move and has asked Kahalani to draw
up a list of prisoners to be freed.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak refused to comment on the
report.
	   With Israel-Palestinian relations at a low point, such a release
would be aimed at building confidence and getting peace efforts
back on track.
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago, and at the urging of the
Clinton administration, the two sides have been holding direct
meetings for the past 11 days to try to revive them.
	   So far, no breakthrough has occurred. More talks were set later
Thursday between Cabinet Secretary Danny Neveh and Abbas.
	   Israel is under pressure to accept an American-authored peace
initiative calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already approved
the initiative, but Netanyahu is balking.
	   Netanyahu received a sharp reproach Wednesday from lawmakers
over his handling of the peace talks. They voted overwhelmingly in
favor of a preliminary measure that would help set the stage for
early elections.
	   The vote was seen as a sign of dissatisfaction across the
political spectrum with the prime minister's stance on the
Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, the Israeli army demolished three Palestinian homes
Thursday outside the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Human rights groups say the pace of such demolitions _ usually
carried out because a homebuilder lacked a permit _ has increased
sharply in recent months. Palestinians say it is almost impossible
for them to obtain building permits from Israel.
	   ``This is state terror _ this is Netanyahu's peace,'' said
32-year-old Ahmed Murqaktan, a father of eight whose home was among
those demolished Thursday.

Foreign medical teams prepare to leave Papua New Guinea disaster

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ An international medical
team will leave this weekend after two weeks of helping Papua New
Guinea provide emergency care for victims of its tsunami disaster,
officials said Thursday.
	   The announcement that the 199 personnel from Australia, New
Zealand and the United States would be withdrawn came as disaster
control authorities announced that the death toll has risen to
2,122.
	   The National Disaster, Surveillance and Emergency Services
Center said 473 disaster survivors were still in hospitals and
9,199 people remained in care centers set up to look after the
homeless.
	   Three waves believed to have been caused by an earthquake hit a
22-mile (35-kilometer) stretch of coast in West Sepik province on
July 17, sweeping four villages into a lagoon and sending thousands
of survivors fleeing into the jungle.
	   Davide Irvine, Australia's high commissioner in Port Moresby, a
position similar to ambassador, said the combined emergency medical
force would attend a memorial service Friday and a traditional
festival of thanks, called a sing-sing, on Saturday, before
leaving.
	   ``We've been advised by the United Nations Development Program
that the emergency response to the Aitape tsunami disaster has now
been fully met and the situation is fully under control,'' Irvine
said.
	   He said the combined task force had completed its function of
delivering emergency disaster relief assistance to the Papua New
Guinea government.
	   The medical team had attended to 248 casualties and performed
145 operations.
	   Irvine said Papua New Guinea medical authorities would now
handle the ``recovery phase'' of the operation.
	   Australia is waiting for a United Nations assessment team to
report to the Papua New Guinea government before deciding how to
further assist in the disaster recovery.

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Two more teams angrily quit the
Tour de France on Thursday, bringing to five the number that have
left the race after one was thrown out in a widening drug scandal.
	   Since 1903, the only things have halted the world's most
prestigious cycling competition have been the two World Wars.
	   Now, three days away from the Paris finish line, the Tour is
verge of stopping again. Race organizers are scrambling to calm a
rider revolt over repeated police searches and testing in the drug
investigation.
	   Early Thursday the Spanish teams of Kelme and Vitalcio joined
ONCE, Riso-Scotti and Banesto in quitting the competition.
	   ``The riders were insulted in the climb to Revard by the Spanish
public,'' said Alvaro Pino, director of the Spanish team Kelme,
referring to one of the Alpine peaks in Wednesday's segment. ``We
received some threats.''
	   The team's Fernando Escartin was in fourth place in the overall
standings in the three-week race.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
With Thursday's pullouts, all four Spanish teams were out of the
race.
	   Despite the new pullouts, the 18th stage started on schedule
shortly after 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) in Aix-les-Bains and head to
Neuchatel, Switzerland, 218 kilometers (135.5 miles).
	   ``Everybody needs to make their own decision. Those who decided
not to continue today were right, but those who are leaving the
race are also right,'' said French rider Luc Leblanc, with the
Polti team.
	   But the drug probe was pressing on. Shortly before midnight
Wednesday, police detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team,
the Francaise des Jeux team director Marc Madiot, and an unnamed
doctor, judicial sources said.
	   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday that no illegal substances were found among medication
seized Tuesday by customs officers from the Bigmat team.

Samaranch allays fears of Australian officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Olympic chief Juan Antonio Samaranch
has written to Australian Sports Minister Andrew Thomson,
apparently to reassure him that the International Olympic Committee
remains committed to the fight against drugs in sport.
	   Samaranch was quoted in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo on Sunday
as saying the list of banned substances should be ``drastically''
reduced and that drugs which don't damage an athlete's health
should not be prohibited.
	   ``Doping now is everything that, firstly, is harmful to an
athlete's health and, secondly, artificially augments his
performance,'' he was quoted as saying. ``If it's just the second
case, for me that's not doping. If it's the first case, it is.''
	   In a letter faxed to Thomson on Thursday, Samaranch said his
comments must be taken in context of the IOC's continuing action
against doping.
	   ``Since 1997, the Executive Board has emphasized the fact that
it was important to strengthen and accelerate the fight against
doping on the basis of the following principles: unity of doctrine,
effectiveness of sanctions, clarity of the applicable text and
simplicity of procedures,'' he wrote.
	   ``There is no change in the policy of the International Olympic
Committee, which I am pleased to confirm.''
	   Thomson said the federal government was pleased to receive a
prompt response to his letter sent to IOC headquarters in Lausanne
on Tuesday.
	   ``It generally goes to some of the concerns we had,'' Thomson
said. ``We are particularly delighted that the IOC, on the strength
of this, is now seeking a government nominee to be part of that
conference on drugs in sport in Lausanne and we want to ensure that
Australia is very properly represented.'' (djp)

Afghan government agrees to talks with U.N. team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A U.N. team on Thursday prepared to
resume negotiations with Afghanistan's Taliban government to try to
resolve a dispute that has stalled aid work in the war-ravaged
Afghan capital.
	   U.N. spokesperson Susan Manuel said the United Nations received
a formal agreement to hold talks Thursday from the Taliban
government.
	   A five-member team lead by Bronek Szynalski, acting coordinator
of U.N. humanitarian projects in Afghanistan, was to leave for
Kabul from neighboring Pakistan later Thursday, and talks were
scheduled for Saturday, Manuel said.
	   ``It's very good news,'' Manuel said of the Afghan religious
regime's decision to open talks. ``We hope that it indicates that
they're changing their stance on the ... relocation.''
	   Taliban officials have been insisting that aid agencies that
want to work in Kabul must move from offices and homes scattered
throughout the Afghan capital to dilapidated dormitories on the
campus of Kabul Polytechnic, which has been heavily damaged in the
years of civil war. Some 200 workers from 38 independent agencies
were thrown out of Kabul on Monday after refusing to move, and went
to Pakistan to await the result of negotiations.
	   Aid workers say that the dormitories are unsafe and
uninhabitable, and that the order to move may have been a pretext
to get them out of Kabul after months of tension with the Taliban
government.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
restricting most women to their homes. International aid groups say
they are committed to providing education and other services to all
Afghans, while Taliban officials accuse the agencies of flouting
the country's laws and traditions.
	   The expelled workers had carried out or supplemented U.N.
humanitarian programs in the city of 1.2 million devastated by
years of civil war. Without the help of Save the Children, Care,
Doctors Without Borders and other agencies, the United Nations has
suspended some projects such as rebuilding schools and hospitals
and limited itself to providing food, health care and safe water.
	   The Red Cross, which like the United Nations was not affected by
the relocation order, also runs a feeding program in the Afghan
capital.

Profiles of key members of new Japanese Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A look at some key members of the new Japanese
Cabinet:
	    &UR; ___
	   KIICHI MIYAZAWA, finance minister.
	   A 78-year-old former prime minister who is heralded by some as
an expert on finance, Miyazawa assumes the most crucial portfolio
in Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ``economic reform Cabinet.''
	   The selection of Miyazawa, a main architect of the party's plan
to reform Japan's banking system, has boosted markets skeptical of
Obuchi's ability to turn around the slumping economy.
	   Despite the praise, as finance minister in 1986-1988 he presided
over a disastrous bubble in land and stock prices. And as prime
minister in 1991-1993, he played down the severity of the bubble's
crash and is accused of delaying the cleanup.
	   Miyazawa is the first former premier to be named finance
minister since 1927, when financial expert Korekiyo Takahashi came
out of retirement to lead Japan out of an economic crisis.
	    &UR; ___
	   MASAHIKO KOMURA, foreign affairs minister.
	   Komura, 56, served as vice minister under Obuchi while the
latter was foreign affairs minister in the previous Cabinet.
	   As Japan's top diplomat, Komura is widely expected to continue
Obuchi's efforts to seek warmer ties with Russia, which have
remained on ice since the Soviet army seized four islands off
Japan's northern coast at the end of World War II.
	    &UR; ___
	   TAICHI SAKAIYA, director-general of the Economic Planning
Agency.
	   The only non-politician in the new Cabinet, Sakaiya is a noted
author on economic issues who has warned Japan's economy suffers
from a ``terminal sickness.''
	   Sakaiya, who assumes the second-most prominent economic post in
the Cabinet after the finance minister, is reportedly Obuchi's
longtime confidant and one of his closest advisors.
	   In his books, the 63-year-old former official of the prestigious
Ministry of International Trade and Industry has called for
curtailing the powers of Japan's bureaucrats.
	   Sakaiya is his pen-name. His real name is Kotaro Ikeguchi.
	    &UR; ___
	   KAORU YOSANO, minister of international trade and industry.
	   A favorite of ruling party elders, Yosano is reportedly an
opponent of younger members trying to reform the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party from within.
	   The 59-year-old veteran lawmaker from Tokyo will take charge of
a ministry that is widely credited with leading Japan's emergence
as an industrial powerhouse but now lacks a sense of purpose.
	   He has experience in industrial policy, serving as chairman of
the lower house's Committee on Commerce and Industry and as a MITI
vice minister.
	    &UR; ___
	   SEIKO NODA, post and telecommunications minister.
	   Noda is the Cabinet's only female member. A former hotel
employee, she entered politics at age 26 after inheriting the
campaign support group of her grandfather, who was a noted
parliamentarian.
	   The 37-year-old becomes the youngest Cabinet minister in
Japanese history.

Syria says no disarmament treaty while Israel is nuclear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria will never sign any international
disarmament treaty as long as Israel possesses nuclear weapons, the
defense minister said in remarks published Thursday.
	   Syria has been always against the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and seeks the establishment of a nuclear free zone in the
Middle East, the minister, Mustafa Tlass, said.
	   He made the comments in an article published in the government's
al-Baath newspaper to mark the Army Day on Saturday, the 53rd
anniversary of the foundation of the armed forces.
	   Syria and many other Arab countries have refused to sign an
international treaty banning chemical weapons. They cite Israel's
refusal to accept the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the
Arabs have signed.
	   Israel has never publicly confirmed that it has nuclear bombs
but is widely believed to possess between 100 and 200 nuclear
warheads.
	   Since Israel poses a ``menacing threat on the security of the
region, we in Syria will never accept to sign disarmament
agreements so long as Israel is not subject to international
organizations' laws,'' Tlass wrote.
	   He also said there will be no peace in the Middle East until
Israel restores all occupied Arab lands.
	   Israel captured from Syria the strategic Golan Heights in the
1967 Middle East war, and its refusal to withdraw from the area
have stalled their peace talks.

Savon, Font lead Cuban surge in boxing semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late matches &QL; 
 &UR; By IRA PODELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One day after the United States gained three
victories over Cuba, Olympic champion Felix Savon turned the tide
back in his country's favor.
	   Savon, the world champion silver medalist who won the
heavyweight gold medal in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, beat Malcolm
Tann of the United States when Tann's corner threw in the towel at
1:20 of the third round Wednesday night in the semifinals of the
Goodwill Games.
	   ``I was a little intimidated by the two gold medals, just a
little,'' Tann said. ``I wanted to win since everyone had counted
me out.''
	   The victory gave Cuba two victories in three bouts Wednesday
against the United States inside the Theater at Madison Square
Garden.
	   Savon will fight American DaVarryl Williamson for the gold
medal. Williamson defeated Igor Kshinin of Russia in a fight
stopped in the second round due to a cut over Kshinin's right eye.
	   Cuba also got a victory from Waldemar Font, the world
championship silver medalist, who outpointed bantamweight Antonio
Rodriguez of Waianae, Hawaii, 21-5.
	   ``I stood with him,'' Rodriguez said. ``He didn't hurt me, he
just outpointed me.''
	   American fighters won two other five-round semifinals.
Welterweight champion Larry Mosley gained some revenge by beating
Roberto Guerra of Cuba in a bout decided by a tiebreaker, and Jacob
Hudson, the American lightweight champion, pleased his many
supporters in the crowd with a 4-4 decision _ decided by a
unanimous tiebreaking vote _ over Aleksandr Leonov of Russia.
	   Hudson will take on Cuba's Mario Kindelan in Friday's
lightweight final.
	   Jose Santa Cruz, a 17-year-old from Monterey Park, California,
lost his bantamweight semifinal 7-4 to Uzbekistan's Timur Tulyakov,
before Miguel Espino, of North Hollywood, California, was beaten
17-0 in his welterweight semifinal by Russia's Andrei Mishin.
	   Tulyakov will meet Font in Friday's bantamweight final and
Mosley will battle Mishin for the welterweight title.
	   The United States defeated Cuba in all but one match during
Tuesday's quarterfinals _ and won 10 bouts overall _ but Rodriguez
was not able to capitalize on any of that momentum.
	   ``We're getting a lot tougher as we go by,'' Rodriguez said.
``Our team is a lot younger than Cuba and the other European
teams.''
	   Rodriguez, 19, who won both the U.S. Championships and the U.S.
Challenge, was a surprise to even reach the semifinals. He defeated
Turkey's Soner Karaaoz, the bronze medalist from the world
championships, in Monday's quarterfinals.
	   ``He's a lot better than me,'' Rodriguez said of Font. ``I just
gave it all. It's a good learning experience for me.''

More rains threaten flood-ravaged China

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Millions of people kept vigil over sodden Yangtze
River embankments threatened with collapse, and forecasts Thursday
warned of further heavy rains in flood-ravaged areas of China.
	   Health authorities, meanwhile, called for vigilance against
outbreaks of disease in flooded areas. Agricultural experts were
sent to some of the worst-hit provinces to help farmers get back on
their feet as soon as possible, the official newspaper China Daily
said.
	   The Ministry of Civil Affairs' tally of people killed in this
year's floods rose to 1,261 as reports of further devastation came
in from Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi _ the three provinces hardest hit
as floodwaters on the Yangtze reached levels unseen in more than
four decades.
	   Houses were flooded up to their eaves in Hubei. In all, more
than 1 million homes were reported destroyed in the three provinces
and total losses were estimated at 39.7 billion yuan (dlrs 4.78
billion).
	   A flood crest, the second-largest on the Yangtze since flooding
in 1954 killed more than 30,000 people, reached Jiangxi's Jiujiang
city Thursday morning, raising the river's level to a record 22.95
meters (75.7 feet), some 3.45 meters (11.4 feet) above the danger
line, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Jiujiang's Flood Control Headquarters said 3 million people had
been sent to guard levees protecting the city.
	   One million soldiers and civilians also were working night and
day to shore up a 143-kilometer (88-mile) stretch of levees in the
neighboring province of Anhui, the China Daily said.
	   In all, millions of people were guarding hundreds of kilometers
(miles) of dikes, watching for leaks that could cause water-soaked
levees to collapse, the newspaper said.
	   Nor did an end seem in sight.
	   Wen Kegang, director of the State Meteorology Bureau, said heavy
rains were expected in flooded areas in coming days, the China
Daily said. Xinhua said heavy rainstorms were expected in Hunan,
Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.
	   Sixty percent of Hunan has been flooded, with 15 million people
_ a quarter of the population _ affected and 200 people killed,
said Wilson Wong of the Hong Kong Red Cross.
	   Chinese authorities have requested medicine to treat flu,
intestinal and skin diseases, Wong said. A Red Cross team touring
Hubei province also reported seeing skin and eye maladies, but no
sign of diseases like cholera.
	   Water purification facilities, medicine and food will be bought
with U.S. dlrs 663,000 in donations collected by the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the China Daily
said.
	   While no epidemics of disease have been reported, the Ministry
of Health has asked medical workers to stay at their posts, the
China Daily said. It said around 100,000 medical workers have been
sent to flooded areas.

Kluivert on brink of signing with Manchester United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Dutch World Cup striker Patrick
Kluivert is reportedly on the brink of signing with Premier League
soccer giant Manchester United.
	   Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is desperate to lure a
top striker before the start of the season and Kluivert now looms
as his most likely alternative.
	   The Daily Mail reported Thursday that Manchester United and
Italian team AC Milan had agreed to a 9 million pound (dlrs 14.8
million) deal for the 22-year-old forward, who had previously been
linked with a move to Arsenal.
	   Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed his club had
received and accepted United's offer for Kluivert, the Daily Mail
said.
	   ``We're happy with their bid,'' Galliani was quoted as saying.
	   AC Milan sporting director Arledo Braida was traveling to
England Thursday to meet with Manchester United officials, the
paper said.
	   Kluivert started the World Cup with a red card against Belgium
before scoring goals against Argentina and Brazil in the
Netherlands' remaining matches.
	   Ferguson had been negotiating with Aston Villa for Dwight Yorke
but his 8 million pound (dlrs 13.15 million) offer was rejected by
Villa on Wednesday.

Miners maintain rail blockade despite police threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking miners on the eastern island of Sakhalin
maintained a blockade of a rail line for a sixth straight day
Thursday despite police threats to remove the protesters by force.
	   A confrontation seemed likely Thursday morning when about 60
police gathered by the railroad where miners have been demanding
back wages and blocking coal deliveries to a power plant, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   But the police eventually withdrew, and miners said it was
because women and children had joined the strike, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   At present, more than 70 rail cars with 4,000 tons of coal
cannot get to the station because of the blockade. Meanwhile, coal
supplies are dwindling and a power plant may have to soon shut down
another power unit, Interfax said.
	   Sakhalin Vice Governor Ivan Malakhov has said he will not allow
the power station to shut down and will use any means necessary to
lift the blockade.
	   Miners say they will let through just enough coal to keep the
plant from switching off completely.
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant's operation for
electricity.

Eldredge, Russian couples lead Goodwill skating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, other details &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Todd Eldredge stood in the middle of
the ice and let the applause pour down around him.
	   The former world champion put on a brilliant show of spins and
jumps Wednesday night to lead the men's figure skating short
program at the Goodwill Games and now the crowd was saluting his
performance.
	   ``The reaction from the crowd was fantastic,'' he said.
	   So was Eldredge, who put on a flawless performance but felt
there was more that he could have done.
	   ``Everybody can skate a little better,'' he said. ``There were a
couple of spins I could do better.''
	   He gets another chance Friday in the long program with the
Goodwill gold on the line. And once again, the competition comes
from 1994 Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov, second to Eldredge after
the short program.
	   Urmanov is coming back from a groin injury that forced him to
miss the 1998 Olympics.
	   ``It is not so big a difference from 1994,'' he said, ``because
again I am competing with Todd.''
	   Two world championship couples from Russia moved in front in ice
dancing and pairs.
	   Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze led after the short
program in pairs, edging ahead of Olympic gold medalists Oksana
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev, and Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov were in front following the compulsory dance.
	   Eldredge, a five-time U.S. champion who was fourth in the
Olympics and second in the world championships this year, got a
standing ovation from the Nassau Coliseum crowd of 4,009 _ about a
quarter of capacity _ as he finished his program with a dazzling
combination spin in the middle of the ice. Skating to music from
the Broadway show ``Les Miserables,'' he was spectacular from start
to finish.
	   All seven judges awarded him marks of 5.8 for the eight required
elements. He also received 5.9s for presentation from the judges
from France, England and the United States.
	   Trailing Eldredge were two Russian skaters, Urmanov and Evgeni
Plushenko. Takeshi Honda of Japan was fourth, followed by Americans
Michael Weiss and Timothy Goebel in fifth and sixth place.
	   The short program counts for one-third of the total mark, with
the remaining two-thirds coming from Friday's freestyle skate.
	   Skimming over the blue ice at the Coliseum, Berezhnaya and
Sikharulidze were flawless, running through the eight required
elements and smiling broadly when they were done. They skated to
``Scenes From Swan Lake'' and received no mark below 5.7 from the
panel of judges.
	   Kazakova and Dmitriev, who withdrew from the world championships
because of food poisoning after winning the Olympics, were second,
followed by the Chinese pair of Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo.
	   Kazakova was satisfied with what the Olympic champions had done.
	   ``We were pleased with our performance because we had been on
tour and are very tired,'' she said.
	   The American pair _ 16-year-old Johnnie Stiegler and his
14-year-old sister Tiffany _ received all 5.1s or lower, and their
scores were booed by the crowd. They stood last.
	   ``We did a good job for our ages,'' Johnnie Stiegler said. ``We
just need to get older and be patient.''
	   The short program counts for one-third of the final mark in
pairs, with Friday's freestyle completing the competition.
	   In the compulsory dance competition, Krylova and Ovsiannikov
took the lead. Skating to the ``Golden Waltz,'' the Olympic silver
medalists received two 5.9s for timing-expression, the highest
marks awarded to any of the four couples.
	   ``I'm very happy because it's 3{ months after the world
championships and we've only had a week to prepare for the
compulsories,'' Ovsiannikov said.''
	   Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia, silver medalists in
the 1994 Goodwill Games, were second, followed by Elena Grushina
and Rusian Goncharov of Ukraine, and Jessica Joseph and Charles
Butler of the United States.
	   The American teen-agers, world junior champions, received four
marks below 5.0, prompting boos from the crowd.
	   ``We're a new team,'' Butler said. ``This is our first year. We
just moved up from the junior tour. We don't have a lot of
experience.''
	   The compulsory dance counts for 20 percent of the final score
with Thursday's original dance counting for 30 percent and the free
dance on Saturday making up the remaining 50 percent.

Chinese negotiator snubs Taiwan's demand for further talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Chinese negotiator on Thursday snubbed
Taiwan's demand for more talks to discuss the planned visit to
China by Taiwan's top negotiator, casting a pall over what would be
an ice-breaking trip.
	   Following Sunday's meeting between Li Yafei and his Taiwanese
counterpart, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation announced the two
had agreed on foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu's visit to Beijing
and Shanghai in September or October.
	   According to the semiofficial negotiating body, it was agreed
the trip would be ``of the nature of a visit'' and both sides
regarded it as a significant event.
	   But Li, who arrived last week as a member of a delegation of
high school tutors, later denied there were such agreements.
	   ``An agreement is something both sides agree to, not a one-sided
statement,'' Li told reporters.
	   After approaching Li for another meeting, the foundation issued
a statement Thursday saying that he ``did not believe there was any
need to reaffirm our consensus, saying few concrete results have
emerged from the last meeting.''
	   It appeared that Koo still would make the visit, but it was
uncertain now whether it would help restart the stalled dialogue
between the two sides. The twist of events highlighted differences
that remain between Taiwan and China over ending a three-year
deadlock.
	   Taiwan is ruled by the Nationalists, who fled the Communists'
takeover of the Chinese mainland in 1949. China regards Taiwan as a
renegade province and has threatened to retake it by force, if
necessary.
	   Li has said China would want the two sides to go straight into
political dialogue, and Koo should discuss with his counterpart,
Wang Daohan, how to get started.
	   Short of an agreement to that, Li said, China would settle for a
plain visit by Koo.
	   Taiwan, however, wants the dialogue to pick up where it left off
by focusing on practical matters such as trade and fishing
disputes. After mutual trust is established, it said, the two sides
can move on to the more sensitive political issues.

Ukrainian opposition activist wounded in shooting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with background on Odarych, quotes grafs 6-7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An assailant shot and wounded an opposition
activist whose group has been sharply critical of the Ukrainian
government, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Serhiy Odarych, chairman of the private Ukrainian Perspective
group, was shot in the leg before dawn Wednesday when he was
returning to his home in Kiev, the Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper
said.
	   Odarych told the newspaper that a man approached and introduced
himself as a ``well-wisher,'' but then told him to stop his
political activities. When Odarych refused to talk to the man, he
opened fire, wounding Odarych, the paper said.
	   ``I rushed to the entrance as quickly as the wound would allow
me and called my wife,'' Odarych told Kievskiye Vedomosti from his
hospital bed. ``Luckily, we live on the first floor, so she
immediately came out.''
	   The attacker fled and no one has been arrested in the case.
Odarych told the newspaper he did not know who was responsible for
the attack, which he said must have been politically motivated.
	   Odarych's centrist group is often critical of the Ukrainian
government and President Leonid Kuchma. It occasionally publishes
the newspaper My (We).
	   ``We, my team and myself personally, have only one opponent _
President Kuchma. We have no other enemies,'' Odarych told the Dyen
newspaper.
	   Police were investigating the attack but had no immediate
comment.

Hun Sen in firm control after meeting king
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Hun Sen telling king he
wants three-way coalition but will control all key ministries.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen proposed quelling
Cambodia's latest round of political instability Thursday by
creating a three-sided coalition government including two
opposition parties that accuse him of winning parliamentary
elections by fraud.
	   Hun Sen emerged from talks with King Norodom Sihanouk and
claimed he had won royal backing for the coalition, under which he
still would hold all the important levers of power.
	   Though Sihanouk is largely a figurehead, his popularity among
many Cambodians and high international profile make his blessing a
vital step for Hun Sen to win back international legitimacy and aid
lost by ousting the king's son as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year.
	   ``The king is pleased with the idea,'' Hun Sen told a news
conference. ``It will create cooperation in the National Assembly
and the government, giving a credible atmosphere for national
reconciliation.''
	   But it was unclear how Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist
FUNCINPEC or the Sam Rainsy Party would react. Refusing to
recognize Hun Sen's apparent victory in Sunday's elections, both
have threatened to boycott the National Assembly and paralyze
formation of a new government.
	   Terrorized opposition activists, meanwhile, have fled from the
provinces to the capital, Phnom Penh, as the Hun Sen-controlled
police retaliated for their challenges to his rule.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, the top United Nations human rights envoy to
Cambodia, said the international community wanted it stopped.
	   ``It's very important that the political leadership make very
clear they will take a strong stance against attempts to settle
scores,'' said Hammarberg.
	   Many Cambodians disbelieve claims by Hun Sen's party of an
overwhelming election victory, but they also put a premium on
stability after decades of war, the Khmer Rouge genocide of the
1970s that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people, and
last year's coup.
	   Under Hun Sen's proposal, his Cambodian People's Party would
retain control of the key ministries _ the security portfolios of
interior and defense, finance, justice and foreign affairs. Sharing
other ministries would be discussed after final results come in.
	   The action signaled that Hun Sen _ relaxed and confident despite
an emergency appendectomy two weeks ago _ realizes he cannot ignore
the opposition but intends to keep all real power.
	   Hun Sen said officials of his party have already discussed the
idea with FUNCINPEC.
	   Sihanouk, 75, intends to leave for China for medical treatment
once the new assembly and government are seated, Hun Sen said.
	   When the opposition first threatened to boycott the assembly,
denying the two-thirds attendance needed to confirm a new
government, Hun Sen replied Wednesday he would change the
constitution to rule unfettered for the next five years.
	   The Asian Network for Free Elections, an independent monitoring
group, and human rights groups claimed that opposition activists
were being terrorized in the provinces after Hun Sen won.
	   At least 23 activists have fled to Phnom Penh, ANFREL told a
news conference. In many cases, police surrounded meetings and
attacked or threatened those attending.
	   ``If massive violence or retaliation occurs, it will undermine
the limited success of the election,'' said ANFREL member Nobuhiko
Suto.
	   In the pre-election period, violence, including murder, was
widespread against opposition activists.
	   Full official results are not expected from the Hun Sen-packed
National Election Committee before Sunday.
	   The top independent monitoring group, the Committee for Free and
Fair Elections in Cambodia, said its figures showed that with 90
percent of the ballots counted, the CPP looked set to get 59 of the
122 National Assembly seats, FUNCINPEC 45 and the Sam Rainsy Party
18.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Hun Sen, who
came to power in 1985 under the Vietnamese occupation that followed
the Khmer Rouge, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war. He deposed Ranariddh last year
in two days of fighting in the capital.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police in western Ukraine detained a senior
security service officer for allegedly attempting to transport 22
illegal migrants out of the country, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Valeriy Shovkovnykov of the Ukrainian Security Service's main
department was detained near the city of Lviv on a bus carrying 22
Sri Lankans and Bangladeshis to Ukraine's border, the daily Fakty
reported.
	   The officer and his brother are suspected of accepting money to
transport the Asians out of Ukraine, apparently to Germany, Fakty
said. A large sum of money was confiscated from Shovkovnykov, it
said.
	   Ukraine is a common transit route for Asians heading to Western
Europe.
	   The 22 Asians are being held in Lviv. The security service has
started an investigation against Shovkovnykov, Fakty said.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistan air force plane crashed in a
crowded Karachi neighborhood Thursday, killing at least six people
on the ground, three of them children. At least 25 people were
injured, most with serious burns.
	   Three houses burst into flames immediately after the crash, and
the fire quickly spread in the neighborhood of small, one-story
dwellings, trapping an unknown number of people.
	   The bodies of six people were pulled from the houses, burned
beyond recognition. Rescue workers said three of the dead were men
and three children. The afternoon crash came at a time when mostly
women and children would be home.
	   Witnesses saw one person bail out of the plane before it crashed
in the western Orangi district, a densely populated,
lower-middle-class neighborhood in Karachi, the port city that is
Pakistan's financial hub.
	   Air force officials said the pilot ejected safely from the
Chinese-made F-7 training jet. They had few other details about the
crash.
	   Dozens of fire trucks rushed to the scene. Troops cordoned off
the area as hundreds of residents rushed from work, anxious about
relatives.
	   Rubina Abdullah, an eyewitness, said the plane crashed with a
``massive bang'' and immediately caught fire.
	   Air force officials confirmed the crash, saying the plane was a
Chinese-made F-7 training jet andfighter trainer. They had few
other details.
	   Earlier Thursday in neighboring India, a commercial propeller
aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Cochin, 2,000
kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of New Delhi. All six persons on
board were killed, Indian news agencies reported.

Israel considering release of 100 Palestinian prisoners

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid efforts to restart peace talks, Israel is
considering a goodwill gesture: the release of 100 Palestinian
prisoners, officials said Thursday.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is looking into the
request for a prisoner release made earlier this week by Yasser
Arafat's top deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, Kahalani's spokeswoman said.
	   According to the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu supports the move and has asked Kahalani to draw
up a list of prisoners to be freed.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak refused to comment on the
report.
	   With Israel-Palestinian relations at a low point, such a release
would be aimed at building confidence and getting peace efforts
back on track.
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago, and at the urging of the
Clinton administration, the two sides have been holding direct
meetings for the past 11 days to try to revive them.
	   So far, no breakthrough has occurred. More talks were set later
Thursday between Cabinet Secretary Danny Neveh and chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Also Thursday, the European Union's Mideast envoy, Miguel
Moratinos, met separately with Netanyahu and Erekat to discuss the
peace talks.
	   Israel is under pressure to accept an American-authored peace
initiative calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already approved
the initiative, but Netanyahu is balking.
	   Netanyahu received a sharp reproach Wednesday from lawmakers
over his handling of the peace talks. They voted overwhelmingly in
favor of a preliminary measure that would help set the stage for
early elections.
	   The vote was seen as a sign of dissatisfaction across the
political spectrum with the prime minister's stance on the
Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, the Israeli army demolished four Palestinian homes
Thursday outside the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Human rights groups say the pace of such demolitions _ usually
carried out because a homebuilder lacked a permit _ has increased
sharply in recent months. Palestinians say it is almost impossible
for them to obtain building permits from Israel.
	   ``This is state terror _ this is Netanyahu's peace,'' said
32-year-old Ahmed Murqaktan, a father of eight whose home was among
those demolished Thursday.
	   A scuffle broke out between Palestinians and soldiers during one
of the demolitions, but there were no injuries or arrests.

Indonesian officials foil attempt to smuggle cobras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Customs officers foiled an attempt to
smuggle an alarming cargo out of Jakarta's international airport:
boxes containing 1,020 deadly cobras.
	   Officials discovered the cobras last weekend after running a
batch of 54 boxes through an X-ray machine and noticing unusual
movements, local media reported Thursday.
	   Documents said the boxes contained live eels, a popular menu
item in some parts of Asia.
	   ``The officers became suspicious when they saw that the movement
of the animals was different from usual. They were more active,''
The Jakarta Post quoted Lukas Tonga, head of the airport's animal
quarantine center, as saying.
	   Police arrested the man handling the cargo's documents. They
said the cobras were bound for China, where the meat and skin of
the prized snakes fetch high prices.
	   The snakes were taken to a Jakarta zoo for temporary care.
	   Cobras are a protected animal in Indonesia and their export is
forbidden.
	   Smugglers of rare species face up to five years in prison and
100 million rupiah (dlrs 7,700) in fines.

British bank Halifax buys out big home lending group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The bank Halifax PLC struck a deal Thursday to buy
out one of Britain's top home lenders, Birmingham Midshires, for
750 million pounds (dlrs 1.23 billion).
	   Birmingham Midshires is Britain's fourth-biggest building
society, a lending group owned by its mortgage holders, and had
previously been sought by the Royal Bank of Scotland, which bid 630
million pounds (dlrs 1.03 billion).
	   Roughly 1 million mortgage holders who own Birmingham Midshires
will receive one-time payments averaging about 750 pounds (dlrs
1,230) each as Halifax takes over. Executives hope to release
details of the payout in a few months and said they expect to close
the deal in the spring.
	   Halifax, based in Halifax, England, has agreed to maintain the
Birmingham Midshires brand name on the society's 115 branches for
at least three years. The bank also agreed there will be no forced
layoffs for any of the 2,000 staff members at Birmingham Midshires,
which is based in Wolverhampton, England.

Pakistan says it supports negotiations to ban fissile material
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; With India-Pakistan-Nuclear &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Under international pressure to curb its nuclear
weapons capability, Pakistan said Thursday it supports immediately
starting negotiations for a treaty to ban the production of
material used to make nuclear weapons.
	   Addressing the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Pakistani
Ambassador Munir Akram said, however, his government wants
negotiations to deal with neighboring India's larger stockpile of
the so-called ``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched
uranium.
	   Akram acknowledged the proposed treaty has been a main topic
between the U.S. and Pakistani governments as Washington seeks ways
to contain India's and Pakistan's development of nuclear weapons
since both countries began test explosions earlier this year.
	   His statement came as top foreign ministry officials from India
and Pakistan resumed talks in Sri Lanka. On Wednesday, their prime
ministers broke a yearlong stalemate and agreed to try again to
resolve their territorial and other disputes.
	   At talks last week in Islamabad, he said, ``Pakistan and the
United States agreed to support the immediate commencement of
negotiations'' on a treaty to ban production of nuclear-weapons
material.
	   At those talks Pakistan pressed for international mediation on
the Kashmir dispute with neighboring India, while the United States
urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty.
	   Pakistan's signing that treaty would depend on ``assurance
against the possibility of further nuclear testing by India,''
Akram said Thursday.
	   He said Pakistan was prepared for a separate test-ban agreement
with India and that it ``is not interested in further escalation up
the nuclear ladder with India.''
	   Conference delegations said it remained to be seen what other
key countries, such as Brazil and Egypt, would say to the proposal
that a committee be set up to discuss the fissile material treaty.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.

Ex-dictator's brother takes charge of Guatemala human rights

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ His brother is a former dictator whose
reign was among the bloodiest in Guatemala's civil war and whose
evangelical Protestant zeal made some Roman Catholics shudder.
	   So the appointment of Bishop Mario Rios Montt _ brother of Gen.
Efrain Rios Montt _ to the Catholic Church's most important human
rights position in Guatemala might have been expected to cause a
stir.
	   But it hasn't. In a country accustomed to brothers fighting
brothers, the Rios Montts are just one more example of how, for 36
years of civil war, families could be divided by politics and
religion yet still sit together amiably at the dinner table.
	   ``You have to distinguish between the family life and the public
life. I don't like to mix the two things,'' Monsignor Mario Rios
Montt said in a recent interview.
	   Appointed in May to replace slain Bishop Juan Gerardi as head of
the archdiocese's human rights office, Rios Montt has to contend
with the fear and turmoil surrounding the killing, including the
recent arrests of a priest and a church cook.
	   At the same time, he has to continue Gerardi's work: uncovering
past abuses and seeking national reconciliation from a war that
left 200,000 people dead or missing before it ended in December
1996.
	   And, inevitably, there will be comparisons with Gerardi, a
powerful, respected voice for human rights who was killed two days
after presenting a report blaming the army for most of the war's
atrocities.
	   Does the Rios Montt name make his job more difficult?
	   ``I think it's a reality. We're not going to ask if it's an
advantage or disadvantage,'' the prelate said.
	   Efrain Rios Montt was a general who seized power in a March 1982
coup and governed until he was overthrown in August 1983. During
his rule, the army burned Indian villages and killed thousands of
suspected leftists.
	   Catholic lay workers were frequent targets because of suspected
rebel ties. In a move seen as a slap to the church, Rios Montt had
six rebel suspects executed on the eve of Pope John Paul II's visit
in 1983, despite papal pleas for mercy.
	   Monsignor Rios Montt declined to offer an opinion on his
brother's rule, noting that he lived abroad for most of that
period. He said the relationship won't affect the human rights
office's work as it looks into the period when his brother was
president.
	   ``My opinion doesn't count before the facts. The truth is the
truth. And that's what's going to appear,'' he said.
	   Within the church and among human rights groups, Rios Montt's
appointment hasn't raised any major concerns.
	   ``Look, this country is so complicated that our families are
complicated,'' said Ronalth Ochaeta, the director of the human
rights office. ``The general isn't responsible for what the bishop
preaches and he isn't responsible for what the general did.''
	   Helen Mack, a leading human rights activist, said she doesn't
know much about Monsignor Rios Montt personally, but said his
experience _ 39 years as a priest and 24 as a bishop _ likely
prepared him well for the job.
	   ``I think there's confidence in the objectivity that a church
pastor can have,'' she said. ``In some way, he himself lived
through the repression that his people suffered.''
	   Efrain Rios Montt, now a politician popular with Guatemalans who
crave greater law and order, declined to be interviewed. But in
responding through a spokesman to questions faxed to him, he
described his brother as ``a magnificent professional.''
	   ``He is prepared for his new job,'' he said.
	   Asked whether political and religious differences have affected
their relationship, Efrain Rios Montt said: ``We don't mix those
factors in our fraternal relations.''
	   Family time, added Mario Rios Montt, is not an occasion for
conflict. ``It's so little the time we can enjoy together that
there is no time to talk about problems.''

Israel considering release of 100 Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid efforts to restart peace talks, Israel is
considering a goodwill gesture: the release of 100 Palestinian
prisoners, officials said Thursday.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is looking into the
request for a prisoner release made earlier this week by Yasser
Arafat's top deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, Kahalani's spokeswoman said.
	   According to the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu supports the move and has asked Kahalani to draw
up a list of prisoners to be freed.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak refused to comment on the
report.
	   With Israel-Palestinian relations at a low point, such a release
would be aimed at building confidence and getting peace efforts
back on track.
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago, and at the urging of the
United States, the two sides have been holding direct meetings for
the past 11 days to try to revive them.
	   So far, no breakthrough has occurred. More talks were set for
later Thursday between Cabinet Secretary Danny Neveh and Abbas.
	   Israel is under pressure to accept an American-authored peace
initiative calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already approved
the initiative, but Netanyahu is balking.
	   Netanyahu received a sharp reproach Wednesday from lawmakers
over his handling of the peace talks. They voted overwhelmingly in
favor of a preliminary measure that would help set the stage for
early elections.
	   The vote was seen as a sign of dissatisfaction across the
political spectrum with the prime minister's stance on the
Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, the Israeli army demolished three Palestinian homes
Thursday outside the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Human rights groups say the pace of such demolitions _ usually
carried out because a homebuilder lacked a permit _ has increased
sharply in recent months. Palestinians say it is almost impossible
for them to obtain building permits from Israel.
	   ``This is state terror _ this is Netanyahu's peace,'' said
32-year-old Ahmed Murqaktan, a father of eight whose home was among
those demolished Thursday.

Government sells stake in large electricity company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A foreign-registered company will be
allowed to buy a 36-percent stake in a large electricity
distribution company, a news agency said Thursday.
	   Contrast Holding Ltd., registered in the British Virgin Islands,
will be allowed to buy 36 percent of the Poltavaoblenergo company
for 44.35 million hryvna (dlrs 22.1 million), more than double the
original asking price, Interfax reported.
	   The announcement was good news for Ukraine's privatization
efforts because the country has had trouble attracting foreign
investors.
	   The government recently offered for sale large stakes in more
than a third of Ukraine's 27 regional electricity distribution
companies.
	   Most of these companies are making profits, despite a prolonged
economic crisis in Ukraine, and are considered to be among the most
attractive state-owned enterprises currently for sale.
	   However, energy privatization in Ukraine has been stalled in
recent months because of high asking prices and rigid requirements
for would-be investors.
	   The government recently agreed to allow potential buyers acquire
controlling stakes in electricity distributors.
	   Privatization in Ukraine this year has brought in about 240
million hryvna (dlrs 120 million), far below government targets.

Russian government proposes ban on Nazi symbols
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Responding to a recent series of attacks blamed on
neo-fascists, the Russian government proposed a bill Thursday that
would ban all Nazi symbols, literature and videos, a news report
said.
	   Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II
caused tremendous suffering, and Nazi ideologues regarded Soviet
citizens as a pool of manual labor to serve the Third Reich.
	   Yet over the last few months, Moscow has seen an increasing
number of racist attacks by members of neo-Nazi groups, drawing
attention to the small but violent neo-fascist movement.
	   Most members are young skinheads who are openly racist and call
for driving ethnic minorities out of Russia.
	   The new bill would ban swastikas and related symbols, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The only exceptions would be for
books and films that ``promote humanitarian ideas and condemn
fascism,'' ITAR-Tass reported, citing Justice Minister Pavel
Krasheninnikov.
	   The bill still must be approved by parliament to become law, and
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko called for a speedy action by the
legislature, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The bill is ``the most civilized way of fighting fascism and
neo-fascism in Russia, so we will no longer be ashamed in front of
(World War II) veterans,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Human rights groups and neo-Nazi organizations estimate that
there are about 4,000 neo-fascists in Moscow.
	   In highly publicized attacks earlier this year, a bomb exploded
at an Orthodox synagogue in Moscow, injuring two people and causing
extensive damage. Jewish leaders blamed fascist groups. Also, a
black American Marine was badly beaten at an outdoor market in an
attack blamed on neo-Nazis.

Former East German prosecutor on trial for perversion of justice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ A former East German prosecutor went on
trial Thursday charged with perversion of justice and wrongful
deprivation of liberty in three cases.
	   State prosecutors say the 68-year-old former prosecutor was a
member of East Germany's communist party and for political reasons
prosecuted and obtained prison terms for three East Germans who
wanted to resettle in the West between 1985 and 1987.
	   After formal reading of the charges, the trial was recessed
until Tuesday, when a verdict is expected.
	   Since unification in 1990, numerous former East German justice
officials have been convicted of perversion of justice for
heavy-handed decisions against those seeking to flee repression
under East Germany's communists from 1949-1989. Most have received
light or suspended sentences.

Opposition terrorized as Cambodian election winners seek payback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Scores of opposition supporters from
Cambodia's rural areas have fled to the capital and taken sanctuary
at their party's headquarters, fearing revenge from the ruling
party after last Sunday's election.
	   Many say their lives or livelihoods were threatened by local
officials affiliated with the Cambodian People's Party of strongman
Hun Sen, which is winning as votes are slowly counted.
	   The problem has been all but ignored by the hundreds of Western
election observers who came and quickly gave the polls a more or
less clean bill of health. Only a small, independent Asian election
observer group has highlighted the issue.
	   The party workers, who refused to give their names or have their
pictures taken for fear of retaliation, were huddled Thursday at
the headquarters of the Sam Rainsy Party when visited by an
Associated Press reporter.
	   ``I am from Takeo province, and I have a lot of problems,'' said
one young man.
	   He was one of several dozen people, mostly men in their 20s and
30s, who had fled to the party compound after being terrorized at
home by the police _ who are controlled by Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party _ and other local powers.
	   ``Their lives will be uprooted for at least the next five
years,'' said Theary Seng, a Cambodian-American law student from
the University of Michigan working with the party over the summer.
``For them to be in an opposition party means life or death.''
	   A foreign human rights worker, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said independent organizations were trying to
investigate the claims but the scale was too great.
	   About 20 people arrived Thursday morning alone. One woman was in
hysterics: She is a party activist whose husband was killed in
political violence last year.
	   Police surrounded her house after the election. She left her
five children behind with her mother-in-law.
	   The young man from Takeo, southwest of Phnom Penh and a Hun Sen
stronghold, said local officials first became angry with him during
the campaign when he attracted supporters for his party, headed by
former finance minister Sam Rainsy.
	   The man left his mother's home well before the election because
police were trying to ``catch'' him. In the campaign, the police
were often accused of taking part in violence, including murder,
and intimidation against the opposition.
	   The man said that after the election, local officials threatened
to kill representatives of his party and FUNCINPEC, the other main
opposition grouping.
	   ``So far, they just speak, but not kill yet,'' he said.
	   Another man, from Kandal province, said he was threatened with
death before and after Sunday's polls. During the voting, he saw
officials guide the hands of elderly voters to check the box for
the ruling party.
	   ``They did it to intimidate voters,'' he said. ``People saw it
and understood that's how they should vote.''
	   After he told voting station authorities the practice was
illegal, a ruling party member told him: ``How dare you complain.
You are a Sam Rainsy Party member _ you may die.''
	   The village chief told police to arrest or shoot him if he made
more trouble.
	   ``I ran away that night with only the clothes on my back,'' he
said. ``Now I would like to return to my house and see how my wife
is faring. We have four children.''
	   One member from Kompong Cham province said he was told it didn't
matter who won, he'd better go live elsewhere.
	   On election night, he didn't go home when he saw three people
with guns loitering around his house. The next night, more
strangers were there.
	   Another man from Kompong Cham went to party headquarters to find
some moral support. But everyone had cleared out. Then he did, too.
	   Face-to-face threats _ or any words _ weren't necessary. Some
people received telephone calls on their mobile phones. Often, the
sound coming over the line was funeral music.

Greek and Turkish soldiers trade fire at border crossing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Greek and Turkish soldiers traded fire at
a border crossing this week, but no injuries were reported.
	   According to an account in a Turkish newspaper, Greek soldiers
opened fire at the direction of the Turkish border, sparking
retaliation by the Turks.
	   The shooting incident occurred Tuesday evening at the Meric
River, called Evros in Greek, that marks the border between the two
countries, the Sabah newspaper reported.
	   It claimed the Greek soldiers were drunk and verbally abused
Turkish border guards before firing their weapons.
	   The Greek General Army Staff countered the report saying a
Turkish border patrol began firing in the direction of Greek
soldiers, who returned the shots.
	   The Turkish Foreign Ministry would not immediately comment,
saying officials were looking into the incident.
	   The two neighbors -- historic rivals -- are at odds over a
variety of issues, including disputes on territorial waters and
airspace, seabed mineral rights and the divided Mediterranean
island of Cyprus.
	   The two have come to the brink of war several times over the
past years.

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Two more teams angrily quit a
dwindling Tour de France on Thursday, bringing to five the number
that have left the race after one was thrown out in a widening drug
scandal.
	   Since 1903, the only things have halted the world's most
prestigious cycling competition have been the two World Wars.
	   Now, three days away from the Paris finish line, the Tour was
limping along with barely 100 entrants left. Race organizers were
scrambling to calm a rider revolt over repeated police searches and
testing in the drug investigation.
	   Early Thursday the Spanish teams of Kelme and Vitalcio joined
ONCE, Riso-Scotti and Banesto in quitting the scandal-plagued
competition. Festina was thrown out.
	   ``The riders were insulted in the climb to Revard by the Spanish
public,'' said Alvaro Pino, director of the Spanish team Kelme,
referring to one of the Alpine peaks in Wednesday's segment. ``We
received some threats.''
	   The team's Fernando Escartin was in fourth place in the overall
standings in the three-week race. Pino told reporters he would
resign as team chief at the end of the season.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
With Thursday's pullouts, all four Spanish teams were out of the
race.
	   Despite the new pullouts, the 18th stage started on schedule
shortly after 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) in Aix-les-Bains and headed to
Neuchatel, Switzerland, 218 kilometers (135.5 miles).
	   The riders numbered 102, down from 116 the day before and from
189 at the beginning of the race.
	   ``Everybody needs to make their own decision. Those who decided
not to continue today were right, but those who are leaving the
race are also right,'' said former French champion Luc Leblanc,
with the Polti team, who pulled out Thursday.
	   The drug probe was pressing on. Shortly before midnight
Wednesday, police detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team,
the Francaise des Jeux team director Marc Madiot, and an unnamed
doctor, judicial sources said.
	   The detention of Massi, leader in the mountain climbing
standings, was the first time the probe blocked a rider from
competing.
	   Police said they also searched vehicles and hotel rooms
Wednesday night belonging to the teams Francaise des Jeux, la ONCE,
and Casino.
	   Police said Thursday that no illegal substances were found among
medication seized Tuesday by customs officers from the Bigmat team.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After starting out in Albertville and going through the motions
for the first hour or so, the pack slowed and stopped -- ironically
just past one of the sprint banners which usually has some of the
fastest action of the race.
	   After discussion, the pack restarted, only to stop again.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the Tour's director, assured the riders that
further police action would be carried out ``with a maximum of
dignity ... at the hotels of the concerned teams and not at police
stations.''
	   With that the riders took off again only to please the public.
	   However the public had mixed emotions. Some shouted at the
riders and made angry gestures. Others cheered.
	   The riders ended the day's stage more than two and a half hours
behind schedule in Aix-les-Bains. Tour judge Joel Menard announced
that the stage was annulled.
	   The Tour has been plagued with doping allegations since its July
11 start in Dublin, Ireland.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the TVM team that's been under investigation. ``I have the
impression the Tour is finished. I'm sick.''
	   Laurent Jalabert, France's top rider and world champion, quit
Wednesday.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said on France Info radio.

Serb battlefield gains said to complicate search for peace formula
</HEADLINE>
in Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western diplomats claimed some
progress in efforts to unite Albanian factions for peace talks on
the future of Kosovo, but said the process was slowed by Serb-led
government gains on the battlefield.
	   In the latest diplomatic move, a three-member European Union
delegation was meeting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on
Thursday in Belgrade after meetings in Kosovo the day before.
	   Milosevic has agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled
out independence, as demanded by Albanian politicians and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on composition of an
``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
	   On Wednesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met for three
hours with Albanian politicians and KLA representatives in the
village of Likoc in the Drenica region. Hill made no statement
after the meeting and returned to Macedonia, where he serves as the
American ambassador.
	   Western diplomats familiar with the negotiations said Hill's
meeting achieved some progress toward uniting the Albanians. They
refused to elaborate, but the fact that Hill returned to Macedonia
suggested the deal was far from complete.
	   The latest talks took place against the background of major
gains by Serb forces in retaking parts of the province under
Albanian control. Since launching an offensive Friday, Serb police
have driven KLA fighters from their stronghold in Malisevo and
pushed them off the main highway between Pristina and Pec which the
insurgents had blocked since May.
	   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Serb
gains had complicated efforts toward peace talks.
	   ``To get people to talk, they have to feel confident and
comfortable and not that they're operating from a position of
weakness,'' one diplomat said. ``No one is going to win this with a
knockout punch. There has to be a diplomatic solution.''
	   On Wednesday, the leading ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, said he had reached a compromise with other groups on a
coalition government that would include ``all political forces''
and ``create preconditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led
Yugoslav government.
	   Albanian-language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA the defense and interior posts, meaning it would control
the provincial police. But it remained unclear whether a
significant part of the KLA was prepared to accept any such offers.

Asian markets mostly higher

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stocks finished mostly higher Thursday,
with local factors coming to the fore as traders waited to see what
direction Japan would take under its new government.
	   While analysts in Hong Kong reported volatile trading ahead of
the expiration of July futures contracts, activity was relatively
low in many other markets as traders waited for a reason to move.
	   Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher. Keizo Obuchi's election as
prime minister by Parliament had little impact. But banking shares
rose on expectations that the new finance minister, Kiichi
Miyazawa, may be less aggressive in pursuing reform.
	   Analysts said investors were likely to stay on the sidelines to
see what policies the government may adopt. The Nikkei average rose
43.51 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 16,201.60.
	   ``Some investors think Obuchi and Miyazawa will be conventional
leaders, which might delay implementation of policies needed to
drive the economy in a better direction,'' said Sachio Ishikawa,
general manager of stocks at Chuo Securities in Tokyo.
	   In Seoul, share prices gained slightly on hopes of lower
interest rates. Earlier this week, the government said it would
push to further lower the rates to help buffer its economic
reforms. The benchmark KOSPI index was up 0.50 points, or 0.10
percent, to 344.91.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended higher, with most stocks
bouncing back after being hit on Wednesday. The Hang Seng index
closed at 7,906.16, up 97.33 points, or 1.2 percent.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares finished higher due to a 95-cent
gain by Australia-based insurance and funds manager AMP Ltd. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index was up 4.44 points, or 0.21 percent, closing
at 2,097.48.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares gained on the strength of blue-chip
industrials. Mining stocks were lower. Australia's All Ordinaries
index was up 8.1 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,701.30.
	   JAKARTA: Gainers outnumbered losers 60 to 45, but the JSX
composite index closed down 2.408 points at 482.69 on
arbitrage-related selling in telecommunications shares because of a
stronger rupiah.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Short-term investors moved into the market to take
advantage of a technical rebound after a 4.5 percent loss
Wednesday, sending the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
Composite Index up 3.56 points to 389.53.
	   SINGAPORE: A lack of incentives in the market drove players into
largely speculative trading. The benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index rose 5.55 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,059.53.
Speculators showed keen interest in newly listed stocks, extending
their recent volatility.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stocks ended higher in thin trading. Local
investors hunted for bargains in banking and finance stocks, which
have been oversold over the past week. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index gained 3.25 points, or 1.2 percent, closing at
266.74.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended lower as investors remained
concerned about the island's economic health. The Weighted Price
Index was down 44.90 points, or 0.57 percent, ending at 7,730.43.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed as the main index nudged
higher with a rebound in some blue-chip stocks. But the market's
weakness still was palpable, with losers beating gainers 51 to 32.
The PSE index was up 8.23 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,613.50.

Castro to meet opposition leader in Jamaica who slighted him

<TEXT>
	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) _ After his election in 1980,
then-Prime Minister Edward Seaga shut down the Cuban embassy in
anger over an earlier experiment with socialism that bankrupted
Jamaica.
	   ``We still have bitter memories,'' Seaga, now the conservative
opposition leader, said during an interview Wednesday.
	   But whatever hard feelings remain, they seem to be easing.
Seaga, who was to meet with Fidel Castro Thursday as part of the
Cuban president's momentous Caribbean tour, said the end of the
Cold War had neutralized Cuba as a threat.
	   ``I don't think we need to fight yesterday's war today,'' he
explained.
	   The first private meeting between Castro and Seaga is a
reflection of the Caribbean nations' reconciliation with Cuba and
their increasing impatience with Washington's isolation of the
Communist island.
	   At a rally Wednesday in Montego Bay's Sam Sharpe Square _ named
for another revolutionary who led an unsuccessful slave rebellion
in Jamaica _ Castro railed against the U.S.-led globalization of
the world's economy.
	   ``We need to know which will be our places in that globalized
world,'' he said. ``We need to put up a fight for the Caribbean
nations and for all the peoples of the Third World region. Our
strength united cannot be ignored.''
	   Castro's host, Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, condemned
the U.S. embargo and the Helms-Burton law, which aims to punish
foreign firms investing in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba.
	   ``We are implacably opposed to the economic blockade against
Cuba, which is morally wrong,'' Patterson said. Helms-Burton, he
added, undermines international law and ``constitutes a threat to
the sovereignty of other nations.''
	   To applause, Patterson welcomed Castro as ``one of the great
leaders of the 20th century.''
	   The first stop on Castro's three-island tour, Jamaica has led a
Caribbean movement to re-establish diplomatic and trade links with
Cuba and has urged Washington to increase its contacts with Havana.
	   ``There are many (U.S.) congressmen who feel strongly that the
U.S. ought to put an end to the embargo,'' Jamaican Deputy Premier
Seymour Mullings said recently.
	   Castro will spend six days in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada. In
August, he joins other Caribbean leaders at a summit in the
Dominican Republic, which this year restored diplomatic relations
with Cuba after 37 years.
	   Castro leaves Jamaica on Friday for Barbados, where he will
honor the 73 victims of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner.
	   The most visible opposition to Castro's trip has come from
Grenada, where some politicians call his visit an insult to
Americans who invaded in 1983 to oust hard-line Marxists. At the
time, some U.S. strategists feared Grenada could help Castro export
his revolution.
	   Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 U.S. troops were killed
during the invasion.

Appeal Court quashes murder conviction of disabled youth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Appeal Court on Thursday overturned the
conviction of a mentally disabled youth hanged for the murder of a
policeman 45 years ago, ending years of public concern and a
campaign by the youth's family to clear his name.
	   ``It must be a matter of profound and continuing regret that
this mistrial occurred,'' said the Lord Chief Justice, Lord
Bingham, the head of the three-judge panel reviewing the case of
19-year-old Derek Bentley, who was convicted on the basis of a
disputed remark.
	   Bingham singled out the summing-up by the judge at Bentley's
1953 trial, saying it had denied the youth a fair trial.
	   Bentley's niece, Maria Dingwall-Bentley, was in the packed
courtroom to hear the verdict Thursday. Her mother Iris, Bentley's
sister, who ran the campaign to have him cleared, died of cancer in
November.
	   ``Today is a great victory of British justice,'' an emotional
Ms. Dingwall-Bentley told reporters outside the courtroom as she
waved a copy of the ruling. ``I just wish my mum was here. ... She
fought for this for 45 years.''
	   The fatal shot was fired by Bentley's friend, 16-year-old
Christopher Craig, when the pair were challenged by police as they
tried to break into a confectionery warehouse in south London on
Nov. 2, 1952.
	   Bentley, who developed epilepsy after being injured in a World
War II air raid, was unable to read or write, and had a mental age
of just 11 and an IQ of 66. Although younger, Craig was able to
dominate his friend.
	   The pair were on the roof of the warehouse when they were
challenged by police, who had been alerted by a neighbor.
	   Craig, who nurtured a hatred for the police after his brother
was jailed for armed robbery, fired his gun several times, killing
Constable Sidney Miles with a single bullet.
	   Three officers said later they heard Bentley call out to Craig,
``Let him have it, Chris,'' a remark interpreted as an
encouragement to Craig to fire.
	   At the pair's Old Bailey trial, there was contradictory evidence
as to whether Bentley knew that Craig was carrying a gun.
	   One policeman who was at the scene later denied Bentley made the
``Let him have it'' remark, also denied by both Bentley and Craig.
	   The judge's summing up made no mention of Bentley's mental
problems and lent a lot of weight to the remark, leaving the jury
little option but to convict. Unusually in such cases, the jury
made a plea for clemency.
	   Bentley was hanged at Wandsworth Prison in London on Jan. 28,
1953. Too young to be executed, Craig spent 10 years in prison.
	   He welcomed the judges' decision Thursday.
	   ``A day does not go by when I don't think about Derek, and now
his innocence has been proved,'' he said.

	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam isn't ready to turn the
LPGA Tour over to Se Ri Pak just yet.
	   Sorenstam, the player of the year in 1997 when she won six times
and earned a record dlrs 1.2 million, has come on strong by winning
three times in her last five tournaments.
	   But talk of rivalry has surfaced again. A year ago it was Karrie
Webb and now it's Pak, who leads the money list and the points for
player of the year.
	   ``It's always very competitive at the top,'' Sorenstam said. ``I
like to be No. 1. When you have somebody playing well, it makes you
grind even harder.''
	   Despite all the attention on Pak, Sorenstam is having another
banner year. She has finished in the top 10 in all but two of her
14 events, and she leads the tour with a 69.86 scoring average, the
statistic that matters the most to her.
	   ``It's not that I'm playing bad,'' she said. ``Somebody else is
just playing better.''

Report: Powerful Nigerian soldier is retired
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ One of Nigeria's most senior army officers
and a former close associate of the country's late dictator has
retired from the military, a newspaper report said Thursday.
	   The daily Lagos Press said it was unclear whether Lt. Gen.
Jeremiah Useni, who was the nation's second-ranking soldier during
the rule of the late Gen. Sani Abacha, had been forced out or had
voluntarily retired.
	   The acting defense spokesman, Col. Godwin Ugbo, said he could
neither confirm nor deny the report.
	   Useni, a 41-year military veteran who was also the minister of
the capital of Abuja until the cabinet was dissolved three weeks
ago, had been expected by many observers to succeed Abacha in the
hours immediately after the dictator's sudden death in early June.
	   Instead, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar took the helm of the nation,
and has been consolidating his power among the ruling junta since
then. Many senior military and civilian advisors to Abacha have
already been forced out, including the powerful chiefs of the
security and intelligence services.
	   Nigeria was devastated by Abacha's five-year rule, crippled by
corruption and neglect and left an international outcast for its
abysmal human rights record.
	   Abubakar, however, has pledged to return Nigeria to civilian
rule by May 1999. He has already freed dozens of political
prisoners and met with a number of important foreign envoys.
	   Many of the nation's dissidents, however, remain deeply
suspicious of him, fearing the military will find a way to retain
their grip on power.

East Timor's rebel leader reiterates desire for independence vote
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timor's jailed rebel chief on
Thursday told the ex-army general who arrested him that his
Indonesian-controlled homeland should be granted a vote on
independence.
	   Xanana Gusmao met retired Maj. Gen. Theo Syafei for an hour at
the prison in Jakarta where he is serving a 20-year sentence for
fighting Indonesian forces in East Timor.
	   Although they were adversaries, the two men often discussed the
conflict in the former Portuguese colony after Gusmao's capture in
1992 and built a mutual respect.
	   Syafei said Gusmao reiterated his belief that the only solution
was a referendum on self-determination in East Timor, a demand that
the Indonesian government has ruled out.
	   ``I'm pretty confident it won't be settled unless through a
referendum,'' Syafei quoted Gusmao as saying.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later. The United Nations, which does not recognize Indonesian
authority there, is sponsoring talks on the territory next week in
New York.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the foreign ministers of
Indonesia and Portugal will take part.
	   Syafei, who was the military's special operations commander when
Gusmao was arrested, said the separatist rebel leader invited him
to the prison for a discussion.
	   He said Gusmao appealed for tolerance from the Indonesian
military, which has been accused by human rights groups of
widespread abuses in East Timor over the past two decades.
	   Syafei quoted Gusmao as saying that he would respect the result
of a referendum, even it were against independence. But Gusmao said
he was confident most East Timorese would vote in favor.
	   Indonesian officials, however, say a vote in the territory of
800,000 could exacerbate internal divisions and lead to bloodshed.
	   President B.J. Habibie has offered a degree of autonomy and the
release of Gusmao in exchange for international recognition of
Indonesian control over East Timor.
	   A human rights group, meanwhile, suggested that independent
observers should monitor Indonesia's withdrawal of 1,000 troops
from East Timor as part of efforts to promote negotiations.
	   ``We hope that the troop reduction will lead to a decrease in
cases of human rights violations,'' said Aniceto Guterres Lopes,
head of the Dili-based Legal, Human Rights and Justice Foundation.
	   The military withdrew 400 soldiers from East Timor on Tuesday
and said another 600 would leave by early August. Once the cutback
is complete, 11,000 soldiers will remain.

Religious activist disrupts German campaign rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAYREUTH, Germany (AP) _ A religious activist shouting ``Jesus
loves you'' ran toward Gerhard Schroeder, the front-runner in
Germany's chancellor race, at a campaign rally, but was stopped
before reaching the podium.
	   The 23-year-old man from Hamburg and four others from a group
calling itself ``Jesus Freaks'' were escorted out of the hall
Wednesday night and searched. One was carrying a pocketknife, but
police said they do not believe the group intended to attack
Schroeder.
	   Police said the five said they only wanted to talk with
Schroeder and invite him to their religious service.
	   Schroeder did not seem upset by the disturbance, telling the
group as they were led out of the hall: ``A campaign rally is not
the right place to discuss religious matters.''

Orthodox group in Jordan calls meeting over Jerusalem property
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Greek Orthodox group in Jordan called
Thursday for a meeting to stop what it said was the church's policy
of selling and leasing its property in Jerusalem.
	   The Greek Orthodox Society in Amman, which represents Jordan's
small Orthodox community, invited delegations from Jerusalem, the
Palestinian territories, Canada, the United States and South
American countries to the meeting Friday.
	   Greek Orthodox Christians in the West Bank and Israel have
protested the church's land deals with Israeli and western
companies. Palestinians, some of whom are Christians, fear the sale
of land will prevent it from becoming part of a Palestinian state.
	   The society said the church's policy of selling and leasing land
aided ``the Jewish settlement program.''
	   The church has said it is only making an investment with the
land. In a letter to Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, the Greek
Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodoros, said the issue was
``misunderstood and misinterpreted.''

Keizo Obuchi declared Japan's new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with naming of Cabinet, quotes, report of
Japanese banks' bad debts far above official estimates; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi was declared
Japan's next prime minister after a vote in Parliament on Thursday,
defeating a challenge from a popular opposition leader and taking
the helm as Japan struggles with its deepest recession in decades.
	   Obuchi, 61, a soft-spoken consensus-builder, served as foreign
minister under his predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced
to quit after voter outrage over the stumbling economy dealt the
ruling party a painful defeat in July 12 upper house elections.
	   Obuchi grinned in satisfaction during the Parliament vote and
bowed when the results were announced. He made the rounds for
traditional greetings at the offices of political parties, and was
to present himself and his Cabinet before Emperor Akihito later
Thursday.
	   The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart takes over a
country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II. Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing
threat of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   In a decisive victory in the powerful lower house, Obuchi snared
268 votes of the 497 ballots cast in the ruling party-controlled
chamber, a comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority.
Opposition leader Naoto Kan was the runner-up with 164 votes.
	   Signaling the political divisions in Japan's government,
however, the opposition-dominated upper house endorsed Kan _
considered the country's most popular politician _ as premier with
142 votes of the 245 votes counted. Obuchi came in second place in
that race.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   The new government moved quickly to announce a so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' with former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa in the crucial post of finance minister _ considered a key
position in the administration's efforts to repair the economy.
	   ``We have to always remind ourselves what we have to do to
regain the public's trust,'' said Hiromu Nonaka, the new top
government spokesman. ``I accepted my post in an effort to make up
for the mistakes we've made.''
	   Miyazawa is respected by many an economics expert and is an
architect of the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden
banking system, though critics say his policies in the 1980s have
led to today's problems. His selection prompted rallies on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   ``No matter what we do, we have to keep in mind the seriousness
of the unemployment problem,'' Miyazawa told reporters. Joblessness
is at 4.1 percent _ the highest rate since the government started
measuring it in the 1950s.
	   Underscoring Japan's economic problems, The New York Times on
Thursday reported that U.S. officials and private financial experts
estimate Japanese banks suffer from nearly dlrs 1 trillion in bad
loans _ almost twice the official number. Japanese officials had no
immediate reaction to the report, which was based on accounts of
unidentified sources.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   The opposition, meanwhile, said the victory in the upper house
better represented the opinions of the voters.
	   ``The upper house results show that the vote in the lower house
does not reflect the will of the people,'' declared Kan, the
president of the Democratic Party.
	   The new prime minister's first priority will be the economy.
Obuchi has pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42.6
billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in new
spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   Most key posts in the new Cabinet went to ruling party veterans
instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Nonaka, 72, was
named chief cabinet secretary. Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education
minister, became minister of international trade and industry.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, replaced Obuchi as
foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi Sakaiya, a writer
and former bureaucrat, was named director-general of the Economic
Planning Agency.
	   The Cabinet included one woman: Seiko Noda, who was named as
post and telecommunications minister. A former hotel employee, she
entered politics at age 26 after inheriting the campaign support
group of her grandfather, who was a noted lawmaker.
	   The 37-year-old becomes the youngest Cabinet minister in
Japanese history.

U.N. rights envoy says tribunals for Khmer Rouge leaders `moving
</HEADLINE>
forward' &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The top United Nations human rights
envoy to Cambodia urged the new government emerging Thursday from
parliamentary elections to show strong political will in bringing
to trial leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime.
	   Thomas Hammarberg said efforts to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders
to justice for causing the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1979 were finally ``moving forward.''
	   A group of experts will come to Phnom Penh in early September to
assess the strength of evidence that has been collected against top
Khmer Rouge leaders and what avenues can be used to bring them to
trial.
	   They also will try to determine how a tribunal should be handled
_ whether it should be like ad hoc tribunals in third countries
dealing with crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda _ or ``a completely new approach, for instance having it
here.''
	   International prosecutors and judges could help, Hammarberg
said.
	   Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died of a purported heart
attack in April, but an estimated 20 influential Khmer Rouge
leaders who would be eligible to stand trial are still at large,
according to experts.
	   However, many former Khmer Rouge killers have received official
or de facto pardons in recent years for making peace with the
government to end festering civil war that followed their overthrow
by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
	   When strongman Hun Sen, who looks like the winner in Sunday's
parliamentary elections as the vote is slowly counted, talks about
bringing Khmer Rouge leaders to justice, he usually refers only to
the trio still leading a few hundred die-hard rebels _ Ta Mok, Nuon
Chea and Khieu Samphan.
	   ``We are not only talking about one, two or three people,''
Hammarberg said, though he was unwilling to list names.
	   Complications include a requirement by the Security Council that
bringing alleged war criminals to justice should not threaten
international stability, Hammarberg said.
	   ``If the political will is there, we can resolve that,''
Hammarberg said.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi accused
the military government Thursday of kidnapping her to end a six-day
roadside stalemate, saying police held her down, took the wheel of
her car and forcibly drove her back to the capital. A spokesman for
the military government admitted it had ended Suu Kyi's protest
against her will. Described by colleagues as ill and running low on
food, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was driven back to her
compound by a police driver who took the wheel of her white sedan
as it sat parked on a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the
capital. Authorities had stopped her there Friday as she tried to
drive to the provincial city of Bassein to meet party members.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton has agreed to break six
months of silence and provide videotaped testimony about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky as embarrassing details emerged
regarding material the former White House intern is providing to
prosecutors. Two legal sources said attorneys for Ms. Lewinsky
provided prosecutors a dress that she says is stained from a sexual
encounter with the president, which could become a key piece of
physical evidence in the investigation of an alleged presidential
affair and cover-up. Under an agreement with Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, Clinton will answer questions on videotape Aug. 17
from inside the White House. Senior aides said Clinton is prepared
to repeat his denial of any sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistan air force plane crashed
Thursday in a crowded Karachi neighborhood, killing at least six
people on the ground, three of them children. At least 25 people
were injured, most with serious burns. Three houses burst into
flames immediately after the crash, and the fire quickly spread in
the neighborhood of small, one-story dwellings, trapping an unknown
number of people. The bodies of three adults and three children
were pulled from the rubble. (PAKISTAN-PLANE CRASH)
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen proposed quelling
Cambodia's latest round of political instability Thursday by
creating a three-sided coalition government including two
opposition parties that accuse him of winning parliamentary
elections by fraud. Hun Sen emerged from talks with King Norodom
Sihanouk, a figurehead who still wields influence, and claimed he
had won royal backing for the coalition, under which he still would
hold all the important levers of power. But it was unclear how the
parties of candidates Prince Norodom Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy would
react. Refusing to recognize Hun Sen's apparent victory in Sunday's
elections, both have threatened to boycott the National Assembly
and paralyze formation of a new government. (CAMBODIA-ELECTIONS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ Recent Serb battlefield gains
appear to have made Kosovo Albanians reconsider their hard-line
stance as they seek to unite their different factions _ a likely
step toward meaningful negotiations. But it was unclear if the key
element in the Kosovo equation, the rebel Kosovo Liberation army,
would be part of a unified, self-styled government that the top
Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, announced Wednesday will be
set up. The underground army is fighting for the independence of
Kosovo, which is being rejected both by the Serbian government and
the West. Rugova said he had reached a compromise with other ethnic
Albanians on a coalition government, saying it would include ``all
political forces'' and ``create preconditions for a dialogue'' with
the Serb-led Yugoslav government. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stocks finished mostly higher on
Thursday, with local factors coming to the fore as traders waited
to see what direction Japan's new government will take the country.
While analysts in Hong Kong reported volatile trading ahead of the
expiration of July futures contracts, in many other markets
activity was relatively low as traders waited for a reason to move.
Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher. Keizo Obuchi's election as
prime minister by parliament had little impact. But banking shares
rose on expectations that the new finance minister, Kiichi
Miyazawa, may be less aggressive in pursuing reform. The Nikkei
average rose 43.51 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 16,201.60.
In Seoul, share prices were up slightly on hopes of lower interest
rates. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ South Asian leaders met privately
Thursday in a seaside resort to discuss how they can increase trade
among themselves and move closer toward setting up a regional
common market. Officials fear it may take up to 10 years to set up
a free trade zone in South Asia, along the lines of the European
Union, given the low volume of business among the seven member
countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation,
or SAARC. The leaders are expected to approve recommendations by
their foreign ministers to ease visa restrictions to promote
tourism, establish direct air links between their capitals, and
simplify customs formalities.(SOUTH ASIA SUMMIT)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co. on Thursday issued
what it said was its final offer for 1,820 striking workers to take
early retirement or face outright dismissal. But the workers, along
with some 3,000 sympathetic colleagues, kept the company's main
plants in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul,
idle for the 11th day, vowing to continue their struggle until they
are granted job security. The company's offer was contained in
thousands of leaflets dropped by helicopter over the
plants.(SKOREA-LABOR)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ General Motors auto plants in Mexico are
ready to resume production at full capacity after U.S. autoworkers
agreed to end a 53-day strike at two U.S. plants. GM has said the
last of its US plants won't be running until next week. The Mexican
plants played a key role in the strike. Workers at both plants on
strike in the U.S. state of Michigan cited fears that GM planned to
send their jobs to Mexico or elsewhere abroad. At one point in the
work stoppage which began in early June, the Ramos Arizpe small-car
plant in the northern Mexico state of Coahuila was the GM's only
operating assembly plant in North America. (MEXICO-GM STRIKE)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With car sales in Southeast Asia
expected to plunge 80 percent this year, Japanese car makers plan
to boost the export of auto parts outside Asia. Japanese automobile
executives also said they would depend less on imported parts from
the United States and instead spur industrial activity within Asia
by buying car components made by countries within the region.
Senior automobile officials from Japan and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations met Thursday to discuss the region's auto
industry. (MALAYSIA-JAPANESE CARS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Cheap deals for tourists are plentiful
in Indonesia these days. On Thursday, some were free, all part of a
bid to lure visitors back to the troubled nation. In a government
campaign dubbed ``Let's Go Indonesia!,'' foreigners arriving in the
country were treated to vouchers for free hotel rooms and meals as
well as free or discounted air tickets. Asia's currency crisis and
recent riots over price increases in Indonesia have battered the
once-robust tourism industry in the nation of 200 million people.
Political turmoil forced former President Suharto to quit in May
after 32 years in power. (INDONESIA-TOURIST)

Kohl party leader says most Germans still undecided about election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) _ Insisting that most Germans are
still undecided two months ahead of national elections, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's party leader said the final phase of the campaign
would focus on trust.
	   Although most polls show Social Democratic challenger Gerhard
Schroeder holding on to a comfortable lead over Kohl, Peter Hintze,
chairman of Kohl's Christian Democrats, said voter research showed
``the big absolute majority'' are not firm in their decision.
	   He cited a poll by an independent research group for German
television that found 70 percent of Germans say they could still
change their mind before the Sept. 27 election.
	   ``That means that in this election, August and September will be
the decisive months,'' Hintze told Southwest Radio.
	   He said the ``real campaign'' would focus on asking voters to
decide who they trust in office ``in a time in which Europe is
getting a new currency.''
	   ``It has to do with who can guarantee the strength of this
currency _ and stand up for Germany in the most important
questions,'' he said. ``And I'm sure that we'll get a decision in
our favor.''

Lehman Brothers of U.S. buys Thai unit of Peregrine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Asian arm of U.S.-based global
investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said Thursday it has
acquired Thailand's Peregrine Finance and Securities.
	   The Thai unit of Hong Kong's Peregrine Group was bought from the
group's liquidators, Lehman Brothers Asia said in a statement.
	   No purchase price was announced.
	   The former Peregrine subsidiary will operate independently from
Lehman Brothers Thailand Ltd., which has been principally engaged
in advisory services, the statement said.
	   Peregrine collapsed last year when Indonesia's currency, the
rupiah, plunged in value. The company had invested nearly one-third
of its capital in a taxi company associated with relatives of
former President Suharto.
	   When the rupiah weakened, the company could not repay its loans
and went into bankruptcy, dragging Peregrine with it.
	   Thailand's financial sector has also been in disarray since the
country's currency, the baht, was floated last July, sparking an
economic crisis. The Thai government shut down 56 insolvent finance
companies earlier this year.
	   Kittivalai Charoensombut-amorn of Lehman Brothers Thailand has
been appointed country manager of Peregrine, responsible for all of
Lehman Brothers' activities in Thailand, it said.
	   Peregrine's Thai finance and securities office has remained open
since the collapse of the group, but securities trading has ceased
for the past several months.
	   ``We believe the addition of this business will significantly
enhance Lehman Brothers' leadership role in helping to restructure
the Thai financial services sector,'' Kittivalai was quoted as
saying.
	   The company described itself as a leading underwriter of Thai
equity, convertible and debt offerings, and an adviser in several
major Thai privatization and other assignments.
	   Lehman Brothers said the acquisition will enable it to offer a
more integrated set of investment banking and capital markets
products to corporations, governments, institutions and high
net-worth individuals.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western diplomats claimed some
progress in efforts to unite Albanian factions for peace talks on
the future of Kosovo, but said the process was slowed by Serb-led
government gains on the battlefield.
	   In the latest diplomatic move, a three-member European Union
delegation was meeting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on
Thursday in Belgrade after meetings in Kosovo the day before.
	   Milosevic has agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled
out independence, as demanded by Albanian politicians and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on composition of an
``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
	   On Wednesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met for three
hours with Albanian politicians and KLA representatives in the
village of Likoc in the Drenica region.
	   After the meeting, Hill told reporters that the KLA ``showed
interest in reaching an agreement'' but indicated the process would
take time.

Brunei launches its first Malay-language newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Despite economic woes
troubling many of Asia's newspapers, Brunei's first Malay-language
newspaper hit the stands Thursday.
	   The newspaper, called Media Permata, will occupy a niche that
has long existed in the country, said Rex deSilva, editor-in-chief
of its popular sister publication, the Borneo Bulletin daily.
	   More than 80 percent of the 350,000 people living in the
oil-rich sultanate are ethnic Malays, and the literacy rate for
Bruneians is 95 percent.
	   Media Permata is published by the Brunei Press, a company owned
by QAF Brunei, the country's second-largest conglomerate,
controlled the younger brother of the sultan of Brunei.
	   DeSilva, who founded the Borneo Bulletin, stressed that the
newspaper will maintain an independent editorial policy and expects
eventually to garner the wide circulation enjoyed by its English
counterpart.

Thai cop says colleagues extorting money from his go-go bar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai police sergeant has accused four
other policemen of posing as gangsters and trying to extort
protection money from his Bangkok go-go bar, local newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   The sergeant has filed a complaint against his colleagues with
the police department, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   He said the four posed as gangster and demanded he pay them
30,000 baht (dlrs 750) a month in protection money for his go-go
bar, Long Gun I, in on Soi Cowboy in Bangkok.
	   Go-go bars on Soi Cowboy are well-known places of prostitution.
The sergeant said he and his wife had been running the bar since
1994 because they couldn't support their family on a policeman's
salary.
	   The sergeant also complained that one of the four policemen had
had sex with his wife, breaking up his family.

Cameroon outlines reform for IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Prime Minister Peter Mafany Musonge has
outlined a 12-month program of economic reform for the
International Monetary Fund as a prerequisite for continued
assistance from the lending agency.
	   Musonge's pledge came in the form of a letter of intent signed
for the IMF, the government said Thursday.
	   The letter of intent paves the way for IMF assistance in the
second year of Cameroon's three-year economic restructuring
program. Tied to its continued reform program, the IMF has pledged
a total of dlrs 219 million in assistance to this Central African
country through its three-year plan.
	   A government statement said the letter of intent also fulfilled
a key condition for further World Bank support.
	   ``The results from the first year of the three-year agreement
were satisfying,'' the government statement said. ``Cameroon's
external competitiveness was improved thanks to the pursuit of
structural reforms and a fall in the rate of inflation.''
	   An IMF inspection team is expected to visit Cameroon in the
coming weeks to review the country's overall economic performance
as it relates to its reform program.

Serb battlefield gains may complicate search for peace in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western diplomats claimed some
progress in efforts to unite Albanian factions for peace talks on
the future of Kosovo, but said the process has been slowed by Serb
battlefield gains against ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In the latest diplomatic move, a three-member European Union
delegation on Thursday was meeting Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade after meetings in Kosovo the day before.
	   Milosevic has agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled
out independence, as demanded by Albanian politicians and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on composition of an
``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
	   On Wednesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met for three
hours with Albanian politicians and KLA representatives in the
village of Likoc in the Drenica region. Hill made no statement
after the meeting and returned to Macedonia, where he serves as the
U.S. ambassador.
	   Western diplomats familiar with the negotiations said Hill's
meeting achieved some progress toward uniting the Albanians. They
refused to elaborate, but the fact that Hill returned to Macedonia
suggested the deal was far from complete.
	   The latest talks took place against the background of major
gains by Serb forces in retaking parts of the province under
Albanian control. Since launching an offensive Friday, Serb police
have driven KLA fighters from their stronghold in Malisevo and
pushed them off the main highway between Pristina and Pec which the
insurgents had blocked since May.
	   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Serb
gains had complicated efforts toward peace talks.
	   ``To get people to talk, they have to feel confident and
comfortable and not that they're operating from a position of
weakness,'' one diplomat said. ``No one is going to win this with a
knockout punch. There has to be a diplomatic solution.''
	   On Wednesday, the leading ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, said he had reached a compromise with other groups on a
coalition government that would include ``all political forces''
and ``create preconditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led
Yugoslav government.
	   Albanian-language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA the defense and interior posts, meaning it would control
the provincial police. But it remained unclear whether a
significant part of the KLA was prepared to accept any such offer.

Women prisoners stage hunger strike in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Some women inmates staging a hunger strike
at a prison in central Turkey are in serious condition, a human
rights group said Thursday.
	   Some 130 women at Sivas prison have been taking turns in
refusing food over the past 63 days, said Nazmi Gur, head of the
independent Human Rights Association.
	   ``Lawyers are negotiating with prison authorities for an end,''
he said.
	   The prisoners are protesting water shortages at the prison and
access to the cellblocks by male guards, who allegedly have
conducted searches of the women. They also want better access to
lawyers and to be supplied newspapers and magazines, Gur said.
	   Turkish prisoners often stage hunger strikes over prison
conditions.
	   Twelve inmates died two years ago in a nationwide hunger strike
before the government bowed to their demands for improved
conditions.

Kaohsiung, was kidnapped Monday from a hotel in the northeastern
port city of Luda together with her Taiwanese boyfriend, said her
colleague Huang Chao-hsin.
	   Lin fell ill two days later while in captivity, and when the
kidnappers took her to see a doctor, her friend escaped and
reported the incident to local police, Huang said.
	   Huang said police had not located her yet.
	   The kidnapping has caused an uproar among the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, of which Lin is a member. Former
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said the incident could hurt China's
efforts to attract foreign investment.
	   Lin reportedly has business dealings in China.
	   The Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official body handling
exchanges with China, has handled about 180 cases of Taiwanese
business people being kidnapped, intimidated, or facing extortion
threats in the past few years.

Israel considering release of 100 Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting of European envoy, another house
demolition; subs 7th graf pvs to CORRECT that Erekat meeting Naveh &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid efforts to restart peace talks, Israel is
considering a goodwill gesture: the release of 100 Palestinian
prisoners, officials said Thursday.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is looking into the
request for a prisoner release made earlier this week by Yasser
Arafat's top deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, Kahalani's spokeswoman said.
	   According to the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu supports the move and has asked Kahalani to draw
up a list of prisoners to be freed.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak refused to comment on the
report.
	   With Israel-Palestinian relations at a low point, such a release
would be aimed at building confidence and getting peace efforts
back on track.
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago, and at the urging of the
U.S. government, the two sides have been holding direct meetings
for the past 11 days to try to revive them.
	   So far, no breakthrough has occurred. More talks were set later
Thursday between Cabinet Secretary Danny Neveh and chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Also Thursday, the European Union's Mideast envoy, Miguel
Moratinos, met separately with Netanyahu and Erekat to discuss the
peace talks.
	   Israel is under pressure to accept a U.S. peace initiative
calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already approved the initiative,
but Netanyahu is balking.
	   Lawmakers reproached Netanyahu on Wednesday over his handling of
the peace talks. They voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
preliminary measure that would help set the stage for early
elections.
	   The vote was seen as a sign of dissatisfaction across the
political spectrum with the prime minister's stance on the
Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, the Israeli army demolished four Palestinian homes
Thursday outside the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Human rights groups say the pace of such demolitions _ usually
carried out because a homebuilder lacked a permit _ has increased
sharply in recent months. Palestinians say it is almost impossible
for them to obtain building permits from Israel.
	   ``This is state terror _ this is Netanyahu's peace,'' said
32-year-old Ahmed Murqaktan, a father of eight whose home was among
those demolished Thursday.
	   A scuffle broke out between Palestinians and soldiers during one
of the demolitions, but there were no injuries or arrests.

Apartheid's `Dr. Death' refuses to answer to truth panel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Refusing even to give his age,
the mastermind behind a secret chemical and biological weapons
program won another delay Thursday from testifying before a panel
probing apartheid atrocities.
	   Dr. Wouter Basson ran a network of army front companies whose
scientists toiled to make poisons for government assassins and
researched a bacteria that would only kill blacks.
	   Basson, dubbed ``Dr. Death'' in local media, has sought to avoid
answering questions from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
arguing the testimony could prejudice his criminal trial on drug
and conspiracy to murder charges.
	   Basson told a commission hearing he could not answer questions
because his lawyers were busy on other matters. He already had won
a delay on Wednesday.
	   With the commission's mandate running out on Friday, Basson
seemed set on delaying his testimony until the deadline expired.
That would end a chance for further light to be shed on the
program, partly outlined by scientists in previous testimony.
	   Truth Commission lawyer Hanif Vally repeatedly asked Basson
basic questions, such as his age, military rank and when he joined
the army.
	   Basson refused to reply. ``I can answer no questions at this
stage,'' the balding, bearded surgeon said.
	   A furious Dumisa Ntsebeza, head of the commission's
investigations unit, warned Basson he was in danger of contempt of
both the commission and a High Court ruling ordering him to
co-operate.
	   ``How you can be prejudiced by answering the question how old
you are defeats me,'' he snapped ``I have a sense you treat us with
contempt.''
	   Ntsebeza, speaking slowly and visibly angry with Basson's
maneuvering, granted a delay until early Friday morning after
Basson gave assurances that one of his lawyers would be available.
	   Set up in 1995, a year after all-race elections ended apartheid,
the Truth Commission is charged with uncovering the facts about
human rights abuses committed by all sides in the fight against
white rule.

After low election profile, Sihanouk returns to stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting ended, Hun Sen praising king, grafs 3-5 &QL;

 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ After keeping an unusually low
profile during the recent, violence-marred parliamentary elections,
King Norodom Sihanouk returned Thursday to Cambodia's political
center stage.
	   The 75-year-old monarch received strongman Hun Sen, the apparent
election winner, at his palace in the northern town of Siem Reap,
near the spiritual center of Cambodian power, the ancient Angkor
temples.
	   With the country facing fresh political turmoil after Sunday's
parliamentary elections, the king endorsed Hun Sen's plan to form a
three-party coalition government with the losers, who claim Hun
Sen's victory is fraudulent.
	   Afterward, Hun Sen laid on some courtly flattery of the kind
Sihanouk has always appreciated.
	   ``The role of King Norodom Sihanouk cannot be replaced by
anyone,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``The success we have achieved in
holding the elections cannot be separated from the really important
role played by our king.''
	   The king, who is in poor health, has walked a tightrope since
Hun Sen deposed his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as co-prime
minister in a coup last year and dispelled any pretense of
power-sharing.
	   Hun Sen, a peasant's son, has said many times that the royal
family should stay out of politics. Sihanouk has expressed fears
that Cambodia's constitutional monarchy will end with his death.
	   His only pre-election role was to issue a statement urging
people to vote and assuring them of ballot secrecy.
	   Still, following the death of infamous Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, Sihanouk remains the world's best-known Cambodian and Hun Sen
needs his tacit blessing to win back the international legitimacy
and aid he lost after last year's coup.
	   Sihanouk has little formal power, but his symbolic importance
dates from his coronation as a teen-ager under the French colonial
regime in 1941, continuing a royal tradition dating to the
Angkorian god-kings.
	   In 1955, he abdicated, resumed his title as prince and took
charge of day-to-day politics during a period of relative peace and
prosperity now remembered only by his older subjects.
	   Ultimately failing to keep his small country out of the Vietnam
War next door, Sihanouk was deposed in a U.S.-backed military coup
in 1970. To regain power, he linked up with the little-known Khmer
Rouge.
	   The Khmer Rouge's strength mushroomed thanks to the monarch's
presence and the U.S. carpet-bombing of eastern Cambodia, which led
to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
	   But Sihanouk became a prisoner in his palace after the
Maoist-inspired revolutionaries took power in 1975 and turned the
country into a vast forced labor camp.
	   Several of his children and relatives were among the 2 million
Cambodians who died over the next four years. Sihanouk survived
only because of the intervention of China, the Khmer Rouge's
biggest ally.
	   Vietnamese troops toppled the Khmer Rouge in 1979. Sihanouk
eventually came to lead a Khmer Rouge-dominated resistance against
the decade-long occupation by Cambodia's historic enemy.
	   Sihanouk regained his throne under the 1991 peace accords that
led to U.N.-sponsored elections two years later.
	   They were won by Ranariddh, but the prince was forced into a
joint premiership when Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
Hanoi-backed regime, threatened more civil war.

Swiss central bank carries out own Nazi gold study
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank is
carrying out its own study to shed more light on its gold dealings
with Nazi Germany during World War II, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   The Swiss National Bank, charged with maintaining the strength
of the Swiss currency, faces a U.S. suit by Holocaust survivors
seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   The study, which aims to provide a clearer picture of economic
policy during the war, is already under way, bank spokesman Gabriel
Juri said. He declined to give further details.
	   Historical studies in recent months have said the central bank
should have known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi
Germany during the war had been looted from the national treasuries
of occupied countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also had received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds)
of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   During the war, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold in
the face of ever greater demand for the Swiss franc, the only
internationally acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   The central bank has said it will oppose vigorously any
class-action suit filed against it. The Swiss government called the
suit, filed last month, ``unacceptable.''
	   Both have refused to become involved in negotiations over a
settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks,
Jewish groups and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing
plans to withhold business from the banks and, if no solution is
found, from other Swiss firms. Other states also have announced
plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   The Swiss government task force on World War II said Thursday
President Flavio Cotti will meet on Sept. 7 with major Swiss
companies to discuss the sanctions threats.
	   Some 12 senior officials of large banking, insurance and
industrial companies, as well as central bank and government
representatives, have been invited to meet with Cotti, spokeswoman
Linda Shepard said.

Malaysia relaxes visa rules for Indians, Chinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hoping to boost the dwindling
number of tourists, Malaysia has made it easier for Chinese and
Indian citizens to obtain tourist visas.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said Thursday the move
was recommended by Malaysia's emergency economic panel, the
National Economic Action Council, to spur the growth of tourism in
the country.
	   Chinese citizens now can apply for tourist visas at Malaysian
embassies, he said.
	   However, Chinese citizens living in Singapore, Thailand and Hong
Kong will still have to be sponsored by tourist agencies registered
with the Malaysian government, Tajol Rosli was quoted as saying by
the national news agency Bernama.
	   They must also enter the country in groups of at least four, he
said, though exemptions could be given on a case-by-case basis.
	   Indians can get multiple-entry visas by proving they are
businessmen, tourists or government officers. Until now, Indians
could get only short-duration single-entry tourist visas unless
they had Malaysian sponsors.
	   Due to the prolonged economic crisis battering Asia, there have
been sharp decreases in arrivals this year from Singapore,
Thailand, Japan, Indonesia and Taiwan, Malaysia's top five tourism
markets.
	   This year, Malaysia hopes to attract 6.8 million tourists, a
sharp drop from its earlier target of 10.5 million visitors. The
country has set a target of 7 million for 1999 and 7.5 million for
2000.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistan air force plane slammed into
a crowded Karachi neighborhood Thursday, killing at least six
people on the ground. At least 25 people were injured, most with
serious burns.
	   The plane exploded on impact, immediately setting three houses
on fire. The flames quickly spread through the neighborhood of
small, one-story dwellings, trapping an unknown number of people.
	   The six dead, including three children, were pulled from the
houses. The bodies were burned beyond recognition. The afternoon
crash came at a time of the day when mostly women and children were
at home.
	   The air force said the Chinese built F-7P fighter, which was on
a routine training mission, developed serious engine trouble while
returning to base nearby and hit the ground in western Orangi
district, a densely populated, lower-middle class neighborhood in
Karachi, the port city that is Pakistan's financial hub..
	   ``The pilot of the aircraft tried to steer it as far away from
the populated area as the circumstances allowed him. When all
efforts to save the aircraft failed..., the pilot ejected out of
the aircraft,'' the air force said in a statement.
	   Dozens of fire trucks converged on the scene. Military troops
cordoned off the area as hundreds of residents rushed home from
work, anxious about relatives.
	   Earlier Thursday in neighboring India, a commercial propeller
aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from the southern city of
Cochin. All six persons on board were killed, Indian news agencies
reported.

Glaxo Wellcome earnings fall, but bright forecast lifts shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Glaxo Wellcome PLC said Thursday its half-year
profits fell 21 percent to 827 million pounds (dlrs 1.35 billion),
mainly because it lost U.S. patents on two key medicines, but the
drugmaker encouraged investors with a bullish outlook for new
products.
	   Traders pushed Glaxo Wellcome up by 7.6 percent to 1,874 pence
(dlrs 30.73) per share by early afternoon on the London Stock
Exchange.
	   Glaxo Wellcome said its earnings for the six months ending June
30 compared with profits of 1.05 billion pounds in the same period
a year earlier.
	   Glaxo Wellcome attributed the big decline to last year's loss of
U.S. patents for two top-selling medicines, the ulcer drug Zantac
and the herpes medication Zovirax.
	   Revenues slipped to 3.87 billion pounds (dlrs 6.30 billion),
compared with 4.11 billion pounds a year earlier.
	   ``In the context of the Zantac and Zovirax patent expiries in
the U.S.A., this is a commendable performance,'' said the Glaxo
Wellcome chairman, Sir Richard Sykes. ``We expect the second half
of 1998 to show a very different picture, as the effect of these
patent expiries becomes a thing of the past.''
	   Sykes said Glaxo Wellcome plans to launch five important new
drugs by the end of 1999 and that the company is developing new
treatments for illnesses that include irritable bowel syndrome,
stroke and diabetes.
	   Despite the slide in earnings, Sykes noted that Glaxo Wellcome
is a much more broadly based company now than it was in 1994, the
year before Glaxo PLC bought out rival Wellcome PLC in a hostile
dlrs 15 billion deal.
	   Back then, Zantac accounted for more than 40 percent of sales,
Sykes said, but Glaxo Wellcome now has a wider portfolio of new
drugs and medicines in the advanced stages of development.
	   Respiratory drugs now account for 27 percent of sales, with two
big drugs leading the way. Flixotide has shown a 71 percent jump in
sales, while Serevent sales are up 24 percent, Glaxo Wellcome said.
	   Anti-viral products now make up 17 percent of total sales, with
Valtrex up 71 percent and the HIV medication Combivir up by 18
percent.
	   Glaxo Wellcome's migraine drugs, Imigran-Imitrex and
Naramig-Amerge, enjoyed 13 percent sales growth in the huge U.S.
market. The depression treatment Wellbutrin SR saw sales double,
while the epilepsy medicine Lamictal was up by 28 percent.
	   The five new drugs Glaxo Wellcome plans to launch are abacavir
and amprenavir, for HIV and AIDS patients; Zeffix for hepatitis B;
Seretide for asthma; and Relenza, for flu.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen won King Norodom
Sihanouk's unofficial backing Thursday to try to quell Cambodia's
political instability by creating a three-sided coalition
government including opposition parties that accuse him of
electoral fraud.
	   But the opposition parties led by Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, and Sam Rainsy said it was too early to discuss a
coalition before allegations of election irregularities are
investigated and the final count from Sunday's elections is in.
	   Hun Sen still would hold all the important levers of power under
his coalition plan.
	   Though Sihanouk is largely a figurehead, his popularity among
many Cambodians and high international profile make his blessing a
vital step for Hun Sen to win back international legitimacy and aid
lost by ousting Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup
last year.
	   ``The king is pleased with the idea,'' Hun Sen told a news
conference after emerging from talks with Sihanouk. ``It will
create cooperation in the National Assembly and the government,
giving a favorable atmosphere for national reconstruction.''
	   Accusing Hun Sen of rigging the election, both Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party threaten to boycott the
assembly and paralyze formation of a government.
	   Terrorized opposition activists, meanwhile, have fled from the
provinces to the capital, Phnom Penh, as the Hun Sen-controlled
police retaliated for their challenges to his rule.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, the top United Nations human rights envoy to
Cambodia, said the international community wanted it stopped.
	   ``It's very important that the political leadership make very
clear they will take a strong stance against attempts to settle
scores,'' said Hammarberg.
	   Many Cambodians disbelieve claims by Hun Sen's party of an
overwhelming election victory, but they also put a premium on
stability after decades of war, the Khmer Rouge genocide of the
1970s that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people, and
last year's coup.
	   Under Hun Sen's proposal, his Cambodian People's Party would
retain control of the key ministries _ the security portfolios of
interior and defense, finance, justice and foreign affairs. Sharing
other ministries would be discussed after final results come in.
	   The action signaled that Hun Sen _ relaxed and confident despite
an emergency appendectomy two weeks ago _ realizes he cannot ignore
the opposition but intends to keep all real power.
	   Hun Sen said that officials of his party have already discussed
the idea with FUNCINPEC
	   Sihanouk, 75, intends to leave for China for medical treatment
once the new assembly and government are seated, Hun Sen said.
	   The opposition has threatened to boycott the assembly, denying
the two-thirds attendance needed to confirm a new government. Hun
Sen replied Wednesday he would change the constitution to rule
unfettered for the next five years.
	   The Asian Network for Free Elections, an independent monitoring
group, and human rights groups claimed that opposition activists
were being terrorized in the provinces after Hun Sen won.
	   At least 23 activists have fled to Phnom Penh, ANFREL told a
news conference. In many cases, police surrounded meetings and
attacked or threatened those attending.
	   ``If massive violence or retaliation occurs, it will undermine
the limited success of the election,'' said ANFREL member Nobuhiko
Suto.
	   In the pre-election period, violence, including murder, was
widespread against opposition activists.
	   Full official results are not expected from the Hun Sen-packed
National Election Committee before Sunday.
	   The top independent monitoring group, the Committee for Free and
Fair Elections in Cambodia, said its figures showed that with 90
percent of the ballots counted, the CPP looked set to get 59 of the
122 National Assembly seats, FUNCINPEC 45 and the Sam Rainsy Party
18.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Hun Sen, who
came to power in 1985 under the Vietnamese occupation that followed
the Khmer Rouge, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war. He deposed Ranariddh last year
in two days of fighting in the capital.

Six killed as propeller plane crashes in southern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A propeller aircraft of a government-run
airline crashed shortly after taking off from a southern Indian
city Thursday, killing all six persons on board.
	   Alliance Air's Dornier aircraft, with three passengers and as
many crew, crashed and burst into flames near a naval workshop in
Cochin, United News of India and Press Trust of India news agencies
reported.
	   The airport is located in a naval base and is used by both
civilian and military planes.
	   The 16-seater aircraft had come from the nearby Lakshadweep
islands and was heading for Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala
state. Cochin is 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of New
Delhi.
	   The cause of the accident and the weather conditions over Cochin
were not immediately known.

British authorities will probe grocery pricing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A consumer watchdog agency said Thursday it wants
to find out whether Britain's biggest supermarket chains are paying
suppliers too little and then charging customers too much.
	   Britain's director-general of fair trading, John Bridgeman,
announced the investigation into grocery pricing practices at four
companies _ J. Sainsbury PLC, Safeway PLC, Tesco PLC and ASDA Group
PLC.
	   The Office of Fair Trading has received numerous complaints from
consumers, food producers and distributors, he said.
	   Bridgeman said he wants to learn whether the big grocers might
be exercising their financial clout by purchasing goods cheaply,
but then not passing along enough savings to customers. Previous
studies have shown the grocers used their purchasing muscle to
negotiate good wholesale prices, but also were competing vigorously
by offering customers a fair deal.
	   But their influence over the British retail sector has grown in
recent years, and Bridgeman said the time seems right for another
look.
	   Bridgeman promised to make his findings public, which he said
``will be in the best interests of the supermarkets themselves,
given the level of disquiet about their activities that surfaces
from time to time.''
	   A retail lobbying group said it welcomed the investigation,
which ``should clear the air'' amid gripes from farmers and food
manufacturers, who have seen sharp drops in some wholesale prices.
	   The British Retail Consortium said the high value of the British
pound has more to do with that than any action by the supermarkets.
	   The supermarkets said they will cooperate with the
investigators, and several executives predicted their pricing
policies will be vindicated.
	   ``Price is a very important element we offer,'' said Dino
Adriano, chief executive at Sainsbury. ``We monitor our prices
against those of our competitors every week to ensure that our
customers receive the very best value.''

Rwandan troops return from Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ More than 100 Rwandan troops and officers
have returned home from neighboring Democratic Republic of the
Congo in what each of the governments claimed was its own decision.
	   A Rwandan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
Thursday, said two planeloads of Rwandan troops and their families
landed at Kigali's Kanombe airport late Wednesday.
	   Col. James Kabari, a Rwandan who served as Congo's interim army
chief of staff, was also expected to return. He stepped down last
month as part of the Rwandan withdrawal and has been since serving
as a senior military advisor to Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Military spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said it was Rwanda's
decision to withdraw the troops more than a year after they played
a decisive role in overthrowing longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
and bringing Kabila to power in May 1997.
	   The Rwandan officers and soldiers stayed on to help maintain
order and train the new Congolese army.
	   Ndahiro said the Congolese government had been upset by the
decision and had pre-empted negotiations with Kigali on the issue
by announcing Monday Congo had ordered them to leave.
	   Kabila on Tuesday said the Rwandans had to leave to ``create
orderly relations'' between the two countries. He warned his own
officers not to allow the withdrawal ``cause chaos.''
	   He was apparently referring to possible attacks against ethnic
Rwandans from eastern Congo, who although a minority, have held key
posts in business community and within the new army.
	   Kabila is often accused by his opposition of allowing the
country to be run by foreigners.
	   Kabila's ties with Rwanda and Uganda, which had also helped his
rebel alliance, have been gradually deteriorating. Disputes have
flared over the way Kabila manages the vast country formerly known
as Zaire, and Hutu rebels continue to use bases in eastern Congo to
launch attacks inside Rwanda.
	   Tensions have also escalated between Tutsi officers from Rwanda
and eastern Congo and members of the new Congolese army from other
tribes.

BMW, VW decline comment on rumors of merger talk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ The two German automakers that battled
each other to buy Rolls-Royce, then tussled over control of the
name, might be courting for a future merger.
	   Neither VW nor BMW would comment on the report in the
mass-market Bild newspaper, which quoted auto industry analysts and
insiders as describing the Rolls-Royce deal as ``a test marriage.''
	   But stock in both companies was rising on the rumors.
	   VW beat BMW this year in a bidding war for Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars Ltd., but failed to secure the rights to the name. That was
held by Rolls-Royce PLC, which makes aircraft engines with BMW.
	   In a surprising coup for BMW, the automakers announced Tuesday
that BMW would buy the rights to the Rolls-Royce name and allow VW
to use it for free until 2002.
	   Both carmakers will cooperate to produce the latest Rolls-Royce
model, the Silver Seraph, and BMW will continue to supply engines
and components to VW for Rolls-Royce cars until the end of 2002,
and for the new Bentley Arnage until the end of its product cycle.
	   Starting in 2003, VW will market its luxury line under the
sister brand, Bentley, allowing BMW to build a ``new'' Rolls-Royce.
	   Analysts noted that meant the rival automakers would be working
together for at least four years.
	   ``If it serves both firms, a merger is naturally the right
thing,'' market specialist Andre Kostolany told Bild.
	   ``When it comes to money, the antagonism stops,'' Deutsche Bank
auto analyst Klaus-Juergen Melzner added.
	   In a time when the auto industry is consolidating globally, some
analysts said it would make sense for the relatively small BMW to
seek a bigger partner for the long-term.
	   Others however questioned whether Volkswagen, Europe's biggest
automaker, was the right fit for BMW, noting that many of their
models and parts overlap already, such as the BMW 3er and the Audi
A3.

China to open structures in disputed Spratlys to Filipino
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China will allow Filipino fishermen
to take shelter in concrete platforms it has built on a disputed
South China Sea reef, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon
said Thursday.
	   Siazon said the pledge was made by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan during a bilateral meeting in Manila.
	   Tang is on an official trip in the Philippines after attending a
multilateral security forum and other meetings between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and major world powers in
Manila.
	   Siazon said the structures were constructed by China in 1995 at
Mischief Reef, one of several areas in the Spratly Islands claimed
by both China and the Philippines.
	   The construction drew strong protests from the Philippines and
strained bilateral ties.
	   Beijing claimed the structures were shelters for its fishermen
but Philippine officials claimed they could be used militarily to
help China expand its control in the islands, believed to sit atop
vast oil and mineral deposits.
	   China never agreed to Manila's requests to dismantle the
platforms and the problem dragged on without being solved.
	   Siazon quoted Tang as saying during the meeting that the
structures were also being used to monitor the weather. The
structures have what appear to be radar discs on their roofs in
surveillance pictures taken by the Philippine military.
	   Siazon said the countries would hold more meetings to discuss
guidelines and a date when the shelters could be opened. Although
Siazon welcomed China's move, he said the Philippines would still
pursue its claim to the reef.
	   Tang was to meet later Thursday with Philippine President Joseph
Estrada before returning home.
	   The Spratly Islands are claimed in whole or in part by China,
the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. They
straddle an important shipping route, where about 400 commercial
ships and oil tankers pass each day.

Swiss central bank carries out own Nazi gold study
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank is
carrying out its own study to shed more light on its gold dealings
with Nazi Germany during World War II, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   The Swiss National Bank, charged with maintaining the strength
of the Swiss currency, faces a U.S. suit by Holocaust survivors
seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   The study, which aims to provide a clearer picture of economic
policy during the war, is already under way, bank spokesman Gabriel
Juri said. He declined to give further details.
	   Historical studies in recent months have said the central bank
should have known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi
Germany during the war had been looted from the national treasuries
of occupied countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also had received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds)
of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   During the war, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold in
the face of ever greater demand for the Swiss franc, the only
internationally acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   The central bank has said it will oppose vigorously any
class-action suit filed against it. The Swiss government called the
suit, filed last month, ``unacceptable.''
	   Both have refused to become involved in negotiations over a
settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks,
Jewish groups and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing
plans to withhold business from the banks and, if no solution is
found, from other Swiss firms. Other states also have announced
plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders claimed the
survivors should be paid more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   The Swiss government task force on World War II said Thursday
President Flavio Cotti will meet on Sept. 7 with major Swiss
companies to discuss the sanctions threats.
	   Some 12 senior officials of large banking, insurance and
industrial companies, as well as central bank and government
representatives, have been invited to meet with Cotti, spokeswoman
Linda Shepard said.

Tokyo Electric shuts down nuclear reactor after steam leak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo Electric Power Co. shut down one of its
nuclear reactors in northern Japan Thursday due to a steam leak in
turbine pipes, the company said.
	   The steam leak was discovered at 2:10 p.m. (0510 GMT) at the
company's 1.09 million-kilowatt, No. 6 nuclear reactor in
Fukushima, 239 kilometers (149 miles) northeast of Tokyo. Reactor
operation was stopped at around 5 p.m. (0800 GMT).
	   The cause of the leak will be investigated Friday, the company
said. It added that there had been no danger of a radioactive leak.

Anti-Taliban group denies receiving military aid from Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The visit of a representative of
supreme Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was for religious,
not military reasons, according to a spokesman for a Shiite militia
fighting Afghanistan's Taliban army.
	   U.S. officials accuse Iranians of stoking the Afghan civil war
by supplying arms and fuel to Taliban enemies, in particular fellow
Shiite Muslims in the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia. Hezb-e-Wahadat
spokesman Aziz Ullah Shafaq denied that in a telephone interview
Thursday, and added there was nothing sinister in the visit to
central Bamiyan province a day before of Sheik Hassan Ebrahimi,
described as a special envoy of Khamenei.
	   Shafaq said Ebrahimi was a mullah, or spiritual leader, who came
``to see our mosques and exchange views with our religious
scholars.''
	   Neighboring Iran also recently set up a satellite dish in the
northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif so Afghans could watch Iranian
television, Shafaq said. The Taliban religious militia has deemed
television un-Islamic, and confiscated satellite dishes, television
sets and video cassette recorders in the parts of Afghanistan it
controls.
	   Bamiyan and Mazar-e-Sharif are in the 15 percent of Afghanistan
controlled by a fractious coalition of anti-Taliban fighters. The
Taliban militia holds the rest, including Kabul, which it captured
in 1996.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, including Shiite Muslims.
Most Iranians are Shiite, while most Afghans belong to the Sunni
sect of Islam.

Lower house approves law to allow women to join military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Parliament took the first step Thursday in approving
a law allowing women to join the Italian armed forces.
	   The lower house overwhelmingly approved the bill, 429-8 with 31
abstentions, to allow volunteer service. It now goes to the Senate.
	   Women's groups said they hoped it would be approved by next
year, when as many as 20,000 women are expected to seek to join the
armed forces.
	   Italian men face 10 months of mandatory service. Women have
pushed for years for at least volunteer service, but until now it
has been blocked by objections to the costs of converting barracks
and training sites.
	   The Defense Ministry said Italy was the only member of NATO
without women in the armed forces.

<TEXT>
	   PAGADIAN, Philippines (AP) _ Police arrested an illegal gunsmith
Thursday and seized 45 homemade guns they believe were to be sold
to robbers and rebels in the southern Philippines, a police
official said.
	   Police provincial director Antonio Valle said the raid took
place early Thursday in Buug in Zamboanga del Sur province.
	   Valle said local residents informed police that a Buug resident,
metal fabricator Palermo Cabrera, was making made-to-order guns for
highway robbers and rebels.
	   After a week of investigation, police raided the shop and seized
45 revolvers and shotguns. Cabrera was arrested but his partners
managed to escape, Valle said.
	   He said the raid was part of a police campaign to reduce crime
in the southern Philippines.
	   Charges are being readied against Cabrera, Valle said.

Ukraine preparing to sell its telecommunications monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine has invited several international
accounting firms to help the government prepare for the planned
privatization of country's telecommunications giant Ukrtelecom, a
news report said Friday.
	   Ukrtelecom wants Arthur Andersen, Price Waterhouse Coopers,
Deloitte and Touche, Ernst and Young and KPMG to make bids on
preparing a financial report on the company, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   The head of Ukraine's privatization agency, Oleksandr Bondar,
said earlier this week that the Cabinet was about to complete a
bill permitting privatization of Ukrtelecom.
	   Parliament needs to approve the bill because under the current
law, Ukrtelecom may not be privatized.
	   Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko has said the
government hopes to raise at least dlrs 2 billion from selling a 25
percent stake in the telecommunications firm.
	   Ukrtelecom includes 35 subsidiaries and 738 branches throughout
Ukraine, and owns large stakes in five joint ventures. The company
employs 130,000 people.

Marcopper mining company delisted from Philippine stock exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Stock Exchange said
Thursday it has canceled the listing of Marcopper Mining Corp.,
which was forced to halt operations after a massive mine spill two
years ago.
	   Exchange president Jose Luis Yulo said Marcopper failed to pay
the fee required to maintain its listing.
	   A company official said the exchange refused Marcopper's request
to defer payment of the 110,000 peso (dlrs 2,700) fee because of
the company's financial problems.
	   Until recently, Canada's Placer Dome Inc. owned 39.9 percent of
Marcopper, once the Philippines' third-largest copper mining
company.
	   The government ordered the company to stop its operations after
millions of tons of mine waste spilled from one of its impounding
dams into a river on central Marinduque Island in March 1996,
creating an environmental disaster.
	   Former company president John Loney, resident manager Steve Reid
and senior manager Pedro Hernandez face charges of criminal
negligence and violation of the Philippine Mining Act in connection
with the waste spill. Loney and Reid are Australians. Hernandez is
a Filipino.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ A driver trying to smuggle a truckload of Kosovo
Albanians into Germany sped through a road block at 120 kilometers
(75 miles) an hour, crashing the truck against a stone wall and
killing at least seven refugees.
	   At least 15 other Kosovo Albanians were seriously hurt and
several of them had life-threatening injuries, said Steffen
Meissner, a police spokesman in the Saxony state town of Freiburg,
near the Czech border.
	   Germany border officials erected a road block to stop the truck
about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the Czech border early Thursday
after noticing that the truck's windows had been covered with foil.
	   Instead of stopping the driver sped up, crashing through the
blockade then losing control on a curve, Meissner said.
	   A Czech man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling refugees, and
a second man was being sought.
	   A few hours after the crash, another Czech driver with four
refugees from Yugoslavia were arrested south of Dresden when the
driver broke through another road block. No one was injured.
	   The number of ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia seeking asylum in
Germany has jumped in recent months as Serb police crack down on
the Albanian majority in Kosovo province.
	   Border police in Berlin had no exact figures for the increase.
	   But the agency said the total number of people caught trying to
enter Germany illegally in the first six months of the year was
6,358. That compares with 4,947 during the same period last year.

Strike against custody death paralyzes Bangladesh capital

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladeshi police fired tear gas at
opposition activists hurling crude bombs during a general strike
Thursday to condemn the death of a university student in police
custody. At least 50 people were injured, witnesses said.
	   The dawn-to-dusk strike halted traffic and shut down businesses
in the capital, Dhaka, as public anger grew over the death of
Shamim Reza Rubel. He was picked up near the university last week
on suspicion of having illegal arms and was allegedly tortured to
death by plainclothes police.
	   Thursday's protest was first called by the country's main
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its six right-wing
allies. They have accused Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
two-year-old government of incompetence and repression.
	   In further embarrassment to Hasina, one of her allies, the
Jatiya Party, also backed the strike.
	   During the strike protesters attacked the police headquarters
and set off small explosives in different parts of the city. Police
responded with tear gas. At least 30 activists were detained, a
police official said.
	   Seven policemen have been arrested in connection with the death
of the student. If convicted, they could be hanged.
	   Police have sweeping powers to arrest anyone for questioning.
Human rights groups accuse the police of regularly torturing people
to confess.
	   At least 41 suspects have died in police custody in the past
year, according to the independent Bangladesh Human Rights
Commission.

Thai police seize large quantity of military weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
called Thursday for a speedy investigation to find out who was
smuggling an arsenal of weapons and ammunition police discovered at
a Bangkok home this week.
	   Police suspect the weapons were intended for Karen guerrillas
fighting the military government of neighboring Myanmar, but don't
know where the arms came from.
	   Udom Suthavej, 66, and his son Sonthi, 28, the owner of the
house, have been arrested and charged with possession of war
weapons and ammunition.
	   When police raided their home Wednesday, they found two
rocket-propelled grenade launchers with four rockets, rocket
launchers, seven M-72 grenades, about 50,000 rounds for automatic
rifles, and 1,026 rounds of 12.7 mm anti-aircraft ammunition.
	   Udom admitted to reporters that for the past five years, he had
allowed his home to be used as a weapons store house for the Karen
in return for cash.
	   Thai police believe the weapons were destined for the Karen or
one of the other armed minority groups in Myanmar, or drug lords in
the Golden Triangle, an opium-rich area where the borders of
Thailand, Laos and Myanmar converge.
	   Army Commander Gen. Chetta Thanajaro said the weapons did not
come from the Thai military.
	   ``It's a large quantity. It's fair to assume that these are
destined for an armed group, or somebody, because I don't think
they will just sit here in Bangkok for long,'' he said.

Reports: Yeltsin may bring Chubais, Gaidar back into Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin may dig into his
past and bring two of Russia's most unpopular reformers back into
his Cabinet, local media reported Thursday.
	   Yeltsin unexpectedly interrupted his rained-out vacation in
northwestern Russia and returned to Moscow on Wednesday, fueling
speculation that he was planning a Cabinet shuffle. He also has
canceled a visit to a northern port that had been scheduled for
Monday, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   During his vacation, he fired the head of the Federal Security
Service and said ``decisions have been made'' on other high-level
hirings and firings.
	   The Kommersant business newspaper speculated that Yeltsin would
return to the Cabinet either Anatoly Chubais, his envoy to
international financial organizations, or Yegor Gaidar, a former
prime minister who led Russia's first post-independence market
reforms.
	   Both men are hugely unpopular in Russia for the hardships
associated with their reforms, and Yeltsin has hired and fired them
repeatedly.
	   Chubais is Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's preferred candidate
for a senior Cabinet post, Kommersant said. Chubais currently runs
Russia's electricity monopoly, Unified Energy System, a huge
company in desperate need of restructuring.
	   He was named deputy prime minister last month, when he was put
in charge of relations with international lending institutions and
negotiated a dlrs 17.1 billion loan package. Despite his title, he
does not have Cabinet rank.
	   Yeltsin has twice fired Chubais from his Cabinet. In January
1996 he was ousted as deputy prime minister, only to be brought
back into government a few months later to run Yeltsin's reelection
campaign. He was fired again in early March.
	   Chubais is scheduled to meet with Yeltsin on Friday, Russian
media reported.
	   Gaidar was appointed prime minister in June 1992. He was ousted
in December 1992 after annual inflation soared to 2000 percent and
industrial production fell 20 percent. He served briefly as deputy
prime minister and economics minister in 1993, and now heads a
small political movement, Democratic Choice.
	   Another possible candidate for a top post is Alexander Livshits,
Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, Kommersant reported.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A brawl erupted in the assembly hall of
Kenya's parliament when legislators narrowly defeated a bill that
would have allowed lawmakers to carry guns, media reports said
Thursday.
	   Fistfights broke out Wednesday when opposition legislators began
shouting at two of their colleagues, who had helped the government
defeat the bill in a 78-77 show of hands, according to the Daily
Nation newspaper.
	   Government officials and legislators, including the minister of
development, leaped across the benches and began throwing punches
in an apparent attempt to protect their opposition allies, the
report said.
	   The bill proposed that all legislators be granted gun licenses,
diplomatic passports and armed security, the newspaper said.
	   At least five opposition legislators were beat up before during
the 10 minute-fracas before order was restored in the chamber.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A four-member delegation from the U.N.
International Commission of Inquiry for Rwanda has held talks with
Zambia's foreign and defense ministers.
	   The delegation, led by commission Chairman Mahmoud Kassem,
discussed possible violations of the U.N. arms embargo against
Rwanda by unnamed foreign entities and governments, the official
Zambia News Agency said.
	   The agency said Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebel movement in Angola
was suspected of supplying arms to Hutu rebels fighting to topple
the Rwandan government, presently dominated by members of the Tutsi
tribe.
	   Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita told the Commission
Zambia would do everything in its power to assist their
investigation since it was essential to identify the root cause of
instability in Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   The 1994 genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda left at
least 800,000 people dead.
	   -----
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba has denied
reports he may amend the constitutional ban on a third five-year
term in office in order to run again in 2001.
	   ``He has not campaigned for a third term and has no intention of
doing so,'' said a statement issued Wednesday by Chiluba's special
assistant for press and public relations, Richard Sakala.
	   After ousting Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia's first democratic
elections in 1991, Chiluba's ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy amended the constitution to prevent a repeat of Kaunda's
27 year grip on power.
	   Sakala accused Kaunda's opposition United National Independence
Party and other current opposition groups of seeking to mislead
Zambians by spreading rumours Chiluba, a former union leader,
intended to try to retain power beyond the 10-year limit.
	   -----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Some 245,000 victims of flood and
drought in Mozambique will need emergency food aid in August
despite an expected 10 percent rise in cereal production this year,
the U.N. World Food Program said.
	   The extra aid is needed to sustain them until the September
harvest.
	   Recent flooding along the Zambezi River damaged crops in central
provinces, and drought has affected people in the south.
	   -----
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) _ The Brazzaville regional office of the
World Health Organization, which was moved to Zimbabwe because of
Congo's civil war last year, is returning to this battle-battered
city.
	   ``We're coming back soon,'' said Dr. Ebrahim Malick Samba, an
official of the U.N. organization. He said 230 foreign employees
and about that many local people would staff the office. The office
was moved to Harare, Zimbabwe, when war broke out.
	   Brazzaville was devastated during the five-month civil war last
year in which up to 10,000 people were killed. Fighting ended in
October. Some dlrs 2 million in damage was done just to the
organization's offices. Samba said he was confident the Congolese
government would repair the damage.
	   Samba said he had few fears about setting up again in
Brazzaville.
	   Security ``is better than Johannesburg, New York and Washington,
where they have tragedies every few minutes.''
	   -----
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ The United States has relieved Cameroon
of half its bilateral debt, which was due within the next three
years, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
	   The remainder of Cameroon's debt to the United States will be
rescheduled over the next 25 years, the embassy said.
	   ``A total of dlrs 10.4 million of debt owed to the Export-Import
Bank, plus the debt owed the U.S. Department of Defense will be
rescheduled under this agreement,'' according to the statement.
	   The total debt was not disclosed.
	   The agreement follows a broader pact signed last year between
Cameroon and the Paris Club of creditor nations.
	   -----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Prisons minister Sipo Mzimela has
resigned following a dispute over his belief in closer ties between
the ruling African National Congress and his Inkatha Freedom Party,
President Nelson Mandela's office said on Thursday.
	   He is replaced by Inkatha's Ben Skosana, leader of the Zulu
nationalist party's parliamentary caucus.
	   Mzimela had earned strong criticism from Inkatha leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi for his call for possible merger talks between
the ANC and Inkatha.
	   In January Inkatha's national council adopted a formal vote of
no confidence in Mzimela, and earlier this month the party
dismissed him as national deputy chairman.
	   Though the ANC won 1994's all-race elections that ended
apartheid, it entered into a government of national unity with
several other political parties to guide South Africa's transition
to democracy after decades of racist white rule.
	   Inkatha has stayed in the government, keeping several
ministerial posts, while the former ruling National Party left in
1996 to join the opposition.

Former British track captain quits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Roger Black, a two-time European champion and
Olympic silver medalist at 400 meters, said Thursday he will retire
after Sunday's British Grand Prix meet in Sheffield.
	   The announcement came three days after Black was bypassed by
British team selectors for the 400 meters at the European
Championships in Budapest starting Aug. 18.
	   ``I'm a championship performer,'' Black said at a news
conference in London. ``I need championship goals. Those goals no
longer exist _ the selectors have defeated me.''
	   Black said he was stepping down as British team captain and
withdrawing from the British 4-by-400 meter relay team.
	   Black, the 1996 Atlanta Olympic 400-meter silver medalist and
two-time European champion, finished fourth at the British AAA meet
in Birmingham last Sunday _ which doubled as the trials for the
Euros and the Commonwealth Games.
	   The 32-year-old finished behind British record-holder Iwan
Thomas, Mark Richardson and Solomon Wariso, who dipped at the line
to beat him for third by a fraction of a second.
	   The first two places automatically qualified for the European
championships and selectors picked Wariso _ who slashed one second
off his personal best at the AAA meet _ to fill the optional third
400 meter spot.
	   ``A part of me has been taken,'' Black said. ``I'm devastated _
I was devastated on Sunday night when the selectors picked the
team. I'm mystified as to how the selectors came to their decision
_ it shows little insight of me as a performer...three-hundredths
of a second is worth more than 13 years of performances.''
	   Ironically, Black's announcement coincided with news that Wariso
was in doubt for the European Championships after sustaining a knee
injury as he lunged for the line to beat Black at the AAA meet.
	   Adding to the selection controversy, Wariso admitted after
beating Black last Sunday that he had only entered the 400 ``as a
laugh.''
	   The 200-meter specialist was banned for three months in 1994
after being sent home from the European Championships for using the
unauthorized substance ephedrine.

	   TOYOURA, Japan (AP) _ Takeshi Saito shot a hole-in-one Thursday
on the fourth hole of his Japan PGA Tour debut, and went on to a
6-under-par 66 and a share of the first-round lead in the 60
million yen (dlrs 428,000) NST Niigata Open.
	   Saito was tied with Canadian Rick Gibson, one shot ahead of
Nobuo Serizawa at 67.
	   In addition to his ace on the 201-yard (183-meter), par-3 fourth
hole, he shot one other eagle, four birdies and two bogeys.
	   Gibson, seeking his first title in three years and third overall
in Japan, birdied the first two holes and sank four more later in a
bogey-free trek over the 7,065-yard (6,429-meter), par-72 Forest
Golf Club East Course.
	   Australian Anthony Gilligan, Hsieh Chin-sheng of Taiwan, Hideki
Kase and three others were tied for fourth at 68.

Pakistani soldier among six killed in Indian shelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ At least six people, including an
army soldier, were killed and 15 were wounded Thursday in shelling
by Indian troops in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, military officials
said.
	   They said the Indian troops pounded artillery shells on Pakistan
Army positions and civilian areas near the border valleys of Neelum
Leepa and Chakothi in the disputed Kashmir region.
	   The civilian victims included a six-year-old girl and a woman,
the private NNI news agency reported, quoting unnamed military
sources. NNI reported that Pakistani troops fired back in
retaliation.
	   Associated Press of Pakistan reported the soldier's death, also
quoting unnamed military sources.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Indian side. Firing
between Pakistani and Indian troops is a routine in this disputed
region, but Pakistani officials say incidents have escalated during
the recent months.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir, a former
princely state in the shadow of Himalayan Mountains that is now
divided between the two countries.
	   New Delhi blames Pakistan for arming Muslim militants in Indian
controlled Kashmir. Pakistan denies the charge and says it offers
only political and moral support.

Comprehensive collection of Warhol drawings exhibited in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ A comprehensive collection of 230
drawings by U.S. pop art icon Andy Warhol goes on display Saturday
at a medieval castle-museum near the Rhine River.
	   The exhibit at Moyland, a castle surrounded by a moat in
Bedburg-Hau near the Dutch border, will be Germany's first major
show of Warhol drawings.
	   The sketches span Warhol's career as a graphic artist in the
1950s through his death in 1987 at age 59 and include studies for
some of his famous silkscreens, curator Bettina Paust said.
	   The drawings are on loan from the Andy Warhol Museum in
Pittsburgh and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in
New York.

Yeltsin invites Japan's new prime minister to visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has invited Japan's new
prime minister to visit Russia in the fall.
	   In his message Thursday congratulating Keizo Obuchi on his
election, Yeltsin noted that Russian-Japanese relations became
``good and neighborly'' during Obuchi's tenure as foreign minister.
	   The two countries have yet to sign a formal treaty ending World
War II because of a territorial dispute over the southern Kuril
Islands, which Soviet troops seized at the end of the war.
	   Yeltsin also invited former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
his family to make a personal visit to Moscow at their convenience.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A driver trying to smuggle a truckload of Kosovo
Albanians into Germany sped through a road block at 120 kilometers
(75 miles) an hour, crashing the truck against a stone wall and
killing at least seven refugees Thursday.
	   At least 15 other Kosovo Albanians were hurt, some seriously,
police said in Freiburg, near the Czech border.
	   Germany border officials erected a road block to stop the rented
truck about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the Czech border early
Thursday after noticing that the truck's windows had been covered
with foil.
	   Instead of stopping the driver sped up, crashing through the
blockade then losing control on a curve, police said.
	   A Czech man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling refugees, and
a second man was being sought.
	   A few hours after the crash, another Czech driver with four
refugees from Yugoslavia were arrested south of Dresden after the
driver broke through another road block. No one was injured.
	   The number of ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia seeking asylum in
Germany has jumped in recent months as Serb police crack down on
the Albanian majority in Kosovo province.
	   Border police in Berlin said the number of people caught trying
to enter Germany illegally has risen as well. In the first six
months of the year, 6,358 were caught, compared with 4,947 during
the same period last year.

Orthodox group in Jordan calls meeting over Jerusalem property
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Greek Orthodox group in Jordan called
Thursday for a meeting to stop what it said was the church's policy
of selling and leasing its property in Jerusalem, saying it
promoted Jewish settlement.
	   The Greek Orthodox Society in Amman, which represents Jordan's
small Orthodox community, invited delegations from Jerusalem, the
Palestinian territories, Canada, the United States and South
American countries to the meeting Friday.
	   The society said the church's policy of selling and leasing land
aided ``the Jewish settlement program.''
	   Greek Orthodox Christians in the West Bank and Israel have
protested the church's land deals with Israeli and western
companies. Palestinians, a minority of whom are Christians, fear
the sale of land will prevent it from becoming part of a
Palestinian state.
	   The church has said it is only making an investment with the
land. In a letter to Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, the Greek
Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodoros, said the issue was
``misunderstood and misinterpreted.''

German tourist commits suicide to prove immortality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German tourist hurled himself to death
from a Cairo tower after reportedly telling a friend that he
expected to be resurrected, police said Thursday.
	   Adam Gotz, 34, a student of ancient Egyptian history, jumped
from the observation deck of the 613-feet (185-meter) Cairo Tower
late Tuesday night, a police official said.
	   Gotz was trying to demonstrate to a friend, Sarah Klimer, his
Pharaonic belief that the dead get resurrected, the official said
on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   Officials at the German Embassy in Cairo said the suicide was
carried out ``for unknown reasons.'' No other details were
available.
	   Ms. Klimer, also a German, was not available for comment.
	   In recent years, a growing number of foreigners have been
visiting Egypt's numerous Pharaonic sites in the belief that they
hold mystical powers.
	   The ungainly Cairo Tower was built in 1961 by then President
Gamel Abdel Nasser, allegedly as a national symbol of defiance
against the United States after the CIA gave funds intended to
coopt the socialist leader.

Russia to build new nuclear plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia plans to build three new nuclear reactors
by 2000, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Ministry said Thursday.
	   Spokesman Georgy Kaurov refused to confirm a report in The
Moscow Times that the government has approved the construction of
four new nuclear plants by 2010 and is drafting plans for another
four.
	   The Moscow Times quoted the Atomic Energy Ministry as saying the
plan, signed by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, would increase
Russia's nuclear energy output by one-third.
	   Kaurov said a new nuclear plant would be built at Rostov-on-Don
in southern Russia. New reactors would be built at existing plants
in Kursk in central Russia and in Kalinin north of Moscow, he said.
	   Each reactor would cost about dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   The 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl in then-Soviet Ukraine
created widespread public distrust of nuclear energy and gave
impetus to the development of Russia's huge natural gas deposits as
the key fuel for power generation.
	   But Russian energy experts argue that new nuclear plants are
necessary to guarantee the country's energy self-sufficiency and to
replace aging reactors that will have to be taken off-line in
coming years.

UNESCO-World Bank fund-raising campaign for shattered Mostar bridge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ UNESCO said Thursday that it's teaming up with the
World Bank in raising money to rebuild the old bridge of Mostar, a
shattered symbol of the Bosnian conflict.
	   Stari Most Bridge, which stood between the Croat-controlled
western and Muslim-held eastern halves of the ancient city, was
shelled into the river by Bosnian Croats on a November morning in
1993.
	   ``Considered a landmark in Bosnia and Herzegovina, not only for
the perfection of its complex construction, but also for its
symbolic value as a bridge between cultures, Stari Most must be
rebuilt as it was,'' Paris-based UNESCO said in a statement.
	   ``We invite people and organizations to cooperate in a global
partnership,'' said the United Nations Educational Scientific and
Cultural Organization said, which tracks and helps protect
so-called ``Heritage Sites'' around the world.
	   Eager to rebuild their war-town city, last September a group of
Mostar residents aided by NATO engineers started fishing the
scattered stones from the river.
	   ``This was a great psychological moment for them,'' said UNESCO
representative Colin Kaiser from his office in Sarajevo.
	   But the project stalled. Kaiser said salvaged stones started
disappearing and the complexities of rebuilding a 428-year-old
stone bridge became overwhelming.
	   Kaiser said a group of experts will probably meet late this
September to discuss plans.
	   World Bank is injecting funds to get the process started, Kaiser
said, and Turkey gave dlrs 1 million to rebuild what was originally
designed by an Ottoman architect. He declined to give a total
budget figure.

Pakistan says it supports negotiations to ban fissile material

 &UR; With India-Pakistan-Nuclear &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Under international pressure to curb its nuclear
weapons capability, Pakistan said Thursday it supports immediately
starting negotiations for a treaty to ban the production of
material used to make nuclear weapons.
	   Pakistani Ambassador Munir Akram told the 61-nation Conference
on Disarmament, however, that his government wants negotiations to
deal with neighboring India's larger stockpile of plutonium and
highly enriched uranium, which are used to make nuclear weapons.
	   Akram acknowledged the proposed treaty has been a main topic
between the U.S. and Pakistani governments as Washington seeks ways
to contain the South Asian arms race since India and Pakistan set
off nuclear explosions earlier this year.
	   His statement came as top foreign ministry officials from India
and Pakistan resumed talks in Sri Lanka. On Wednesday, their prime
ministers broke a yearlong stalemate and agreed to try again to
resolve their territorial and other disputes.
	   At talks last week in Islamabad, he said, ``Pakistan and the
United States agreed to support the immediate commencement of
negotiations'' on a treaty to ban production of nuclear-weapons
material.
	   At those talks, Pakistan pressed for international mediation on
the Kashmir dispute with neighboring India, while the United States
urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty.
	   Pakistan's signing that treaty would depend on ``assurance
against the possibility of further nuclear testing by India,''
Akram said Thursday.
	   He said Pakistan was prepared for a separate test-ban agreement
with India and that it ``is not interested in further escalation up
the nuclear ladder with India.''
	   Conference delegations said it remained to be seen what other
key countries, such as Brazil and Egypt, would say to the proposal
that a committee be set up to discuss action on uranium and
plutonium issue.

German tourist commits suicide to prove immortality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German tourist hurled himself to death
from a Cairo tower after reportedly telling a friend that he
expected to be resurrected, police said Thursday.
	   Adam Gotz, 34, a student of ancient Egyptian history, jumped
late Tuesday night from the observation deck of the 613-feet
(185-meter) Cairo Tower, a police official said.
	   Gotz was trying to demonstrate to a friend, Sarah Klimer, his
Pharaonic belief that the dead get resurrected, the official said
on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   Officials at the German Embassy in Cairo said the suicide was
carried out ``for unknown reasons.'' No other details were
available.
	   Ms. Klimer, also a German, was not available for comment.
	   In recent years, a growing number of foreigners have been
visiting Egypt's numerous Pharaonic sites in the belief that they
hold mystical powers.
	   The ungainly Cairo Tower was built in 1961 by then President
Gamel Abdel Nasser, allegedly as a national symbol of defiance
against the United States after the CIA gave funds to try to coopt
the socialist leader.

Farm machine maker to buy former East German combine harvester
</HEADLINE>
firm &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARSEWINKEL, Germany (AP) _ Claas, Europe's leading farm
machinery maker, said Thursday it plans to purchase the largest
combine harvester manufacturer of former East Germany.
	   Claas, based in western Germany, said it intends to acquire
Landtechnik Schoenebeck (LTS) from the office handling federal
privatization, and to build a new factory in the Schoenebeck area,
about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of Berlin.
	   Financial details weren't available because negotiations are
ongoing, a Claas spokesman said.
	   Self-propelled forage harvester production, in which Claas is a
world market leader, will be integrated at the Schoenebeck site.
Claas also said it expects to increase its business in eastern
Europe, where LTS already has an established market.
	   In its 1997 fiscal year ending Sept. 30, Claas had 1.9 billion
marks (dlrs 1.1 billion) in sales, up 30.5 percent from the
previous year.
	   Claas is the manufacturer of CAT threshing machines in
Harsewinkel, in North-Rhine Westphalia state. Claas and Caterpillar
have agreed to build a joint production site for threshing machine
production in Omaha, Nebraska, next year.

Dispute between Singapore and Malaysia over border post escalates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In an escalating dispute between Southeast
Asian neighbors, Singapore declared Thursday it would move the
railway border post in two days despite Malaysia's refusal to
agree.
	   After the move on Saturday, it warned, ``Malaysian immigration
officers performing immigration functions at (the old post) will be
acting without legal authority and contrary to the proper sequence
of immigration clearance.''
	   The statement from Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs that the
move would go ahead as previously planned came after Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had said Monday that his country
would not shift its customs, immigration and quarantine operations
in tandem with Singapore's move.
	   His surprise announcement came only a few days after reports of
an agreement between the two sides, brokered by Singapore Foreign
Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar and his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah
Badawi on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations meeting in Manila.
	   Malaysia has not yet elaborated on why it does not wish to join
in the move, though on Monday, Mahathir said there must be an
international agreement approved by the Cabinet and Parliament for
such a shift.
	   Singapore's statement Thursday said that ``Singapore has on many
occasions since 1989 informed Malaysia of its intention to move its
... operations from Tanjong Pagar railway station to the Woodlands
Train Checkpoint.''
	   Singapore contends that the move will improve efficiency and
help prevent drug smuggling and entry of illegal immigrants into
the small city-state.
	   In its lengthy statement, Singapore said that at their last
meeting two days ago, it reminded its neighbor that ``to locate its
immigration control post in Singapore is not in compliance with
Malaysia's own laws,'' which require that the post should be
located across the border is the southern Malaysian city of Johor
Bahru.
	   It warned that ``all immigration endorsements made by (Malaysian
authorities) on Singapore passports at Tanjong Pagar will be
unauthorized and improper.''
	   The dispute is just one aspect of the increasingly shrill tone
between the neighboring countries, which joined into one sovereign
state in 1963 but separated abruptly two years later after race
riots and irreconcilable political differences.
	   Tensions between the two countries have grown in recent weeks
over a series of other, sometimes petty issues.
	   Malaysia accused the Singapore media of unduly criticizing the
opening of its new international airport, which was beset with a
number of serious problems, all reported in the local media.
	   A Malaysian minister also accused Singapore of excluding his
country from a list of tourist destinations, an allegation rejected
by the island republic.
	   More recently, another Malaysian minister hit out at Singapore's
port authorities, accusing them of using ``various tactics'' to
block cargo from entering Malaysian ports.
	   The neighbors have also experienced a protracted dispute over
the sale of Malaysian water to Singapore, which imports most of its
supplies from its northern neighbor.

Resurgent rebels hit northern Sierra Leone town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Although presumed to be in
disarray and on the run, a resurgent rebel movement in Sierra Leone
launched a surprise attack on the northern town of Kabala, a
military commander said Thursday.
	   Renegade soldiers loyal to the country's ousted military junta
along with allied rebel factions control some sections of Kabala
near the border with Guinea, said Nigerian Gen. Maxwell Khobe, the
outgoing commander of a West African coalition army in Sierra
Leone.
	   ``They are in specific areas of Kabala in large numbers,'' Khobe
told reporters Thursday.
	   The Nigerian-led coalition army, known as ECOMOG, has been
fighting on behalf of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah since the West
African force restored him to power in March.
	   The unexpected attack began earlier this week when at least 50
rebel gunmen entered Kabala on the pretext of surrendering to
ECOMOG soldiers.
	   A second group of at least 100 rebels followed close behind and
attacked the coalition forces, who were caught off guard.
	   ``You can only trust a rebel who is not armed,'' Khobe said.
	   He would not comment on military of civilian causalities, but
added that a contingent of Guinean troops assigned to the ECOMOG
force had come under heavy fire in Kabala's southern side.
	   The rebels are made up of former military junta soldiers and
their allies. Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma staged a military coup in
May 1997 and ruled the country by decree for 10 months until he was
subsequently forced from the capital by ECOMOG troops.
	   More than six months after their ouster, the rebel forces are
still waging a ruthless war of terror against the civilian
population in pockets throughout Sierra Leone.
	   Human rights groups and aid workers say thousands of people have
been killed, tortured or disfigured by the rebel campaign of
terror.

Presidents of Ukraine, Russia discuss cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin discussed a variety of bilateral
cooperation issues in a telephone conversation Thursday, Kuchma's
press service reported.
	   During a 20-minute talk, the presidents also discussed possible
meetings between the two countries' senior officials in the near
future, and preparations for a Ukrainian-Russian summit scheduled
for the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in mid-September.
	   In February, the two leaders signed an ambitious economic
cooperation plan, and Yeltsin said that there were ``no unsettled
problems'' left between the two nations.
	   However, there has been discord over Russian customs taxes on
Ukrainian goods and there have been frictions in recent years over
issues such as control of the Black Sea naval bases from the Soviet
era and Ukraine's natural gas debts to Russia.
	   Also, the Russian parliament has failed to ratify a friendship
treaty that was signed last year.
	   Kuchma is currently on vacation in Crimea, while Yeltsin
interrupted his holidays and returned to Moscow earlier this week.

Man appears in court for bombing on day before elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A man appeared in court
Thursday charged with detonating a car bomb on the day before
elections for Northern Ireland's new power-sharing assembly.
	   Unemployed Patrick Bernard Wall, 32, of Forkill, who is charged
with setting off home-made explosives in the town of
Newtownhamilton on June 24, was remanded in custody.
	   Wall, who denies the charge, will appear before a court inside
the Maze Prison on Aug. 26.
	   A small anti-British gang, the Irish National Liberation Army,
claimed responsibility for the attack, which injured a 13-year-old
boy and damaged shops and homes in the main street of
Newtownhamilton,
	   It was not immediately clear what Wall's role with the group
was.
	   Wall, wearing a black and white check shirt, stood impassively
in the dock of Newry Magistrates' Court as the charges were read
out. He did not speak.
	   Voters went to the polls on June 25 to elect members of Northern
Ireland's new 108-seat Assembly where Protestants and Catholics
share power.

Cuba trounces the Dominican Republic to stay unbeaten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Oscar Machado smacked a home run in a three-run
fifth inning and Yosvani Aragon pitched a five-hitter Thursday to
help Cuba trounce the Dominican Republic 9-2 at the Baseball World
Championships.
	   Cuba, the five-time defending titlist, heads into Friday's
quarterfinals as the only undefeated team at the championships. It
has won 38 consecutive games at the Worlds.
	   Thursday's only game -- part of the preliminary round -- had
originally been scheduled for Tuesday, but rain washed it out.
	   The top four teams of each of the two eight-country pools
qualified for the quarterfinals to be played at Grosseto and
Nettuno. These are: Cuba (7-0), Japan (6-1), the Dominican Republic
(5-2) and Italy (3-4), for pool A; Australia (5-2), Nicaragua
(5-2), South Korea (4-3), and the Netherlands (4-3), for pool B.
	   The final is set for Sunday.
	   The U.S. team of college players finished fifth in group B and
failed to advance. The Americans have not won these championships
since 1974, the last time the country hosted the event.
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time but
no players from the Major Leagues are participating. Some minor
leaguers are playing for Canada, the Dominican Republic and other
countries.

Southeast Asia appeals for international aid to fight haze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with ministers' closing comments, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations appealed
to the international community Thursday to quickly release millions
of dollars in stalled financial aid for fighting haze-causing
fires.
	   ``Now is a critical period for us. We need funding immediately.
We would like donors to dispatch the funds as soon as possible,''
Malaysian Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said after a one-day
meeting with Association of Southeast Asian Nations environment
ministers and international aid groups.
	   Although more than dlrs 8 million has been pledged by foreign
donors, much of it has been either pigeonholed for studying the
fires or has been stalled by a ``tortuous bureaucratic process,''
Singapore Environment Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said at a joint news
conference after the group's fifth gathering since December to
discuss fighting the hazardous smog that blanketed the region last
year.
	   ``We need to get donations into actual fire fighting,'' said
Yeo, specifying that money was needed for aerial surveillance,
fire-fighting equipment and training firefighters.
	   Recently, the wildfires that blackened more than 500,000
hectares (1.2 million acres) of Indonesian forest have been subdued
by the easing of the El Nino weather pattern, which caused the
worst drought in half a century.
	   ``Despite the change in weather, ASEAN should remain vigilant in
its effort to prevent fires,'' the group said in a joint statement.
	   ``The region should make use of this wetter period to put in
place all necessary mechanisms to prevent and control fires in
preparation for future dry seasons,'' the statement said.
	   As Malaysia readies for the Commonwealth Games in September,
Indonesia has entered its dry season, heightening concern that
wildfires like last year's will shroud Malaysia in dark clouds.
	   It is during the dry season that local farmers and large
plantation companies clear land by setting crops on fire. This
practice is blamed for the wildfires that covered the region in
haze from last July through April of this year.
	   ``We need to impress on (international donors) it is a lot
cheaper to help us prevent fires than to cure them,'' said Yeo.
	   Foreign aid packages include dlrs 4 million from the United
States, dlrs 2 million from the Asian Development Bank, dlrs
600,000 from the United Nations Development Program and dlrs
396,000 from Australia.
	   The U.N. Environment Program recently released a dlrs 30,000
disbursement of a dlrs 750,000 fire-fighting aid package. An
additional dlrs 400,000 was expected by mid-August.
	   Using the initial money, Indonesia launched its first aerial
surveillance flight Monday to scout fires in Riau province on
Sumatra Island. The island is covered with plantations and
potential hot spots.
	   Asked whether Indonesia could control its fires, the country's
assistant environment minister, Effendy A. Sumardja, said, ``We are
trying our best to overcome the problem.''
	   Yeo said ASEAN was still waiting for the United States to
release its financial aid. A detailed plan was expected before the
group's next haze meeting, scheduled Sept. 4 in Manila.

Nuclear fuel storage in Russia's north is unsafe, minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Stores of spent nuclear fuel from decommissioned
submarines in Russia's north are critically unsafe, Russia's deputy
atomic energy minister told reporters Thursday.
	   With more than 150 discharged submarines holding in excess of 80
metric tons (88 tons) of spent nuclear fuel in Russia's north, the
government does not have the estimated dlrs 1.5 billion necessary
to scrap the subs or improve radiation safety, Deputy Atomic Energy
Minister Nikolai Yegorov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia has agreed to dismantle 100 of its aging submarines by
2000, but the deadline is seen as wildly unrealistic, given the
country's financial problems.
	   Western countries have expressed growing concern about Russia's
nuclear waste disposal dilemma. A number of nations, including the
United States, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Japan, have agreed to
give financial assistance.
	   But the help is not enough to counterbalance the lack of funding
from the Russian government to construct long-term waste burial or
storage facilities.
	   Federal lawmakers have earmarked only dlrs 35 million for
various cleanup projects _ a fraction of the billions of dollars
needed to adequately clean up the mess, Interfax said.

Archaeologists say Chinese villagers may be Roman descendants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese archaeologists believe inhabitants of a
village in northwestern China may be descended from Roman soldiers
who fought in Central Asia more than 2000 years ago, the official
Xinhua News Agency reports.
	   Residents of Zhelaizhai village in Gansu province exhibit Latin
physical traits and carry on cultural traditions that can be traced
to ancient Rome, Xinhua said Wednesday.
	   Residents were likely descended from a Roman expeditionary force
sent to Central Asia and defeated in battle in 53 B.C. Some 6,000
soldiers who survived the battle were said to have settled in
northwestern China, the report said.
	   According to village lore, the area's residents migrated from
the far west, Xinhua quoted resident Song Guorong, 39, as saying.
	   It quoted Song as saying his father had brown hair and blue
eyes, ``just like the Europeans I've seen in pictorials.''
	   Archaeologists also have uncovered defensive works in the
village, probably built by the Roman army 2,000 years old, Xinhua
said.
	   Gansu lies along the Silk Road trade route that brought Chinese
precious silks to Rome in the time of the emperors.
	   Canny local authorities have capitalized on Zhelaizhai's
supposed link to ancient Rome by putting up a hotel with ``certain
Roman architectural features'' and a ``Roman shopping mall,'' the
agency said.

Japan's car market may recover this fall, Toyota chairman says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spelling Toyoda is cq for Toyota chairman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toyota Motor Corp. executives expect the Japanese
auto market to begin recovering this fall as consumer confidence
returns to Japan.
	   Toyota Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda told Dow Jones Newswires
Thursday that passenger cars are already selling at close to last
year's levels.
	   ``Things are looking better, especially with new cars,'' he
said. ``It's old models and trucks that are the problem.''
	   Toyoda expressed confidence that Japan's new leaders would
resolve the country's banking problems, putting depositors at ease
and prompting consumers to resume automobile purchases.
	   Massive bad loan problems have contributed to the country's
worst recession in decades. Keizo Obuchi, who was elected prime
minister Thursday, has pledged to make cleaning up the bad debt
mess and fixing the economy his top priorities.
	   Kanji Kurioka, Toyota's executive vice president in charge of
domestic marketing, said he expects commercial vehicle sales to
take more time to recover, adding that they may continue to bring
down overall sales figures.
	   Truck sales may not recover until next year, he said, because
corporations are the largest purchasers of trucks and they will
take longer to emerge from Japan's recession.

Two transexuals lose their case against Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Two gentlemen who became ladies lost
their case before the European Court of Human Rights Thursday,
failing to convince the judges they should force Britain alter
gender on the birth certificates of transsexuals.
	   The 20-judge court said there had been no violation of human
rights of Kristina Sheffield or Rachel Horsham due to a refusal to
recognize their sex-change operations on all documents.
	   Both had argued that the British government's refusal to accept
their new sexual status as women was a breach of their right to
respect for private and family life, guaranteed by the Human Rights
Convention.
	   Miss Sheffield, born as a man in 1946, switched sexes in 1986.
She changed her name and was provided with a new passport and
drivers licence. But other records, such as her birth certificate
and social security remained in her old name and she continued to
be regarded as a man under British law.
	   That meant she was required to reveal her previous gender
publicly on numerous occasions, such as when applying for car
insurance.
	   Miss Horsham, also born in 1946, has been living in the
Netherlands since 1974 and acquired Dutch citizenship in 1993. She
underwent sex-change surgery in 1992. Britain issued her a passport
in her new name and recording her sex as female but refused to
amend her birth certificate.
	   Miss Horsham told the court she has a male partner whom she
plans to marry in the Netherlands, but she fears the validity of
the marriage would not be recognized under British law were she to
return to Britain. The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys
informed her it was not possible under English law to add new
information to a birth certificate.
	   The two cases were joined by the court.
	   The court noted that in earlier cases it had concluded that
Britain was under no obligation to modify its system of births
registration and that in the Sheffield and Horsham cases Britain
``had struck a fair balance between the general interest of the
community and the interests of those applicants.''
	   At the same time, it recognized that ``transexualism raised
complex scientific, legal, moral and social issues, in respect of
which there was no generally shared approach'' among European
nations.
	   The court added that it was not satisfied that the suffering of
the plaintiffs through being obliged to disclose their previous sex
was sufficient to override the state's prerogatives.

Wave of boat immigrants shows problems of `border-free' Europe

	   LAMPEDUSA, Italy (AP) _ The desperate who sail by night from
Tunisian ports to this wind-swept speck of an island are kept out
of sight of the tourists.
	   They are caught and crowded into barracks doubling as a holding
center. When that fills up, military planes whisk the illegal
immigrants away to elsewhere in Italy. Yet another temporary
shelter for the unwelcome was hastily thrown together Wednesday in
Sicily.
	   This summer's wave of clandestine job-seekers to southern
Italian shores is aggravating an unresolved dilemma: How should the
new ``border-free'' Europe deal with the unwanted seeking a better
life?
	   Encouraged by good sailing weather, more than 3,000 would-be
immigrants were caught arriving on southern shores in July alone _
nearly as many as arrived in the first six months of the year.
	   Now, by the hundreds, and with tempers sometimes flaring, they
await expulsion back to Morocco, Tunisia, Sierra Leone or other
poor African countries.
	   Illegal immigrants from Africa pay about U.S. dlrs 2,000 to
smugglers who cram them into barely seaworthy fishing boats bound
for Italy, which has long coastlines that are particularly enticing
to those bound for Europe.
	   Lampedusa is one of the easiest points to reach, 120 nautical
miles from Sicily, but only half that from Tunisia.
	   The immigrants don't expect to hide on Lampedusa's eight square
miles (20 square kilometers) of mainly flat rock, but they see
reaching Italian soil as tantamount to getting a foothold in
France, Switzerland, Germany and other points north where relatives
and jobs await.
	   Until this year, that was largely true.
	   In the past, Italy would hand illegal immigrants expulsion
papers giving them 15 days to leave, but make little effort to
actually expel them.
	   But after howls from Germany and others that too many Kurds were
reaching them via Italy's largely unpatrolled coasts, Rome cracked
down.
	   ``Before when the immigrants came, we islanders would give them
blankets, something to eat from our house. They left the next
day,'' said hotelier Giovanni Cappello.
	   Now they are confined to sweltering detention centers.
	   On July 25, a brawl broke out over a sandwich in the center in
Lampedusa, which holds 146 men. As a result, on Tuesday they
started getting hot meals.
	   But on Thursday, after a revolt erupted at about 2 a.m.,
authorities decided to transfer the men to Sicily and close the
center down.
	   The immigrants had set fire to one of the containers they had
been sleeping in for 16 days. Ten police officers and a score of
immigrants were treated for bruises in the scuffle. Twenty men were
arrested for resisting police.
	   ``We can't keep them in locked-up barracks. It's not humane,''
said Luigi Vallone, the mayor of a small Sicilian town vacationing
in Lampedusa. ``We need a diplomatic solution.''
	   But this country is now trying to live up to its obligations
under the Schengen agreement, which requires members to control
Europe's external borders so that its internal borders can remain
open. So Italy is seeing that the immigrants are escorted home.
	   The system doesn't always work.
	   Coast guard commander Michele Niosi said Tunisia quit escorting
returnees in December.
	   ``The other day, we had 60 immigrants ... in a boat meant for
four fishermen. We waited hours for the Tunisians to arrive,'' he
said. ``They never answered our radio calls.''
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's trip to Rabat this week
produced an agreement for Morocco to take back its immigrants; on
Wednesday more than 100 people were flown home. But Dini's visit to
Tunis failed to bring results.
	   In the meantime, many in Lampedusa worry that their livelihood
is threatened. The tourist season runs from May to September _ also
prime immigrant season.
	   ``My friends call me on my cellphone to say, `We just saw on TV
that another 200 arrived. Be careful,''' Vallone said from the
shade of his beach umbrella.
	   August looks grim. Hoteliers report up to 30 percent vacancies
in the peak, always-booked-solid month.

Japan's Isuzu recalls sport utility models over transmission
</HEADLINE>
problem &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd. has recalled 9,856 sport
utility vehicles and light trucks to repair transmission and brake
problems, the company announced Thursday.
	   The models affected were the Bighorn, VehiCross and Horizon
sport utility vehicles and the Elf light truck.
	   Some of the Bighorn vehicles were exported to the United States,
Europe and Asia, while the VehiCross and the Horizon were mostly
for the domestic market. Elf trucks were sold only in Japan.
	   A total of 9,663 sport utility vehicles manufactured between May
12, 1995, and Jan. 28, 1998, were included in the recall because of
problems with the transmission that could prevent them from moving,
the company said.
	   Elf trucks made between Aug. 21, 1996, and Dec. 25, 1996 _ a
total of 193 _ were also included due to brake-related troubles,
the company said.
	   The Horizon is supplied to Honda Motor Co. on an original
equipment manufacturing basis, and is the same vehicle as the
VehiCross.
	   Customers can have the vehicles repaired free of charge at
dealerships.

Slovenia stops supplying Croatia with electricity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia's state electricity company
stopped Thursday supplying Croatia with electricity from their
jointly-owned Krsko nuclear power plant after Croatia failed to pay
back its debts, the state-run news agency STA reported.
	   It said Croatia had not paid its bills since June, amounting to
a total of dlrs 14 million.
	   The transmission lines carrying electric power to Croatia from
other foreign countries via Krsko are still active, Alojz Kovse, an
Economics Ministry official in charge of electricity said.
	   The Croatian state electric power concern, which is the co-owner
of Krsko, said it would cover the lack of Krsko-made electricity by
its own power generation. It characterized Slovenia's move as
``illegal and unauthorized,'' according to the news agency HINA.
	   Although Slovenia's move likely will not cause a blackout in
Croatia, which only gets 15 percent of its power supplies from
Krsko, this represents the first serious quarrel between the two
former Yugoslav republics, which simultaneously proclaimed
independence in June 1991.
	   Croatian-Slovenian relations so far have been better than among
any other former Yugoslav republics. But their failure to solve
some problems caused by the breakup of the former Yugoslav
federation have caused constant tensions.
	   Krsko is the only nuclear plant in former Yugoslavia. It was
jointly built by Slovenia and Croatia.
	   After some heated debate between the two neighbors, Slovenia
eventually accepted Croatia's 50 percent ownership. But tensions
arose again last month after negotiations broke down over who would
finance the plant's upgrading and the Croats staged a walkout from
the talks.
	   Croatia's official in charge of electricity, Roman Nota,
acknowledged to HINA that Croatia owes some money to the Krsko
management, but ``not nearly the amount given'' by Slovenia.
	   He said Slovenia's move is ``radical'' and that it would only
aggravate relations.

Panel says Amsterdam's twin stars must play on for Ajax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Twin soccer stars Frank and Ronald
de Boer must continue playing for Ajax Amsterdam, arbitrators said
Thursday in a ruling that ends their long and bitter battle to
leave the club.
	   The Dutch Soccer Association arbitration commission held the De
Boers to their contracts with Ajax, which run through 2004, siding
with the club in its contention that they had no legal right to
seek release.
	   The contracts, signed in March 1997, also contain a clause
stipulating that the twins cannot seek a transfer before 2001.
	   In a brief press release, Ajax said the De Boers had
acknowledged they would abide by the decision ``and that their
football careers with Ajax will continue.''
	   The decision by the three-member panel, which is legally
binding, ended a longrunning fight by the 28-year-old De Boers to
break free of Ajax and play abroad, where salaries are higher and
opponents tougher than in the Netherlands.
	   Frank, a defender, and Ronald a forward, were key members of the
Dutch national squad that reached the semifinals of the 1998 World
Cup. They have also been crucial to Ajax's trophy-filled success in
recent years.
	   A delegation from FC Barcelona had attended a hearing this week,
and Dutch media reported that the Spanish powerhouse was willing to
pay dlrs 22 million to acquire them both. Archrival Real Madrid
also was hot to sign them.
	   English league champion Arsenal made a dlrs 15 million bid for
Ronald last month, but Ajax rejected it as ``out of the question.''
	   The De Boers took their case to the arbitration commission after
direct negotiations with the club failed.

Human rights group demands laws to curb racial discrimination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A human rights group charged Thursday that the
Hong Kong government was holding back on action to protect the
rights of minorities.
	   In a meeting with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, the Hong
Kong-based Human Rights Monitor said government-sponsored education
programs against racial discrimination were not enough to protect
non-Chinese living in Hong Kong.
	   ``The government has been educating people against smoking for
the past 30 years, and still they had to enact laws to prevent
it,'' said the group's chairman, Stephen Ng.
	   The Hong Kong government has come under criticism because of its
lack of enthusiasm for concrete measures to curb discrimination.
Nearly 500,000 of Hong Kong's 6.5 million people are immigrants or
ethnically non-Chinese.
	   The group called for revisions in the Equal Opportunities Law,
enacted while Hong Kong was under British rule, to include racial
origin as one of the categories. The law prohibits discrimination
based on gender, religion, sexual preference or physical
disability.
	   Ng noted that a survey the group released Wednesday indicated
non-Chinese in Hong Kong felt they were being excluded from proper
housing, job opportunities, and even medical care. The survey,
which did not give any margin of error, said many non-Chinese
complained of low wages and poor housing.
	   In recent weeks, newspapers have reported bars and night clubs
overcharging or refusing entry on the basis of race.
	   ``Discrimination will not cease simply by education,'' the group
said in a statement submitted to Tung. It said that education
``does not provide the immediate protection minorities require.''
	   In a statement released after the meeting, Tung said Hong Kong's
human rights record was ``one of the best in the world.''
	   ``We are not complacent,'' Tung added. ``We are looking for the
most effective ways to improve.''
	   But Ng said Tung was ``not very forthcoming'' in the meeting,
his second with the group. Ng said the human rights organization
was ``very disappointed'' with the meeting.
	   Ravi Gidumal, an Indian businessman who attended the meeting,
said Tung failed to give reasons why the government was holding
back on laws to protect minorities in Hong Kong. He added that the
government ``had underestimated the problem.''
	   ``For (the government) no mechanism is the right mechanism,''
Gidumal said. ``The problem exists and legislation is the way to
stop it.''

EU: Milosevic declares Serb offensive over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic declared Thursday that a sweeping Serb offensive in
Kosovo, that left many dead and thousands homeless, was over.
	   ``Milosevic assured us that the military action has come to a
halt,'' said Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan, who headed a
three-member European Union delegation in talks with the Yugoslav
President.
	   The members of the fact-finding delegation, who visited the
embattled Serbian province Wednesday, expressed their dismay with
the level destruction the Serb forces committed during this week's
offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   ``The impression our mission got is quite a devastating one,''
said German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. ``What has been created is
literally a wasteland.''
	   Rohan said he got a ``clear impression of excessive use of
military force .... totally out of proportion with military
targets.''

First major show of Warhol drawings exhibited in Germany

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ The first major show in Germany of
drawings by U.S. pop art icon Andy Warhol goes on display Saturday
at a medieval castle-museum near the Rhine River.
	   The exhibit of 230 drawings runs till Sept. 20 at Moyland, a
castle surrounded by a moat in Bedburg-Hau near the Dutch border.
	   The sketches span Warhol's career as a graphic artist in the
1950s through his death in 1987 at age 59 and include studies for
some of his famous silkscreens, curator Bettina Paust said.
	   The exhibit was put together by the Andy Warhol Museum in
Pittsburgh, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in New
York and the Public Art Collection of Basel, Switzerland.
	   The traveling exhibit goes next to Tuebingen, 30 kilometers (20
miles) southwest of Stuttgart in southern Germany, and then to
Austria before returning to the United States.
	   The Moyland castle also houses a permanent collection of
drawings by the late German artist Joseph Beuys, an acquaintance of
Warhol's who also made collages and sought to expand the boundaries
of art.

Moderate quakes rattle southern Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook southern
Romania Thursday, the Earth Physics Institute said. There were no
reports of damage or injury.
	   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 3.9, occurred at
07:55 a.m. (0455 GMT) in the Petrosani mining coal basin in the
southwestern Carpathian Mountains, some 250 kilometers (127 miles)
northwest of the capital, said Domnica Georgescu, a spokeswoman for
the institute. It rumbled at a depth of 5 kilometers (3 miles) and
followed a quake with a similar preliminary magnitude that occurred
late Wednesday.
	   Georgescu said that both quakes ``were unusual'' because
Petrosani region is not usually seismically active.
	   More than 30 minor earthquakes hit the country every year, most
of them causing no damage. Romania's last serious quake left over
1,000 people dead and destroyed hundreds of buildings in March
1977.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic declared Thursday that a sweeping Serb offensive in
Kosovo that left many dead and thousands homeless was over.
	   ``Milosevic assured us that the military action has come to a
halt,'' said Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan, who headed a
three-member European Union delegation in talks with the Yugoslav
President.
	   Members of the fact-finding group that visited the embattled
Serbian province Wednesday expressed their dismay with the level
destruction by Serb forces during this week's offensive against
ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   ``The impression our mission got is quite a devastating one,''
said German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. ``What has been created is
literally a wasteland.''
	   Rohan said he got a ``clear impression of excessive use of
military force .... totally out of proportion with military
targets.''

Taliban religious police get tough on TVs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's religious police hauled
televisions from stores and smashed them on the streets of the
capital Thursday, destroying the latest item forbidden under their
strict version of Islam.
	   ``What can I do?'' said one shopkeeper who refused to give his
name. ``It is difficult to argue with the Taliban religious
police.''
	   Soon after capturing Kabul in 1996, the Taliban began their
campaign against entertainment with a ban on all music except
religious songs. The only movie theater in Kabul was closed and
books and other publications published outside Afghanistan were
banned.
	   Taliban officials say Afghans should spend their free time at
prayer.
	   Haji Qalamuddin, deputy chief of the ministry in charge of
religious observance, said Kabul residents had been told 15 days
ago that they had until Thursday to get rid of their sets.
Shopkeepers said many of the sets they displayed were intended for
export to neighboring Pakistan, not for use in Afghanistan.
	   Consumer electronics from all over the world are routinely
smuggled duty-free from Afghanistan to Pakistan.

Two U.S. Navy ships to visit China in sign of closer military ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two U.S. Navy ships are to visit the Chinese port
of Qingdao next week in a sign that military contacts between the
two sides are growing routine again, two years after tensions rose
over Taiwan.
	   The USS Blue Ridge, the flagship of the U.S. 7th Fleet, and the
guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain will call for four days
at the northern Chinese port beginning Sunday, the U.S. Embassy
announced Thursday.
	   It will be the fourth U.S. Navy ship visit to the Chinese
mainland since 1995, when port visits resumed after being frozen
following China's violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in
1989.
	   Relations were shaken again in 1996, when China launched missile
tests and war games near Taiwan in a bid to intimidate supporters
of the independence for the island. The United States positioned
two aircraft carrier battle groups off Taiwan as a warning to
China, and the two navies found themselves operating dangerously
close to each other.
	   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, and threatens to
invade it should it declare independence. Washington doesn't
formally recognize Taiwan, but is bound by law to consider any
threat to the island's security a matter of grave concern.
	   Military-to-military ties have improved through high-level
contacts and smaller confidence-building exchanges. The two sides
have traded views on disaster relief operations and China has
agreed to send observers to U.S. naval and air force exercises this
year.

BELGRADE: military targets.''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Western diplomats claimed some progress in efforts to unite
Albanian factions for peace talks on the future of Kosovo, but said
the process has been slowed by Serb battlefield gains against
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Milosevic has agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled
out independence, as demanded by Albanian politicians and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``Milosevic for the first time indicated flexibility on how far
the self-government could go,'' Ischinger said. ``He didn't dispute
the fact that the time is running out.''
	   ``I've never seen him as concerned as today. He agrees with the
idea of a platform that includes all relevant elements of the
(Kosovo Albanian) side.''
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on composition of an
``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
	   Ischinger said he expected that the Albanians will form a joint
delegation in the next few days and that the negotiations with
Milosevic's government will start ``in a matter of weeks.''
	   ``We leave encouraged that a platform is developing,'' the
British member in the EU delegation, Emyr Jones Perry, said after
meeting Milosevic.
	   On Wednesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met for three
hours with Albanian politicians and KLA representatives in the
village of Likoc in the Drenica region. Hill made no statement
after the meeting and returned to Macedonia, where he serves as the
U.S. ambassador.
	   Western diplomats familiar with the negotiations said Hill's
meeting achieved some progress toward uniting the Albanians. They
refused to elaborate, but the fact that Hill returned to Macedonia
suggested the deal was far from complete.
	   The latest talks took place against the background of major
gains by Serb forces in retaking parts of the province under
Albanian control.
	   Since launching an offensive Friday, Serb police have driven KLA
fighters from their stronghold in Malisevo and pushed them off the
main highway between Pristina and Pec which the insurgents had
blocked since May.
	   Numerous people have been reported killed and tens of thousands
ethnic Albanians have fled their homes.
	   Reporters traveling through the embattled regions Thursday saw
deserted and burning houses. Apparently fleeing in panic, KLA
fighters left behind abandoned weapons and stocks of food.
	   On Wednesday, the leading ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, said he had reached a compromise with other groups on a
coalition government that would include ``all political forces''
and ``create preconditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led
Yugoslav government.
	   Albanian-language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA the defense and interior posts, meaning it would control
the provincial police. But it remained unclear whether a
significant part of the KLA was prepared to accept any such offer.

Outspoken government critic elected labor union leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A vociferous critic of the government's
economic policies was elected Thursday as leader of Lebanon's
powerful trade union federation.
	   Elias Abu Rizk, who was defeated by a candidate backed by Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri last year, was elected leader of the General
Confederation of Labor Trade Unions, which represents the
350,000-strong labor force.
	   He won 32 of the 51 votes cast in the confederation's 56-member
electoral body. His rival, independent George Harb, received three
votes. Thirteen ballot papers were blank and three more votes were
declared invalid.
	   With his election, Rizk is expected to take up the unions'
demand for salary increases and doubling the current minimum
monthly wage of 300,000 pounds (dlrs 200) as well as social
benefits.
	   ``The confederation will continue to play its leading role in
improving economic and social conditions,'' he told reporters.
	   Abu Rizk was supported by representatives of the Shiite Muslim
Amal movement, led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and those of
the leftist Progressive Socialist Party headed by former Druse
warlord and current Minister of the Displaced Walid Jumblatt.
	   Their support was part of a simmering political dispute with
Hariri over how to run the country, which is struggling to rebuild
from the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   Hariri, whose government has launched a multibillion-dollar
reconstruction program, has come under attack by opposition
politicians and labor unions because his plans require heavy
borrowing and higher taxes.
	   Critics have also accused the Hariri government of rampant
corruption, bribery and mishandling of public funds.
	   Abu Rizk led several anti-government strikes and protests when
he was labor union leader from 1993 to 1997.
	   Ghanim Zogbi, Abu Rizk's predecessor, resigned in May in protest
against the government's failure to improve economic conditions. He
did not contest this year and voted for Abu Rizk.

Panel says Amsterdam's twin stars must play on for Ajax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with panel also ordering brothers to report for
training as usual next Monday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Twin soccer stars Frank and Ronald
de Boer must continue playing for Ajax Amsterdam, arbitrators ruled
Thursday, ending their long and bitter battle to leave for more
lucrative opportunities.
	   The Dutch Soccer Association arbitration commission held the De
Boers to their contracts with Ajax, which run through 2004, siding
with the club in its contention that they had no legal right to
seek release.
	   The contracts, signed in March 1997, also contain a clause
stipulating that the twins cannot seek a transfer before 2001.
	   Arbitrators said they could see ``no pressing reasons'' why the
De Boers should be allowed out of their contracts, and ordered the
brothers to report to training as usual next Monday.
	   In a brief press release, Ajax said the De Boers had
acknowledged they would abide by the decision ``and that their
football careers with Ajax will continue.''
	   The decision by the three-member panel, which is definitive and
legally binding, ended a longrunning fight by the 28-year-old De
Boers to break free of Ajax and play abroad, where salaries are
higher and opponents tougher than in the Netherlands.
	   Frank de Boer, a defender, and Ronald de Boer, a forward, were
key members of the Dutch national squad that reached the semifinals
of the 1998 World Cup. They have also been crucial to Ajax's
trophy-filled success in recent years.
	   A delegation from FC Barcelona had attended a hearing this week,
and Dutch media reported that the Spanish powerhouse was willing to
pay dlrs 22 million to acquire them both. Archrival Real Madrid
also was hot to sign them.
	   English league champion Arsenal made a dlrs 15 million bid for
Ronald de Boer last month, but Ajax rejected it as ``out of the
question.''
	   The De Boers took their case to the arbitration commission after
direct negotiations with the club failed.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A driver trying to smuggle a truckload of Kosovo
Albanians into Germany sped through a road block at 120 kilometers
(75 miles) an hour, crashing the truck against a stone wall and
killing at least seven refugees Thursday.
	   At least 15 other Kosovo Albanians were hurt, some seriously,
police said in Freiburg, near the Czech border.
	   Germany border officials erected a road block to stop the rented
truck about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the Czech border early
Thursday after noticing that the truck's windows had been covered
with foil.
	   Instead of stopping, the driver sped up, crashing through the
blockade then losing control on a curve, police said.
	   A Czech man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling refugees; he
was also injured, although not critically. Police say they don't
know whether he or a second man who escaped was the driver.
	   A few hours after the crash, another Czech driver with four
refugees from Yugoslavia were arrested south of Dresden after the
driver broke through another road block. No one was injured.
	   The number of ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia seeking asylum in
Germany has jumped in recent months as Serb police crack down on
the Albanian majority in Kosovo province.
	   Border police in Berlin said the number of people caught trying
to enter Germany illegally has risen as well. In the first six
months of the year, 6,358 were caught, compared with 4,947 during
the same period last year.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The family of a U.S. Marine who fought in World War
II has returned a flag taken 50 years ago from a fallen Japanese
soldier, Kyodo News reported Thursday.
	   Ervin Day reportedly took the flag from the fallen body of
Takiguchi Ota, a Japanese navy officer, during a battle on Iwo Jima
in 1944.
	   The flag was returned to Ota's son, Kazuhiko, on behalf of the
family at a ceremony July 13 in Niigata prefecture, about 250
kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Tokyo, Kyodo said, citing
military officials.
	   Japanese soldiers often carried flags into battle for good luck.
	   A member of Day's family set out to find the owner of the flag
after hearing of its origin, Kyodo reported.
	   U.S. military officials in Japan were unavailable for comment
after office hours Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Thursday declared an end to a sweeping Serb offensive
in Kosovo that left many dead and thousands homeless, an Austrian
diplomat said.
	   ``Milosevic assured us that the military action has come to a
halt,'' said Albert Rohan, who headed a three-member European Union
delegation in talks with the Yugoslav President.
	   Members of the fact-finding group that visited the embattled
Serbian province Wednesday said they saw extensive destruction
caused by Serb forces during their offensive against ethnic
Albanian separatists.
	   ``The impression our mission got is quite a devastating one,''
said German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. ``What has been created is
literally a wasteland.''
	   Rohan said he got a ``clear impression of excessive use of
military force .... totally out of proportion with military
targets.''
	   Western diplomats claimed some progress in efforts to unite
Albanian factions for peace talks on the future of Kosovo, but said
the process has been slowed by Serb battlefield gains against
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Milosevic has agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled
out the independence demanded by Albanian politicians and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``Milosevic for the first time indicated flexibility on how far
the self-government could go,'' Ischinger said. ``He didn't dispute
the fact that the time is running out.
	   ``I've never seen him as concerned as today. He agrees with the
idea of a platform that includes all relevant elements of the
(Kosovo Albanian) side.''
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on the composition of
an ``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
	   Ischinger said he expected that the Albanians will form a joint
delegation in the next few days and that the negotiations with
Milosevic's government will start ``in a matter of weeks.''
	   ``We leave encouraged that a platform is developing,'' the
British member in the EU delegation, Emyr Jones Perry, said after
meeting Milosevic.
	   On Wednesday, the leading ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, said he had reached a compromise with other groups on a
coalition government that would include ``all political forces''
and ``create preconditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led
Yugoslav government.
	   Albanian-language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA the defense and interior posts, meaning it would control
the provincial police. But it remained unclear whether a
significant part of the KLA was prepared to accept any such offer.
	   The latest talks took place against the background of major
gains by Serb forces in retaking parts of the province under
Albanian control.
	   Since launching an offensive Friday, Serb police have driven KLA
fighters from their stronghold in Malisevo and pushed them off the
main highway between Pristina and Pec which the insurgents had
blocked since May.
	   Numerous people have been reported killed and tens of thousands
ethnic Albanians have fled their homes.
	   Reporters traveling through the embattled regions Thursday saw
deserted and burning houses. KLA fighters, apparently fleeing in
panic, left behind abandoned weapons and stocks of food.

Congress studies possible re-election of lawmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ ``No re-election'' has been a sacred slogan
for Mexican politicians since the 19th century. Now the country's
Congress is thinking of allowing at least lawmakers to seek
additional terms.
	   Congressman Santiago Creel said late Wednesday that all five
parties in Congress have agreed to discuss constitutional
amendments that would let congressmen serve three consecutive terms
and senators two.
	   Congressmen serve terms of three years, senators of six. While
they can serve more than one term, they cannot do so consecutively.
	   Creel said re-election would create lawmakers with greater
experience and greater interest in the voters they serve.
	   Analysts also say it might help strengthen a Congress
historically overshadowed by Mexico's president.
	   Current lawmakers would not be eligible for re-election if the
measure passes. The amendment also would not affect Mexico's
president.
	   Mexican reformers raised the cry of ``no re-election'' in the
19th century to prevent strongmen from maintaining themselves in
power.
	   The idea gained added strength because of opposition to Porfirio
Diaz, who ruled Mexico from 1877 to 1881 and from 1884 to 1911.
	   Other possible constitutional amendments would permit Mexicans
abroad to vote, create a second round in elections where the leader
fails to gain 50 percent and reduce the minimum age for
legislators.

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Norway brought experts Thursday to
Bolivia to search for a Norwegian explorer and agronomist missing
in a remote tropical rain forest.
	   Lars Hafskjold, 38, was last seen in November passing through
the village of San Fermin, a farming community and military outpost
on the Bolivian border with Peru. San Fermin, 300 kilometers (185
miles) north of La Paz, is only accessible by a trail that crosses
the Andes.
	   Area residents, park officials and Conservation International
believe Hafskjold was on his way to the Bolivian Madidi National
Park to search for a remote Indian community.

Man appears in court for bombing on day before elections

explosives charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A man appeared in court
Thursday charged with detonating a car bomb on the day before
elections for Northern Ireland's new power-sharing assembly.
	   Unemployed Patrick Bernard Wall, 32, of Forkill, who is charged
with setting off home-made explosives in the town of
Newtownhamilton on June 24, was remanded in custody.
	   Wall, who denies the charge, will appear before a court inside
the Maze Prison on Aug. 26.
	   A small anti-British gang, the Irish National Liberation Army,
claimed responsibility for the attack, which injured a 13-year-old
boy and damaged shops and homes in the main street of
Newtownhamilton,
	   It was not immediately clear what Wall's role with the group
was.
	   Wall, wearing a black and white check shirt, stood impassively
in the dock of Newry Magistrates' Court as the charges were read
out. He did not speak.
	   Separately Thursday, three men and a woman charged with a failed
London bombing campaign blamed on Irish Republican Army dissidents
appeared in court in the capital.
	   The four, who were arrested in London earlier this month, were
remanded in custody at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court and will appear
in court again on Aug. 27.
	   Anthony Hyland, 25, whose address was not given; Darren
Mulholland, 19, of Dundalk in the Irish Republic; Elaine Moore, 21,
of Hampstead, northwest London; and Liam Grogan, 21, of Naas in the
Irish Republic, are charged with conspiracy to cause explosions.
Mulholland, Grogan and Moore also are charged with possessing
explosives.
	   Voters went to the polls on June 25 to elect members of Northern
Ireland's new 108-seat Assembly where Protestants and Catholics
share power.

Sydney officials declare water unsafe across whole city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with water emergency covering all of Sydney; adds
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Authorities warned millions of
residents throughout Sydney Thursday to boil their tap water before
drinking it after finding widespread parasite contamination.
	   Bottled water disappeared from store shelves as panic buying
began. Residents were even told to boil drinking water for their
pets.
	   The parasites giardia and cryptosporidium were found in the
city's main water systems, Sydney Water managers said.
	   City residents must boil water for at least 60 seconds _ and
preferably for three minutes _ to avoid the parasites.
	   Giardia, normally spread from human or animal fecal matter, can
cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
	   Cryptosporidium causes symptoms similar to flu. It can kill
people with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, patients
recovering from surgery and victims weakened by other diseases.
	   This is the second major infrastructure failure this year in the
region.
	   A power failure struck downtown Auckland in February, plunging
the commercial heart of New Zealand's largest city into darkness.
Sporadic power failures and electricity shortages continued for
five weeks.
	   Sydney's discovery of tainted water has prompted fears the
city's reputation has been damaged ahead of the 2000 Olympic Games,
for which Sydney is the host.
	   The timing of the discovery was particularly embarrassing as it
came on the day U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Secretary of Defense William Cohen arrived with a contingent of
American reporters.
	   The two officials are in Australia for annual consultations with
their counterparts here.
	   No illness has been reported so far as a result of the
contamination, but the parasites have an incubation period of about
a week.
	   The city's population is about 3.7 million. Only a few far
western suburbs, which draw their water from a different source,
were not affected.
	   New South Wales State Premier Bob Carr vowed to fire those
responsible but played down damage to the Olympic city's
reputation.
	   ``It's got nothing to do with the Olympics, it's got to do with
being able to drink water from a tap knowing you're not in danger
of getting a stomach bug,'' he told reporters.
	   Sydney Water had previously been so proud of its water supply
that it ran ad campaigns featuring prominent Olympic athletes
endorsing its purity.
	   Tests around the city earlier this week turned up signs of
giardia in a small area of downtown. But emergency warnings were
expanded to include southern and eastern suburbs after the outbreak
was found to be much more widespread than originally thought,
Sydney Water said.
	   On Thursday night, the alert spread citywide as a new outbreak
was found in Palm Beach, a suburb on Sydney's extreme northern
outskirts.
	   Schools, hospitals, nursing homes and child care centers that
were not in the previously identified area were advised to be on
alert. They are not allowing students, patients and children to
drink tap water.
	   State opposition leader Peter Collins said Sydney's reputation
was on the line because of the contamination.
	   ``Two years out from the Olympics, we get a reputation for being
a city whose water supply has to be boiled before you can drink
it,'' Collins said on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``If this was Dakar (Senegal) after the flood, you might
understand it but how has this been allowed to happen in Sydney?''
	   Sydney Water managing director Chris Pollock said the
contamination was believed to have come from dams that supplied
Sydney's water.
	   Giardia normally lives in the gut of warm-blooded animals and
can be washed into rivers and catchments, he said. It normally dies
within two or three days when in water.

Ortiz leads Puerto Rico past Japan; Brazil edges South Korea

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Veteran center Jose Ortiz, who once played
for the Utah Jazz, had game-highs of 22 points and 11 rebounds to
lead Puerto Rico past Japan 78-57 Thursday at the World Basketball
Championship.
	   The 2.07-meter (6-foot-10) Ortiz dominated under the basket, and
spurred a 23-8 run in the opening nine minutes of the second half
that put the game away.
	   Puerto Rico (1-1), which led 39-32 at halftime, remained in the
hunt to advance from Group D to the next round.
	   Michael Takahashi, who played college basketball at
Cal-Northridge and whose father is American, led Japan (0-2) with
20 points and nine rebounds.
	   In another preliminary round game Thursday, Brazil held off
South Korea 76-73 behind 17 points from Caio Cazziolato and 14 from
Rogerio Klafke.
	   South Korea drew even at 67-67 on a layup by Lee Sang Min
(game-high 19 points) with 4:32 left, but Caio had two baskets in a
7-1 Brazilian run that sealed victory.
	   Brazil is 1-1, South Korea 0-2 in Group C.
	   The United States was to play Lithuania later in Thursday's
other Group C game, while 1990 world champion Yugoslavia faced
Russia in Group B.
	   Other key games included Greece vs. Italy, Argentina vs.
Nigeria, and Spain vs. Australia.
	   On the U.S. team, Trajan Langdon is a fill-in for a fill-in.
He's the new guy. The kid.
	   But the Duke senior, last off the bench for the United States,
is proof that depth might soon become the team's hallmark.
	   ``What we saw tonight is that we are a team that's 12-deep.
That's one of our strengths,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said
Wednesday after his charges debuted in Athens with an 83-59 rout of
Brazil. ``Our starting lineup is just the guys who start the
game.''
	   They didn't start particularly well against Brazil.
	   The Americans went more than four minutes without a field goal
and trailed by five points early. But they took over with a 13-1
run, highlighted by Langdon's pair of 3-pointers.
	   The guard's only two shots of the game hit all net.
	   ``All my teammates and the coaches say, `When you get an open
look, shoot the ball.' That's my mentality as a shooter,'' Langdon
said.
	   ``That guy,'' Tomjanovich said of Langdon, ``is just solid,
fearless.''
	   Yet he nearly wasn't here.
	   Among the last players cut a week ago when Tomjanovich rushed to
put together his eclectic squad, Langdon was called up Sunday to
replace Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, who sprained an ankle.
	   Of course, neither of the two collegians, or anyone else wearing
the red-white-and-blue here, was supposed to be representing the
United States at the worlds. But the NBA labor dispute led to USA
Basketball dumping the Dream Team.
	   The five players Tomjanovich put on the court at tip-off all
play in either the CBA or European leagues. They averaged less than
17 minutes apiece Wednesday and were outscored 52-31 by the U.S.
bench players.

Hakkinen considers Coulthard bigger threat than Schumacher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Even though Michael Schumacher has
been breathing down his neck, Mika Hakkinen believes the biggest
threat to his Formula One championship hopes comes from his own
teammate, David Coulthard.
	   The two McLaren-Mercedes drivers have been dominating the season
and come to the German Grand Prix on Sunday following their sweep
in Austria, where Hakkinen finished ahead of Coulthard.
	   Hakkinen's victory four days ago snapped Schumacher's three-race
winning streak. Schumacher is trying to become the first Ferrari
driver since Jody Schockter in 1979 to win the drivers'
championship.
	   ``The red car (Ferrari) has been a challenger all year,''
Hakkinen said Thursday. ``But the top car at the moment is McLaren.
	   ``And I am the top driver. This may sound very confident, but we
have been very strong in all aspects,'' the Finn said.
	   ``We have been very consistent the entire season,'' Hakkinen
said.
	   In Austria, Hakkinen started from the second row on the grid.
But he blasted to the front from the start and was in the lead by
the first corner. Avoiding trouble in an accident-filled race,
Hakkinen cruised home.
	   While Hakkinen had a virtually perfect run, Coulthard was the
one who had a spectacular race.
	   The British driver was in the back of the field after qualifying
in 14th position. He was involved in one of several first-lap
accidents and had to make an early pit stop for some quick repairs.
	   Coulthard managed to rejoin the race while the safety car was
still pacing the field. Back in last place, Coulthard steadily
overtook driver after driver to finally finish second.
	   Hakkinen, who twice fought off Schumacher's attempts to
overtake, said he'd been astonished to see Coulthard behind him.
	   ``I couldn't believe it, I was even a bit worried,'' Hakkinen
said.
	   With six races left in the season, Hakkinen's win in Austria
gave him an eight-point lead over Schumacher, a two-time champion
before he joined Ferrari.
	   ``Schumacher has shown that you always have to count with him
and Ferrari,'' Hakkinen said. ``But I really think that my teammate
David will be my toughest opponent. He's always a big challenge for
me.''
	   Coulthard is third with 36 points. Hakkinen has 66 and
Schumacher 58. A victory is worth 10 points.
	   Hakkinen has five victories this season, Schumacher four and
Coulthard one. Coulthard has been second to Hakkinen four times.
	   Sunday's race over 45 laps on the 6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile)
Hockenheim Ring is on of the fastest Formula One tracks and is
likely to favor McLaren.
	   But Hockenheim is where Schumacher feels at home and he will
have the frenetic support of 150,000 fans.

Georgian prime ministerial candidate accepts post
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's ambassador to Russia decided
Thursday to accept the post of state minister of the former Soviet
republic, second in rank to President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Vazha Lordkipanidze is to head the newly reshuffled Cabinet.
When he announced the shakeup last week, Shevardnadze said that new
government officials were necessary to carry Georgia's economic
reforms to a new stage.
	   Nearly all members of the Georgian Cabinet have submitted their
resignations in recent days.
	   Georgia suffers from many of the same economic woes as other
former Soviet republics, as well as a conflict with separatists in
the Black Sea province of Abkhazia.
	   Lordkipanidze has been active on the Abkhazian issue, conducting
negotiations with separatist representatives in Moscow.
	   He said he would carry out a ``reformist, coordinated policy''
and denied it would be pro-Russian.
	   ``I will be carrying out the policy that my country needs,'' he
told reporters.
	   The Russian government praised the appointment Thursday, saying
the move would ``doubtless strengthen and broaden bilateral ties''
between Russia and Georgia, the Interfax news agency said, citing
an unidentified Foreign Ministry source.
	   But Abkhazian leaders said the appointment would not help to
settle the standoff between Georgia and the province.
	   Lordkipanidze, 48, was first secretary of the Young Communist
League of the Georgian republic in the early 1980s, and in 1992 he
became head of Shevardnadze's administration.
	   He was appointed ambassador to Russia in 1995, and took up the
post of presidential envoy in the Abkhazian settlement.
	   Russia pressured Georgia on Thursday to decide whether to keep
Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia after Friday, when the present
mandate expires, Interfax reported. But Russian special envoy to
Georgia Lev Mironov said Moscow would tolerate a delay, given the
Cabinet reshuffle.
	   The peacekeepers were sent to stabilize Abkhazia in 1994
following a war in which Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian
government troops.

Chris Lewis to be disciplined after abusive outburst against
</HEADLINE>
selectors

<TEXT>
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ English all-rounder Chris Lewis will
be disciplined by his county team after criticizing selectors who
omitted him from England's World Cup cricket squad.
	   Lewis _ who played for England against South Africa in two
limited-overs internationals in May _ said the 37-man England squad
was not picked on ``cricketing ability'' and selectors were ``full
of ....''.
	   The Leicestershire player made the remarks after his team's
NatWest Trophy win over Warwickshire on Tuesday.
	   The 30-year-old, whose last test cap for England was against
Pakistan two years ago, has a reputation for being erratic and was
overlooked by selectors for a squad preparing for the World Cup,
starting Sept. 9 next year.
	   Leicestershire chief executive David Collier said Thursday that
comments attributed to Lewis were unacceptable.
	   ``There are mitigating circumstances which we will be taking
into account, but the club will be disciplining him,'' he said.

Four Israeli soldiers wounded in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) - Lebanese guerrillas opened fire on
four Israeli outposts in southern Lebanon Thursday, wounding at
least four Israeli soldiers, security officials said.
	   Israeli helicopters evacuated the wounded to hospitals in
Israel, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The clashes began at 0300 p.m. (1200 GMT) and were intensifying
more than an hour later, the officials said.
	   The fighting began when guerrillas opened fire at positions of
the Israel army and Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia at
Sojod, Rihan, Bir Kallab, and Ghozlan inside the Israeli-occupied
security zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia is the main guerrilla group
active in the area.
	   The guerrillas are trying to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 allied militiamen from the security zone, which Israel
established in 1985 to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.

Russian government promises financial help to crash victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government promised Thursday to give
financial aid to those affected by the crash of a military plane
that killed at least 69 people in Siberia in December, a news
agency reported.
	   The government allocated 3 million rubles (dlrs 500,000) for
victims of the An-124 Ruslan crash in Irkutsk, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The cargo plane went down Dec. 7 when three of its four engines
failed seconds after it took off. It clipped an orphanage, three
houses and a school before slamming into an apartment building and
igniting a fireball.
	   The relief money will come from a reserve fund designed to ease
the aftermath of emergencies and natural disasters.

Turkey rejects European court decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Thursday rejected a decision by
the European Court of Human Rights ordering it to pay dlrs 700,000
in compensation to a Greek Cypriot woman.
	   The Strasbourg-based court on Wednesday ruled in favor of Titina
Loizidou and ordered Turkey to pay the money for depriving her of
property she owns in Kyrenia, which is located in the self-declared
Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the divided island.
	   A Foreign Ministry statement said the court's judgment lacked
``the means of applicability and implementation'' and added Turkey
could not be legally held responsible for property in the
self-styled Turkish Cypriot state, which is only recognized by
Turkey.
	   As a signatory of its convention, Turkey is obliged to abide by
the Court's rulings.
	   The issue is a very thorny one for Ankara, as the Court's
decision is likely to open the way to hundreds of other property
claims against Turkey.
	   The island is divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded the
northern third of the island, in the wake of an abortive coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state was established in the north
in 1983. Turkey maintains some 35,000 troops there.
	   ``The court failed to take into account the fact that (northern
Cyprus) is an independent state... with its own constitution,
administration and judiciary system,'' the statement said.
	   Cyprus' attorney general, Alecos Markides, hailed the ruling as
a ``historic landmark decision that creates a legal precedent'' for
the 180,000 Greek Cypriots who were not allowed by the Turkish army
to return to their homes and property in northern Cyprus.
	   The Greek Cypriots either fled or were forcibly expelled in the
wake of the invasion.

Angola faces humanitarian disaster, government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government warned Thursday of an
impending ``humanitarian disaster'' in Angola due to a surge in the
number of people fleeing alleged hit-and-run attacks by the former
rebel movement UNITA.
	   Officials have reported about 100,000 new displaced people in
Lunda Norte province in the northeast, bringing the total number of
displaced in the country to almost 1 million, Social Reinsertion
Minister Albino Malungo told state radio RNA.
	   Some 215 people reportedly were massacred last week in the Lunda
Norte village of Bula, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of
Luanda, deepening unease among the local population.
	   Survivors claim the attack was carried out by UNITA, though the
group has denied the charge.
	   Malungo said efforts to distribute aid were being hampered by
new land mines laid along main roads around the country. It was not
immediately clear who laid the mines.
	   The government has accused UNITA of attacking rural towns in
several provinces in recent months, killing dozens of police and
civilians.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ was supposed to have demobilized its
70,000-strong guerrilla army under the 1994 peace pact with the
government which ended a two-decade civil war. But the government
claims the group maintains armed men hidden in the bush of this
vast southwest African nation.
	   U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was scheduled to arrive here
Friday to urge the former foes to stick to the terms of the peace
accord.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A propeller-driven aircraft crashed
Thursday, moments after takeoff froma naval base in southwestern
India. All six people on board and two on the ground were killed,
Indian news agencies reported.
	   The Dornier aircraft of government-run Alliance Air burst into
flames when it plowed into a naval workshop in Cochin. Firefighters
rushed to the site, put out the fire and pulled out the three
passengers and three crew members, but all were dead.
	   Two workers on the dockyard were killed when the plane crashed
into the shed where they were working. The building later burst
into flames and workers inside ran out with their clothes on fire,
the Press Trust of India reported.
	   One worker was seriously burned.
	   Civil Aviation Minister Ananth Kumar told Parliament a committee
of inquiry would investigate the deaths.
	   The 16-seater aircraft had come from the nearby Lakshadweep
Islands and was heading for Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala
state. Cochin is 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of New
Delhi.

Appeal Court quashes murder conviction of disabled teen-ager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, updates throughout. CORRECTS in graf 5 that Iris
Bentley died in January 1997; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For decades, the case was a cause celebre: After a
controversial trial, a mentally disabled youth was hanged for the
murder of a policeman. And he didn't even fire the fatal shot.
	   On Thursday, 45 years after 19-year-old Derek Bentley went to
the gallows, the Appeal Court ruled he was innocent, ending a long
campaign by Bentley's family to clear his name.
	   ``Today is a great victory of British justice,'' said an
emotional Maria Dingwall-Bentley, whose mother, Iris, was Bentley's
sister. But the day was ``tinged with great sadness'' that her
mother, who died of cancer in January 1997, could not be there, Ms.
Dingwall-Bentley said.
	   ``It is also tinged by the fact that Derek cannot walk free,''
she said.
	   Ms. Dingwall-Bentley, 35, said the family will now seek
financial compensation from the government.
	   Three judges led by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham,
overturned Bentley's murder conviction _ which was based on a
single disputed remark.
	   ``It must be a matter of profound and continuing regret that
this mistrial occurred,'' Bingham said. The summing-up by the judge
at Bentley's 1953 trial, which laid great stress on the remark, was
prejudicial and unfair, Bingham added.
	   The case, dramatized in a feature film in 1991, is one of a
series of British miscarriages of justice that have been come to
light in recent years and brought calls for a public inquiry.
	   It also provided a grim reminder of the final nature of the
death penalty, abolished in Britain in 1965.
	   Bentley's friend, 16-year-old Christopher Craig, fired the fatal
shot when the pair were challenged by police as they tried to break
into a confectionery warehouse in south London on Nov. 2, 1952.
	   Bentley, who developed epilepsy after being injured in a World
War II air raid, was unable to read or write, and had a mental age
of just 11 and an IQ of 66. Although younger, Craig was able to
dominate his friend.
	   The pair were on the roof of the warehouse when they were
challenged by police, who had been alerted by a neighbor.
	   Craig, who nurtured a hatred for the police after his brother
was jailed for armed robbery, fired his gun several times, killing
Constable Sidney Miles with a single bullet.
	   Three officers said later they heard Bentley call out to Craig,
``Let him have it, Chris,'' a remark interpreted as an
encouragement to Craig to fire.
	   At the pair's Old Bailey trial, there was contradictory evidence
as to whether Bentley knew Craig was carrying a gun.
	   One policeman who was at the scene later denied Bentley made the
``Let him have it'' remark, also denied by both Bentley and Craig.
	   In his summing-up, the judge made no mention of Bentley's mental
problems, paid the police lavish praise and laid great stress on
the remark, leaving the jury little option but to convict.
	   Unusual in such cases, jurors made a plea for clemency.
	   Bentley was hanged at Wandsworth Prison in London on Jan. 28,
1953. Too young to be executed, Craig spent 10 years in prison.
	   Now 61, Craig welcomed the judges' decision Thursday.
	   ``A day does not go by when I don't think about Derek, and now
his innocence has been proved,'' he said.

Keizo Obuchi declared Japan's new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet appearing before emperor in 3rd graf;
ADDS that analysts have long suspected Japan's bad debt problem
approached dlrs 1 trillion in 12th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling party candidate Keizo Obuchi was declared
Japan's next prime minister after a vote in Parliament on Thursday,
defeating a challenge from a popular opposition leader and taking
the helm as Japan struggles with its deepest recession in decades.
	   Obuchi, 61, a soft-spoken consensus-builder, served as foreign
minister under his predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced
to quit after voter outrage over the stumbling economy dealt the
ruling party a painful defeat in July 12 upper house elections.
	   Obuchi grinned in satisfaction during the Parliament vote and
bowed when the results were announced. He made the rounds for
traditional greetings at the offices of political parties, and
presented himself and his Cabinet before Emperor Akihito on
Thursday night.
	   The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart takes over a
country suffering its worst recession since the end of World War
II. Obuchi also faces divisions in his own party and the growing
threat of an increasingly popular opposition.
	   In a decisive victory in the powerful lower house, Obuchi snared
268 votes of the 497 ballots cast in the ruling party-controlled
chamber, a comfortable margin above the 249 vote majority.
Opposition leader Naoto Kan was the runner-up with 164 votes.
	   Signaling the political divisions in Japan's government,
however, the opposition-dominated upper house endorsed Kan _
considered the country's most popular politician _ as premier with
142 votes of the 245 votes counted. Obuchi came in second place in
that race.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   The new government moved quickly to announce a so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' with former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa in the crucial post of finance minister _ considered a key
position in the administration's efforts to repair the economy.
	   ``We have to always remind ourselves what we have to do to
regain the public's trust,'' said Hiromu Nonaka, the new top
government spokesman. ``I accepted my post in an effort to make up
for the mistakes we've made.''
	   Miyazawa is respected by many an economics expert and is an
architect of the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden
banking system, though critics say his policies in the 1980s have
led to today's problems. His selection prompted rallies on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   ``No matter what we do, we have to keep in mind the seriousness
of the unemployment problem,'' Miyazawa told reporters. Joblessness
is at 4.1 percent _ the highest rate since the government started
measuring it in the 1950s.
	   Underscoring Japan's economic problems, The New York Times on
Thursday reported that U.S. officials and private financial experts
estimate Japanese banks suffer from nearly dlrs 1 trillion in bad
loans _ almost twice the official number. Japanese officials had no
immediate reaction to the report, which was based on accounts of
unidentified sources. Some analysts, however, have long suspected
that the bad debt problem approached that figure.
	   For the vote on Thursday at least, the ruling party showed unity
in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who challenged Obuchi for the LDP presidency, called for support
for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   The opposition, meanwhile, said the victory in the upper house
better represented the opinions of the voters.
	   ``The upper house results show that the vote in the lower house
does not reflect the will of the people,'' declared Kan, the
president of the Democratic Party.
	   The new prime minister's first priority will be the economy.
Obuchi has pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42.6
billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in new
spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   Most key posts in the new Cabinet went to ruling party veterans
instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Nonaka, 72, was
named chief cabinet secretary. Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education
minister, became minister of international trade and industry.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, replaced Obuchi as
foreign minister. One non-party veteran, Taichi Sakaiya, a writer
and former bureaucrat, was named director-general of the Economic
Planning Agency.
	   The Cabinet included one woman: Seiko Noda, who was named as
post and telecommunications minister. A former hotel employee, she
entered politics at age 26 after inheriting the campaign support
group of her grandfather, who was a noted lawmaker.
	   The 37-year-old becomes the youngest Cabinet minister in
Japanese history.

BlueWave edge Fighters 7-6
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chris Donnels singled home the winning run against
Erik Shullstrom in the bottom of the ninth as the Orix BlueWave
edged the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 7-6 at
Kobe Thursday.
	   The Fighters had gone ahead 6-5 with three runs in the top of
the ninth on a passed ball and Hiroshi Narahara's two-run single.
	   But in the bottom of the inning, pinch hitter Hirofumi Ogawa
tied the score with a homer and former Boston Red Sox player
Donnels hit the winning single after three walks by Shullstrom.
	   Shullstrom, formerly with the Minnesota Twins, gave up two hits
and three walks in the last 1 1/3 innings and took the loss. He is
6-2.
	   League leader Jerry Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins,
hit his 22nd homer of the season in the second inning for the
Fighters.
	   The Fighters are seven games ahead of the second-place Kintetsu
Buffaloes, whose scheduled game with the Seibu Lions at Seibu Dome
was rained out.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks ended their losing
streak at five with a 3-2 victory over the Chiba Lotte Marines.
	   The Hawks' Noriyoshi Oomichi doubled home the first run in the
third inning and teammate Hiroshi Shibahara singled home two runs
in the seventh.
	   In the Central League, Dave Hansen hit his third home run in
three games, helping the cellar-dwelling Hanshin Tigers beat the
Hiroshima Toyo Carp 7-1 at Koshien Stadium. It was the seventh
homer of the season for Hansen, who formerly played for the Chicago
Cubs.
	   Teammate Makoto Imaoka tripled home two runs in the five-run
sixth as the Tigers extended their winning streak to three and the
Carp suffered their ninth straight defeat.
	   A scheduled game between the Yomiuri Giants and the Yakult
Swallows at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium was rained out.
	   The front-running Yokohama BayStars and the second-place
Chunichi Dragons were idle Thursday.

Four Israeli soldiers wounded in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas opened fire
Thursday on four Israeli outposts in southern Lebanon, wounding at
least four Israeli soldiers, security officials said.
	   Israeli helicopters evacuated the wounded to hospitals in
Israel, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The clashes began at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) and were intensifying
more than an hour later, the officials said.
	   The fighting began when guerrillas opened fire at positions of
the Israel army and Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia at
Sojod, Rihan, Bir Kallab, and Ghozlan inside the Israeli-occupied
security zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia is the main guerrilla group
active in the area.
	   The guerrillas are trying to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 allied militiamen from the security zone, which Israel
established in 1985 to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.

Angola warns of humanitarian disaster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government warned Thursday of an
impending ``humanitarian disaster'' in Angola due to a surge in the
number of people fleeing alleged hit-and-run attacks by the former
rebel movement UNITA.
	   Officials have reported about 100,000 new displaced people in
Lunda Norte province in the northeast, bringing the total number of
displaced in the country to almost 1 million, Social Reinsertion
Minister Albino Malungo told state radio RNA.
	   Some 215 people reportedly were massacred last week in the Lunda
Norte village of Bula, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of
Luanda, deepening unease among the local population.
	   Survivors claim the attack was carried out by UNITA, though the
group has denied the charge.
	   Malungo said efforts to distribute aid were being hampered by
new land mines laid along main roads around the country. It was not
immediately clear who laid the mines.
	   The government has accused UNITA of attacking rural towns in
several provinces in recent months, killing dozens of police and
civilians.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ was supposed to have demobilized its
70,000-strong guerrilla army under the 1994 peace pact with the
government which ended a two-decade civil war. But the government
claims the group maintains armed men hidden in the bush of this
vast southwest African nation.
	   U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was scheduled to arrive here
Friday to urge the former foes to stick to the terms of the peace
accord.

Two rich German states challenge revenue-sharing agreement among
</HEADLINE>
states &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Two of Germany's richest states filed
a constitutional challenge Thursday against an arrangement that
requires rich states to transfer billions of marks (dollars) per
year to poorer states.
	   The revenue-sharing formula, periodically negotiated among
Germany's 16 states, was last updated in 1995 and runs through
2004.
	   Conservative, industry-rich Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg want
to change the formula now to cut their burden roughly in half.
Bavaria paid out 5.7 billion marks (dlrs 3.2 billion) last year,
and Baden-Wuerttemberg 6.9 billion (dlrs 3.8 billion).
	   The German constitution calls for efforts toward economic parity
among the states.
	   But Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, led by Bavarian governor
Edmund Stoiber, argue the current formula places too large a burden
on their state coffers and amounts to a disincentive for their
economic development.
	   After unsuccessfully seeking to negotiate changes with other
states, the rich states decided to take the issue before Germany's
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe.
	   The states said they remained open to renegotiation of the
formula while the court deliberates. A decision was not expected
before next year.
	   The Social Democratic Party, the main opposition in both states,
said the constitutional challenge amounted to an attack on
Germany's eastern states, still struggling in their transition from
communism to capitalism.
	   Hamburg Mayor Ortwin Runde called it an affront to Germany
solidarity.

Mubarak urges Israel to stop pressuring Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israel is using the prolonged deadlock in
peace talks with the Palestinians to force them to make
concessions, President Hosni Mubarak said Thursday.
	   Mubarak said he was pessimistic for the first time since
Arab-Israeli negotiations began in earnest more than 20 years ago
with an overture to Israel by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
	   ``Procrastination and extremism cannot force people to give up
their rights,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by the official Middle
East News Agency. ``The Palestinian people will not accept any
aggression against their land.''
	   He warned that the failure of negotiations would have ``grave
and dangerous consequences'' on the region.
	   ``The situation is not satisfactory at all. I am not optimistic,
as I used to be,'' Mubarak said.
	   However, he said Arabs should not stop their contacts with
Israel or halt the peace talks.
	   ``The idea of political boycott is wrong because it allows
Israel to monopolize on the arena and this will increase the
imbalance in the region,'' he said.
	   Palestinian-Israeli negotiations broke down 16 months ago after
Israel's right-wing government endorsed building new Jewish
settlements in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. But both sides
have held direct meetings in recent days to try to revive them.
	   Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979 and since then has played a role in trying to
advance the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

Rain delays championship game of women's world softball
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUJINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ Torrential rain and lightning delayed
the championship game Thursday night between the United States and
Australia in the 9th Women's World Softball Championship.
	   The game was suspended after the Americans had gone ahead 1-0 on
Lisa Fernandez's home run in the top of the first inning.
	   Following a delay of almost four hours, the rain stopped and the
International Softball Federation decided to resume the game at
12:30 a.m. Friday (1530 GMT Thursday).
	   The U.S. team, a 2-1 loser to Australia Wednesday, rebounded and
won a place in the final by ousting host Japan 4-0 earlier
Thursday.
	   With the defeat, Japan took the bronze medal.
	   China already had placed fourth Wednesday with a 2-1 record in
the final round.
	   In another game Thursday for fifth place and a ticket to the
Sydney Olympics, Canada edged Italy 1-0.
	   The top four teams, excluding Olympic host Australia, qualify
for the 2002 games.
	   The United States, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, seeks its
fourth straight, and sixth overall, world championship.
	   Australia, the bronze medalist at Atlanta, is in contention for
its second world title. It won the inaugural world championship in
Melbourne in 1965.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A coal miners' union threatened Thursday that its
600,000 members would begin a civil disobedience campaign _
including blocking entrances to foreign embassies in Moscow _ if
force is used to disperse protesting miners in Russia's Far East.
	   Coal miners blocked a rail line on Sakhalin Island for a sixth
straight day Thursday, despite police threats to remove them by
force. The blockade by miners demanding back wages has prevented
more than 70 rail cars with 4,000 tons of coal from reaching a
power plant.
	   Sakhalin Vice Governor Ivan Malakhov has said he will not allow
the power station to shut down and will use any means necessary to
lift the blockade. Railway Minister Nikolai Aksenenko backed his
decision.
	   ``The measure is the right one,'' Aksenenko told a news
conference in Moscow. ``A bunch of 20 pickets cannot mock residents
of the whole island.''
	   The coal miners' trade union said if this happens, it will urge
its members to block railways and highways across the country.
	   Chairman Ivan Mokhnachuk said they would seal all routes leading
to crucial facilities throughout Moscow and block entrances to
foreign embassies in the capital, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The miners on Sakhalin say they will let through just enough
coal to keep the plant from switching off completely. Sakhalin is
not connected to Russia's national power grid, so much of the
island is dependent on the plant's operation for electricity.
	   Coal miners have staged periodic strikes and other protests
across Russia since May to demand overdue wages. However, the
protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not inflicted
significant damage on the economy.
	   On Thursday, miners in the northern Vorkuta region blocked their
acting director from leaving his office at Vorgashorskaya, Europe's
largest mine, until their overdue wages are paid, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   However, workers at the Partizansk mine in the Far East released
the mine director they had held in his office for two days.
	   A regional governor said he would introduce a special emergency
system of control over the Mayak nuclear waste processing plant in
the Ural Mountains if coal miners continue to block the
Trans-Siberian Railway.
	   The blockade is preventing coal from getting to the thermal
station that produces steam for Mayak, also known as
Chelyabinsk-65. A train carrying nuclear waste from Bulgaria also
cannot get through, Interfax said.

Poisonous mushrooms kill 8 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Poisonous mushrooms have killed eight Russians so
far this mushroom-picking season, the ITAR-Tass news agency said
Thursday.
	   It said that 173 people have been sickened by poisonous
mushrooms, including 43 children.
	   Epidemiologists say a family of five in the Perm region in the
Ural Mountains ate bad mushrooms and two of them, a grandmother and
granddaughter, died.
	   Mushroom-picking is a favorite summertime pastime for Russians.
Epidemiologists say many people mistake the poisonous toadstool
mushroom for edible varieties.

Foreign tourists killed in road accident in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KORKUTELI, Turkey (AP) _ Four foreigners were killed and 21
Russian tourists were injured Thursday when a tour bus crashed into
a truck near the resort of Antalya, officials said.
	   The dead included a German national and a Russian, said Ahmet
Gundogdu, deputy governor for Korkuteli. Officials were trying to
determine the nationality and identity of the other two dead.
	   Initial reports had identified the dead as Hungarian tourists.
	   Gundogdu said police were looking for the truck's driver who
fled the crash. Police believe the truck, carrying asphalt for road
construction, hit the oncoming bus while passing.
	   Antalya, one of Turkey's most popular Mediterranean resorts, is
725 kilometers (435 miles) southeast of Istanbul.

Youths abducted for Angola civil war, rights group claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement is
abducting Angolan youths in preparation for renewed civil war,
human rights groups charged Thursday.
	   UNITA also was targeting young women whom they exploit to cook
and carry munitions, according to Ngande Mwanajiti, executive
director of the Lusaka-based Inter-African Network for Human Rights
and Development.
	   UNITA, the former rebel movement, has killed hundreds of
civilians and police in attacks in recent months, the government
claims. UNITA alleges that police have tortured and murdered its
supporters.
	   The claims, which could not be independently verified, have
further delayed full implementation of the peace accord that ended
a two-decade civil war. The United Nations and European Union have
imposed sanctions on UNITA.
	   In a joint statement, Inter-African Network and New York-based
Human Rights Watch of New York said the targeted youths lived in
border towns of Cazombo and Lumbala Nguimbo, UNITA's stronghold, in
northeast Angola.
	   Mwanajiti said the abducted youths were as young as 13, but that
it was too early to give numbers.
	   ``We interviewed over 50 refugees who gave testimony (about)
numerous human rights abuses. People who live along the border
towns are running away because they are scared of being recruited
into the UNITA army,'' Mwanajiti said.
	   Abuses described by interviewed refugees also included rape and
summary execution, he said.
	   Alex Vines from Human Rights Watch said at a news conference
that there were allegations by Hutu refugees who had fled Angola to
Zambia that UNITA was forcibly integrating their compatriots who
remained behind into its forces.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A bomb blew up a car near the
presidential palace in Dushanbe on Thursday, seriously injuring the
deputy customs chief of the Central Asian country.
	   Ali Emomnadzarov and his driver were in the car parked 100
meters (yards) from the residence of President Emomali Rakhmonov
when the bomb exploded, the Tajik Interior Ministry said.
	   The driver was also seriously hurt, and five passers-by were
injured, the ministry said.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Tajikistan has been torn by violence since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. The government and mostly Islamic opposition formally
ended a five-year civil war last year, but sporadic clashes have

Moody's lowers outlook for Sumitomo Bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ratings lowered for two other banks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Thursday it has
lowered its rating outlook for Sumitomo Bank Ltd., one day after
the bank announced a tie-up with Daiwa Securities Co. in investment
banking.
	   The U.S. credit rating agency said it lowered its outlook for
Sumitomo's credit rating to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' It said
the tie-up was risky for Sumitomo because of ``Daiwa's very weak
financial condition.''
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. credit rating company Standard and Poor's
lowered its ratings for Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., citing expectations for further
loan losses.
	   Moody's also said it would continue to review Daiwa's ``Baa3''
rating for a possible downgrade. A cut would drop Daiwa's debt into
the ranks of ``speculative'' or ``junk'' investments.
	   Moody's did not change its ``A2'' rating on Sumitomo's deposits,
but the ``negative'' outlook means there is a greater chance the
agency will lower it sometime soon. A lower rating is associated
with higher risk and could force Sumitomo to pay higher interest
rates to attract depositors.
	   The decision followed the bank's announcement Wednesday that it
will put up 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.05 billion) to form joint
venture companies with Daiwa.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa said they will establish three joint venture
companies that will start operations next April.
	   The tie-up is the latest move in a continuing consolidation in
Japan's financial industry following a series of reforms, dubbed
the ``Big Bang,'' aimed at invigorating the economy by opening up
markets to greater competition.
	   But Moody's seemed to question the choice of Daiwa as a partner.
	   ``The transaction will significantly raise Sumitomo's total
exposure to Daiwa,'' Moody's said in a press release. The tie-up
``could expose Sumitomo to contingent risks,'' it added.
	   Moody's rates companies according to their ability to repay
their debts, assigning grades from ``Aaa'' for the strongest firms
to ``C'' for the riskiest ventures.
	   Sumitomo's ``A2'' rating on Sumitomo puts it in the middle of
the upper half of Moody's scale.
	   Standard and Poor's cut the long-term senior debt ratings of
Mitsubishi Trust and Sumitomo Trust to ``triple-B'' from
``single-A-minus.'' The new rating is two notches above
``speculative'' grade in S and P's scale.
	   ``Sumitomo Trust remains exposed to the emergence of additional
credit costs, both from the domestic and Asian markets,'' the
credit rating company said.
	   ``The bank's profitability and capitalization provide only
marginal coverage for its problem loans,'' the company added.
	   Sumitomo Trust's long-term rating remained under review for
another possible cut because of a planned merger with the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, which S and P called a ``significantly weaker
institution.''
	   Sumitomo Trust said last month it was negotiating a merger that
would amount to a bailout of the struggling LTCB.
	   S and P attributed the lower ratings for Mitsubishi Trust to its
``expectation of further large loan losses, stemming from
Mitsubishi Trust's heavy exposure to several fragile sectors of the
Japanese economy.''
	   Both banks' short-term ratings were also lowered to ``A-3'' from
``A-2.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Glaxo Wellcome PLC said Thursday its half-year
profits fell 21 percent to 827 million pounds (dlrs 1.36 billion),
mainly because it lost U.S. patents on two key medicines, but the
drugmaker encouraged investors with a bullish outlook for new
products.
	   Traders pushed Glaxo Wellcome up by 9 percent to 1,905 pence
(dlrs 31.24) per share by late afternoon on the London Stock

	   Glaxo Wellcome said its earnings for the six months ending June
30 compared with profits of 1.05 billion pounds in the same period
a year earlier.
	   Glaxo Wellcome attributed the big decline to last year's loss of
U.S. patents for two top-selling medicines, the ulcer drug Zantac
and the herpes medication Zovirax.

Nuclear fuel storage in Russia's north is unsafe, minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on foreign help in 5th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Stores of spent nuclear fuel from decommissioned
submarines in Russia's north are critically unsafe, Russia's deputy
atomic energy minister told reporters Thursday.
	   With more than 150 discharged submarines holding in excess of 80
metric tons (88 tons) of spent nuclear fuel in Russia's north, the
government does not have the estimated dlrs 1.5 billion necessary
to scrap the subs or improve radiation safety, Deputy Atomic Energy
Minister Nikolai Yegorov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia has agreed to dismantle 100 of its aging submarines by
2000, but the deadline is seen as wildly unrealistic, given the
country's financial problems.
	   Western countries have expressed growing concern about Russia's
nuclear waste disposal dilemma, and have agreed to give some
financial assistance.
	   Norway plans to contribute dlrs 30 million to shut down a
nuclear waste storage facility in the Murmansk region and to build
a railway that will help remove nuclear waste. Japan and the
Netherlands have offered dlrs 20 million and dlrs 3 million
respectively for unidentified projects, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   But the help is not enough to counterbalance the lack of funding
from the Russian government to construct long-term waste burial or
storage facilities.
	   Federal lawmakers have earmarked only dlrs 35 million for
various cleanup projects _ a fraction of the billions of dollars
needed to adequately clean up the mess, Interfax said.

 &UR; Steels wins 18th stage of Tour de France; new rider revolts
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with day's stage &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEUCHATEL, Switerland (AP) _ The Tour de France, depleted by a
rider revolt, limped back into action Thursday with Tom Steels of
Belgium winning the 18th leg ending in Switzerland.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   The sprint finish began with just a few kilometers to go.
	   But for most of the day, the cycling was overshadowed by the
riders' protests about an investigation into alleged drug abuse.
	   Earlier in the day, Spanish teams Kelme and Vitalcio angrily
quit the field, bringing to five the number of teams to have left
the race since it began.
	   The Tour's other three Spanish teams _ Banesto, ONCE and
Riso-Scotti _ all withdrew Wednesday. Festina was thrown out for
drug abuse on July 17.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
With Thursday's pullouts, the riders numbered 102, down from 116
the day before and from 189 at the start.
	   Despite the new pullouts, the 18th stage started on schedule
shortly after 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) in Aix-les-Bains, heading to
Neuchatel, 218 kilometers (135.5 miles) away.
	   Three days away from the Paris finish line, race organizers were
scrambling to calm the revolt over repeated police searches and
testing in the drug investigation, and said the Tour would
continue.
	   The latest teams to quit blamed the atmosphere around the Tour.
	   ``The riders were insulted in the climb to Revard by the Spanish
public,'' said Alvaro Pino, director of the Spanish team Kelme,
referring to one of the Alpine peaks in Wednesday's segment. ``We
received some threats.''
	   The team's Fernando Escartin was in fourth place in the overall
standings in the three-week race. Pino told reporters he would
resign as team chief at the end of the season.
	   ``Everybody needs to make their own decision. Those who decided
not to continue today were right, but those who are leaving the
race are also right,'' said former French champion Luc Leblanc,
with the Polti team, who pulled out Thursday.
	   The drug probe was pressing on. Shortly before midnight
Wednesday, police detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team,
the Francaise des Jeux team director Marc Madiot, and an unnamed
doctor, judicial sources said.
	   The detention of Massi, leader in the mountain climbing
standings, was the first time the probe blocked a rider from
competing.
	   Police said they also searched vehicles and hotel rooms
Wednesday night belonging to the teams Francaise des Jeux, la ONCE,
and Casino.
	   Police said Thursday that no illegal substances were found among
medication seized Tuesday by customs officers from the Bigmat team.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After starting out in Albertville and going through the motions
for the first hour or so, the pack slowed and stopped -- ironically
just past one of the sprint banners which usually has some of the
fastest action of the race.
	   After discussion, the pack restarted, only to stop again.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the Tour's director, assured the riders that
further police action would be carried out ``with a maximum of
dignity ... at the hotels of the concerned teams and not at police
stations.''
	   With that, the riders took off again only to please the public.
	   However the public had mixed emotions. Some shouted at the
riders and made angry gestures. Others cheered.
	   The riders ended the day's stage more than two and a half hours
behind schedule in Aix-les-Bains. Tour judge Joel Menard announced
that the stage was annulled.
	   The Tour has been plagued with doping allegations since its July
11 start in Dublin, Ireland.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the TVM team that's been under investigation. ``I have the
impression the Tour is finished. I'm sick.''
	   Laurent Jalabert, France's top rider and world champion, quit
Wednesday.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said on France Info radio.
	   Since 1903, the only things to have halted the world's most
prestigious cycling competition have been the two World Wars.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fifth Israeli soldier wounded, details

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) - Hezbollah guerrillas opened fire on
four Israeli outposts in southern Lebanon Thursday, wounding at
least five Israeli soldiers, security officials said.
	   Israeli helicopters evacuated the wounded to hospitals in
Israel, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. They said one of the soldier was seriously wounded.
	   The clashes began at 0300 p.m. (1200 GMT) and were intensifying
more than an hour later, the officials said.
	   The fighting began when guerrillas opened fire at positions of
the Israel army and Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia at
Sojod, Rihan, Bir Kallab, and Ghozlan inside the Israeli-occupied
security zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia said in a statement its
guerrillas attacked the posts, and also detonated bombs under an
Israeli Merkava tank. It gave no casualty figures.
	   The guerrillas are trying to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 allied militiamen from the security zone, which Israel
established in 1985 to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.

Milosevic promises end of Kosovo offensive
</HEADLINE>

shelling KLA stronghold Junik; DELETES outdated material; no

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic assured European diplomats Thursday he had halted a
government offensive in Kosovo which swept ethnic Albanian rebels
from strongholds and driven thousands of civilians from their
homes.
	   The diplomats -- representing the European Union -- also warned
Milosevic of serious consequences if government troops shell the
encircled Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold of Junik on the
southwestern border with Albania.
	   The diplomats -- from Britain, Germany and Austria -- said the
offensive which began Friday night had transformed wide areas of
Kosovo into a ``wasteland.''
	   ``Milosevic assured us that the military action has come to a
halt,'' Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan, who headed the three-member
EU delegation, told reporters after meeting Milosevic.
	   Rohan said the delegation specifically warned against shelling
Junik because large numbers of Albanian civilians had taken refuge
there before Serb police and army troops surrounded it.
	   ``We warned Milosevic that the shelling of Junik would entail
civilian casualties with serious consequences,'' Rohan said. ``he
assured us this is not the intention to shell this village.''
	   The EU delegation was the latest in a series of international
missions seeking to resolve the conflict in Kosovo, fearing it will
spill over into other Balkan areas with large Albanian-speaking
populations.
	   Europeans, especially the Germans, also fear a new wave of
refugees seeking asylum in their countries.
	   The EU mission also criticized the degree of force used by the
government in the offensive against the KLA.
	   ``The impression our mission got is quite a devastating one,''
said German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. ``What has been created is
literally a wasteland.''
	   Rohan said he got a ``clear impression of excessive use of
military force .... totally out of proportion with military
targets.''
	   Western diplomats claimed some progress in efforts to unite
Albanian factions for peace talks on the future of Kosovo, but said
the process has been slowed by Serb battlefield gains against
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Milosevic has agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled
out independence, as demanded by Albanian politicians and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``Milosevic for the first time indicated flexibility on how far
the self-government could go,'' Ischinger said. ``He didn't dispute
the fact that the time is running out.''
	   ``I've never seen him as concerned as today. He agrees with the
idea of a platform that includes all relevant elements of the
(Kosovo Albanian) side.''
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on composition of an
``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
	   Ischinger said he expected that the Albanians will form a joint
delegation in the next few days and that the negotiations with
Milosevic's government will start ``in a matter of weeks.''
	   ``We leave encouraged that a platform is developing,'' the
British member in the EU delegation, Emyr Jones Perry, said after
meeting Milosevic.
	   On Wednesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met for three
hours with Albanian politicians and KLA representatives in the
village of Likoc in the Drenica region. Hill made no statement
after the meeting and returned to Macedonia, where he serves as the
U.S. ambassador.
	   Western diplomats familiar with the negotiations said Hill's
meeting achieved some progress toward uniting the Albanians. They
refused to elaborate, but the fact that Hill returned to Macedonia
suggested the deal was far from complete.

Egyptian president urges Israel to stop pressuring Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinian &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israel is using the prolonged deadlock in
peace talks with the Palestinians to force them to make
concessions, President Hosni Mubarak said Thursday.
	   Mubarak said he was pessimistic for the first time since
Arab-Israeli negotiations began in earnest more than 20 years ago
with an overture to Israel by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
	   ``Procrastination and extremism cannot force people to give up
their rights,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by the official Middle
East News Agency. ``The Palestinian people will not accept any
aggression against their land.''
	   He warned that the failure of negotiations would have ``grave
and dangerous consequences'' on the region.
	   ``The situation is not satisfactory at all. I am not optimistic,
as I used to be,'' Mubarak said.
	   However, he said Arabs should not stop their contacts with
Israel or halt the peace talks.
	   ``The idea of political boycott is wrong because it allows
Israel to monopolize on the arena and this will increase the
imbalance in the region,'' he said.
	   Palestinian-Israeli negotiations broke down 16 months ago after
Israel's right-wing government endorsed building new Jewish
settlements in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. But both sides
have held direct meetings in recent days to try to revive them.
	   Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979 and since then has played a role in trying to
advance the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

Packers, Chiefs arrive in Japan for American Bowl

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Jet-lagged from more than 13 hours of flying in the
middle of a tiring training season, the Green Bay Packers and the
Kansas City Chiefs arrived in Tokyo Thursday for their first
exhibition game of the season.
	   ``It was a long flight. I haven't seen the night, the darkness,
for the past 16 hours, but I will be there'' for the American Bowl
game, said Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac as he walked through New
Tokyo International Airport.
	   The teams clash on Sunday Tokyo time, with a special treat for
fans here: two Japanese players who played in NFL Europe suiting up
for each team. They are the first players from Japan to participate
in NFL training camps.
	   Masafumi Kawaguchi, a linebacker for the Amsterdam Admirals, and
Tamon Nakamura, a fullback with the Rhein Fire, are on 10-day
contracts with the Packers. The Chiefs were assigned tight end
Nachi Abe and wide receiver Masato Itai, both of the Scottish
Claymores.
	   The two teams arrived on separate chartered flights and were
greeted by about 100 Japanese fans. But some of the player looked
exhausted after spending 13 to 15 hours in the air from the United
States.
	   Still, Packers coach Mike Holmgren said he is looking forward to
the game, while Packers quarterback Brett Favre said ``it'll be
fun'' to beat the Chiefs.
	   This isn't the first time Japanese players have been featured in
an NFL game in Tokyo. The 1996 contest included three players who
practiced with the teams for only a day before the game. Holmgren
said before leaving Green Bay that the Japanese players would see
some action in special teams and maybe some offense and defense.
	   This is the ninth in a series of NFL preseason games in Japan,
going back to 1989. The league also has arranged games in eight
other cities outside the United States since the first one was held
in London back in 1986.
	   This is the first overseas trip in the 80-year history of the
Packers. The Chiefs have participated in the American Bowl three
times in the past.
	   Holmgren and Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer plan to play
their starters for up to a quarter. Holmgren decided not to bring
six injured players, including wide receiver Robert Brooks,
sidelined by a broken right pinkie.
	   The Packers and Chiefs will practice against each other Friday.
	   Former Packers now trying to take Kansas City to the Super Bowl
include linebacker Wayne Simmons, wide receiver Andre Rison,
running back James Bostic, defensive lineman Darius Holland and
cornerbacks Matt Dorsett and Bucky Brooks.
	   After their arrival, the Packers had a two-hour bus ride to the
New Otani Hotel in Tokyo before a team meeting.

Government admits raiding newspaper offices in Malawi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Military and police officials Thursday
admitted a newspaper office here was raided by vengeful troops and
that suspected opposition churchmen have been interrogated by
police.
	   Gen. Joseph Chimbayo said investigations into an attack in
January on the Blantyre offices of the Daily Times had confirmed it
was perpetrated by junior ranking officers angered by an article on
the high incidence of AIDS in the armed forces.
	   Chimbayo, whose chief, Defense Minister Joseph Kubwalo, had
previously denied any army involvement in the attack, insisted
senior ranks were not involved.
	   ``The soldiers were wrong. It was unfortunate you were harassed
and property damaged,'' said Chimbayo. Journalists were assaulted
and equipment smashed.
	   The attack was condemned by human rights groups and
international media organizations as a threat to free expression in
the former British colony, which in 1994 had its first democratic
elections after 30 years' dictatorship by ``life president''
Hastings Banda.
	   Police in Lilongwe Thursday confirmed they had interrogated
members of the Nkhoma synod of the Presbyterian Church of Central
Africa, a denomination with widespread membership in the country. A
recent pastoral letter urged voters to support ``a Christian
candidate'' at next year's general elections.
	   President Bakili Mukluzi, who ousted Banda, is a Muslim.
	   Following allegations Muluzi planned to ``Islamicize'' Malawi
using Middle Eastern funding, he warned the opposition not to use
religion or the churches for political capital.
	   Nkhoma, central Malawi, is a Presbyterian center established by
Scottish missionaries led by explorer David Livingstone more than
100 years ago.

Turkish Parliament approves early elections date
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Deputies on Thursday overwhelmingly
approved April 18 as the date for elections a year ahead of
schedule.
	   The elections were called at the urging of a social democrat
party, which has been supporting the minority government of Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Politics here have been tumultuous since 1995 elections brought
the pro-Islamic Welfare Party to party.
	   A Welfare-led government angered the military, which forced it
to resign last year. Welfare was later shut down by the
constitutional court.
	   Welfare's successor, the Virtue Party, is considered a
front-runner in opinon polls.
	   Political analysts have predicted that early elections would not
bring any stability to Turkish politics if the mainstream parties
remain divided.

Screening fetal bump may help detect Down syndrome earlier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED for release until 2301 GMT; time set by source

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Measuring the bump at the back of the neck of a
young fetus could help doctors detect earlier and more accurately
whether the fetus is carrying Down syndrome, a study published
Friday says.
	   Scientists believe that swelling under the skin at the back of
the neck of the fetus at 10 to 14 weeks' gestation is associated
with increased risk of Down syndrome and other birth defects.
	   Researchers at the Fetal Medicine Foundation in London say they
used ultrasound to measure such swellings in 96,127 British women,
and were able to predict Down syndrome sucessfully in 82 percent of
cases.
	   The study was published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal.
	   Researchers said the risk of Down syndrome was high _ estimated
at 1 in 300 or more _ in 268 of the 326 pregnancies that were
subsequently confirmed to be accompanied by the chromosome
disorder. The women had an average age of 31.
	   ``Assessment of risk of chromosomal defects in the first rather
than the second trimester provides the option of earlier invasive
diagnostic testing; consequently, termination of an affected
pregnancy may be less traumatic for couples who choose this
option,'' the researchers wrote.
	   Women not considered to be at high risk, such as those under 35,
are routinely given blood tests for Down syndrome. Older women
often have amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling _ invasive
tests that give much more definitive answers.
	   In the younger childbearing years, the risk of Down syndrome is
1 in 2,000 births. For women over 40, the risk is 1 in every 40
births.
	   The researchers said amniocentesis, where a needle is used to
draw a sample of amniotic fluid from around the baby, identifies
about 30 percent of fetuses with Down syndrome in women aged 37 or
over.
	   Screening women who are at high risk because of their age and
blood chemistry during the middle period of pregnancy ``gives a
better detection rate at 60 percent,'' they said.
	   Dr. James Haddow of the Foundation for Blood Research in
Scarborough, Maine, said the new technique ``can be an effective
screening technique when applied under expert management in
centralized settings, and it represents an important advance.''
	   But writing in The Lancet, he said similar studies in the United
States and Finland yielded ``considerably lower detection rates''
than the 82 percent claimed in this study.
	   The British researchers' figures indicate a detection rate of
something like 60 percent, Haddow said.
	   He said the study takes no account of how often the ultrasound
measurements could not be successfully completed _ as high as 17
percent in one recent U.S. study.

FIFA, UEFA threaten to ban Super League clubs, players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It doesn't even exist yet. But the prospect of a
breakaway Super League looms so large over European soccer that
FIFA is already warning players and clubs who take part they'll be
kicked out of the game.
	   The British media is convinced the league will be set up within
two years, backed by pay-per-view TV and persuasive commercial
giants such as Italian TV magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
	   According to the papers, established UEFA-backed competitions
and domestic leagues will be powerless to stop clubs such as Inter
and AC Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich,
Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool from joining the Super
League by the year 2000.
	   While speculation abounds amid reports of secret meetings, the
clubs are saying nothing. Only those against the concept are making
any noise about it.
	   FIFA, soccer's world governing body, has warned that anyone who
takes part in defiance of UEFA will be banned from playing at any
other level of the game, from domestic leagues to the World Cup.
	   ``If this league were to be run or led by elements outside the
football community of UEFA or the national associations, or without
their backing, we would not permit it,'' said FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper.
	   ``If a league were set up in defiance of UEFA it would lead to
the suspension of the clubs concerned and their players.
	   ``Any players would be banned from playing any kind of
professional football, including international matches, until the
suspension were lifted. That's the barrier they have to cross.''
	   UEFA, which stands to lose the most in terms of prestige, issued
a statement Thursday saying that the feedback it had received from
the individual national associations indicated the clubs weren't
interested in the Super League.
	   ``UEFA takes it for granted that the clubs in question will not
make any commitment to any such private party which would
jeopardize their future participation in national and international
competitions,'' the statement read.
	   The idea of a Super League has been talked about in secret for
some time.
	   According to the tabloid Daily Mail, meetings took place at the
London offices of a firm of lawyers as recently as last week
between club owners and legal representatives of Super League
backers.
	   The meetings were in such secrecy that security staff made sure
that the floors above and below the rooms were off limits to staff
and documents relating to the discussions were shredded.
	   Several press reports suggest Berlusconi, owner of AC Milan and
a former Italian Premier, is the leading mover behind the Super
League. His TV companies likely would profit hugely from pulling
Europe's biggest clubs into one star-studded competition.
	   Critics say that such a league would make the rich clubs even
richer while the vast majority which don't play in the Super League
would lose TV revenue and prestige. They would also be competing
for UEFA competitions which wouldn't have the gloss of big-name
involvement.
	   Because Super League speculation has been around for more than a
decade, UEFA has taken steps to strengthen its own competitions to
keep them more attractive to the big clubs.
	   It created a league system within the Champions Cup so that the
leading eight clubs go automatically into the last 24 and play in
groups before reverting to the knockout formula from the
quarterfinal onwards.
	   UEFA has even changed the group format from six groups of four
to four groups of six next season so that the clubs will gain
higher revenue from more games.

Kluivert on brink of signing with Manchester United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Man U confirmation

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Dutch World Cup striker Patrick
Kluivert is on the brink of signing with Premier League giant
Manchester United.
	   Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards confirmed Thursday
that AC Milan had accepted an offer, worth a reported 9 million
pounds (dlrs 14.8 million), for the 22-year-old forward.
	   Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is desperate to lure a
top striker before the start of the season and Kluivert _ who is
expected to complete the deal after thrashing out personal terms on
his return from holiday _ is a near certainty.
	   Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani said he was happy with the
Manchester United bid for Kluivert.
	   Kluivert started the World Cup with a red card against Belgium
before scoring goals against Argentina and Brazil in the
Netherlands' remaining matches.
	   Edwards said the signing of Kluivert did not mean Manchester
United would give up on trying to lure Dwight Yorke from Aston
Villa.
	   Aston Villa, which values Yorke at 16 million pounds (dlrs 26.3
million), has already rejected Manchester United's 8 million pound
(dlrs 13.15 million) offer for the Trinidad and Tobago striker.

Croat minor killed elderly Serb couple in formerly Serb-held area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A Croat youth who killed an elderly Serb
couple in a formerly Serb-held area of Croatia was apprehended and
will be charged, police said Thursday.
	   Police caught the youth, identified only as M.K., hours after
they learned of the killings. Because he is under 21, his case will
be handled by the minors district court in Osijek, 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Zagreb. His exact age was not released.
	   On Tuesday, M.K. rode his bicycle to the house of an
unidentified 62-year-old Serb man and his 51-year-old wife in
Topolje village in Eastern Slavonia, armed with two bombs and a
knife.
	   He broke into the house, stabbed the woman with the knife,
injuring her and causing her to flee. After fatally stabbing the
husband, the youth chased down the wife and killed her with an axe.
	   The following day, neighbors noticed the couple was missing and
called the police, who found the youth with traces of blood on his
clothes and other evidence linking him to the incident.
	   M.K. told police that he had a ``certain animosity towards
Serbs,'' because his mother was reportedly maltreated by Serbs in
the village of Topolje in Eastern Slavonia, said Milan Baricevic,
head of the Osijek police.
	   The region of Eastern Slavonia, seized by rebel Serbs in 1991,
reverted to Croatian control last January.
	   Thousands of Serbs have left the area since then, some fearing
that they would be exposed to random vengeance from Croats, who are
returning after being expelled by Serbs in 1991.
	   The confrontations of former neighbors-turned-foes has so far
caused dozens of incidents, though murders have been rare.

Germans blast Czech leader for remarks on ethnic German group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Thursday
criticized as unacceptable Czech premier Milos Zeman's comparison
of ethnic Germans expelled after the war from then-Czechoslovakia
to right-wing extremists and communists.
	   Kinkel's comments came at a meeting with Czech Foreign Minister
Jan Kavan in Berlin, where Kavan rejected demands from Bavarian
politicians that Zeman apologize for his remarks.
	   Most of the 2.5 million ethnic Germans forced out of the Sudeten
area of then-Czechoslovakia after World War II resettled in
Bavaria.
	   The dispute arose when Zeman rejected including Sudeten Germans
as board members of a German-Czech fund that is to compensate them
for property lost through their expulsion.
	   Zeman said allowing the Sudeten Germans to take part in those
talks would be like nominating radical rightists or communists to
the board.
	   The Sudeten Germans are a powerful political lobby and forced
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government into negotiations over their
role.
	   Germany and the Czech Republic reached agreement on a so-called
``Fund for the Future'' in January to compensate Czech victims of
the Nazis and exiled Germans from former Czechoslovakia.
	   The German government is paying 140 million (dlrs 78 million)
into the fund and the Czechs 440 million koruna (dlrs 13 million).
	   Three of the five German fund executives nominated for the
managing board are Sudeten Germans. They are Herbert Werner, a
former member of parliament born in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in
1941; the head of the Bavarian state parliament, Johann Boehm, and
a moderate Sudeten leader, Volkmar Gabert.
	   Kinkel said that Zeman must clear up the current situation,
because the two foreign ministers could not. He said the
German-Czech resolution on the fund set the guidelines on relations
between the two countries.
	   But he reassured his Czech counterpart that Germany does not
intend to burden the Czech Republic's entry into the European Union
with ``stirred-up animosities from the past.''

Keizo Obuchi defeats opposition candidate, declared Japan's new
</HEADLINE>
prime minister &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS throughout with fresh quotes, details; CHANGES

 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Putting down a challenge from a more popular
opposition leader, ruling party favorite Keizo Obuchi rolled to
victory in the race for prime minister in Parliament on Thursday,
taking power in a country grappling with political divisions and a
souring economy.
	   The new government moved quickly to win voters' confidence and
reassure worried markets, vowing decisive action and announcing an
``economic reform Cabinet'' with a party economics expert as
finance minister, a key position in plans to power Japan out of
recession.
	   ``We have to always remind ourselves what we have to do to
regain the public's trust,'' said Hiromu Nonaka, the new top
government spokesman. ``I accepted my post in an effort to make up
for the mistakes we've made.''
	   But Obuchi, 61, takes office with a weak mandate. He succeeds
party colleague Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced to resign after a
painful electoral defeat, and emerged as the Liberal Democratic
Party nominee last week only after a bruising battle with party
reformists.
	   Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled lower house Thursday,
winning 268 votes of the 497 ballots cast. But the
opposition-dominated upper house chose Democratic Party leader
Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   The opposition cried that Obuchi's victory did not reflect the
will of the people and called for immediate general elections to
elect a new Parliament. The opposition triumphed in July 12
elections for the upper house and figure a quick vote for the other
chamber would yield similar results.
	   Kan predicted the new government would not be successful.
	   ``I don't think they'll be able to come up with aggressive
measures without having the support of the people,'' he told
reporters.
	   Despite the problems, former Foreign Minister Obuchi was
ebullient. He smiled in satisfaction during the Parliament vote and
bowed when the lower house results were announced. He then made the
rounds for traditional greetings at the offices of political
parties, and presented his Cabinet before Emperor Akihito. He was
not expected to speak to reporters until Friday.
	   The new prime minister, however, is considered by many to be too
entrenched in the conservative ways of the LDP _ which has held the
premiership for 40 of the past 43 years _ to take the bold,
innovative steps needed to solve the structural flaws of the
Japanese economy.
	   Obuchi worked hard over the past week to turn that image around,
heavily lobbying former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the
finance minister's job. Miyazawa, 87, is respected as an economics
expert and is an architect of the government's plan to bail out its
debt-laden banking system.
	   Though it is uncertain if Miyazawa, a lont-time party
powerbroker, would deliver any bold initiatives, talk that he would
be chosen buoyed markets. Tokyo stocks slumped on Monday, the first
session after Obuchi's selection as LDP leader, but then rallied
later in the week as Miyazawa emerged as the choice for finance.
	   On Thursday, Miyazawa, who served as prime minister from 1991 to
1993, vowed action.
	   ``We must get our work done as quickly as possible within the
limited amount of time we are given,'' he told reporters.
	   The economy is in bad need of quick remedies. The New York Times
on Thursday reported that U.S. officials and private financial
experts estimate Japanese banks suffer from nearly dlrs 1 trillion
in bad loans _ almost twice the official number. Japanese officials
had no immediate reaction to the report, which was based on
accounts of unidentified sources, though some analysts have
suspected for years that the bad debts could approach such a
figure.
	   Obuchi has already proposed what many economists say are needed:
tax cuts and spending. He plans to cut income taxes by 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption. Also on the agenda is a clean up of the
troubled banking sector.
	   Despite talk of revolt in his own party, the LDP showed unity
Thursday in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi, a party maverick who challenged Obuchi for the LDP
presidency, called for support for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   There were few surprises in the new Cabinet lineup, which was
chosen from among party veterans.
	   Two that stood out, however, were Taichi Sakaiya, a writer and
former bureaucrat, who was named director-general of the Economic
Planning Agency, and the Cabinet's only woman, Seiko Noda, named as
post and telecommunications minister. The 37-year-old is the
youngest Cabinet minister in Japanese history.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A brawl erupted in the assembly hall of
Kenya's parliament when legislators narrowly defeated a bill that
would have allowed lawmakers to carry guns, media reports said
Thursday.
	   Fistfights broke out Wednesday when opposition legislators began
shouting at two of their colleagues, who had helped the government
defeat the bill in a 78-77 show of hands, according to the Daily
Nation newspaper.
	   Government officials and legislators, including the minister of
development, leaped across the benches and began throwing punches
in an apparent attempt to protect their opposition allies, the
report said.
	   The bill proposed that all legislators be granted gun licenses,
diplomatic passports and armed security, the newspaper said.
	   At least five opposition legislators were beat up before during
the 10 minute-fracas before order was restored in the chamber.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A four-member delegation from the U.N.
International Commission of Inquiry for Rwanda has held talks with
Zambia's foreign and defense ministers.
	   The delegation, led by commission Chairman Mahmoud Kassem,
discussed possible violations of the U.N. arms embargo against
Rwanda by unnamed foreign entities and governments, the official
Zambia News Agency said.
	   The agency said Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebel movement in Angola
was suspected of supplying arms to Hutu rebels fighting to topple
the Rwandan government, presently dominated by Tutsis.
	   Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita told the Commission
Zambia would do everything in its power to assist their
investigation since it was essential to identify the root cause of
instability in Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   The 1994 genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda left at
least 800,000 people dead.
	   -----
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba has denied
reports he may amend the constitutional ban on a third five-year
term in office in order to run again in 2001.
	   ``He has not campaigned for a third term and has no intention of
doing so,'' said a statement issued Wednesday by Chiluba's special
assistant for press and public relations, Richard Sakala.
	   After ousting Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia's first democratic
elections in 1991, Chiluba's ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy amended the constitution to prevent a repeat of Kaunda's
27 year grip on power.
	   Sakala accused Kaunda's opposition United National Independence
Party and other current opposition groups of seeking to mislead
Zambians by spreading rumours Chiluba, a former union leader,
intended to try to retain power beyond the 10-year limit.
	   -----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Some 245,000 victims of flood and
drought in Mozambique will need emergency food aid in August
despite an expected 10 percent rise in cereal production this year,
the U.N. World Food Program said.
	   The extra aid is needed to sustain them until the September
harvest.
	   Recent flooding along the Zambezi River damaged crops in central
provinces, and drought has affected people in the south.
	   -----
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) _ The Brazzaville regional office of the
World Health Organization, which was moved to Zimbabwe because of
Congo's civil war last year, is returning to this battle-battered
city.
	   ``We're coming back soon,'' said Dr. Ebrahim Malick Samba, an
official of the U.N. organization. He said 230 foreign employees
and about that many local people would staff the office. The office
was moved to Harare, Zimbabwe, when war broke out.
	   Brazzaville was devastated during the five-month civil war last
year in which up to 10,000 people were killed. Fighting ended in
October. Some dlrs 2 million in damage was done just to the
organization's offices. Samba said he was confident the Congolese
government would repair the damage.
	   Samba said he had few fears about setting up again in
Brazzaville.
	   Security ``is better than Johannesburg, New York and Washington,
where they have tragedies every few minutes.''
	   -----
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ The United States has relieved Cameroon
of half its bilateral debt, which was due within the next three
years, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
	   The remainder of Cameroon's debt to the United States will be
rescheduled over the next 25 years, the embassy said.
	   ``A total of dlrs 10.4 million of debt owed to the Export-Import
Bank, plus the debt owed the U.S. Department of Defense will be
rescheduled under this agreement,'' according to the statement.
	   The total debt was not disclosed.
	   The agreement follows a broader pact signed last year between
Cameroon and the Paris Club of creditor nations.
	   -----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Prisons minister Sipo Mzimela has
resigned following a dispute over his belief in closer ties between
the ruling African National Congress and his Inkatha Freedom Party,
President Nelson Mandela's office said on Thursday.
	   He is replaced by Inkatha's Ben Skosana, leader of the Zulu
nationalist party's parliamentary caucus.
	   Mzimela had earned strong criticism from Inkatha leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi for his call for possible merger talks between
the ANC and Inkatha.
	   In January Inkatha's national council adopted a formal vote of
no confidence in Mzimela, and earlier this month the party
dismissed him as national deputy chairman.
	   Though the ANC won 1994's all-race elections that ended
apartheid, it entered into a government of national unity with
several other political parties to guide South Africa's transition
to democracy after decades of racist white rule.
	   Inkatha has stayed in the government, keeping several
ministerial posts, while the former ruling National Party left in
1996 to join the opposition.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An independent think tank has prepared a
444-page book on public and economic policies it believes Kenya
should adopt to move beyond what the editors call ``the most
difficult period in Kenya's independent history.''
	   ``Our Problems, Our Solutions: An Economic and Public Policy
Agenda for Kenya,'' will be launched Aug. 6 by the Institute of
Economic Affairs, Chairman James Karuga told a briefing Thursday.
	   The book consists of 36 papers on topics ranging from the need
for a land policy to problems in the health sector and enhancing
productivity. The contributors, considered by editors Robert Shaw
and Wayumu Gatheru to be experts in their fields, are not
identified ``so as not to compromise them,'' Shaw said.
	   Shaw acknowledged that there are some ``untouchable subjects''
that have been broached in the book, particularly land ownership,
corruption and the operation of government.
	   ``It is almost like government is a state secret, and what we've
tried to do is unravel it,'' he said.

More rains threaten flood ravaged China

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with color in graf 2, comments from Red Cross field
worker in final two grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Millions of people kept vigil over sodden Yangtze
River embankments threatened with collapse, and forecasts Thursday
warned of further heavy rains in flood-ravaged areas of China.
	   State television showed farmers waist deep in the river locking
arms as a human breakwater to protect fragile earthen dikes from
the surging waters. Teams of volunteers dived into the muddy river
to plug holes below the surface before they could undermine the
dikes.
	   Health authorities, meanwhile, called for vigilance against
outbreaks of disease in flooded areas. Agricultural experts were
sent to some of the worst-hit provinces to help farmers get back on
their feet as soon as possible, the official newspaper China Daily
said.
	   The Ministry of Civil Affairs' tally of people killed in this
year's floods rose to 1,261 as reports of further devastation came
in from Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi _ the three provinces hardest hit
as floodwaters on the Yangtze reached levels unseen in more than
four decades.
	   Houses were flooded up to their eaves in Hubei. In all, more
than 1 million homes were reported destroyed in the three provinces
and total losses were estimated at 39.7 billion yuan (dlrs 4.78
billion).
	   A flood crest, the second-largest on the Yangtze since flooding
in 1954 killed more than 30,000 people, reached Jiangxi's Jiujiang
city Thursday morning, raising the river's level to a record 22.95
meters (75.7 feet), some 3.45 meters (11.4 feet) above the danger
line, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Jiujiang's Flood Control Headquarters said 3 million people had
been sent to guard levees protecting the city.
	   One million soldiers and civilians also were working night and
day to shore up a 143-kilometer (88-mile) stretch of levees in the
neighboring province of Anhui, the China Daily said.
	   In all, millions of people were guarding hundreds of kilometers
(miles) of dikes, watching for leaks that could cause water-soaked
levees to collapse, the newspaper said.
	   Nor did an end seem in sight.
	   Wen Kegang, director of the State Meteorology Bureau, said heavy
rains were expected in flooded areas in coming days, the China
Daily reported. Xinhua said heavy rainstorms were expected in
Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.
	   Sixty percent of Hunan has been flooded, with 15 million people
_ a quarter of the population _ affected and 200 people killed,
said Wilson Wong of the Hong Kong Red Cross.
	   Chinese authorities have requested medicines to treat flu,
intestinal and skin diseases, Wong said. A Red Cross team touring
Hubei province also reported seeing skin and eye maladies, but no
sign of diseases like cholera.
	   Water purification facilities, medicine and food will be bought
with U.S. dlrs 663,000 in donations collected by the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the China Daily
said.
	   While no outbreaks of disease have been reported, the Ministry
of Health has asked medical workers to stay at their posts, the
China Daily said. It said around 100,000 medical workers have been
sent to flooded areas.
	   Flooded-out families sheltering in plastic covered lean-tos on
the top of dikes may have to wait another month to return home,
said Sharilyn Amy, a Red Cross worker.
	   ``We need to gear up for the long haul to maintain the level of
support and stave off epidemics,'' Amy said from Wuhan, a city of 7
million people in Hubei province, where the flood crest passed
Wednesday.

	   NEUCHATEL, Switerland (AP) _ The Tour de France, depleted by a
rider revolt, limped back into action Thursday with Tom Steels of
Belgium winning the 18th leg ending in Switzerland.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   Overall, the result meant Italy's Marco Pantani retained the
yellow jersey. Bobby Julich, of the United States, held second
place, and Germany's Jan Ullrich was third.

Milosevic promises end of Kosovo offensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; adds quote on EU warning about shelling KLA
stronghold Junik; DELETES outdated material; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic assured European diplomats Thursday he was halting a
government offensive in Kosovo that had swept ethnic Albanian
rebels from strongholds and drove thousands of civilians from their
homes.
	   The diplomats, representing the European Union, also warned
Milosevic of serious consequences if government troops shell the
encircled Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold of Junik on the
southwestern border with Albania.
	   The three diplomats said the offensive which began Friday night
had transformed wide areas of Kosovo into a ``wasteland.''
	   ``Milosevic assured us that the military action has come to a
halt,'' Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan, who headed the delegation,
told reporters after meeting Milosevic.
	   Rohan said the delegation specifically warned against shelling
Junik because large numbers of Albanian civilians had taken refuge
there before Serb police and army troops surrounded it.
	   The EU delegation was the latest in a series of international
missions seeking to resolve the conflict in Kosovo, fearing it will
spill over into other Balkan areas with large Albanian-speaking
populations.
	   Europeans, especially the Germans, also fear a new wave of
refugees seeking asylum in their countries.
	   The EU mission also criticized the degree of force used by the
government in the offensive against the KLA.
	   ``The impression our mission got is quite a devastating one,''
said German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. ``What has been created is
literally a wasteland.''
	   Rohan said he got a ``clear impression of excessive use of
military force .... totally out of proportion with military
targets.''
	   Western diplomats claimed some progress in efforts to unite
Albanian factions for peace talks on the future of Kosovo, but said
the process has been slowed by Serb battlefield gains against
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Milosevic has agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled
out the independence demanded by Albanian politicians and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``Milosevic for the first time indicated flexibility on how far
the self-government could go,'' Ischinger said. ``He didn't dispute
the fact that the time is running out.''
	   ``I've never seen him as concerned as today. He agrees with the
idea of a platform that includes all relevant elements of the
(Kosovo Albanian) side.''
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on composition of an
``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
	   Ischinger said he expected that the Albanians will form a joint
delegation in the next few days and that the negotiations with
Milosevic's government will start ``in a matter of weeks.''
	   ``We leave encouraged that a platform is developing,'' the
British member in the EU delegation, Emyr Jones Perry, said after
meeting Milosevic.

Red Cross welcomes entry into force of blinding laser weapons ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Red Cross on Thursday welcomed
the entry into force of a landmark agreement banning the use in war
of blinding laser weapons.
	   ``This new norm is a tremendous achievement,'' Cornelio
Sommaruga, president of the International Committee of the Red
Cross. ``Many soldiers and innocent civilians will be spared
horrible suffering.''
	   The international protocol which came into force Thursday means
the laser weapons can be added to the list of arms prohibited under
international humanitarian law, the ICRC said.
	   It bans the use and transfer of any laser weapon specifically
designed to cause permanent blindness.
	   The ICRC says it's the first time since 1868, when exploding
bullets were banned, that a weapon has been outlawed before
actually being used on the battlefield.
	   Both the United States and Britain are expected eventually to
join the list of countries who have ratified the protocol, which
forms part of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Conventional Weapons.
	   However, a U.N. conference in Rome in early July, which drafted
a treaty on a world criminal court, decided to abandon proposals
which would declare the use of blinding lasers, nuclear weapons and
anti-personnel mines to be war crimes.

EU welcomes signing of ceasefire in Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Thursday welcomed
the signing of a ceasefire between the government of the West
African nation of Guinea-Bissau and the leaders of a breakaway
military faction.
	   In a statement, the EU urged both sides to abide scrupulously''
by the agreement and ``commit themselves constructively'' to talks
toward reconciliation and lasting peace in the former Portuguese
colony.
	   On Sunday, the government and the self-proclaimed Junta Militar
in Guinea-Bissau agreed to a ceasefire to end their seven-week old
conflict, which has displaced some 200,000 people _ about one-fifth
of the population.
	   The pact was signed after three days of talks under the auspices
of a group made up of the Portuguese-speaking nations of Angola,
Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome e Principe.
	   The conflict erupted June 7 when a breakaway military faction
launched a coup by occupying the capital's main military garrison
and the international airport.
	   The EU said it is ready to provide humanitarian aid to the
displaced people. It said it was also prepared to ``participate in
the efforts required for the social and economic rehabilitation''
of Guinea-Bissau.
	   The EU statement said that 10 countries from Eastern Europe,
Cyprus, as well as Iceland and Norway, backed the EU's call for a
lasting peace in the small African country.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Greek and Turkish soldiers traded fire at
a border crossing this week, but no injuries were reported.
	   Turkish officials said Thursday that Greek soldiers opened fire
in the direction of the Turkish border, sparking retaliation by the
Turks.
	   The Greek general army staff countered the report saying a
Turkish border patrol began firing in the direction of Greek
soldiers, who returned the shots.
	   The shooting incident occurred Tuesday evening at the Meric
River, called Evros in Greek. The river separates the two
countries.
	   A Turkish foreign ministry statement said Greek soldiers
verbally abused Turkish border guards before firing their weapons.
	   ``We invite Greek border authorities to take all necessary
precautions to prevent the reoccurrence of such acts which can lead
to unexpected, dangerous results,'' the statement said.
	   The two neighbors are at odds over a variety of issues,
including disputes on territorial waters and airspace, seabed
mineral rights and the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
	   The two have come to the brink of war several times over the
past years.

Singapore searches for the cleanest lavatory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's environment ministry isn't just
concerned with air pollution, infectious disease and littering. It
also wants to make that potentially horrific visit to the public
toilet a more pleasant experience.
	   And it already had good news on the opening day Thursday of this
year's Clean Public Toilets Campaign.
	   In a recent inspection, the ministry said, a record number of
public lavatories _ 122 _ had received an excellent rating.
	   The total number of public toilets in Singapore and previous
years' findings were not immediately available.
	   The annual campaign is aimed at encouraging more sanitary
practices in public toilets, such as flushing after use and keeping
the toilet dry.
	   There are fines in Singapore for not flushing a public toilet
after using it, though in practice few are ever caught or punished
for this common transgression.
	   As in past years, the monthlong public awareness event includes
a contest for the cleanest toilet, and Singaporeans were encouraged
to call the ministry on a special hot line to vote.
	   The government is also exploring improved designs for public
toilets, hoping that this too will facilitate more sanitary
practices.
	   The government is fond of such drives to instill approved values
and behavior among its 3.1 million citizens.
	   Publicity campaigns over the years have focused on saving water,
the evils of drugs, speaking Mandarin instead of Chinese dialects,
being more punctual, more courteous, and exercising more, to name
but a few.

Five Israeli soldiers wounded in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fifth Israeli soldier wounded, details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas opened fire
Thursday on four Israeli outposts in southern Lebanon, wounding at
least five Israeli soldiers, security officials said.
	   Israeli helicopters evacuated the wounded to hospitals in
Israel, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. They said one of the soldier was seriously wounded.
	   The clashes began at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) and were intensifying
more than an hour later, the officials said.
	   The fighting began when guerrillas opened fire at positions of
the Israel army and Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia
inside the Israeli-occupied security zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia said in a statement its
guerrillas attacked the posts, and also detonated bombs under an
Israeli Merkava tank. It gave no casualty figures.
	   The guerrillas are trying to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 allied militiamen from the security zone, which Israel
established in 1985 to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.

While dismantling communism, China publishes book praising Marx
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has published a book reaffirming Marxism's
central role even as it carries out its most extensive dismantling
yet of its communist social system.
	   The book, ``Marxism in China Over the Past 100 Years,'' is the
most systematic look ever at the subject, the official Xinhua News
Agency quoted editorial adviser Ding Shouhe saying Thursday.
	   The massive work was written by a team of scholars from across
China, Xinhua said.
	   Its publication comes as China pushes an ambitious campaign to
privatize formerly protected state enterprises or let them go bust,
in the process taking a knife to the old system of cradle-to-grave
welfare.
	   Concepts as anathema to Marxism as purchasing real estate and
buying private cars are being promoted to keep the economy growing.
	   But even as it moves toward a market economy, President Jiang
Zemin's authoritarian government continues to define itself by the
founding philosophy of Mao Tse-tung's revolution.
	   ``The theory ... is the guiding ideology of the state and the
Communist Party of China, which is the largest communist
organization in the world,'' Xinhua said.
	   ``The book illustrates the validity of the truths of Marxism,''
it said.
	   Carl Marx's political philosophy has enjoyed a resurgence of
popularity in China on the 150th anniversary of the publication of
his Communist Manifesto, the agency said.
	   ``Celebrations will abound throughout the country'' to mark the
anniversary, it said.

<SLUG> Ashes of anti-Apartheid hero Huddleston returned to South Africa </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The ashes of a founder of the
anti-apartheid movement, Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, arrived
Friday in South Africa.
	   Huddleston, 84, who died April 20 in Mirfield, England, had said
he wanted his ashes to be interred at Christ the King Church in
Sophiatown, a section of Johannesburg emptied of blacks by South
Africa's apartheid regime.
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo accompanied Huddleston's ashes on a
plane from London, where the prelate had been honored with a
service at Westminster Abbey.
	   ``And so this great giant among our people, this South African
patriot, came back today,'' Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said at a
ceremony at Christ the King.
	   Huddleston headed Anglican missions in Sophiatown and Orlando,
near the city, in the 1940s and 1950s.
	   He protested the removal of black people from Sophiatown under
the apartheid law of separate racial residential areas. Residents
were moved to an open piece of land to the west of Johannesburg,
which later became the Soweto township.
	   His outspoken opposition to the racial policies of the
government led to his expulsion in 1956.
	   Huddleston returned to South Africa in 1995, but he left a few
months later, saying he could do more good in Britain by trying to
persuade people to invest in South Africa.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German tourist hurled himself to his death
from a Cairo tower after reportedly telling a friend that he
expected to be resurrected, police said Thursday.
	   Adam Gotz, 34, a student of ancient Egyptian history, jumped
from the observation deck of the 613-feet (185-meter) Cairo Tower
late Tuesday night, a police official said.
	   Gotz was trying to demonstrate to a friend, Sarah Klimer, his
Pharaonic belief that the dead are resurrected, the official said
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Officials at the German Embassy in Cairo said the suicide was
carried out ``for unknown reasons.''
	   A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry in Bonn said Gotz
was from the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.

EU holds talks with Togo on June elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Senior EU officials held talks Thursday
with a Togolese delegation headed by Prime Minister Kwassi Klutse
to determine whether the electoral process in presidential polls
last month was flawed.
	   ``The EU side requested these consultations because it considers
that the election process of 21 June was not completed, that
therefore the election result appears to be incorrect,'' the EU
said in a statement.
	   In the June 21 elections, President Gnassigbe Eyadema won his
second term. Eyadema has ruled the country since a bloody coup 31
years ago and won his first term in 1993 after 26 years as a
dictator.
	   Several days of protests and riots followed Eyadema's declared
victory in the polls in which vote-counting was interrupted and the
chief electoral officer resigned. The European Union and United
States criticized the polls.
	   The EU noted in its statement that the elections had been
followed by several teams of observers, who reported that the
election procedure had been ``seriously flawed.''
	   Thursday's talks meanwhile were held in an ``open and
constructive atmosphere,'' the EU said.
	   It said it would examine explanations offered by the Togolese
delegation, which ``differ considerably from the assessment of the
EU observers' mission,'' before deciding whether to pursue talks at
a later date.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Screams, panic and flames rose in a
crowded slum Thursday after a Pakistan air force plane slammed into
a row of homes. At least six people on the ground were killed,
three of them children.
	   Another 25 people were injured, most with serious burns. The
pilot ejected to safety after first trying to guide his plane to a
less-populated area, the air force said.
	   The plane exploded on impact as it rammed into a house,
destroying it completely. The flames quickly spread through the
Karachi neighborhood of small, one-story dwellings, damaging more
than a dozen houses.
	   Witnesses said local residents were the first to attempt rescue,
dragging a number of victims from the fire as people screamed in
panic.
	   Dozens of fire trucks and ambulances converged on the scene.
Paramilitary rangers and army personnel cordoned off the area to
prevent the people from hindering the rescue operation. Hundreds of
residents rushed home from work, anxious about relatives.
	   The six dead were pulled from the houses, their bodies burned
beyond recognition. The afternoon crash came at a time of the day
when mostly women and children were at home.
	   The air force said the Chinese built F-7P fighter, which was on
a training flight, developed serious engine trouble while returning
to base nearby and hit the ground in the western Orangi district of
Karachi, the port city that is Pakistan's financial hub.
	   ``The pilot of the aircraft tried to steer it as far away from
the populated area as the circumstances allowed him. When all
efforts to save the aircraft failed ... the pilot ejected out of
the aircraft,'' the air force said in a statement.
	   Witness Latifur Rehman said he first saw the plane in flames,
flying very low.
	   ``Within seconds it plunged into the houses,'' Rehman said.
	   Earlier Thursday in neighboring India, a commercial propeller
aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from the southern city of
Cochin. All six persons on board were killed, Indian news agencies
reported.

Two rich German states challenge revenue-sharing agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Two of Germany's richest states
challenged an arrangement in constitutional court Thursday that
requires rich states to transfer billions of marks (dollars) per
year to poorer states.
	   The revenue-sharing formula, devised in keeping with the
constitution's requirement that states work toward economic parity,
was last updated in 1995 and runs through 2004.
	   Conservative, industry-rich Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg want
to change the formula now to cut their burden roughly in half.
Bavaria paid out 5.7 billion marks (dlrs 3.2 billion) last year,
and Baden-Wuerttemberg 6.9 billion (dlrs 3.8 billion).
	   The two states, led by Bavarian governor Edmund Stoiber, argue
the formula places too large a burden on their state coffers and
amounts to a disincentive for their economic development.
	   After unsuccessfully seeking to update the 1995 agreement
negotiated among the 16 states, the rich states decided to take the
issue before Germany's Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, the
nation's highest court.
	   A decision was not expected before next year.
	   The Social Democratic Party, the main opposition in both states,
said the constitutional challenge amounted to an attack on
Germany's eastern states, still struggling in their transition from
communism to capitalism.
	   Hamburg Mayor Ortwin Runde called it an affront to German
solidarity.

	   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Indian shells fired across the
troubled Kashmiri border killed six Pakistani civilians and four
soldiers Thursday, military sources said.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity in Muzaffarabd,
the regional capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, said another
20 people were injured as Indian artillery pounded Pakistan army
positions and civilian areas along the border.
	   The civilian victims included a six-year-old girl, the private
NNI news agency reported, quoting unnamed military sources.
	   Witnesses said villagers took shelter in ravines in the
mountainous area, and the thud of exploding shells could be heard
40 kilometers (25 miles) away.
	   There was no immediate comment from India. Firing between
Pakistani and Indian troops is routine in this disputed region, but
Pakistani officials say incidents have escalated during recent
months.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir, a former
princely state in the shadows of the Himalayas now divided between
the two countries.
	   New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming Muslim militants in
Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan denies the charge, saying it
offers only political and moral support.
	   Kashmir was believed to be the central issue in closed-door
talks Thursday in Sri Lanka between top Indian and Pakistani
foreign officials. The talks broke a yearlong stalemate in attempts
to normalize relations between the two countries, a goal made more
urgent by their tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May.

Parliament rejects 16 people Museveni named in cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda's no-party parliament on Thursday
rejected a list of 16 names President Yoweri Museveni had submitted
in a cabinet reshuffle, including that of his only brother, Maj.
Gen. Salim Saleh.
	   Sources close to the parliamentary committee that sat in a
closed-door session to review the list said among the reasons given
for throwing out the entire list was the need to limit government
expenditure and the lack of regional representation.
	   On Wednesday Museveni presented the list of two new ministers
for unspecified cabinet posts and 14 junior ministers or ministers
of state, enlarging the cabinet to include 19 full ministers and 43
junior ministers.
	   Saleh was named to one of the ministerial posts. He is currently
serving as ``overseer'' of the Defense Department.
	   Under Ugandan law, president appointees to the cabinet must be
approved by parliament in closed session before the new names are
made public.
	   Museveni made the list public Wednesday.
	   ``Rejecting the list was like a return to sender situation; it
was good,'' said Norbert Mao, a legislator from northern Gulu
District who opposes Museveni.
	   It was the first time parliament had rejected a list of cabinet
changes since 1966.
	   When Museveni assumed power in 1986 after a five-year bush war,
he decided that political parties only exaceerbated tribal conflict
in the East African nation, so party politicking was banned.
	   But Museveni, who was elected president in 1996, created a
national political organization called the National Resistance
Movement to which every Ugandan theoretically belongs.
	   Candidates for parliament run as individuals without party
identification.
	   Critics of the 16-name ministerial list said it was heavily
weighted in favor of Museveni's home district in southwestern
Uganda. Only one candidate was from the north and three from the
east.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Chinese gymnast paralyzed in the Goodwill
Games is moving to a state-of-the-art New York rehabilitation
center Thursday, and hopes to walk again some day.
	   At a Long Island hospital on Wednesday, Sang Lan dreamed of
seeing the movie ``Titanic'' _ and meeting actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
	   China's 1997 national vault champion ``is fascinated with
American pop culture,'' says Shelley Lotenberg, spokeswoman for the
Nassau County Medical Center. ``She told us she wanted to meet with
Leonardo.''
	   If DiCaprio can't make it, Celine Dion and the Spice Girls also
are high on the 17-year-old's wish list.
	   On Wednesday, Sang was being treated in a pediatric intensive
care unit at the Nassau County Medical Center. On a wall near her
bed hung a bulletin board adorned with DiCaprio's picture and cards
from hundreds of well-wishers.
	   She was to be transferred Thursday to Mount Sinai Rehabilitation
Institute in Manhattan, a where she will begin a full
rehabilitation schedule, the Goodwill Games said in a statement.
	   ``Mount Sinai is one of the few model spinal cord injury centers
in the United States. Sang Lan's family and the Chinese delegation
have chosen one of the truly best centers available for the next
phase of her treatment,'' the statement said.
	   Sang broke her neck last week during a Goodwill Games warmup
vault at the Nassau Coliseum and underwent surgery Saturday. She
has no sensation from the chest down, and doctors say she might
never walk again. Her toes have moved, but her doctors discounted
it as an involuntary twitch.
	   Still, ``I am so happy. I feel no more pain in my neck,'' she
told a Chinese reporter Tuesday. She's also inquiring about how her
fellow gymnasts are doing in the games.
	   She was disappointed when told the movie ``Titanic'' wasn't yet
available on video. Paramount Pictures rushed to the rescue,
sending a studio copy that is to be delivered Thursday.
	   DiCaprio's Los Angeles publicist, Cindy Guagenti, said she told
him of Sang's wish and he was deciding exactly how to respond.
	   ``He was very sad'' about Sang's injury and ``felt he had to do
something,'' Guagenti told the New York Post. ``We're trying to
arrange something.''
	   Lotenberg said later Wednesday that the hospital had been
contacted ``about a possible arrangement for a visit by DiCaprio.''
	   Just in case the 23-year-old movie star were to appear, the
diminutive athlete has learned a few words of English: ``Hi, how
are you?''
	   Kim Jakwerth, Ms. Dion's Los Angeles publicist, said she had
left a message at the singer's home in Florida and was waiting to
hear from her. A representative for the Spice Girls could not reach
them immediately.
	   Sang was also honored by her country's leaders. On Tuesday, one
of China's vice premiers, Qian Qichen, made a stopover in New York
to see her on his way home from a Caribbean trip. He was joined in
Sang's hospital room by China's ambassador to the United States,
its vice minister of foreign affairs and the Chinese consul general
in New York.
	   Earlier in the week, Sang received a visit from former football
player Dennis Byrd of the Jets, who overcame paralysis suffered six
years ago when he collided with a teammate.
	   Sang is being treated with SYGEN, the same nerve-building drug
that helped Byrd recover.

Nuns shot to death in Yemen buried in southern port city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns from Mother Teresa's order who
were shot to death by a gunman as they left a clinic for the
disabled were buried Thursday in Yemen, officials said.
	   The women, one from the Philippines and two from India, were
buried in the southern port of Aden in a ceremony attended by
senior Yemeni officials, diplomats and Sister Nirmala, who
succeeded Mother Teresa as leader of the Missionaries of Charity.
	   The funeral, held under tight security, lasted two hours.
	   The nuns were wearing the order's traditional blue-bordered
saris at the time of the attack Monday in the Red Sea city of
Hodeida, (220 kilomters) 140 miles west of the capital, San`a.
	   Police arrested a suspect, Abdullah al-Nashri, 25, whom they
described as ``unstable.'' They said he had was a patient at the
clinic for physical and mental disabilities where the nuns worked.
	   Al-Nashri fought in Afghanistan and Bosnia, police said. He was
married to a Bosnian woman and has two children.
	   Police are still looking for at least two more suspects,
although al-Nashri has told police that he acted alone.
	   A military plane brought the bodies of the nuns from Hodeida to
Aden on Thursday. The order asked that the women be buried in
Yemen, said officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. Aden, once under British colonial rule, has a Christian
cemetery.
	   The Missionaries of Charity, which is based in Calcutta, India,
has operated clinics in Yemen since 1970.
	   The order has four branches in the country's main cities, with a
total of 25 workers. They help an estimated 450 physically and
mentally disabled people.
	   The attack marked the first against its nuns in Yemen.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with
rivals. None of the kidnapped foreigners have been harmed.

Media watchdog is to end Bosnia's broadcasting chaos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The United States and the
European Union have set up a media watchdog to put an end to
widespread broadcasting chaos and help the divided Balkan nation
shed wartime enmities.
	   As of August 1, the Independent Media Commission will start its
work of creating free, professional and independent media in
Bosnia, its leaders say.
	   ``We are the good guys,'' said Krister Thelin, the commission's
Swedish director outlining the panel's activities.
	   He and his staff will have the daunting task of defusing what
was one of the most dangerous weapons of nationalists before,
during and after the Bosnian war.
	   The media situation in Bosnia has become increasingly chaotic.
The number of broadcasters has grown by leaps and bounds, some of
them have jammed each others, while still others have rebroadcast
Croatian or Serbian programs reflecting the view of foreign
governments.
	   Nationalist propaganda played a key role in turning neighbor
against neighbor and ultimately mobilized armies to fight each
other in the Balkan theater.
	   In postwar Bosnia, media have to be lifted above the political
arena and help bring Bosnia closer to Europe.
	   ``The general belief throughout all communities is that media
play an important, if not vital role, in the implementation of the
peace process,'' Thelin said.
	   His commission, jointly financed by the United States and the
European Union, was established in June by a decision of the top
international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp. But it will be
independent and ``answerable to no one,'' its director said.
	   The mandate of foreigners in the commission expires after three
years when local experts are to take over.
	   ``We're in business to go out of business,'' said Robert
Gillette, the deputy director and head of licensing media in
Bosnia.
	   To be successful, the body has been given a wide mandate of
licensing media, monitoring their work and preventing media who
ignore set rules from working.
	   ``We are entrusted with authority ranging from warnings and
requesting apologies to terminating licensing and closing
stations,'' Thelin said. In an extreme situation, the commission
can seek assistance from the NATO-led peace force on the ground.
	   Nobody seems to know the number of broadcasters in the country.
According to Thelin, they range from 268 to 370.
	   The commission will try to locate them and make them operate by
generally accepted, free, western democratic standards.
	   Since June, no new licenses have been issued, and those media
operating before will have to reapply.

Russian finance chief happy, more taxpayers paying up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More Russian taxpayers are paying their bills and
filling up the government's empty coffers, the country's finance
minister reported with satisfaction Thursday.
	   Mikhail Zadornov said tax collection improved in July over June,
and predicted the trend would continue.
	   He refused to give specifics, but the Interfax news agency said
tax revenues in July were expected to total 12 billion rubles (dlrs
1.9 billion), up 7.1 percent from June.
	   The government's inability to collect taxes is one of the
fundamental problems plaguing the Russian economy.
	   Russians have no history of paying taxes, as all salaries were
paid by the state in the Soviet era, and only a small percentage of
workers comply. Most of the country's biggest companies, including
the largest, gas monopoly Gazprom, are also tax deadbeats.
	   Improved tax collection was a condition set down by the
International Monetary Fund before approving its portion of a dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package.
	   ``In June, the collections were better than in May, and in July
they were better again,'' Zadornov said at a news conference. ``I
expect this tendency to continue in August.''
	   The government appointed former Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov
as chief tax collector in May and he has threatened to to seize the
assets of companies that owe the government.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko ordered Fyodorov not to act on
that threat yet, in the hopes an agreement can be reached with
companies such as Gazprom. The government says Gazprom owes 12
billion rubles (dlrs 1.9 billion) in unpaid taxes, but Gazprom says
it is owed 13 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion) by various government
agencies.
	   Zadornov also said the government will not borrow on financial
markets until the end of October, and said the government will sell
its stakes in a number of large companies before the end of the
year.
	   That includes a 25-percent stake in the telecommunications
holding company Svyazinvest, as well as stakes in Gazprom and the
oil holding company Lukoil.
	   Analysts say the government could raise as much as dlrs 2
billion from the sales.
	   Both the Russian stock market and ruble closed higher Thursday
after Kiriyenko met with foreign investors to explain government
efforts to stabilize the economy.
	   Despite lingering speculation that the government may not be
able to avoid devaluing the ruble, a senior Central Bank official
reiterated that the bank will continue to support the currency.
	   ``The central ban's position is that we don't consider
devaluation an instrument of economic policy,'' said Sergei
Alexashenko, first deputy chairman of the bank. ``It would bring
about more damage than benefits.''

Cycling doping procedures under review in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The doping scandal surrounding the Tour de France
has prompted the UK Sports Council to join with the British Cycling
Federation to review domestic anti-doping procedures in the sport.
	   UK Sports Council chairman David Chesterton said the reputation
of the sport internationally had been tarnished by drugs
allegations during the Tour de France.
	   The widespread use of performance enhancing drugs, particularly
Erythropoietin (EPO), among professional cyclists was exposed
before the Tour de France started when a medical staff member of
the Festina team was caught by customs officials with banned
performance enhancing drugs in his car.
	   The controversy has marred the Tour _ the Festina team was
subsequently banned, five other teams have pulled out and cyclists
have protested by stopping during two separate stages.
	   French police have also detained several people involved in the
event and ransacked the luggage of competing cyclists during drug
raids.
	   Chesterton said the review aimed to restore public confidence in
the sport in Britain by examining the adequacy of the current
anti-doping program.
	   ``While we have a doping program respected the world over, we
must not be complacent,'' he said.
	   British Cycling Federation president Brian Cookson said he had
been ``appalled and dismayed'' by drug revelations during the Tour
de France.
	   ``I don't believe that there is a significant problem on the
home scene but I am anxious to ensure that British cycling is drug
free,'' he said.
	   No British cyclist is competing on the tour since Chris Boardman
crashed out while wearing the leader's yellow jersey during the
second stage near Cork, Ireland, on July 13.
	   Graeme Obree _ a two-time world record holder in the one-hour
event _ said Wednesday he was cut from a team before the 1995 Tour
de France for refusing to take performance enhancing drugs.
	   The Scottish cyclist, who said the sport had a ``culture of the
needle,'' has never been invited back to compete in the Tour.

Gdansk shipyard appeals court decision on its sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The bankrupt Gdansk shipyard said Thursday
it has filed an appeal against a court ruling to sell it to a
consortium including another Polish shipyard.
	   The court ruled last week the shipyard could be sold to a
consortium of the Gdynia shipyard and Evip Progress consulting
firm, rejecting the Gdansk board's offer to negotiate a settlement
with the shipyard's creditors.
	   The court said the Gdansk board failed to prove it could pay off
the shipyard's debts of 628 million zloty (dlrs 182 million) and
said Gdynia's offer was ``the most profitable and credible.''
	   The ruling drew criticism from the governing Solidarity-led bloc
in parliament, with six parliamentary deputies defecting in protest
of government's failure to bail out Gdansk.
	   The consortium does not have money to buy the shipyard and will
borrow funds using the yard's assets as security. If it fails to
pay back, the shipyard will become property of a bank, perhaps a
foreign one, said Zbigniew Sulatycki from the bloc opposing the
sale.
	   But Gdynia shipyard chairman Janusz Szlanta says the yard ``has
sufficient potential to meet that challenge'' and all credits will
be secured on Gdynia's assets.
	   Both shipyards have ``a chance to build one of the biggest
shipyard holdings in Europe with a billion dollars in sales within
a few years,'' said Szlanta.
	   The Gdansk shipyard was the birthplace of Poland's Solidarity
trade union in the early 1980s, which many credit with the eventual
overthrow of communism.
	   Szlanta also said the Gdynia understands the historical
significance of the Gdansk yard and will look for ways to ``link
memory about history with running a competitive company.''
	   Even if the court scraps the ruling, the bankruptcy judge can
refuse his permission for a settlement, Judge Dariusz Kardas said.
	   The Gdynia consortium reportedly would pay dlrs 29 million for
the Gdansk operation and has pledged to spend dlrs 80-100 million
through 2010 to modernize the shipyard and boost the work force
from the current 2,000 to as many as 3,500.

Customs confiscate fake Adidas, Nike sportswear headed for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Airport officials intercepted cargoes
containing 10 tons (11 tons avoirdupois) of fake sportswear headed
for Russia, customs officers said Thursday.
	   The clothes, with fake Adidas and Nike logos, were found in two
Aeroflot cargo planes that arrived from South Korea earlier this
week, said Risto Sirola, director of Helsinki Airport Customs.
	   The contraband goods were intercepted while being loaded into
trucks from the aircraft.
	   ``There's been a big increase in pirated goods headed for Russia
via Finland in recent years,'' Sirola said. ``I suppose we'll just
have to destroy these like previous similar consignments.''
	   Last year, customs officers confiscated more than 130,000
bootleg compact discs which were being smuggled to Russia.
	   Finnair, which unloads cargoes in Helsinki, said it will
temporarily stop handling the consignments of dozens of Russian
aircraft arriving from South Korea.

Hun Sen wins king's backing to ease instability with coalition
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Continuing to pressure the opposition
to accept him as the election winner, Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
claimed Thursday to have won the blessing of the country's
influential king for his plan to form a coalition government.
	   But leaders of the two main opposition parties said it was too
early to discuss a coalition, which would include their groups,
while they were still disputing the results of Sunday's election.
	   Hun Sen traveled to the northwestern town of Siem Reap, where
King Norodom Sihanouk keeps a palace, to try to consolidate his
apparent election victory. He presented a coalition plan under
which he still would hold all the important levers of power.
	   ``The king is pleased with the idea,'' Hun Sen said at a news
conference. ``It will create cooperation in the National Assembly
and the government, giving a favorable atmosphere for national
reconstruction.''
	   Though Sihanouk is largely a figurehead, his popularity among
many Cambodians and high international profile make his blessing a
vital step for Hun Sen to win back international legitimacy and aid
lost last year when he staged a coup against his co-premier, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
	   In Phnom Penh, Ranariddh, the king's son, said his opposition
FUNCINPEC party was demanding a recount of some ballots, and ``as
long as we have not yet received the results we cannot say anything
about the coalition.''
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, the second largest opposition group, said,
``The only question to be considered now is whether the campaign,
polling and ballot-counting have led to a democratic result or
not.''
	   The two parties had issued a statement Tuesday saying they could
not accept the election results until their allegations of fraud
had been thoroughly investigated by national and international
observers.
	   They said that they were prepared to boycott the National
Assembly unless they were satisfied that they had not been cheated
in Sunday's polls.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any business.
	   Hun Sen countered Wednesday by saying he could lower the
constitutional minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a
government from two-thirds to 50 percent plus one. He also said his
current government could remain in power.
	   Meanwhile, opposition activists have been fleeing from the
provinces to the capital in fear of revenge attacks by police and
local authorities loyal to Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party.
	   With the election over, they feel a lack of international
scrutiny makes them easy targets. Even in the pre-election period,
violence, including murder, was widespread against opposition
activists.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, the top United Nations human rights envoy to
Cambodia, said the international community wanted it stopped.
	   ``It's very important that the political leadership make very
clear they will take a strong stance against attempts to settle
scores,'' said Hammarberg.
	   Western election observers, most of whom have already packed up
and left, have downplayed the problem.
	   The Associated Press found scores of scared FUNCINPEC and Sam
Rainsy Party members taking refuge at the Phnom Penh headquarters
of their parties.
	   Under Hun Sen's proposal, his Cambodian People's Party would
retain control of the key ministries _ the security portfolios of
interior and defense, finance, justice and foreign affairs. Sharing
other ministries would be discussed after final results come in.
	   The action signaled that Hun Sen _ relaxed and confident despite
an emergency appendectomy two weeks ago _ realizes he cannot ignore
the opposition but intends to keep all real power.
	   Hun Sen said officials of his party have already discussed the
idea with FUNCINPEC
	   Full official results are not expected from the Hun Sen-packed
National Election Committee before Sunday.
	   The top independent monitoring group, the Committee for Free and
Fair Elections in Cambodia, said its figures showed that with 90
percent of the ballots counted, Hun Sen's CPP looked set to get 59
of the 122 National Assembly seats, FUNCINPEC 45 and the Sam Rainsy
Party 18.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Hun Sen, who
came to power in 1985 under the Vietnamese occupation that followed
the Khmer Rouge, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war. He deposed Ranariddh last year
in two days of fighting in the capital.

Small quake rattles Athens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A small earthquake shook Athens on
Thursday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or
damage.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.1, occurred at
6:30 p.m. (1530 GMT) in the area of Avlona, 35 kilometers (22
miles) north of the capital, the Athens Geodynamic Institute said.
	   The quake was felt throughout the wider Athens area.
	   A quake of moment magnitude 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally
felt by people. A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage.
	   Magnitude 5 can produce moderate damage. Magnitude 6 causes
severe damage under a populate area, while a magnitude seven
indicates a major earthquake capable of widespread, heavy damage.

EU holds talks with Togo on questioned elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Concerned that Togo's president did not
fairly win last month's presidential ballot, senior EU officials
held talks Thursday with a Togolese delegation to determine whether
the electoral process was flawed.
	   President Gnassigbe Eyadema, who has ruled Togo for 31 years,
won the June 21 ballot. He ruled as a dictator for 26 years, after
taking power in a bloody coup, and was elected to his first term in
1993.
	   Days of protests and riots followed Eyadema's declaration of
victory. The European Union and United States criticized the polls
in which vote-counting was interrupted and the chief electoral
officer resigned.
	   ``The EU side requested these consultations because it considers
that the election process of 21 June was not completed, that
therefore the election result appears to be incorrect,'' the EU
said in a statement.
	   The EU noted in its statement that several teams of election
observers reported that the election procedure was ``seriously
flawed.''
	   It said it would examine explanations offered by the Togolese
delegation, which ``differ considerably from the assessment of the
EU observers' mission,'' before deciding whether to pursue further
talks.
	   The Togolese delegation was headed by Prime Minister Kwassi
Klutse.

Albania warns Yugoslavia to stop border provocations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Albania warned the Yugoslav government
Thursday to immediately stop all cross-border provocations, foreign
ministry officials said.
	   ``There is no chance that such provocations will intimidate us
... worse, if they are part of a plan to extend the conflict even
in our territory, they will be met with a decisive reaction from
our armed forces and the Albanian people,'' the Albanian Foreign
Ministry said in a note handed in to the Yugoslav representative in
Tirana.
	   The move comes after several reports that Yugoslav troops
allegedly fired across the border into Albania and exploded
grenades on Albanian territory.
	   Yugoslaiva, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, has been fighting
to quash the violent independence movement of ethnic Albanians in
the southern Serbian province of Kosovo and accuses Albanian of
encouraging and harboring rebels within its borders.
	   Late Monday, two missiles exploded 50 meters (yards) inside the
Albanian territory in the border village of Padesh. No injuries
were reported.

Panel says Amsterdam's twin stars must play on for Ajax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Arbitrators sided with Dutch club
Ajax against Frank and Ronald de Boer on Thursday, ruling the twins
must honor their contracts and end their efforts to gain a release
to pursue more lucrative offers.
	   The Royal Dutch Soccer Association (KNVB) arbitration commission
declared the players have no legal right to seek release from their
contracts, which run through the 2003-2004 season.
	   The deals, signed in March 1997, also contain a clause
stipulating that the twins cannot seek a transfer before 2001.
	   Arbitrators said they could see ``no pressing reasons'' why the
De Boers should be allowed out of their contracts, and ordered the
brothers to report to training as usual on Monday.
	   In a brief press release, Ajax said the De Boers had
acknowledged they would abide by the decision ``and that their
football careers with Ajax will continue.''
	   The decision by the three-member panel, which is definitive and
legally binding, ended a long-running fight by the 28-year-old De
Boers to break free of Ajax and play abroad, likely increasing
their salary.
	   Frank de Boer, a defender, and Ronald de Boer, a forward, were
key members of the Dutch national squad that reached the semifinals
of the World Cup. They have also been crucial to Ajax's trophy
filled success in recent years.
	   A delegation from FC Barcelona attended a hearing this week, and
Dutch media reported that the Spanish powerhouse was willing to pay
dlrs 22 million to acquire both of them. Arch-rival Real Madrid
also was reportedly interested in the pair.
	   English league champion Arsenal made a dlrs 15 million bid for
Ronald de Boer last month, but Ajax rejected it as ``out of the
question.''
	   The De Boers took their case to the arbitration commission after
direct negotiations with the club failed.

Nuns shot to death in Yemen buried in southern port city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns from Mother Teresa's order who
were shot to death by a gunman as they left a clinic for the
disabled were buried Thursday in Yemen, officials said.
	   The women, one from the Philippines and two from India, were
buried in the southern port of Aden in a ceremony attended by
senior Yemeni officials, diplomats and Sister Nirmala, who
succeeded Mother Teresa as leader of the Missionaries of Charity.
	   The funeral, held under tight security, lasted two hours.
	   The nuns were wearing the order's traditional blue-bordered
saris at the time of the attack Monday in the Red Sea city of
Hodeida, 220 kilometers (140 miles) west of the capital, San`a.
	   Police arrested a suspect, Abdullah al-Nashri, 25, whom they
described as ``unstable.'' They said he had was a patient at the
clinic for physical and mental disabilities where the nuns worked.
	   Al-Nashri fought in Afghanistan and Bosnia, police said. He was
married to a Bosnian woman and has two children.
	   Police are still looking for at least two more suspects,
although al-Nashri has told police that he acted alone.
	   A military plane brought the bodies of the nuns from Hodeida to
Aden on Thursday. The order asked that the women be buried in
Yemen, said officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. Aden, once under British colonial rule, has a Christian
cemetery.
	   The Missionaries of Charity, based in Calcutta, India, has
operated clinics in Yemen since 1970.
	   The order has four branches in the country's main cities, with a
total of 25 workers. They help an estimated 450 physically and
mentally disabled people.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Putting down a challenge from a more popular
opposition leader, ruling party favorite Keizo Obuchi rolled to
victory in the race for prime minister in Parliament on Thursday,
taking power in a country grappling with political divisions and a
souring economy.
	   The new government moved quickly to win voters' confidence and
reassure worried markets, vowing decisive action and announcing an
``economic reform Cabinet'' with a party economics expert as
finance minister, a key position in plans to power Japan out of
recession.
	   ``We have to always remind ourselves what we have to do to
regain the public's trust,'' said Hiromu Nonaka, the new top
government spokesman. ``I accepted my post in an effort to make up
for the mistakes we've made.''
	   But Obuchi, 61, takes office with a weak mandate. He succeeds
party colleague Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced to resign after a
painful electoral defeat, and emerged as the Liberal Democratic
Party nominee last week only after a bruising battle with party
reformists.
	   Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled lower house Thursday,
winning 268 votes of the 497 ballots cast. But the
opposition-dominated upper house chose Democratic Party leader
Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   The opposition cried that Obuchi's victory did not reflect the
will of the people and called for immediate general elections to
elect a new Parliament. The opposition triumphed in July 12
elections for the upper house and figure a quick vote for the other
chamber would yield similar results.
	   Kan predicted the new government would not be successful.
	   ``I don't think they'll be able to come up with aggressive
measures without having the support of the people,'' he told
reporters.
	   Despite the problems, former Foreign Minister Obuchi was
ebullient. He smiled in satisfaction during the Parliament vote and
bowed when the lower house results were announced. He then made the
rounds for traditional greetings at the offices of political
parties, and presented his Cabinet before Emperor Akihito. He was
not expected to speak to reporters until Friday.
	   The new prime minister, however, is considered by many to be too
entrenched in the conservative ways of the LDP _ which has held the
premiership for 40 of the past 43 years _ to take the bold,
innovative steps needed to solve the structural flaws of the
Japanese economy.
	   Obuchi worked hard over the past week to turn that image around,
heavily lobbying former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the
finance minister's job. Miyazawa, 78, is respected as an economics
expert and is an architect of the government's plan to bail out its
debt-laden banking system.
	   Though it is uncertain if Miyazawa, a long-time party
powerbroker, would deliver any bold initiatives, talk that he would
be chosen buoyed markets. Tokyo stocks slumped on Monday, the first
session after Obuchi's selection as LDP leader, but then rallied
later in the week as Miyazawa emerged as the choice for finance.
	   On Thursday, Miyazawa, who served as prime minister from 1991 to
1993, vowed action.
	   ``We must get our work done as quickly as possible within the
limited amount of time we are given,'' he told reporters.
	   The economy is in bad need of quick remedies. The New York Times
on Thursday reported that U.S. officials and private financial
experts estimate Japanese banks suffer from nearly dlrs 1 trillion
in bad loans _ almost twice the official number. Japanese officials
had no immediate reaction to the report, which was based on
accounts of unidentified sources, though some analysts have
suspected for years that the bad debts could approach such a
figure.
	   Obuchi has already proposed what many economists say are needed:
tax cuts and spending. He plans to cut income taxes by 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption. Also on the agenda is a clean up of the
troubled banking sector.
	   Despite talk of revolt in his own party, the LDP showed unity
Thursday in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi, a party maverick who challenged Obuchi for the LDP
presidency, called for support for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   There were few surprises in the new Cabinet lineup, which was
chosen from among party veterans.
	   Two that stood out, however, were Taichi Sakaiya, a writer and
former bureaucrat, who was named director-general of the Economic
Planning Agency, and the Cabinet's only woman, Seiko Noda, named as
post and telecommunications minister. The 37-year-old is the
youngest Cabinet minister in Japanese history.

Ex-minister found guilty of dirty war kidnapping reiterates
</HEADLINE>
innocence &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ As the conviction of 12 former government
and police officials for dirty war activities continued to
reverberate through Spanish political circles Thursday, a former
cabinet minister sentenced in the case reiterated his innocence and
vowed to fight the verdict.
	   ``We have been convicted without proof,'' Jose Luis Barrionuevo
told some 200 journalists and supporters waiting for him outside
the Supreme Court in central Madrid where he went to collect
official notice of the verdict.
	   ``We have averted suffering, violence, intolerance and attacks
on many people and once again we must say that our actions were in
line with constitutional principles,'' he said.
	   The court said Wednesday it had found Barrionuevo and 11 others
guilty of the 1983 kidnapping French businessman Segundo Marey who
had been mistaken for a hitman from the Basque separatist group
ETA.
	   Marey's abduction was the first action attributed to the
so-called GAL death squad that killed 27 people between 1983 and
1987 in its pursuit of ETA members and sympathizers. Many of its
victims, like Marey, turned out to be mistaken targets.
	   The verdict came as a major blow to former premier Felipe
Gonzalez who has long denied allegations that his governments set
up and ran the GAL. The scandal and other controversies contributed
greatly to his Socialist party's defeat in elections in 1996 after
nearly 14 years in office.
	   ``We will fight this with everything judicial procedures afford
us,'' said Barrionuevo, who added that he would not ask for a
government pardon as nothing he had done while responsible for
internal security between 1982 and 1988 _ the period of the dirty
war _ needed to be pardoned.
	   In its first official reaction, Socialist party leader Joaquin
Almunia said they ``respected the verdict but totally disagreed
with it as there was no proof against Barrionuevo.''
	   Almunia intimated the party would not seek revenge against its
political opponents by saying the organization believed the best
thing for Spain to do now ``was work together for the future.''
	   Gonzalez, who flew back from vacation in Morocco on Wednesday
after the verdict was released, has yet to comment. Last week he
reiterated his claim that the case was part of a rightist plot to
discredit him.
	   Barrionuevo, currently a parliamentary deputy, arrived at the
court accompanied by his former deputy, Rafael Vera, who was also
sentenced to 10 years.
	   Vera and Barrionuevo were the only defendants to plead not
guilty.
	   One other defendant, a former provincial security chief Julian
Sancristobal was sentenced to 10 year also while the other nine
received lesser terms.
	   Judicial procedures could keep all 12 out of prison until
September.
	   Both Barrionuevo and Vera have also been banned from holding
public office for 12 years.

'You know your life is never going to be the same'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE FEINSILBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A son, a grandchild, a husband does something
terrible and the family name is tainted forever.
	   Oswald. Ray. Bundy. Hinckley. McVeigh. Kaczynski. And now the
suspect's name is Weston _ Russell Weston Jr., accused of killing
two Capitol Police officers.
	   While the families of the dead grieve and are comforted by
millions, the families of the accused and convicted also suffer.
For the rest of their lives, they live with the deed, the
accusation, the stigma _ and, only occasionally, the sympathy of
strangers.
	   ``There's such a swirl of emotions,'' said David Kaczynski,
younger brother of Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, who was sentenced
in May to four life sentences plus 30 years for planting and
mailing bombs that left three dead and 29 injured.
	   It was David who called the FBI's attention to Theodore, 56. The
lead prosecutor in the case, Robert Cleary, called David ``a true
American hero.''
	   ``It's kind of hard to know what you feel,'' David said in a
telephone interview from his job at a shelter for runaway and
homeless youth in Albany, New York. ``I felt numb, I felt
frightened, I felt very vulnerable. And there is the instantaneous
feeling that you know your life is never going to be the same.''
	   In a 1996 interview, Wanda Kaczynski, the mother of Theodore and
David, spoke of the hesitancy families felt years ago about seeking
psychiatric help for a child. In Theodore's case, it was never
seriously considered, she said.
	   Now David sympathizes with the Weston family, newest members of
a club no one seeks to join.
	   Even in the clamor and confusion, the Weston family has
accommodated scores of reporters who set up camp outside their home
and invaded their church. They hope Russell's predicament will draw
attention to the plight of the mentally ill. ``We don't want this
to happen to any other families ever again,'' said Weston's sister,
April Callahan.
	   The public and the press have come to understand ``that there is
an illness here,'' as these public tragedies have played themselves
out time and again, said Laurie Flynn, executive director of the
185,000-member National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
	   Amen, says Jerry Ray, 63, whose older brother, James Earl Ray,
confessed _ then recanted _ in the 1968 killing of Martin Luther
King.
	   ``I know Weston's father feels bad, but he's not guilty of
anything. The son is mentally ill. I'd tell him it's not his
fault,'' Jerry Ray said.
	   For all the pain, becoming unwitting public figures sometimes
gives a new direction to the lives of the families.
	   That was the effect on Jerry Ray, who before 1968 had not been
close to his brother. James Earl Ray died in April of liver
failure, but Jerry is still campaigning for new tests on a rifle
that he says will show his brother is innocent, a cause he's
championed for 30 years.
	   In 1963, when Lee Harvey Oswald was seized as John F. Kennedy's
assassin, life became ``unbearable,'' said his widow, Marina. Even
two decades later, their daughter, June, who was 1 year old at the
time of the shooting, felt the sting when her assigned college
roommate demanded she move out.
	   Serial killer Ted Bundy's mother Louise said the year he was
executed, 1989, that she got stares or averted looks whenever she
pulled out a credit card or signed a check. Once, at a Methodist
women's retreat, Mrs. Bundy talked about her son and the trauma
caused in her life. Another woman began crying. ``She was the
mother of one of Ted's victims,'' Mrs. Bundy recalled. The two
women did not speak after that. They turned away when they met.
	   David Kaczynski also drew comfort from strangers amid the
anguish he still feels.
	   ``People were much more supportive and kinder than we could ever
imagine,'' he said. ``We got hundreds of letters from people
struggling with a family member with mental illness and not knowing
what to do. That was tremendously helpful, to know that people
cared. There was not a single ugly letter.''

Red Cross welcomes entry into force of blinding laser weapons ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Red Cross on Thursday welcomed
the start of a landmark ban on the use of blinding laser weapons in
war.
	   The international agreement that came into force Thursday bans
the use and transfer of any laser weapon specifically designed to
cause permanent blindness. Beams from such weapons can cause
immediate and irreversible blindness from several kilometers away.
	   ``This new norm is a tremendous achievement,'' said Cornelio
Sommaruga, president of the International Committee of the Red
Cross. ``Many soldiers and innocent civilians will be spared
horrible suffering.''
	   The ICRC says it's the first time since 1868, when exploding
bullets were banned, that a weapon has been outlawed before being
used on the battlefield.
	   The United States and Britain are expected eventually to join
the 27 countries who have ratified the protocol, part of the 1980
U.N. Convention on Conventional Weapons.
	   However, a U.N. conference in Rome in early July, which drafted
a treaty on a world criminal court, decided to abandon proposals to
categorize as war crimes the use of blinding lasers, nuclear
weapons and anti-personnel mines.

<TEXT>
	   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) _ The Tour de France, depleted by a
rider revolt, limped back into action Thursday with Tom Steels of
Belgium winning the 18th leg ending in Switzerland.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   Overall, the result meant Italy's Marco Pantani retained the
yellow jersey. Bobby Julich, of the United States, held second
place, and Germany's Jan Ullrich was third.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   The sprint finish began with just a few kilometers to go.
	   But for most of the day, the cycling was overshadowed by the
riders' protests about an investigation into alleged drug abuse.
	   Earlier in the day, Spanish teams Kelme and Vitalcio angrily
quit the field, bringing to five the number of teams to have left
the race since it began.
	   The Tour's other three Spanish teams _ Banesto, ONCE and
Riso-Scotti _ all withdrew Wednesday. Festina was thrown out for
drug abuse on July 17.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
With Thursday's pullouts, the riders numbered 102, down from 116
the day before and from 189 at the start.
	   Despite the new pullouts, the 18th stage started on schedule
shortly after 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) in Aix-les-Bains, heading to
Neuchatel, 218 kilometers (135.5 miles) away.
	   Three days away from the Paris finish line, race organizers were
scrambling to calm the revolt over repeated police searches and
testing in the drug investigation, and said the Tour would
continue.
	   The latest teams to quit blamed the atmosphere around the Tour.
	   ``The riders were insulted in the climb to Revard by the Spanish
public,'' said Alvaro Pino, director of the Spanish team Kelme,
referring to one of the Alpine peaks in Wednesday's segment. ``We
received some threats.''
	   The team's Fernando Escartin was in fourth place in the overall
standings in the three-week race. Pino told reporters he would
resign as team chief at the end of the season.
	   ``Everybody needs to make their own decision. Those who decided
not to continue today were right, but those who are leaving the
race are also right,'' said former French champion Luc Leblanc,
with the Polti team, who pulled out Thursday.
	   The drug probe was pressing on. Shortly before midnight
Wednesday, police detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team,
the Francaise des Jeux team director Marc Madiot, and an unnamed
doctor, judicial sources said.
	   Police found small quantities of cortisone-based drugs in
Massi's room, the public prosecutor's office in Lille said
Thursday.
	   The detention of Massi, leader in the mountain climbing
standings, was the first time the probe blocked a rider from
competing.
	   Police said they also searched vehicles and hotel rooms
Wednesday night belonging to the teams Francaise des Jeux, ONCE,
and Casino.
	   But police said no illegal substances were found among
medication seized Tuesday by customs officers from the Bigmat team.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After starting out in Albertville and going through the motions
for the first hour or so, the pack slowed and stopped -- ironically
just past one of the sprint banners which usually has some of the
fastest action of the race.
	   After discussion, the pack restarted, only to stop again.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the Tour's director, assured the riders that
further police action would be carried out ``with a maximum of
dignity ... at the hotels of the concerned teams and not at police
stations.''
	   With that, the riders took off again only to please the public.
	   The riders ended the day's stage more than two and a half hours
behind schedule, and the stage was annulled.
	   The Tour has been plagued with doping allegations since its July
11 start in Dublin, Ireland.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the TVM team that's been under investigation. ``I have the
impression the Tour is finished. I'm sick.''
	   Laurent Jalabert, France's top rider and world champion, quit
Wednesday.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said.

Two transexuals lose their case against Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Changing your sex doesn't mean you can
change history, a European rights court ruled Thursday.
	   Two transexuals failed to convince the European Court of Human
Rights that Britain is obliged to alter their gender on their birth
certificates.
	   In both cases, British authorities agreed to provide new
passports with the sex registered as female, but said it was not
possible under English law to add new information to a birth
certificate.
	   The 20-judge court said that did not violate the human rights of
Kristina Sheffield or Rachel Horsham.
	   Both had argued that the refusal was a breach of their right to
respect for private and family life, guaranteed by the European
Union's Human Rights Convention.
	   Both women were born male in 1946.
	   Miss Sheffield said the anomaly of being registered as ``male''
on her birth certificate forced her to constantly reveal her
previous gender, for instance when applying for car insurance.
	   Miss Horsham told the court she has a male partner whom she
plans to marry in the Netherlands, but she fears the validity of
the marriage would not be recognized under British law were she to
return to Britain.
	   The court said Britain ``had struck a fair balance between the
general interest of the community and the interests of those
applicants.''
	   The court added that it was not satisfied that the suffering of
the plaintiffs through being obliged to disclose their previous sex
was sufficient to override the state's prerogatives.

Media watchdog is to end Bosnia's broadcasting chaos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The United States and the
European Union have set up a media watchdog to put an end to
widespread broadcasting chaos in Bosnia and help the divided Balkan
nation shed wartime enmities.
	   As of August 1, the Independent Media Commission will start its
work of creating free, professional and independent media in
Bosnia, its leaders say.
	   Krister Thelin, the commission's Swedish director, said the
commission will have the daunting task of defusing what was one of
the most dangerous weapons of nationalists before, during and after
the Bosnian war.
	   The media in Bosnia has become increasingly chaotic. The number
of broadcasters has soared, some have jammed others, while still
others have rebroadcast Croatian or Serbian programs reflecting the
view of foreign governments.
	   Nationalist propaganda played a key role in turning neighbor
against neighbor and in mobilizing armies to fight each other in
the Balkan theater.
	   In postwar Bosnia, media have to be lifted above the political
arena and help bring Bosnia closer to Europe.
	   ``The general belief throughout all communities is that media
play an important, if not vital role, in the implementation of the
peace process,'' Thelin said.
	   His commission, jointly financed by the United States and the
European Union, was established in June by a decision of the top
international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp. But it will be
independent and ``answerable to no one,'' its director said.
	   The mandate of foreigners in the commission expires in three
years, when local experts are to take over.
	   ``We're in business to go out of business,'' said Robert
Gillette, the deputy director and head of licensing media in
Bosnia.
	   To be successful, the body has been given a wide mandate of
licensing media, monitoring their work and preventing media who
ignore set rules from working.
	   ``We are entrusted with authority ranging from warnings and
requesting apologies to terminating licensing and closing
stations,'' Thelin said. In an extreme situation, the commission
can seek assistance from the NATO-led peace force on the ground.
	   Nobody seems to know the number of broadcasters in the country.
According to Thelin, they range from 268 to 370.
	   The commission will try to locate them and make them operate by
generally accepted, free, western democratic standards.
	   Since June, no new licenses have been issued, and those media
operating before will have to reapply.

Lithuania deals U.S. rude awakening, 84-82
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lithuania win over U.S. DELETES old material. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Lithuania, behind Arturas Karnisovas' 29
points, beat the United States 84-82 Thursday at the World
Basketball Championship to snap the Americans' 26-game winning
streak at major international events.
	   That run of victories, which includes two Olympic golds and a
world title, was built by Dream Teams of NBA stars.
	   Because of the ongoing NBA labor dispute, this U.S. team is a
mixed bag of mostly anonymous players from the CBA, European
leagues and college.
	   They were outplayed and often outmuscled by Lithuania, which was
without its own two NBA players, Arvydas Sabonis and Zydrunas
Ilgauskas.
	   The U.S. (1-1) never found a defensive solution for Karnisovas,
who played at Seton Hall and was the 1997 European player of the
year. The 2.03-meter (6-foot-9) forward scored 20 of his points
after halftime, on a mix of slashes to the basket and timely
outside shooting.
	   While he delivered points in bunches, the United States suffered
without a go-to player.
	   Jimmy Oliver was the closest thing to a consistent threat,
scoring 18 points. The former Purdue standout, who now plays in
Spain, had a chance to win the game, but his desperation 3-point
attempt rolled around the rim and dropped out after the United
States inbounded with 0.5 seconds left.
	   Lithuania took the lead for good seven minutes into the game,
and was up by as many as 16 points, but the United States did make
two strong runs.
	   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich's team, which has been together for less
than a month, scored 10 straight points early in the second half to
whittle its deficit to single digits at 54-51.
	   With a chance to cut it to one with 13:43 to go, Oliver missed a
dunk at the end of a 2-on-1 breakaway with Michael Hawkins (16
points). Lithuania built up its lead again, and a late rally by the
United States fell short.
	   Lithuania used a 23-8 run midway through the first half to build
a 47-34 lead at the break.
	   The last loss by a U.S. team at either the Olympics or a world
championship was at the 1990 worlds, when a team of collegians lost
99-91 to Yugoslavia in the semifinals.
	   Lithuania now tops Group C in preliminary round play with a 2-0
record. Like the United States, Brazil is 1-1 after beating South
Korea 76-73 Thursday behind 17 points from Caio Cazziolato and 14
from Rogerio Klafke.
	   South Korea (0-2) drew even at 67-67 on a layup by Lee Sang Min
(game-high 19 points) with 4:32 left, but Caio had two baskets in a
7-1 Brazilian run that sealed victory.
	   Also Thursday, veteran center Jose Ortiz, who once played for
the Utah Jazz, had game-highs of 22 points and 11 rebounds to lead
Puerto Rico past Japan 78-57 in a Group B game.
	   The 2.07-meter (6-foot-10) Ortiz dominated under the basket, and
spurred a 23-8 run in the opening nine minutes of the second half
that put the game away.
	   Puerto Rico (1-1) led 39-32 at halftime.
	   Michael Takahashi, who played college basketball at
Cal-Northridge and whose father is American, led Japan (0-2) with
20 points and nine rebounds.

South African reconciliation at landmark; painful work remains

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Truth and Reconciliation
Commission on Friday shuts down part of its work, and now faces the
task of producing a report to help shape a new nation emerging from
apartheid's emotional rubble.
	   Friday's deadline for testimony affects the commission's human
rights committee, which since 1996 has heard or read reports from
21,000 victims of abuse during white minority rule. A separate
amnesty committee continues its work.
	   Chaired by Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu, the commission was
created by President Nelson Mandela's government after 1994's first
all-race elections to help heal the breaches of apartheid.
	   Already debate has begun on the commission's usefulness, sparked
by a survey this week by the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day.
Almost two-thirds of South Africans felt the commission's work had
worsened race relations, the survey found.
	   Interviewed on SABC radio, Tutu said he wasn't surprised.
	   ``I'd be surprised if the opposite was the case, after all the
ghastly revelations about what South Africans did to each other ...
Reconciliation is not easy,'' he said.
	   The commission has uncovered tales of murder, torture and rape
by government police officers and anti-apartheid activists.
	   The human rights committee has spent most of this year
investigating special issues, such as chemical warfare.
	   To enable South Africans to get on with their future, Parliament
set time limits on the commission's activities. But the shutdown
threatens to frustrate efforts to find out who ordered the
apartheid government's secret chemical and biological weapon
program.
	   The man who headed the program, Dr. Wouter Basson, has used
legal maneuvers this week to postpone testimony until Friday.
	   But while some aspects may remain hidden, the human rights
committee work has allowed ordinary, mostly black people, to
publicly describe their suffering and humiliation at the hands of
government police. The revelations have shocked many white South
Africans who say they never knew what went on.
	   The report is due in October.
	   The amnesty committee will continue to hear 1,000 applications
into next year, said commission spokesman John Allen.
	   A main applicant is Eugene de Kock, who headed the apartheid
government's hit squad, Vlakplaas, and is serving two life terms
and 212 years in prison for crimes he committed.
	   He is seeking amnesty for over 100 crimes, including his role in
the 1981 bombing of Mandela's African National Congress offices in
London.
	   Of the 7,000 applications, amnesty has only been granted to 125
people who could prove political motives and convince the panel
they told the whole truth. Thousands of applications have been
dismissed on paper because there was no political motive, Allen
said.
	   In the latest rulings, four members of a mob who stoned and
stabbed to death American student Amy Biehl were granted amnesty
Tuesday and released from prison.
	   Many black South Africans oppose amnesty, like the citizens of
Trust Feeds in KwaZulu-Natal, where former policeman Brian Mitchell
orchestrated the killing of 11 people in 1988.
	   But the village opened its heart to Mitchell when he went in
person to beg forgiveness last year.
	   ``Amnesty was necessary. It would have been a blood bath in
South Africa without it,'' said Khoza Mgojo, one of the 15
commissioners, in an interview last year.

French star returns for Reds' Munich anniversary game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Retired soccer star Eric Cantona will
pull on his famous No. 7 shirt for Manchester United one more time
in a special game at Old Trafford next month to remember those who
perished in the Munich air disaster of 1958.
	   The French forward was originally lined up to lead a Cantona XI
against the current Manchester United team. But he has changed his
mind and will captain the Reds team instead.
	   Other former United stars, such as Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes,
Steve Bruce, Andrei Kanchelskis and Paul Ince, also will play in
the game while the Cantona XI also will have another top French
player, Jean-Pierre Papin.
	   The game is being staged Aug. 18 and proceeds will go to a fund
set up for the dependents of those who died and the survivors of
the crash, in which eight members of the Manchester United team
were among 23 people killed on a snowbound runway at Munich
airport.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Chile's World Cup defender Javier Margas Thursday
signed a contract to play for West Ham in the Premier League.
	   The 29-year-old fullback transfered from Universidad Catolica,
having previously played for Colo Colo of Chile and America of
Mexico. Universidad is understood to have received 2 million pounds
(dlrs 3.3 million) in the deal.
	   Margas has been a starter in the national squad for almost a
decade and played in all four of Chile's World Cup games at France
'98 before the team was knocked out 4-1 by Brazil.
	   The Hammers, who also have hired veteran England striker Ian
Wright from Arsenal, goalkeeper Shaka Hislop from Newcastle and
French forward Marc Keller from Karlsruhe, also announced Thursday
they had recruited veteran England international defender Neil
Ruddock from Liverpool.

Former British track captain quits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updates with reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Roger Black, a two-time European champion and
Olympic silver medalist at 400 meters, said Thursday he will retire
after Sunday's British Grand Prix meet in Sheffield.
	   The announcement came three days after Black was bypassed by
British team selectors for the 400 meters at the European
Championships in Budapest starting Aug. 18.
	   ``I'm a championship performer,'' Black said at a news
conference in London. ``I need championship goals. Those goals no
longer exist _ the selectors have defeated me.''
	   Black said he was stepping down as British team captain and
withdrawing from the British 4-by-400 meter relay team.
	   Black, the 1996 Atlanta Olympic 400-meter silver medalist,
finished fourth at the British AAA meet in Birmingham last Sunday _
which doubled as the trials for the Euros and the Commonwealth
Games.
	   The 32-year-old finished behind British record-holder Iwan
Thomas, Mark Richardson and Solomon Wariso, who dipped at the line
to beat him for third by 0.003 seconds.
	   The first two places automatically qualified for the European
championships and selectors picked Wariso _ who slashed one second
off his personal best at the AAA meet _ to fill the optional third
400 meter spot.
	   ``A part of me has been taken,'' Black said. ``I'm devastated _
I was devastated on Sunday night when the selectors picked the
team. I'm mystified as to how the selectors came to their decision
_ it shows little insight of me as a performer...three-hundredths
of a second is worth more than 13 years of performances.''
	   UK Athletics performance director Max Jones said he was
disappointed Black had withdrawn from the British team _ and he
would definitely be missed _ but sentiment has to make way for
performance in selection criteria.
	   Mark Richardson said he understood why his ``mentor'' Black made
his decision.
	   ``It's very sad. Roger's whole season has been focused on
winning at the European Championships,'' he said.
	   ``It's a big blow being denied the opportunity in such
contentious circumstances and my heart goes out to him.''
	   Colin Jackson, 110-meter hurdles world record holder, said
Black's retirement was a sad day for the sport in Britain.
	   ``He will be a great loss to the team _ this kind of thing can
take the edge off the team,'' he said.
	   World triple jump record holder Jonathan Edwards said Black's
decision was a sad end to a distinguished career.
	   ``It's a sad to finish like this,'' he said.
	   ``Roger had great hopes of challenging for the European title.
He will have perceived it has been taken away from him.''
	   Ironically, Black's announcement coincided with news that Wariso
was in doubt for the European Championships after sustaining a knee
injury as he lunged for the line to beat Black at the AAA meet.
	   Adding to the selection controversy, Wariso admitted after
beating Black last Sunday that he had only entered the 400 ``as a
laugh.''
	   The 200-meter specialist was banned for three months in 1994
after being sent home from the European Championships for using the
unauthorized substance ephedrine.
	   Black was scheduled to line up against the three men who beat
him at Birmingham last Sunday at the Grand Prix meet at Sheffield.

Europe's Supreme Allied Commander in Macedonia

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The top NATO commander arrived in
Macedonia Thursday to discuss the crisis in Kosovo and inspect a
military facility scheduled to host a joint NATO exercise.
	   It is the third time this year NATO's Supreme Allied Commander
for Europe, General Wesley Clark has visited Macedonia. He also met
with Macedonian defense minister Lazar Kitanoski to discuss the
crisis in neighboring Serbia's Kosovo province, which borders
Macedonia to the north.
	   ``We remain concerned, obviously, about the situation ... we are
determined to provide the assistance and support to this very
important government here in Macedonia,'' Clark told reporters at a
newsconference.
	   Kitanoski said NATO and the U.S. government continue to support
his country.
	   ``Macedonia must remain a secure country in the region,'' he
said.
	   Macedonia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1995
and last year it established closer cooperation with the alliance.
	   With violence raging in neighboring Serbia's troubled Kosovo
province, there are increased fears the clashes could spill across
the border into Macedonia, which has its own substantial ethnic
Albanian minority.
	   The threats of a broader Balkan conflict also prompted the U.N.
Security Council in July to authorize an additional 300 troops to
the 750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force already in Macedonia and
extend the force's mandate until the end of next February.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
crackdown began in February.
	   Twenty-four countries, eleven of them NATO members, with a total
of 700 soldiers are to participate in the NATO exercise, entitled
``Best Cooperative Effort,'' at the Krivolak military facility in
September.

Kosovo Albanians caught at Hungarian-Slovak border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A group of Kosovo Albanians tried to
illegally cross the border from Hungary to Slovakia Thursday, the
state news agency MTI reported.
	   Police caught the group of 45 ethnic Albanians between Putnok
and Serenyfalva, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Budapest in
a truck, driven by a Hungarian smuggler.
	   Hungarian border authorities took the aliens into custody and
will decide their fate in the coming days. If they are declared
refugees of war, Hungary will grant them haven for the duration of
the conflict.
	   Five months ago, Serb and Yugoslav forces launched a bitter
campaign against rebel ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern Kosovo
province, that has killed hundreds of people and forced thousands
of others to flee their homes.
	   The republics of Serbia and Montenegro make up Yugoslavia, which
borders Hungary to the south. Yugoslavs are allowed to enter
Hungary without a visa.

Worlds: Yugoslavia rallies to beat Russia in OT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia scored the last 10 points of
the game, including Dejan Bodiroga's six free throws in the last 52
seconds, to beat Russia 82-74 in overtime Thursday at the World
Basketball Championship.
	   Zeljko Rebraca, the 2.11-meter (7-foot) center from Italian club
Benetton Treviso, led 1990 world champion Yugoslavia with 23
points. Bodiroga added 16, with 14 from the line.
	   The thrilling game lived up to its billing as one of the 16-team
tournament's premier matchups.
	   The victory gives Yugoslavia control of preliminary round Group
B with a 2-0 record. Russia and Puerto Rico are 1-1, with winless
Japan last.
	   Russia, which got 20 points from Mikhail Mikhailov, had four
players foul out.
	   Igor Koudelin hit back-to-back 3-pointers as Russia used a 10-2
run to close the first half with a 40-33 lead.

Albania warns Yugoslavia to stop border provocations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania warned the Yugoslav government on
Thursday to immediately stop all cross-border provocations, foreign
ministry officials said.
	   ``There is no chance that such provocations will intimidate us.
... Worse, if they are part of a plan to extend the conflict in our
territory, they will be met with a decisive reaction from our armed
forces and the Albanian people,'' the Albanian Foreign Ministry
said in a note handed in to the Yugoslav representative in Tirana.
	   The move comes after several reports that Yugoslav troops
allegedly fired across the border into Albania and exploded
grenades on Albanian territory.
	   Yugoslaiva, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, has been fighting
to quash the violent independence movement of ethnic Albanians in
the southern Serbian province of Kosovo and accuses Albanian of
encouraging and harboring rebels within its borders.
	   Late Monday, two missiles exploded 50 meters (yards) inside the
Albanian territory in the border village of Padesh. No injuries
were reported.

Ex-minister found guilty of dirty war kidnapping reiterates
</HEADLINE>
innocence &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former cabinet minister sentenced for his
role in a kidnapping that was part of the dirty war against Basque
separatists reiterated his innocence Thursday and vowed to fight
the verdict.
	   The court found Jose Luis Barrionuevo and 11 others guilty
Wednesday in the 1983 kidnapping of French businessman Segundo
Marey, who had been mistaken for a hitman from the Basque
separatist group ETA.
	   ``We have been convicted without proof,'' Barrionuevo told 200
journalists and supporters waiting for him outside the Supreme
Court in central Madrid where he went to collect official notice of
the verdict. ``We will fight this with everything judicial
procedures afford us.''
	   Marey was abducted by the so-called GAL death squad that killed
27 people between 1983 and 1987 in its pursuit of ETA members and
sympathizers. Many of its victims, like Marey, had no connection to
ETA.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence of seven provinces in northern Spain and southern
France.
	   Barrionuevo said he would not ask for a government pardon,
saying he did nothing wrong while responsible for internal security
between 1982 and 1988 _ the period of dirty war, or illegal
crackdown, against the militant separatists.
	   ``We have averted suffering, violence, intolerance and attacks
on many people and once again we must say that our actions were in
line with constitutional principles,'' he said.
	   The verdict came as a major blow to former premier Felipe
Gonzalez who has long denied allegations that his governments set
up and ran the GAL. The scandal and other controversies contributed
greatly to his Socialist party's defeat in elections in 1996 after
nearly 14 years in office.
	   In its first official reaction, Socialist party leader Joaquin
Almunia said they ``respected the verdict but totally disagreed
with it as there was no proof against Barrionuevo.''
	   Almunia intimated the party would not seek revenge against its
political opponents by saying the organization believed the best
thing for Spain to do now ``was work together for the future.''
	   Gonzalez, who flew back from vacation in Morocco after the
verdict was released, has yet to comment. Last week he reiterated
his claim that the case was part of a rightist plot to discredit
him.
	   Barrionuevo, currently a parliamentarian, arrived at the court
accompanied by his former deputy, Rafael Vera, who was also
sentenced to 10 years.
	   Vera and Barrionuevo were the only defendants to plead not
guilty.
	   Another defendant, former provincial security chief Julian
Sancristobal, also was sentenced to 10 years. The other nine
received lesser terms.
	   Both Barrionuevo and Vera have also been banned from holding
public office for 12 years.

Milosevic promises end of Kosovo offensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more quotes, changes byline
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Thursday declared an end to a sweeping Serb offensive
against Kosovo rebels and offered peace talks if they can agree on
a team to represent them, European diplomats said.
	   ``Milosevic assured us that the military action has come to a
halt,'' said Albert Rohan, a senior Austrian diplomat who headed a
three-member European Union delegation in talks with the Yugoslav
president.
	   German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger added that Milosevic
``expressly'' told the delegation ``that the offensive is over.''
	   Since Friday, Serb police have driven Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters from their stronghold in Malisevo and pushed them off the
main highway between Pristina and Pec, blocked by the insurgents
since May.
	   Numerous people have been reported killed and tens of thousands
ethnic Albanians have fled their homes.
	   Despite Milosevic's assurances, reporters traveling Thursday in
the Drenica area of southern Kosovo heard explosions in the
distance and Albanian sources reported ``fierce'' clashes Thursday
along the Albanian border near Djakovica.
	   Yugoslav army troops and Serb police continue to surround the
KLA stronghold of Junik near the Albanian border, and Rohan said
Milosevic promised not to shell the village, where thousands of
Albanian civilians are believed to have taken refuge.
	   The diplomats, who visited the embattled Serbian province
Wednesday, said they saw extensive destruction caused by Serb
forces during their offensive.
	   ``For over three hours of driving around in villages and towns,
we have not encountered a single Albanian civilian,'' Ischinger
said. ``What we saw was an empty country, a wasteland... quite a
bit of destruction of property.''
	   Rohan said he got a ``clear impression of excessive use of
military force .... totally out of proportion with military
targets.''
	   The EU diplomats claimed some progress in efforts to unite
Albanian factions for peace talks on the future of Kosovo, but said
the process has been slowed by Serb battlefield gains against
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   ``While Milosevic has confirmed to us the willingness of his
government to make the return of civilians possible, it's quite
difficult for us to see this can be achieved without more
confidence-building measures,'' Ischinger said.
	   Milosevic agreed to discuss autonomy for Kosovo, a province of
Serbia, the main republic within Yugoslavia. But he has ruled out
the independence demanded by Albanian politicians and the KLA.
	   ``Milosevic for the first time indicated flexibility on how far
the self-government could go,'' Ischinger said. ``He didn't dispute
the fact that the time is running out.
	   ``I've never seen him as concerned as today. He agrees with the
idea of a platform that includes all relevant elements of the
(Kosovo Albanian) side.''
	   The Albanians have so far failed to agree on the composition of
an ``all-party executive team'' to negotiate with the government.
The KLA opposes peaceful resistance of Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova and instead supports armed struggle to gain
independence from Serbia.
	   Ischinger said he expected the Albanians to form a joint
delegation in the next few days and negotiations with Milosevic's
government to start ``in a matter of weeks.''
	   ``We leave encouraged that a platform is developing,'' said the
British member in the EU delegation, Emyr Jones Perry.

Archaeologists unearth statue of ancient god Osiris in Nile Delta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian archaeologists have unearthed a
statue of the ancient god Osiris in the Nile Delta, the head of
Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities said Thursday.
	   Gaballah Ali Gaballah said the bronze statue was found in a huge
cemetery belonging to Egypt's Roman period at San el-Hagar, 167
kilometers (111 miles) northeast of Cairo.
	   The statue stands 31 centimeters (1 foot) high and weighs 2
kilograms (4.4 pounds) and had been buried with other ancient
artifacts, Gaballah said in a statement.
	   Osiris, the god of the underworld, his wife, Isis, the goddess
of fertility, and their son, Horus, were worshiped by ancient
Egyptians.
	   The Egyptian team will continue to excavate the enormous site at
San el-Hagar, which belongs to the relatively late period of
ancient history, Gaballah said.

	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) _ After his election in 1980,
then-Prime Minister Edward Seaga shut down the Cuban embassy in
anger over an earlier experiment with socialism that bankrupted
Jamaica.
	   ``We still have bitter memories,'' Seaga, now the conservative
opposition leader, said during an interview Wednesday.
	   But whatever hard feelings remain, they seem to be easing.
Seaga, who met Thursday with Fidel Castro as part of the Cuban
president's momentous Caribbean tour, said the end of the Cold War
had neutralized Cuba as a threat.

Two small planes crash in western France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two small planes crashed over the Atlantic Ocean
just off the Brittany coast Thursday, police said. About fifteen
people were reported missing and some of them were presumed dead.
	   The crash between a Cessna and a twin-engine plane belonging to
the Proteus company took place at 3:58 p.m. (1358 GMT) in the bay
just off Quiberon, a port 505 kilometers (311 miles) southwest of
Paris.
	   The Cessna belonged to a local flying club, while the Proteus
plane, a Beechcraft 1900D, was on a regularly scheduled commercial
flight from Lyon to Lorient, a coastal city about 50 kilometers (30
miles) northwest of Quiberon.
	   Fourteen people were aboard the Proteus plane, including 12
passengers and two crew members, said Franklin Deveux, president of
the company. At least one person was in the Cessna.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   Rescue officials, including several helicopter and two teams of
divers aboard speedboats, rushed to the accident site, police said.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot flew to the accident site
on Thursday afternoon.

Italian World Cup star turns down move to Middlesbrough

	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Bryan Robson's dream of pairing
England veteran Paul Gascoigne and Italian World Cup winger
Francesco Moriero in midfield for Middlesborough was shattered
Thursday when the Inter Milan player turned down the move.
	   Middlesborough had agreed a 5 million pound (dlrs 8.2 million)
tranfer deal with Inter for Moriero. But the 29-year-old decided to
see out his existing contract in Italy's Serie A.
	   Moriero was a member of the Italian team that lost its World Cup
quarterfinal to France in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie.
France went on to win the title.
	   He would have become the third former Inter player at the
Riverside, with striker Marco Branca and central defender Gianluca
Festa already there.

Keizo Obuchi declared Japan's new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Obuchi comment early Friday in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Putting down a challenge from a more popular
opposition leader, ruling party favorite Keizo Obuchi rolled to
victory in the race for prime minister in Parliament on Thursday,
taking power in a country grappling with political divisions and a
souring economy.
	   The new government moved quickly to win voters' confidence and
reassure worried markets, vowing decisive action and announcing an
``economic reform Cabinet'' with a party economics expert as
finance minister, a key position in plans to power Japan out of
recession.
	   ``I'm happy to have such an excellent Cabinet, but at the same
time I feel a heavy responsibility,'' Obuchi told reporters early
Friday after meeting with Cabinet members.
	   Obuchi, 61, takes office with a weak mandate. He succeeds party
colleague Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced to resign after a
painful electoral defeat, and emerged as the Liberal Democratic
Party nominee last week only after a bruising battle with party
reformists.
	   Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled lower house Thursday,
winning 268 votes of the 497 ballots cast. But the
opposition-dominated upper house chose Democratic Party leader
Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   The opposition cried that Obuchi's victory did not reflect the
will of the people and called for immediate general elections to
elect a new Parliament. The opposition triumphed in July 12
elections for the upper house and figure a quick vote for the other
chamber would yield similar results.
	   Kan predicted the new government would not be successful.
	   ``I don't think they'll be able to come up with aggressive
measures without having the support of the people,'' he told
reporters.
	   Despite the problems, former Foreign Minister Obuchi was
ebullient. He smiled in satisfaction during the Parliament vote and
bowed when the lower house results were announced. He then made the
rounds for traditional greetings at the offices of political
parties, and presented his Cabinet before Emperor Akihito. He was
not expected to speak to reporters until Friday.
	   The new prime minister, however, is considered by many to be too
entrenched in the conservative ways of the LDP _ which has held the
premiership for 40 of the past 43 years _ to take the bold,
innovative steps needed to solve the structural flaws of the
Japanese economy.
	   Obuchi worked hard over the past week to turn that image around,
heavily lobbying former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the
finance minister's job. Miyazawa, 78, is respected as an economics
expert and is an architect of the government's plan to bail out its
debt-laden banking system.
	   Though it is uncertain if Miyazawa, a long-time party
powerbroker, would deliver any bold initiatives, talk that he would
be chosen buoyed markets. Tokyo stocks slumped on Monday, the first
session after Obuchi's selection as LDP leader, but then rallied
later in the week as Miyazawa emerged as the choice for finance.
	   On Thursday, Miyazawa, who served as prime minister from 1991 to
1993, vowed action.
	   ``We must get our work done as quickly as possible within the
limited amount of time we are given,'' he told reporters.
	   The economy is in bad need of quick remedies. The New York Times
on Thursday reported that U.S. officials and private financial
experts estimate Japanese banks suffer from nearly dlrs 1 trillion
in bad loans _ almost twice the official number. Japanese officials
had no immediate reaction to the report, which was based on
accounts of unidentified sources, though some analysts have
suspected for years that the bad debts could approach such a
figure.
	   Obuchi has already proposed what many economists say are needed:
tax cuts and spending. He plans to cut income taxes by 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption. Also on the agenda is a clean up of the
troubled banking sector.
	   Despite talk of revolt in his own party, the LDP showed unity
Thursday in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi, a party maverick who challenged Obuchi for the LDP
presidency, called for support for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   There were few surprises in the new Cabinet lineup, which was
chosen from among party veterans.
	   Two that stood out, however, were Taichi Sakaiya, a writer and
former bureaucrat, who was named director-general of the Economic
Planning Agency, and the Cabinet's only woman, Seiko Noda, named as
post and telecommunications minister. The 37-year-old is the
youngest Cabinet minister in Japanese history.

Bulgaria's president seeks to counter Balkans' image problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ While keeping a watchful eye on the turbulent
Balkans, Bulgaria's president is in Canada this week to be honored
for a reform program that he hopes will counter negative images of
his country and region.
	   ``We live in a region which is extremely interesting,'' Petar
Stoyanov said in interview Thursday. ``But in our recent past it
has often proved to be a curse for us.''
	   Stoyanov, a former leader of the anti-communist opposition, took
office in January 1997 and since then has used his background as a
lawyer to push for legal, political and economic reforms.
	   On Friday, he was to receive an award for his work from the
Central and East European Law Initiative, a project launched by the
American Bar Association to support legal reform in the former
Soviet Bloc.
	   Though the lawyers' group has become well-acquainted with
Bulgaria's progress, Stoyanov said many Westerners are less
informed.
	   ``I do come across a lack of understanding,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``But I find this only natural. For 45 years, we
belonged to a system that was completely cut off.''
	   Of immediate concern to Stoyanov is the conflict in Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province between the ethnic Albanian majority and Serb
security forces.
	   The main overland route from Western Europe to Bulgaria goes
through Yugoslavia, and Stoyanov is concerned that economic
sanctions against Yugoslavia would harm his country.
	   ``An escalation in Kosovo might affect Bulgaria's reform,''
Stoyanov said. ``That's why we're so actively involved in
diplomatic activities.''
	   To lessen dependence on the routes through Yugoslavia, Stoyanov
is lobbying for construction of a second bridge across the Danube
River, which forms the border between Bulgaria and Romania.
	   ``It's absolutely unacceptable for two countries that share a
long river border to have just one bridge,'' Stoyanov said.
	   Longer-term goals include Bulgaria's admission into NATO and the
European Union.
	   ``The precise date is not important,'' he said of NATO
admission. ``What matters is that every day, with perseverance and
hard work, we try to reach the standards that would get us in.''
	   He said Bulgaria's quest for greater international respect is
much influenced by Balkan events.
	   ``It is essential for us, to improve our own image, to try to
improve the overall image of the Balkans,'' he said. ``Developments
in Bosnia and in Kosovo have cast a shadow over our image.''
	   He hopes that regional dialogue and a move toward more open
borders will help. He also advocates increased international
cooperation to help combat Bulgaria's serious corruption and
organized crime.
	   ``Integration in the criminal world proceeds faster than
integration of the countries trying to fight it,'' he said. ``The
criminals aren't bogged down by bureaucracy.''

<TEXT>
	   VANNES, France (AP) _ Two small planes collided over the
Atlantic Ocean just off the Brittany coast Thursday, police said.
Six people were killed and another nine were reported missing and
presumed dead.
	   The crash between a Cessna and a twin-engine plane belonging to
the Proteus company took place at 3:58 p.m. (1358 GMT) in the bay
just off Quiberon, a port 505 kilometers (311 miles) southwest of
Paris.
	   The Cessna belonged to a local flying club, while the Proteus
plane, a Beechcraft 1900D, was on a regularly scheduled commercial
flight from Lyon to Lorient, a coastal city about 50 kilometers (30
miles) northwest of Quiberon.
	   Fourteen people were aboard the Proteus plane, including 12
passengers and two crew members, said Franklin Deveux, president of
the company. One person was in the Cessna.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   Rescue officials, including several helicopter and two teams of
divers aboard speedboats, rushed to the accident site, police said.
	   Six bodies were fished out of the ocean and rescuers were
attempting to locate the other people reported missing.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot flew to the accident site
on Thursday afternoon.

Tour escapes to Switzerland, but scandal widens; Belgian wins stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs; UPDATES throughout with details, color. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) _ After one of the most turbulent
days in its history, the scandal-plagued Tour de France escaped
Thursday to peaceful Switzerland, where fans tinkled cowbells along
the road and officials promised there wouldn't be any late-night
drug raids.
	   But despite the bucolic surroundings, the athletes couldn't
escape news of the widening doping scandal, which continued to
claim new victims in the world's biggest cycling event.
	   Three more teams pulled out to protest police behavior, and
investigators for the first time prevented a cyclist from competing
after finding drugs in his possession.
	   When the 18th stage was over, Tom Steels of Belgium had won, but
the overall standings remained the same. Italy's Marco Pantani
retained the yellow jersey. Bobby Julich of the United States held
onto second place, followed by last year's winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany.
	   Before Thursday's start, there was uncertainty as to whether the
race would go on at all. Many riders, angered at the growing
investigation, had threatened to pull out entirely. But in the end,
103 of them left the French Alpine town of Aix-les-Bains for a
218-kilometer ride through stunning countryside to to Neuchatel,
Switzerland.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   But most of the attention was back in France.
	   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, police in Chambery, near
Aix-les-Bains, detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team, the
leader in mountain climbing standings. They found banned drugs in
his room, said prosecutors in the northern city of Lille, where the
probe is centered.
	   They also found drugs in a truck belonging to the Spanish ONCE
team _ one of five that has dropped out of the race in protest, the
prosecutors said. Its doctor, Nicolas Terrados, was detained.
	   And after a night in detention, a third man, Marc Madiot,
director of the French team Francaise des Jeux, was released.
	   Earlier, two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, angrily quit the
field, joining the other three Spanish teams, who quit Wednesday. A
sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17 after police found
dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the current scandal.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
	   Riders at the finish line said they were trying to put the
scandal behind them, and think ahead to Sunday's finale on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After stopping twice, the pack coasted slowly to the finish
line, and the stage results were canceled. Riders threatened to
give up entirely, but by Thursday morning, they seemed to realize
the enormity of stopping the race in protest for the first time
since its 1903 debut.
	   ``We were all afraid to give up after 20 days of racing,'' said
Marco Pantani, who leads the race. ``I've made sacrifices to get
the yellow jersey.''
	   Fans lining the route through eastern France made their
sentiments clear.
	   ``Free Festina!'' one banner said. Another read: ``The wheels of
justice move, and heroes are killed.''
	   Once the race crossed into Switzerland, with its pristine lakes,
mountains, chalets, and kids ringing cowbells, the banners were
just as blunt. ``It's hypocrisy!'' said one.
	   Swiss organizing official Jean Cavadini went on the radio to
promise the riders a peaceful, raid-free night in Neuchatel. But he
added: ``I fear the celebration has been spoiled, ever since the
first week.''
	   Swiss fans, though, were determined not to let that happen.
Jeannette Etamba, 28, brought her 4-month-old son to drink in the
scene at the finish line.
	   ``Doping is deceitful, but the scandal hasn't destroyed the
atmosphere for us,'' she said minutes before the exhausted riders,
glistening with sweat, crossed the finish line. ``We brought our
sandwiches and our iced tea, and we're going to cheer the riders
and then go swimming.''

Lithuania deals U.S. rude awakening, 84-82
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Karnisovas, Tomjanovich quotes; Yugoslavia win
over Russia. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Lithuania, behind Arturas Karnisovas' 29
points, beat the United States 84-82 Thursday at the World
Basketball Championship to snap the Americans' 26-game winning
streak at major international events.
	   Jimmy Oliver's desperation 3-point shot rolled around the rim
and dropped out after the United States inbounded with half a
second left.
	   The U.S. string of victories, which includes two Olympic golds
and a world title, was built by Dream Teams of NBA stars.
	   Because of the ongoing NBA labor dispute, this U.S. team is a
mixed bag of mostly anonymous players from the CBA, European
leagues and college.
	   They were outplayed and often outmuscled by Lithuania, which was
without its own two NBA players, Arvydas Sabonis and Zydrunas
Ilgauskas.
	   ``Today we came out and wanted to play like they play, which is
powerful physical basketball,'' Karnisovas said. ``We wanted to be
very aggressive and run, run the ball. That's why we stayed in the
game and that's why we won.''
	   The United States (1-1) never found a defensive solution for
Karnisovas, who played at Seton Hall and was the 1997 European
player of the year. The 2.03-meter (6-foot-9) forward scored 20 of
his points after halftime, on a mix of slashes to the basket and
timely outside shooting.
	   ``Karnisovas was a big factor,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``They played a very aggressive offensive game. I thought we
finally got it under control but it was too late.''
	   In another key game Thursday, 1990 world champion Yugoslavia
came back to beat Russia 82-74 in overtime. Dejan Bodiroga made six
free throws in the final 52 seconds as Yugoslavia (2-0 to top Group
B) scored the last 10 points of the game.
	   While Karnishovas delivered points in bunches, the United States
suffered without a go-to player.
	   Oliver was the closest thing to a consistent threat, scoring 18
points on 7-of-14 shooting. The former Purdue standout, who now
plays in Spain, had a good look at the basket before firing the
final shot.
	   ``I told Jimmy Oliver I'd put my money on him making that shot
every time,'' Tomjanovich said.
	   Lithuania took the lead for good seven minutes into the game,
and was up by as many as 16 points, but the United States did make
two strong runs.
	   Tomjanovich's team, which has been together for less than a
month, scored 10 straight points early in the second half to
whittle its deficit to single digits at 54-51.
	   With a chance to cut it to one with 13:43 to go, Oliver missed a
dunk at the end of a 2-on-1 breakaway with Michael Hawkins (16
points). Lithuania built up its lead again, and a late rally by the
United States fell short.
	   Lithuania used a 23-8 run midway through the first half to build
a 47-34 lead at the break.
	   The last loss by a U.S. team at either the Olympics or a world
championship was at the 1990 worlds, when a team of collegians lost
99-91 to Yugoslavia in the semifinals.
	   Lithuania now tops Group C in preliminary round play with a 2-0
record. Like the United States, Brazil is 1-1 after beating South
Korea 76-73 Thursday behind 17 points from Caio Cazziolato and 14
from Rogerio Klafke.
	   Veteran center Jose Ortiz had game-highs of 22 points and 11
rebounds to lead Puerto Rico (1-1) past winless Japan 78-57 in a
Group B game. The 2.08-meter (6-foot-10) Ortiz once played for the
Utah Jazz.

Israel considering release of 100 Palestinian prisoners

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with negotiating session, fresh quotes, ADDS byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid efforts to restart peace talks, Israel is
considering a goodwill gesture: the release of 100 Palestinian
prisoners, officials said Thursday.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is looking into the
request for a prisoner release made earlier this week by Yasser
Arafat's top deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, Kahalani's spokeswoman said.
	   According to the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu supports the move and has asked Kahalani to draw
up a list of prisoners to be freed.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak refused to comment on the
report.
	   With Israel-Palestinian relations at a low point, such a release
would be aimed at building confidence and getting peace efforts
back on track.
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago, and at the urging of the
Clinton administration, the two sides have been holding direct
meetings for the past 11 days to try to revive them.
	   So far, no breakthrough has occurred but negotiators continued
to meet Thursday.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat held three hours of
talks with Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho on the scope of a long
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank and an American
peace proposal aimed at seeing it through.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians were waiting to see Israeli maps of
proposed withdrawal areas. ``Today the Israelis told us they
understood our position, but they had security considerations and
fears, and that they were studying the maps,'' Erekat said. The
sides agreed that more talks would be scheduled shortly.
	   Both Erekat and netanyahu also met separately with the European
Union's Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos, to discuss the peace talks.

Italian prime minister withholds criticism of Slovakia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Italy's prime minister visited
Slovakia Thursday, praising the economy, but avoiding any criticism
of his Slovak counterpart for his controversial policies towards
NATO and the European Union.
	   Romano Prodi is the only western prime minister to visit Slovak
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, since his government manipulated a
referendum on joining NATO and direct election election of a
president.
	   ``The main principle of my visit abroad is to not interfere in
internal matters of a country,'' Prodi told reporters at a join
newsconference following a meeting with Meciar where the two signed
several bilateral agreements.
	   Both men also addressed a business forum of Slovak and Italian
entrepreneurs and managers of large Slovak companies, where Prodi
praised Slovakia's economic development.
	   ``I'm full of admiration,'' Prodi told the audience. ``This
country has made exceptional results, in spite of the bad prospects
everyone had predicted back when Czechoslovakia split.''
	   Earlier in the day, the two signed a treaty on the protection of
investment, aimed at providing legal guarantees for Italian
businessmen and ease their operation in Slovakia.
	   Prodi, who was traveling with Italian businessmen, said Slovakia
is interesting to Italians, not only for its internal market but
also as a ``bridge'' to Ukraine and Russia.

Tour escapes to Switzerland, but scandal widens; Belgian wins stage

<TEXT>
	   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) _ After one of the most turbulent
days in its history, the scandal-plagued Tour de France escaped
Thursday to peaceful Switzerland, where fans tinkled cowbells along
the road and officials promised there wouldn't be any late-night
drug raids.
	   But despite the bucolic surroundings, the athletes couldn't
escape news of the widening doping scandal, which continued to
claim new victims in the world's biggest cycling event.
	   Three more teams pulled out to protest police behavior, and
investigators for the first time prevented a cyclist from competing
after finding drugs in his possession.
	   When the 18th stage was over, Tom Steels of Belgium had won, but
the overall standings remained the same. Italy's Marco Pantani
retained the yellow jersey. Bobby Julich of the United States held
onto second place, followed by last year's winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany.
	   Before Thursday's start, there was uncertainty as to whether the
race would go on at all. Many riders, angered at the growing
investigation, had threatened to pull out entirely. But in the end,
103 of them left the French Alpine town of Aix-les-Bains for a
218-kilometer ride through stunning countryside to to Neuchatel,
Switzerland.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   But most of the attention was back in France.
	   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, police in Chambery, near
Aix-les-Bains, detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team, the
leader in mountain climbing standings. They found banned drugs in
his room, said prosecutors in the northern city of Lille, where the
probe is centered.
	   They also found drugs in a truck belonging to the Spanish ONCE
team _ one of five that has dropped out of the race in protest, the
prosecutors said. Its doctor, Nicolas Terrados, was detained.
	   And after a night in detention, a third man, Marc Madiot,
director of the French team Francaise des Jeux, was released.
	   Earlier, two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, angrily quit the
field, joining the other three Spanish teams, who quit Wednesday. A
sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17 after police found
dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the current scandal.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
	   Riders at the finish line said they were trying to put the
scandal behind them, and think ahead to Sunday's finale on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After stopping twice, the pack coasted slowly to the finish
line, and the stage results were canceled. Riders threatened to
give up entirely, but by Thursday morning, they seemed to realize
the enormity of stopping the race in protest for the first time
since its 1903 debut.
	   ``We were all afraid to give up after 20 days of racing,'' said
Marco Pantani, who leads the race. ``I've made sacrifices to get
the yellow jersey.''
	   Fans lining the route through eastern France made their
sentiments clear.
	   ``Free Festina!'' one banner said. Another read: ``The wheels of
justice move, and heroes are killed.''
	   Once the race crossed into Switzerland, with its pristine lakes,
mountains, chalets, and kids ringing cowbells, the banners were
just as blunt. ``It's hypocrisy!'' said one.
	   Swiss organizing official Jean Cavadini went on the radio to
promise the riders a peaceful, raid-free night in Neuchatel. But he
added: ``I fear the celebration has been spoiled, ever since the
first week.''
	   Swiss fans, though, were determined not to let that happen.
Jeannette Etamba, 28, brought her 4-month-old son to drink in the
scene at the finish line.
	   ``Doping is deceitful, but the scandal hasn't destroyed the
atmosphere for us,'' she said minutes before the exhausted riders,
glistening with sweat, crossed the finish line. ``We brought our
sandwiches and our iced tea, and we're going to cheer the riders
and then go swimming.''

Kafelnikov and Muster ousted at Generali Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Defending champion Filip DeWulf of
Belgium needed just 57 minutes Thursday to rout Austria's Thomas
Muster in straight sets at the Generali Open.
	   But Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador, ranked 62nd in the world,
pulled the biggest upset in the third round of the dlrs 535,000
tournament. He ousted the seventh-ranked Russian, Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, 6-4, 6-1.
	   Kafelnikov, the former French Open champion, was the top seed
left after Marcelo Rios pulled out with an injury.
	   DeWulf, seeded 10th, rolled past an erratic Muster, another
former French Open champion, 6-2, 6-4. Last year, the Belgium
player captured his second career title at the tournament as a 12th
seed.
	   ``That was one of the weakest matches of my career,'' said a
disgusted Muster, seeded fifth.
	   Spain's Albert Costa, the third seed, avoided the upset trend by
struggling past France's Stephane Huet, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. His
compatriot, Francisco Clavet, ended the run of Austria's Markus
Hipl, ranked 266th, with a 6-1, 6-4 win.
	   Hipl beat Spain's Galo Blanco, then stunned Morocco's
42nd-ranked Hicham Arazi in straight sets in the second round.
	   Hipl broke Clavet's serve early, but squandered several other
chances to repeat the feat. Afterwards the Spaniard ran off nine
straight games.
	   ``I played well today. I noticed Hipl was getting tired, which
was why I went for long rallies,'' said Clavet.

Basketball Championship.
	   Zeljko Rebraca, the 2.11-meter (7-foot) center from Italian club
Benetton Treviso, led 1990 world champion Yugoslavia with 23
points. Bodiroga added 16, with 14 from the line.
	   The thrilling game lived up to its billing as one of the 16-team
tournament's premier matchups.
	   ``We always had the thought that we might lose the game and that
mind-set resulted in us winning it,'' Yugoslavia coach Zeljko
Obradovic said.
	   His team trailed most of the game, but rallied behind strong
defensive play. By putting more emphasis on perimeter defense,
Yugslavia held Russia to two field goals in the last seven minutes
of regulation, which ended 68-68.
	   ``We don't have the players that can handle the pressure in the
final minutes and not make the turnovers,'' Russia coach Sergei
Belov said.
	   The victory gives Yugoslavia control of preliminary round Group
B with a 2-0 record. Russia and Puerto Rico are 1-1, with winless
Japan last.
	   Russia, which got 20 points from Vassily Karassev, had four
players foul out.
	   Igor Koudelin hit back-to-back 3-pointers as Russia used a 10-2
run to close the first half with a 40-33 lead.

Tour escapes to Switzerland, but scandal widens; Belgian wins stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) _ After one of the most turbulent
days in its history, the scandal-plagued Tour de France escaped
Thursday to peaceful Switzerland, where fans tinkled cowbells along
the road and officials promised there wouldn't be any late-night
drug raids.
	   But despite the bucolic surroundings, the athletes couldn't
escape news of the widening doping scandal, which continued to
claim new victims in the world's biggest cycling event.
	   Three more teams pulled out to protest police behavior, and
investigators for the first time prevented a cyclist from competing
after finding drugs in his possession.
	   When the 18th stage was over, Tom Steels of Belgium had won, but
the overall standings remained the same. Italy's Marco Pantani
retained the yellow jersey. Bobby Julich of the United States held
onto second place, followed by last year's winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany.
	   Before Thursday's start, there was uncertainty as to whether the
race would go on at all. Many riders, angered at the growing
investigation, had threatened to pull out entirely. But in the end,
103 of them left the French Alpine town of Aix-les-Bains for a
218-kilometer (134.5 mile) ride through stunning countryside to to
Neuchatel, Switzerland.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   But most of the attention was back in France.
	   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, police in Chambery, near
Aix-les-Bains, detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team, the
leader in mountain climbing standings. They found banned drugs in
his room, said prosecutors in the northern city of Lille, where the
probe is centered.
	   They also found drugs in a truck belonging to the Spanish ONCE
team _ one of five that has dropped out of the race in protest, the
prosecutors said. Its doctor, Nicolas Terrados, was detained.
	   And after a night in detention, a third man, Marc Madiot,
director of the French team Francaise des Jeux, was released.
	   Earlier, two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, angrily quit the
field, joining the other three Spanish teams, who quit Wednesday. A
sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17 after police found
dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the current scandal.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
	   Riders at the finish line said they were trying to put the
scandal behind them, and think ahead to Sunday's finale on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After stopping twice, the pack coasted slowly to the finish
line, and the stage results were canceled. Riders threatened to
give up entirely, but by Thursday morning, they seemed to realize
the enormity of stopping the race in protest for the first time
since its 1903 debut.
	   ``We were all afraid to give up after 20 days of racing,'' said
Marco Pantani, who leads the race. ``I've made sacrifices to get
the yellow jersey.''
	   Fans lining the route through eastern France made their
sentiments clear.
	   ``Free Festina!'' one banner said. Another read: ``The wheels of
justice move, and heroes are killed.''
	   Once the race crossed into Switzerland, with its pristine lakes,
mountains, chalets, and kids ringing cowbells, the banners were
just as blunt. ``It's hypocrisy!'' said one.
	   Swiss organizing official Jean Cavadini went on the radio to
promise the riders a peaceful, raid-free night in Neuchatel. But he
added: ``I fear the celebration has been spoiled, ever since the
first week.''
	   Swiss fans, though, were determined not to let that happen.
Jeannette Etamba, 28, brought her 4-month-old son to drink in the
scene at the finish line.
	   ``Doping is deceitful, but the scandal hasn't destroyed the
atmosphere for us,'' she said minutes before the exhausted riders,
glistening with sweat, crossed the finish line. ``We brought our
sandwiches and our iced tea, and we're going to cheer the riders
and then go swimming.''

Conoco reports evidence of oil near Barbados
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Texas oil firm Continental Oil
Company Inc. has found evidence of oil and natural gas reserves off
the southeastern coast of Barbados, the government reported
Thursday.
	   The Houston-based firm, also known as Conoco, is preparing a
dlrs 5 million series of seismic tests in the area after a dlrs 1.3
million preliminary study proved positive, the government said in a
statement.
	   Oil fields in the eastern part of Barbados already produce up to
1,500 barrels a day and fulfill about 30 percent of the country's
requirements.
	   Conoco said it had also found high-quality source rock in open
seas between Barbados and the region of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.
	   The government said it would probably grant the company a long
lease to drill for oil.

Keizo Obuchi declared Japan's new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with US comment in grafs 17-18 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Putting down a challenge from a more popular
opposition leader, ruling party favorite Keizo Obuchi rolled to
victory in the race for prime minister in Parliament on Thursday,
taking power in a country grappling with political divisions and a
souring economy.
	   The new government moved quickly to win voters' confidence and
reassure worried markets, vowing decisive action and announcing an
``economic reform Cabinet'' with a party economics expert as
finance minister, a key position in plans to power Japan out of
recession.
	   ``I'm happy to have such an excellent Cabinet, but at the same
time I feel a heavy responsibility,'' Obuchi told reporters early
Friday after meeting with Cabinet members.
	   Obuchi, 61, takes office with a weak mandate. He succeeds party
colleague Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced to resign after a
painful electoral defeat, and emerged as the Liberal Democratic
Party nominee last week only after a bruising battle with party
reformists.
	   Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled lower house Thursday,
winning 268 votes of the 497 ballots cast. But the
opposition-dominated upper house chose Democratic Party leader
Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   The opposition cried that Obuchi's victory did not reflect the
will of the people and called for immediate general elections to
elect a new Parliament. The opposition triumphed in July 12
elections for the upper house and figure a quick vote for the other
chamber would yield similar results.
	   Kan predicted the new government would not be successful.
	   ``I don't think they'll be able to come up with aggressive
measures without having the support of the people,'' he told
reporters.
	   Despite the problems, former Foreign Minister Obuchi was
ebullient. He smiled in satisfaction during the Parliament vote and
bowed when the lower house results were announced. He then made the
rounds for traditional greetings at the offices of political
parties, and presented his Cabinet before Emperor Akihito. He was
not expected to speak to reporters until Friday.
	   The new prime minister, however, is considered by many to be too
entrenched in the conservative ways of the LDP _ which has held the
premiership for 40 of the past 43 years _ to take the bold,
innovative steps needed to solve the structural flaws of the
Japanese economy.
	   Obuchi worked hard over the past week to turn that image around,
heavily lobbying former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the
finance minister's job. Miyazawa, 78, is respected as an economics
expert and is an architect of the government's plan to bail out its
debt-laden banking system.
	   Though it is uncertain if Miyazawa, a long-time party
powerbroker, would deliver any bold initiatives, talk that he would
be chosen buoyed markets. Tokyo stocks slumped on Monday, the first
session after Obuchi's selection as LDP leader, but then rallied
later in the week as Miyazawa emerged as the choice for finance.
	   On Thursday, Miyazawa, who served as prime minister from 1991 to
1993, vowed action.
	   ``We must get our work done as quickly as possible within the
limited amount of time we are given,'' he told reporters.
	   The economy is in bad need of quick remedies. The New York Times
on Thursday reported that U.S. officials and private financial
experts estimate Japanese banks suffer from nearly dlrs 1 trillion
in bad loans _ almost twice the official number. Japanese officials
had no immediate reaction to the report, which was based on
accounts of unidentified sources, though some analysts have
suspected for years that the bad debts could approach such a
figure.
	   In Washington, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
refused to comment on the report, but said the Clinton
administration hopes the new government will move quickly to boost
economic growth, deal with serious problems in the banking sector
and accelerate deregulation efforts.
	   ``These economic imperatives remain present with the political
changes,'' Summers said. ``We hope the new Japanese government will
move rapidly and effectively in each of these areas.''
	   Obuchi has already proposed what many economists say are needed:
tax cuts and spending. He plans to cut income taxes by 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption. Also on the agenda is a clean up of the
troubled banking sector.
	   Despite talk of revolt in his own party, the LDP showed unity
Thursday in backing Obuchi. Even former Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi, a party maverick who challenged Obuchi for the LDP
presidency, called for support for the new government.
	   ``It's not a question of believing in the new administration or
not,'' he said. ``We have to believe in it and we have to work
toward the end of solving Japan's financial crisis.''
	   There were few surprises in the new Cabinet lineup, which was
chosen from among party veterans.
	   Two that stood out, however, were Taichi Sakaiya, a writer and
former bureaucrat, who was named director-general of the Economic
Planning Agency, and the Cabinet's only woman, Seiko Noda, named as
post and telecommunications minister. The 37-year-old is the
youngest Cabinet minister in Japanese history.

Preliminary report says no fire on plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A preliminary report on the June 26 plane
crash that killed the U.N. special representative for Angola and
seven other people indicates there was no explosion or fire before
the plane crashed in Ivory Coast, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
investigators couldn't rule out foul play but believed the cause of
the crash was an accident.
	   A full investigation will take six months or longer to complete,
U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said Thursday. But a preliminary
report, conveyed to the Security Council on Thursday, indicates
that there was no fire or blast before the crash.
	   Because of the size and type of the plane, neither a flight data
recorder nor a cockpit voice recorder were required to be
installed, he said.
	   The plane from Lome, Togo was attempting to land at Abidjan's
airport on the evening of June 26 and had been in contact with the
air traffic control tower up until it crashed, Brandt said.
	   ``These communications gave no indication that the flight was
proceeding in other than the normal manner,'' he said.
	   The U.N. special representative for Angola, Alioune Blondin
Beye, five members of the U.N. Angola mission and two pilots
perished in the crash.
	   Beye mediated the 1994 peace accord that ended the civil war
between government troops and the former rebel movement UNITA. He
had been trying to get support from African leaders to implement it
in the face of UNITA resistance to hand over its territories and
demobilize its troops when he died.
	   Since his death, hostilities have increased in the south African
nation.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The holding company of the Benetton family,
Edizione Holding SpA, said Thursday it has bought four percent of
Pirelli and C., the main holding company for tire and cable maker
Pirelli SpA.
	   A spokesman for Edizione Holding said the family acquired the
stake for investment purposes only and has no intention to increase
it.
	   Edizione Holding Spa owns 69.5 percent of Benetton SpA, a
leading manufacturer of clothing with retail stores worldwide.
	   The share-ownership structure of Pirelli and C. and Pirelli SpA
is in the process of streamlining. At year-end, Pirelli and C. will
own at least 30 percent of Pirelli SpA equity and at least 35
percent of its voting rights.

Kabbah seeks help to maintain troops, security

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sierra Leone's newly restored president
appealed to world leaders Thursday to keep troops in the devastated
West African country and help it rebuild itself after 30 years of
coups and violence.
	   Ahmed Tejan Kabbah said, it is important to maintain the West
African coalition army which drove Lt. Col. Johnny Koroma's
military junta from power more than six months ago and is trying to
keep his allies from attacking civilians.
	   ``We cannot talk about peace-building without reference to the
material elements _ the blocks, mortars and tools _ needed for the
foundation of a solid structure of national development,'' he said
at a special conference Thursday on rebuilding Sierra Leone.
	   ``We fear that unless assistance for (the troops) is
forthcoming, as a matter of urgency, rebel activities will not only
continue and create more human tragedy, but will also drain our
limited resources,'' Kabbah said.
	   In addition, he said Sierra Leone urgently needed ``continued
humanitarian assistance, including medicines, health care serves
and food.''
	   British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said his government
could give up to 6.5 million pounds (dlrs 10.4 million) over two
years, in addition to the 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.2 million)
already provided, to help Sierra Leone maintain its security and
troops.
	   Since Kabbah was restored to power, former junta members and
their rebels allies have been killing, maiming and raping thousands
of civilians in remote areas.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who gave the opening speech,
took note of the plight of Sierra Leone's citizens.
	   ``Since last March, 500 victims of mutilations _ including
amputations _ have been admitted to hospitals. And they may be the
lucky ones,'' Annan said. ``It has been estimated that for every
one victim able to obtain assistance, four or five civilians have
died or remain in the bush terrified of meeting another human
being.''
	   A Human Rights Watch report released Tuesday said Kabbah's
forces have also taken part in extrajudicial killings and torture
of rebels soldiers and their suspected allies.
	   Kabbah said his government has been treating former junta
members fairly.
	   ``I am proud to say that Sierra Leone as a nation, under the
present democratically elected government, is based on the rule of
law,'' Kabbah said.
	   Kabbah insisted that his government has ``resisted the popular
clamor for revenge'' but noted that some former junta members and
their allies surrendered for fear of their personal safety, ``and
for fear that the citizens against whom they had perpetrated much
atrocities, might take revenge.''
	   Kabbah said trials for junta members are ``transparent and
fair.''
	   ``They are held in public, with the accused persons given every
opportunity and facility to defend themselves,'' he said.
	   Annan said he was ``particularly encouraged'' by the
government's recent decision to offer an amnesty for child soldiers
from all combatant groups.
	   The Security Council recently agreed to send military observers
to Sierra Leone to help disarm warring factions.

Kosovo's refugees: In hiding or on the run

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds hide in a crumbling stone
farmhouse. Others wander from village to village for food by day
but sleep in the woods at night. A shelter of tree branches feels
more secure than a village, feared as a target of more shooting,
more bombing, more burning.
	   Some 20,000 ethnic Albanian civilians are on the run after a
six-day Serb offensive against Albanian rebels. Aid groups made
another attempt to reach refugees on Thursday. For days, Serb
police have blocked them from driving up into hills where thousands
of terrified people have fled.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told diplomats he had
ordered an end to the recent onslaught on the Kosovo Liberation
Army. The loosely organized guerrilla group seeks independence for
Kosovo, a province in the Serb republic of Yugoslavia where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   The Serb operation cleared two strategic arteries of KLA
fighters, as well as Albanian civilians. Roads open to traffic for
the first time in months are now desolate, rural villages vacant of
all but emaciated cows and horses. Mortar fire blasted roofs from
dozens of red-brick houses. Serb forces apparently set some
villages on fire, leaving behind charred walls and the acrid smell
of smoke.
	   After visiting Kosovo, a European delegation said Thursday it
was dismayed with the level of destruction by Serb forces, which it
called ``an excessive use of military force ... totally out of
proportion with military targets.''
	   ``What has been created is literally a wasteland,'' German
diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said.
	   In southern hills over Malisevo, a KLA headquarter town emptied
by the fighting, thousands of refugees were hiding in a labryinth
of small villages.
	   Women wearing long skirts and head scarves chopped tomatoes and
baked flat bread in one village Wednesday, using flour saved by a
local farmer to feed hundreds of people living in a courtyard and
stone house. The farmer said he had enough food for another week.
	   New arrivals trudged the winding dirt roads looking for space in
villages already overflowing with people. A tractor-pulled wagon
carried an elderly woman holding a black umbrella as shelter from
the piercing sun.
	   Some refugees sleep in the woods on blankets or thin mattresses
because they claim the villages are unsafe. Rumors whispered among
the refugees say that this or that village is next on a Serb
``list'' for destruction. People pleaded with visiting reporters
not to identify villages for fear of becoming targets.
	   They speak of ``ethnic cleansing,'' of a Serb push to wipe the
mostly Muslim Albanian population from the face of Kosovo. Other
rumors passed among refugees claim that Serbs have butchered
civilians in recent fighting, particularly in the town of Orahovac
last week.
	   Serb police say no Albanian civilians have been killed. The
wildly differing reports are nearly impossible to rectify in
Kosovo, a region seared by centuries of ethnic hatred. Serbs accuse
the KLA of attrocities against their people, and Albanians claim
the opposite.
	   ``As you can see, the Serbs have trapped us,'' said Muharem
Telaku, a man living in the farmhouse. ``We were trying to defend
our homes but they are massacring us, killing our children.
	   ``We have no where left to go. We have no medicine, very little
food. And I hope the world will take notice.''
	   A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
contacted The Associated Press early Thursday morning asking for
the location of refugee villages. Serb police barred refugee
workers Wednesday from moving outside the strict police control of
Malisevo, the representative said.
	   An refugee worker who asked not to be identified said smaller
aid agencies have been driving the back roads of Kosovo, evading
police blockades in their search for refugees.
	   Five months of war have driven an estimated 130,000 people from
their homes, according to the U.N. refugee group. Thirty-thousand
ethnic Albanians have crossed borders into Albanian, Macedonia or
Montenegro. The rest are still in Kosovo, on the run or living with
relatives.
	   ``While Milosevic has confirmed to us the willingness of his
government to make the return of civilians possible, it's quite
difficult for us to see how this can be achieved,'' said Ischinger,
the German diplomat.

Appeal Court quashes murder conviction of teen hanged 45 years ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It was a case that hinged on a single disputed
remark: ``Let him have it, Chris.''
	   Forty-five years ago, 19-year-old Derek Bentley went to the
gallows for supposedly uttering that phrase to his friend
Christopher Craig, who shot a police constable dead on the roof of
the confectionery warehouse they were trying to rob.
	   On Thursday, the Appeal Court ruled Bentley was innocent, ending
a decades-long campaign by his family to clear his name, even if
they could not save his life.
	   ``Today is a great victory of British justice,'' said an
emotional Maria Dingwall-Bentley, whose mother, Iris, was Bentley's
sister.
	   But the day was ``tinged with great sadness'' that her mother,
who died of cancer in January 1997, could not be there, Ms.
Dingwall-Bentley said.
	   ``It is also tinged by the fact that Derek cannot walk free,''
she said.
	   Lord Bingham, Lord Chief Justice of the Appeal Court and head of
the three-judge panel that overturned the conviction, said the
summing-up by the judge at Bentley's 1953 trial _ which laid great
stress on the ``Let him have it'' remark _ was prejudicial and
unfair.
	   ``It must be a matter of profound and continuing regret that
this mistrial occurred,'' Bingham said.
	   The controversy over Bentley's hanging made him a household name
in Britain.
	   The youth, who developed epilepsy after being injured in a World
War II air raid, was unable to read or write, and had a mental age
of 11. Although younger by three years, Craig was able to dominate
his friend.
	   The pair were on the roof of the south London warehouse on Nov.
2, 1952, when they were challenged by police officers.
	   Craig, who nurtured a hatred for the police after his brother
was jailed for armed robbery, fired his gun several times, killing
Constable Sidney Miles with a single bullet.
	   Three officers said later they heard Bentley call out to Craig,
``Let him have it, Chris,'' a remark interpreted as an
encouragement to Craig to fire.
	   At the pair's Old Bailey trial, there was contradictory evidence
as to whether Bentley knew Craig was carrying a gun. One policeman
who was at the scene also later denied Bentley made the ``Let him
have it'' remark _ which both Bentley and Craig also insisted was
never uttered.
	   In his summing-up, the judge made no mention of Bentley's mental
problems, paid the police lavish praise and laid great stress on
the remark, leaving the jury little option but to convict, Bingham
said.
	   ``Far from encouraging the jury to approach the case in a calm
frame of mind, the trial judge's summing up ... had exactly the
opposite effect,'' he said.
	   Unusual in such cases, jurors made a plea for clemency.
	   The trial judge, Lord Goddard, died in 1971. On Thursday, his
daughter, Lady Sachs, said he always believed the death sentence
imposed on Bentley was ``fair and just.'' But she added that her
father was ``always willing to recognize that there might be two
opinions.''
	   The case, dramatized in a 1991 feature film called ``Let Him
Have It,'' is one of a series of British miscarriages of justice
that have come to light in recent years and brought calls for a
public inquiry.
	   It also provided a grim reminder of the final nature of the
death penalty, abolished in Britain in 1965.
	   Ms. Dingwall-Bentley, 35, said the family will now seek
financial compensation from the government.
	   Bentley was hanged at Wandsworth Prison in London on Jan. 28,
1953. Too young to be executed, Craig spent 10 years in prison.
	   Now 61, Craig welcomed the judges' decision.
	   ``A day does not go by when I don't think about Derek, and now
his innocence has been proved,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, those had fought more than four decades to clear
Derek Bentley's name laid flowers on his grave in south London's
Croydon Cemetery, where he lies next to his sister.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police fired tear gas as opposition
activists hurled crude bombs and fought with police during a
general strike to condemn the death of a university student in
police custody. At least 70 people were injured, witnesses said.
	   The dawn-to-dusk strike halted traffic and shut down businesses
in Dhaka, the capital, as public anger grew after Shamim Reza Rubel
was picked up near the university last week for reportedly having
illegal arms and allegedly tortured to death by plainclothes
policemen.
	   Thursday's protest was first called by the country's main
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its six right-wing
allies. They have accused Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
two-year-old government of incompetence and repression.
	   In further embarrassment to Hasina, one of her allies, the
Jatiya Party, also backed the strike.
	   During the strike, protesters attacked the police headquarters
and set off small explosives in different parts of the city. Police
responded with tear gas. At least 30 activists were detained, a
police official said.
	   Police said ruling party lawmaker Habibur Rahman Mollah, elected
from the city suburb, was injured during clashes with opposition
party activists.
	   Schools, businesses, cinemas and theaters remained closed
because of the strike. But banks and government offices were open.
Traffic remained off the roads.
	   Seven policemen have been arrested in connection with the death
of the student. If convicted, they can be hanged to death.
	   Embarrassed by the death, Home Minister Rafiqul Islam said
Wednesday that a special tribunal will be set up for quick trial of
the offenders.
	   Police have sweeping powers to arrest anyone for questioning.
Human rights groups accuse the police of regularly torturing people
to extract confessions.
	   At least 41 suspects have died in police custody in the past
year, according to the independent Bangladesh Human Rights
Commission.

Albanian TV broadcasts appeal for refugee corridor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Albanian television broadcast an appeal
Thursday in the name of the ``population'' of neighboring Kosovo
for the international community to open a humanitarian corridor to
rush food, medicine and other supplies to Albanian civilians caught
up in the fighting.
	   Tens of thousands of civilians, mostly Albanians, are believed
to have displaced by the recent fighting in Kosovo, where Albanian
rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army are fighting for independence
from Serbia.
	   During its daily half-hour newscast on the Kosovo situation,
Albanian television said ``the population'' called on international
humanitarian organizations to establish a ``corridor'' for bringing
aid to the children, the wounded and the pregnant women.
	   On Thursday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told European
diplomats in Belgrade that the Serb offensive against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo is over and that he is ready to talk peace.
	   The EU diplomats, who visited the embattled Serbian province
Wednesday, said they saw extensive destruction caused by Serb
forces.
	   ``The impression our mission got is quite a devastating one,''
said German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. ``For over three hours of
driving around in villages and towns, we have not encountered a
single Albanian civilian. What we saw was an empty country, a
wasteland ... quite a bit of destruction of property.''

seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   The study, which aims to provide a clearer picture of economic
policy during the war, is already under way, bank spokesman Gabriel
Juri said. He declined to give further details.
	   Studies in recent months have said the central bank should have
known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi Germany during
the war had been looted from the national treasuries of occupied
countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds) of
gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   During the war, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold in
the face of demand for the Swiss franc, the only internationally
acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   The central bank has said it will oppose vigorously any
class-action suit filed against it. The Swiss government called the
suit, filed last month, ``unacceptable.''
	   Both have refused to become involved in negotiations over a
settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups
and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders said the banks
should be paying more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   An open letter obtained by The Associated Press, to appear in
the New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times over the
next week, reiterated Swiss arguments against sanctions.
	   The letter, addressed to U.S. President Bill Clinton, was signed
``members of the Swiss business community,'' but no names or
companies are mentioned.
	   It expressed concern that sanctions against Swiss firms ``could
trigger a vicious circle of threats and counter-measures.''
	   Meanwhile, the Swiss government said President Flavio Cotti will
meet on Sept. 7 with some 12 officials from major Swiss companies,
as well as central bank and government officials, to discuss the
sanctions threats.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on the International Monetary Fund:
	   The International Monetary Fund assumes the central role in
coordinating international support for financially troubled
countries. But fears are growing that it is running short of cash,
just as the currency and financial crisis is spreading from East
Asia to Russia. ...
	   Most member countries, including Japan, are ready to pay their
dues, once their respective legislative bodies have approved the
contributions. Despite this, the agreed funding increment has been
held back by the United States. That country contributes 17.5
percent of the IMF's funding _ the largest among member states. The
administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has still not
received approval from Congress to pay its share.
	   The IMF needs to strengthen its financial footing so it can
improve its ability to resolve a currency and financial crisis of
global proportions. We urge Washington to pay its share as soon as
it receives congressional approval.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times, London, on U.S. presidents:
	   After six years in office all American Presidents become
enthusiastic historians. Their place in political memory emerges as
an all-pervasive obsession. This must be especially true for Bill
Clinton, a man who can expect three decades or more of life as a
former resident of the White House. He has been dogged by personal
and political scandal throughout his entire period of power. The
next few weeks will determine whether such controversies will be
the defining feature of the Clinton era.
	   At the outset of this scandal the obvious comparisons were with
Watergate and the Iran-Contra fiasco. The Lewinsky affair will
probably fall between the two. Ronald Reagan's managerial methods
were severely criticized as a result of Iran-Contra, but his
reputation for personal integrity remained intact. The affair only
partly damaged his political legacy. President Richard Nixon was
brought down by what he described as a ``third-rate burglary.'' His
reputation, despite intense efforts, never fully recovered. Clinton
will almost certainly remain in the White House until January 2001.
Starr and his grand jury will largely determine whether he then
departs Washington with dignity or in disgrace.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Independent, London, on Kosovo:
	   What is happening now in Kosovo is sickening. Thousands of
civilians are on the move, driven from their homes by Serbian
forces who are fighting a ruthless war against Kosovan separatists.
	   It is particularly alarming because it is exactly what was
predicted. Two months ago, the panjandrums of the new world order,
President Clinton and Secretary Albright, wrung their hands and
urgently reviewed the situation, ably supported by the
practitioners of ethical foreign policy, Prime Minister Blair and
Foreign Secretary Cook. There was going to be a conference.
Military plans were being drawn up. We were allowed to believe that
further Serbian aggression would be met by the threat of force from
NATO. What has happened? Nothing, apart from unsuccessful
negotiations led by Richard Holbrooke, Mr. Clinton's Balkan envoy.
Negotiations, and the ominous rolling of Serbian tanks. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Figaro newspaper, Paris, on famine in Sudan:
	   Famine has the same face everywhere. It's always the same empty
look of dead living children with a big skull and a protruding
stomach. And faced with such suffering, it's always the same
powerlessness that one feels.
	   We have seen these unbearable images in Biafra and then in
Ethiopia and now in Sudan. Once again, it is necessary to be
reminded that drought cannot explain such a great catastrophe, even
less so in a country that was the breadbasket of Africa. ... In
Sudan, as often elsewhere, famine is not simply a twist of fate. It
is, of course, the product of drought and the result of an exodus
due to war. But it is also calamity controlled, organized and
programmed by the fighters. One sign doesn't fool. In both camps,
there are men old enough to make war, soldiers or rebels. They are
well nourished. To eat, you don't need to be a woman or a child.
It's enough to be well armed. And humanitarian organizations can't
do anything against that.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on drugs at
Olympics:
	   If president of the International Olympic Committee Juan Antonio
Samaranch gets his way at the special conference on doping in
January, the Sydney Olympics could become the drug Olympics.
	   That is the likely outcome if there is a `drastic' cut in the
number of banned drugs and an easing of restriction on those drugs
which can be used by athletes. (Such changes) will merely encourage
athletes to cheat and team officials to devise masking techniques
that will allow the cheating to go undetected.
	   Samaranch is a politician of exceptional ability and shrewdness.
Nothing he says or does is without a reason. Everything is
carefully calculated to develop and enrich the Olympic Games brand.
He is misguided, however, if he believes that the Olympic brand
will be enhanced with fewer athletes being exposed as drug cheats _
because of a drug-testing regime that is designed not to catch
cheats _ when everyone knows that drug-taking is rampant. ...

	   Aftonbladet, Stockholm, on the withdrawal of aid organizations
from Afghanistan:
	   ... The most rabid anti-Western forces can be encouraged by the
aid workers' retreat. But when the regime physically hinders women
from going to hospitals, to work outside the home and at aid
organizations? When absurd obstacles are piled up, when health
clinics are forbidden from using depictions of the human body
because they are impious, what is left to be done?
	   Aid donors can have other views than than the recipient land on,
for example, women's participation in society. As long as various
opinions in some way can be exchanged or `compete,' it is
defensible to stand up for aid even under the toughest opposition.
	   But in the Taliban's Afghanistan, it is a matter of a system
using diktat and violence to separate women's society from men's,
and deviation is not allowed in even the most mild forms.
	   If aid people's work helps people for the moment but in the long
run only contributes to locking them into a loathsome system, then
the limit has been reached.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Temps, Geneva, on the Tour de France drug scandal:
	   What is shocking about the admissions of those who are speaking
is the hypocrisy of those who are denying everything and keeping
quiet.
	   Who can still believe that a single team doctor, a single
sporting director, a single event organizer knows nothing?
	   Given that, the game that has been playing out is taking on the
appearance of a sad farce.
	   On one side, legal authorities carry on their painstaking and
slow quest for a a secret which appears day after day in the media.
	   On the other, is the management of the Tour, which is trying to
hold out until Sunday, until (the tour arrives in) Paris, because
interests and an immense legend are at stake.
	   The public ... is on its side. It continues to applaud the
riders and has no interest whatsoever in their magic potions. ...
	   So everyone's taking drugs? Well, let them just say it!
	   The only way of saving the Tour from the moral abyss it has
fallen into would be that: a collective confession, a letter signed
by all the riders admitting that EPO is a daily reality for the
high-level cyclist.
	   It would be a gesture of loyalty toward their colleagues
expelled from the race, and a gesture of truth to the public.
	   For the riders themselves, it would be a gesture of courage. It
would be the end of this Tour, no doubt, but the sport would be
better for it.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on Malaysia:
	   The fact that Malaysia has not weathered the economic crisis as
well as it might have is due more to political factors than to weak
economic fundamentals.
	   Its Prime Minister acquired the unnerving habit of saying the
wrong things at the wrong time for the wrong reasons; Kuala Lumpur
issued confusing policy signals; and there have been hints of
disagreement at the top about matters like interest rates....
	   Though there is no doubting the seriousness of Malaysia's
economic predicament, the country has advantages that other Asian
Crisis economies do not have. It is not weighted down, as Thailand
and Indonesia are, by paralyzing large external debts. Its current
account has turned positive of late and longterm capital inflows,
including foreign direct investment, have remained modestly
healthy.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on U.S._Israel:
	   There are no limits, it seems, to how far the United States will
go to defend Israel and its interests. This week's U.S. government
decision to ban American satellite-imaging companies from taking
high-resolution pictures of Israel sharply illustrates the U.S.
commitment to protecting the Jewish state.
	   What is perplexing about the American decision is that no
country neighboring Israel has any intention, declared or
otherwise, to attack the Jewish state.
	   This bias in favor of Israel, which already has spy satellites
in space, will only lead to a race of a different nature in the
region, a space race of sorts. The countries of the region who used
to purchase their images from American companies will now resort to
putting their own satellites in orbit.
	   The U.S. should realize by now that Israel's security will not
be achieved by ensuring it has a military edge over all its
neighbours, nor by denying those neighbours the acquisition of all
the sophisticated equipment that Israel has.
	   Israel's only security is in its acceptance in the region. And
it will not be accepted nor will it live in peace as long as it
denies the Palestinians their national right. Nor will it live in
peace as long as it occupies Arab lands.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A preliminary report on the June 26 plane
crash that killed the U.N. special representative for Angola and
seven other people indicates there was no explosion or fire before
the plane crashed in Ivory Coast, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
investigators couldn't rule out foul play but believed the cause of
the crash was an accident.
	   A full investigation will take six months or longer to complete,
U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said Thursday. But a preliminary
report, conveyed to the Security Council on Thursday, indicates
that there was no fire or blast before the crash.
	   Because of the size and type of the plane, neither a flight data
recorder nor a cockpit voice recorder were required to be
installed, he said.
	   The plane from Lome, Togo was attempting to land at Abidjan's
airport on the evening of June 26 and had been in contact with the
air traffic control tower up until it crashed, Brandt said.
	   ``These communications gave no indication that the flight was
proceeding in other than the normal manner,'' he said.
	   The U.N. special representative for Angola, Alioune Blondin
Beye, five members of the U.N. Angola mission and two pilots
perished in the crash.
	   Beye mediated the 1994 peace accord that ended the civil war
between government troops and the former rebel movement UNITA. He
had been trying to get support from African leaders to implement it
in the face of UNITA resistance to hand over its territories and
demobilize its troops when he died.
	   Since his death, hostilities have worsened in the south African
nation, prompting the U.N. chief to send a top official, Lakhdar
Brahimi, to the country this weekend.
	   The Security Council on Thursday welcomed Brahimi's trip and
expressed their deep concern about the worsening violence in the
country, council president Sergey Lavrov said.
	   The council called upon both sides, but in particular UNITA, to
fulfill its obligations under the peace accord, he said.

<TEXT>
	   The Irish Times, Dublin, Ireland:
	   The murder of two security guards is, unfortunately, a common
enough occurrence in the United States and throughout the world.
...
	   The case of Russell Eugene Weston Jr., the man suspected of
Friday's murders, raises wider questions. He had come to the
attention of the Secret Service for threatening behavior in the
past. Diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic and described by
neighbors as being reasonable when on medication but aggressive
when not, Weston displayed many of the characteristics of a tiny
but menacing section of the American community...
	   Although there is evidence that such politically-centered
paranoia exists in far greater numbers in the United States than
had previously been believed, there is nothing to suggest that on a
per-capita basis Americans are more prone to such dangerous
delusions than any other nationality. What does cause anxiety,
however, is that the Secret Service decided that Weston should not
be regarded as a danger.
	   What gives even greater concern is that a man with such a
disturbed background found it possible, perhaps even easy, to
possess a six-shot .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver. Once
again the 'right,' based on pseudo-democratic argument, of all
citizens to bear arms has played a part in sending shock waves
through the halls of true democracy. Attempts, through the law, to
make it more difficult for dangerous people to get their hands on
dangerous weapons have been shown once more to have failed.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, on U.S. sanctions against
Pakistan:
	   The world market for wheat is glutted right now, and if U.S.
sanctions prevent Pakistan from buying American wheat, other
producers will happily fill the orders. The effect of the sanctions
would be to reward Canadian and Australian growers and punish
Northwest farmers.
	   A broader review of sanctions is in order. In the case of
Pakistan, the imposition and revocation of sanctions sends a mixed
message that undoubtedly will be read as a softening of U.S.
opposition to nuclear testing. It would have been better to choose
appropriate sanctions after the testing occurred, rather than
having to back away from sanctions that were automatically imposed
under the 1994 law.
	   The United States can clearly state its belief that Pakistan
should use it resources to feed its people, not to build nuclear
weapons. But denying Pakistan the opportunity to buy Northwest
wheat won't help make that point.
	    &UR; ___
	   St. Petersburg Times, St. Petersburg, Florida, on secret
evidence and deportation:
	   The Justice Department this month admitted it goofed when it
used secret evidence to obtain a deportation order for six Iraqis
accused of being national security risks. ...
	   But that admission was pried out of the department only after
three of the country's most powerful U.S. senators demanded a
briefing. ... The use of secret evidence makes a mockery of our
judicial process.
	   Since the World Trade Center bombing and the passage of the 1996
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, our government has
stepped up its use of secret evidence against aliens it views as
security risks. ... The six Iraqis were part of the opposition to
Saddam Hussein cultivated by the CIA. ...
	   If sent back to Iraq, they would all face certain execution. ...
	   This injustice incensed former CIA Director James Woolsey. He
offered to represent the six Iraqis pro bono and called on his
powerful friends in the Senate to review the case. ... Even more
startling was the paltry nature of the evidence released. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The New York Times, on President Bill Clinton and independent
prosecutor Kenneth Starr:
	   The White House spin that Kenneth Starr is a combination of
Javert and Clouseau played well on ``Meet the Press,'' but in the
end it probably harmed President Clinton by lulling him. ...
	   Now, within the last 10 days, Starr has closed the pincers of an
excruciating legal squeeze, collecting Secret Service testimony,
winning the right to question Bruce Lindsey and then signing
immunity deals with Monica Lewinsky and her mother. The residual
public-relations clout of the Presidency is so great that it would
be an overstatement to say that it is too late for Mr. Clinton to
save himself legally and build some kind of positive monument for
posterity. But no reasonable person in his position would dally any
longer before beginning a comeback. ...
	   If he can step free of legal trouble, including obstruction of
justice, Mr. Clinton can tackle the task of doing something
positive with his remaining days in office. That would involve a
full, ungrudging, verifiable explanation to the American people
about what has gone on with regard to Ms. Lewinsky and the other
matters under investigation. ...

Tour escapes to Switzerland, but scandal widens; Belgian wins stage

<TEXT>
	   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) _ After one of the most turbulent
days in its history, the scandal-plagued Tour de France escaped
Thursday to peaceful Switzerland, where fans tinkled cowbells along
the road and officials promised there wouldn't be any late-night
drug raids.
	   But despite the bucolic surroundings, the athletes couldn't
escape news of the widening doping scandal, which continued to
claim new victims in the world's biggest cycling event.
	   Two more teams pulled out to protest police behavior, and
investigators for the first time prevented a cyclist from competing
after finding drugs in his possession.
	   When the 18th stage was over, Tom Steels of Belgium had won, but
the overall standings remained the same. Italy's Marco Pantani
retained the yellow jersey. Bobby Julich of the United States held
onto second place, followed by last year's winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany.
	   Before Thursday's start, there was uncertainty as to whether the
race would go on at all. Many riders, angered at the growing
investigation, had threatened to pull out entirely. But in the end,
103 of them left the French Alpine town of Aix-les-Bains for a
218-kilometer (134.5 mile) ride through stunning countryside to to
Neuchatel, Switzerland.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   But most of the attention was back in France.
	   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, police in Chambery, near
Aix-les-Bains, detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team, the
leader in mountain climbing standings. They found banned drugs in
his room, said prosecutors in the northern city of Lille, where the
probe is centered.
	   They also found drugs in a truck belonging to the Spanish ONCE
team _ one of five that has dropped out of the race in protest, the
prosecutors said. Its doctor, Nicolas Terrados, was detained.
	   And after a night in detention, a third man, Marc Madiot,
director of the French team Francaise des Jeux, was released.
	   Earlier, two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, angrily quit the
field, joining two other Spanish teams and an Italian team, who
quit Wednesday. A sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17
after police found dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the
current scandal.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
	   Riders at the finish line said they were trying to put the
scandal behind them, and think ahead to Sunday's finale on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After stopping twice, the pack coasted slowly to the finish
line, and the stage results were canceled. Riders threatened to
give up entirely, but by Thursday morning, they seemed to realize
the enormity of stopping the race in protest for the first time
since its 1903 debut.
	   ``We were all afraid to give up after 20 days of racing,'' said
Marco Pantani, who leads the race. ``I've made sacrifices to get
the yellow jersey.''
	   Fans lining the route through eastern France made their
sentiments clear.
	   ``Free Festina!'' one banner said. Another read: ``The wheels of
justice move, and heroes are killed.''
	   Once the race crossed into Switzerland, with its pristine lakes,
mountains, chalets, and kids ringing cowbells, the banners were
just as blunt. ``It's hypocrisy!'' said one.
	   Swiss organizing official Jean Cavadini went on the radio to
promise the riders a peaceful, raid-free night in Neuchatel. But he
added: ``I fear the celebration has been spoiled, ever since the
first week.''
	   Swiss fans, though, were determined not to let that happen.
Jeannette Etamba, 28, brought her 4-month-old son to drink in the
scene at the finish line.
	   ``Doping is deceitful, but the scandal hasn't destroyed the
atmosphere for us,'' she said minutes before the exhausted riders,
glistening with sweat, crossed the finish line. ``We brought our
sandwiches and our iced tea, and we're going to cheer the riders
and then go swimming.''

Swiss central bank carries out own Nazi gold study

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank is
carrying out its own study to shed more light on its gold dealings
with Nazi Germany during World War II, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   The Swiss National Bank, charged with maintaining the strength
of the Swiss currency, faces a U.S. suit by Holocaust survivors
seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   The study, which aims to provide a clearer picture of economic
policy during the war, is already under way, bank spokesman Gabriel
Juri said. He declined to give further details.
	   Studies in recent months have said the central bank should have
known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi Germany during
the war had been looted from the national treasuries of occupied
countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds) of
gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   During the war, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold in
the face of demand for the Swiss franc, the only internationally
acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   The central bank has said it will oppose vigorously any
class-action suit filed against it. The Swiss government called the
suit, filed last month, ``unacceptable.''
	   Both have refused to become involved in negotiations over a
settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups
and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders said the banks
should be paying more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   The Swiss government said President Flavio Cotti will meet on
Sept. 7 with some 12 officials from major Swiss companies, as well
as central bank and government officials, to discuss the sanctions
threats.

	   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) _ After one of the most turbulent
days in its history, the scandal-plagued Tour de France escaped
Thursday to peaceful Switzerland, where fans tinkled cowbells along
the road and officials promised there wouldn't be any late-night
drug raids.
	   But despite the bucolic surroundings, the athletes couldn't
escape news of the widening doping scandal, which continued to
claim new victims in the world's biggest cycling event.
	   Two more teams pulled out to protest police behavior, and
investigators for the first time prevented a cyclist from competing
after finding drugs in his possession.
	   When the 18th stage was over, Tom Steels of Belgium had won, but
the overall standings remained the same. Italy's Marco Pantani
retained the yellow jersey. Bobby Julich of the United States held
onto second place, followed by last year's winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany.
	   Before Thursday's start, there was uncertainty as to whether the
race would go on at all. Many riders, angered at the growing
investigation, had threatened to pull out entirely. But in the end,
103 of them left the French Alpine town of Aix-les-Bains for a
218-kilometer (134.5 mile) ride through stunning countryside to to
Neuchatel, Switzerland.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   Steels, who races for Mapei-Bricobi, edged Erik Zabel of Germany
in a sprint finish to post his third stage victory of the Tour.
Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   But most of the attention was back in France.
	   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, police in Chambery, near
Aix-les-Bains, detained rider Rodolfo Massi of the Casino team, the
leader in mountain climbing standings. They found banned drugs in
his room, said prosecutors in the northern city of Lille, where the
probe is centered.
	   They also found drugs in a truck belonging to the Spanish ONCE
team _ one of five that has dropped out of the race in protest, the
prosecutors said. Its doctor, Nicolas Terrados, was detained.
	   And after a night in detention, a third man, Marc Madiot,
director of the French team Francaise des Jeux, was released.
	   Earlier, two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, angrily quit the
field, joining two other Spanish teams and an Italian team, who
quit Wednesday. A sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17
after police found dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the
current scandal.
	   Of the 21 teams that started this year's Tour, only 15 remain.
	   Riders at the finish line said they were trying to put the
scandal behind them, and think ahead to Sunday's finale on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After stopping twice, the pack coasted slowly to the finish
line, and the stage results were canceled. Riders threatened to
give up entirely, but by Thursday morning, they seemed to realize
the enormity of stopping the race in protest for the first time
since its 1903 debut.
	   ``We were all afraid to give up after 20 days of racing,'' said
Marco Pantani, who leads the race. ``I've made sacrifices to get
the yellow jersey.''
	   Fans lining the route through eastern France made their
sentiments clear.
	   ``Free Festina!'' one banner said. Another read: ``The wheels of
justice move, and heroes are killed.''
	   Once the race crossed into Switzerland, with its pristine lakes,
mountains, chalets, and kids ringing cowbells, the banners were
just as blunt. ``It's hypocrisy!'' said one.
	   Swiss organizing official Jean Cavadini went on the radio to
promise the riders a peaceful, raid-free night in Neuchatel. But he
added: ``I fear the celebration has been spoiled, ever since the
first week.''
	   Swiss fans, though, were determined not to let that happen.
Jeannette Etamba, 28, brought her 4-month-old son to drink in the
scene at the finish line.
	   ``Doping is deceitful, but the scandal hasn't destroyed the
atmosphere for us,'' she said minutes before the exhausted riders,
glistening with sweat, crossed the finish line. ``We brought our
sandwiches and our iced tea, and we're going to cheer the riders
and then go swimming.''

Israel considering release of 100 Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with negotiating session, fresh quotes, ADDS byline;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid efforts to restart peace talks, Israel may
release 100 Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture, officials
said Thursday.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is looking into the
request for a prisoner release made earlier this week by Yasser
Arafat's top deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, Kahalani's spokeswoman said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports the move and has
asked Kahalani to draw up a list of prisoners to be freed, the
daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak refused to comment on the
report.
	   Israel-Palestinian relations are at a low point, and a prisoner
release would be aimed at building confidence.
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago, and at the urging of the
Clinton administration, the two sides have been holding direct
meetings for the past 11 days to try to revive them.
	   So far, no breakthrough has occurred but negotiators continued
to meet Thursday.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat held three hours of
talks with Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho on the scope of a long
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank and a U.S peace
proposal aimed at seeing it through.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians were waiting to see Israeli maps of
proposed withdrawal areas.
	   ``Today the Israelis told us they understood our position, but
they had security considerations and fears, and that they were
studying the maps,'' Erekat said. The sides agreed that more talks
would be scheduled shortly.
	   Both Erekat and netanyahu also met separately with the European
Union's Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos, to discuss the peace talks.
	   Israel is under pressure to accept a U.S. peace initiative
calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already approved the initiative,
but Netanyahu is balking.
	   Lawmakers reproached Netanyahu on Wednesday over his handling of
the peace talks. They voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
preliminary measure that would help set the stage for early
elections.
	   Meanwhile, the Israeli army demolished four Palestinian homes
Thursday outside the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Human rights groups say the pace of such demolitions _ usually
carried out because a homebuilder lacked a permit _ has increased
sharply in recent months. Palestinians say it is almost impossible
for them to obtain building permits from Israel.
	   ``This is state terror _ this is Netanyahu's peace,'' said
32-year-old Ahmed Murqaktan, a father of eight whose home was among
those demolished Thursday.

Kosovo's refugees: In hiding or on the run

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds hide in a crumbling stone
farmhouse. Others wander from village to village for food by day
but sleep in the woods at night. A shelter of tree branches feels
more secure than a village, feared as a target of more shooting,
more bombing, more burning.
	   Some 20,000 ethnic Albanian civilians are on the run after a
six-day Serb offensive against Albanian rebels. Aid groups made
another attempt to reach refugees on Thursday. For days, Serb
police have blocked them from driving up into hills where thousands
of terrified people have fled.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told diplomats he had
ordered an end to the recent onslaught on the Kosovo Liberation
Army. The loosely organized guerrilla group seeks independence for
Kosovo, a province in the Serb republic of Yugoslavia where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   The Serb operation cleared two strategic arteries of KLA
fighters, as well as Albanian civilians. Roads open to traffic for
the first time in months are now desolate, rural villages vacant of
all but emaciated cows and horses. Mortar fire blasted roofs from
dozens of red-brick houses. Serb forces apparently set some
villages on fire, leaving behind charred walls and the acrid smell
of smoke.
	   After visiting Kosovo, a European delegation said Thursday it
was dismayed with the level of destruction by Serb forces, which it
called ``an excessive use of military force ... totally out of
proportion with military targets.''
	   ``What has been created is literally a wasteland,'' German
diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said.
	   In southern hills over Malisevo, a KLA headquarter town emptied
by the fighting, thousands of refugees were hiding in a labryinth
of small villages.
	   Women wearing long skirts and head scarves chopped tomatoes and
baked flat bread in one village Wednesday, using flour saved by a
local farmer to feed hundreds of people living in a courtyard and
stone house. The farmer said he had enough food for another week.
	   New arrivals trudged the winding dirt roads looking for space in
villages already overflowing with people. A tractor-pulled wagon
carried an elderly woman holding a black umbrella as shelter from
the piercing sun.
	   Some refugees sleep in the woods on blankets or thin mattresses
because they claim the villages are unsafe. Rumors whispered among
the refugees say that this or that village is next on a Serb
``list'' for destruction. People pleaded with visiting reporters
not to identify villages for fear of becoming targets.
	   They speak of ``ethnic cleansing,'' of a Serb push to wipe the
mostly Muslim Albanian population from the face of Kosovo. Other
rumors passed among refugees claim that Serbs have butchered
civilians in recent fighting, particularly in the town of Orahovac
last week.
	   Serb police say no Albanian civilians have been killed. The
wildly differing reports are nearly impossible to rectify in
Kosovo, a region seared by centuries of ethnic hatred. Serbs accuse
the KLA of attrocities against their people, and Albanians claim
the opposite.
	   ``As you can see, the Serbs have trapped us,'' said Muharem
Telaku, a man living in the farmhouse. ``We were trying to defend
our homes but they are massacring us, killing our children.
	   ``We have no where left to go. We have no medicine, very little
food. And I hope the world will take notice.''
	   A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
contacted The Associated Press early Thursday morning asking for
the location of refugee villages. Serb police barred refugee
workers Wednesday from moving outside the strict police control of
Malisevo, the representative said.
	   An refugee worker who asked not to be identified said smaller
aid agencies have been driving the back roads of Kosovo, evading
police blockades in their search for refugees.
	   Five months of war have driven an estimated 130,000 people from
their homes, according to the U.N. refugee group. Thirty-thousand
ethnic Albanians have crossed borders into Albanian, Macedonia or
Montenegro. The rest are still in Kosovo, on the run or living with
relatives.
	   ``While Milosevic has confirmed to us the willingness of his
government to make the return of civilians possible, it's quite
difficult for us to see how this can be achieved,'' said Ischinger,
the German diplomat.

Italian Parliament approves tougher anti-pedophilia law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian Senate on Thursday gave final approval
to a tougher anti-pedophilia law meant to give investigators
broader power to crack down on child-sex rings in Italy and abroad.
	   The bill, which was passed a day earlier in the lower Chamber of
Deputies, allows investigators to tap suspects' phones, create fake
websites on the Internet as bait for pedophiles and stiffens
various penalties by one-third if the violator is a relative or a
baby-sitter or if the child involved is younger than 14.
	   Child prostitution and possession of child pornography carries a
maximum sentence of 12 years in jail. Those found guilty of
organizing trips abroad featuring sex with children can be
sentenced to as long as 20 years in jail.
	   Last week, Italy was shocked when an eight-year-old boy was
found murdered near a seaside suburb of Rome. Police arrested a
fisherman who allegedly killed the boy for refusing to take part in
erotic games.

Spain trying to find its way back from heady days of 1984
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Spain won silver in the 1984 Olympics and
basketball took off in Iberia. But lately it's been grounded.
	   Spain's last major medal was a bronze in the '91 European
championship. Since then, Spain hasn't gotten past the
quarterfinals of any major tournament.
	   ``That's our goal this time, to get to the quarterfinals and
then get past,'' said coach Manuel ``Lolo'' Sainz.
	   There's hope. This club represents a new generation of talent
keyed by five players that took gold in last summer's Mediterranean
championship: Carlos Jimenez, Ignacio De Miguel, Rodrigo De La
Fuente, Jose Ignacio Rodilla and Jose Antonio Paraiso.
	   In addition, Spain's junior teams are loaded with talent.
	   ``We need a good showing here to give us a little push,'' Sainz
said.
	   The big question mark is Roberto Duenas, the 7-foot-2 (2.19
meter) center _ Spain's tallest ever _ who's been slowed by
injuries.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GOOD-BYE BABY: &LR;  Fanis Christodoulou, nicknamed Bebis _ which
means baby in Greek _ is retiring after 219 appearances with the
Greek national team including being a key member of the 1987
European championship team.
	   The 6-7 (2.01) forward scored 2,555 points for Greece and, at
33, is stepping aside to have surgery on his Achilles tendon.
	   ``I do not regret anything, except perhaps the fact that I did
not go to the United States in 1987 when I was drafted by the
Atlanta Hawks,'' he said Thursday. ``If I had, things might have
been better for me. Or maybe worse. You never know.''
	   ``I have only good memories, because all this has been a big
part of my life. I will miss the game of basketball, I will miss
the practices and, perhaps, I will gain some weight.''
	   Easy in a country like Greece.
	   --- &QC; 
	   VIVA PUERTO RICO: &LR;  If you notice a New England accent
over-running his Spanish, that's because Puerto Rico guard Carmelo
Travieso grew up in Dorchester, Mass.
	   Born in Puerto Rico, Travieso moved to the Boston area when he
was four. He's been playing with the national team for several
years and also plays professionally in Puerto Rico for Morovis, a
league team.
	   ``I was down in Puerto Rico and the basketball federation
invited me to training camp,'' Travieso said. ``I've been playing
for them on and off for two years, but I'm still a rookie on the
team because we have a lot of veterans.''
	   Travieso played a key role for UMass as it marched through the
NCAA tournament to the Final Four in 1996.
	   ``Playing for UMass helped a lot. You get exposed to a lot of
different styles playing at such a high level. The more you play,
the more you learn.''
	   He also played played for Puerto Rico in the Atlanta Olympics.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   REBOUNDS: &LR;  ``If you play good basketball, people here will hear
about it and word will spread,'' said U.S. guard Jimmy King, hoping
Athens will grow enthused over the no-name Americans. ... Another
American guard Michael Hawkins can't get over the poise of teammate
Trajan Langdon, the only college player among the 12. ``He plays at

<TEXT>
	   VANNES, France (AP) _ Two small planes collided over the
Atlantic Ocean just off the Brittany coast Thursday, police said.
Seven people were killed and another eight were reported missing
and presumed dead.
	   The crash between a Cessna and a twin-engine plane belonging to
the Proteus company took place at 3:58 p.m. (1358 GMT) in the bay
just off Quiberon, a port 505 kilometers (311 miles) southwest of
Paris.
	   The Cessna belonged to a local flying club, while the Proteus
plane, a Beechcraft 1900D, was on a regularly scheduled commercial
flight from Lyon to Lorient, a coastal city about 50 kilometers (30
miles) northwest of Quiberon.
	   The Beechcraft apparently had deviated from its regular flight
plan to overfly the giant cruise ship Norway, formally the France,
which was sailing just off Quiberon, police said.
	   Fourteen people were aboard the Proteus plane, including 12
passengers and two crew members, said Franklin Deveux, president of
the company. One person was in the Cessna.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   Rescue officials, including several helicopter and two teams of
divers aboard speedboats, rushed to the accident site, police said.
	   Six bodies were fished out of the ocean and rescuers were
attempting to locate the other people reported missing.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot flew to the accident site
on Thursday afternoon.
	   It was the worst air catastrophe in France since 1992 when an
Airbus 320 crashed near Strasbourg killing 87 people.

Swiss central bank carries out own Nazi gold study
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with open letter in U.S. papers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank is
carrying out its own study to shed more light on its gold dealings
with Nazi Germany during World War II, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   The Swiss National Bank, charged with maintaining the strength
of the Swiss currency, faces a U.S. suit by Holocaust survivors
seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   The study, which aims to provide a clearer picture of economic
policy during the war, is already under way, bank spokesman Gabriel
Juri said. He declined to give further details.
	   Studies in recent months have said the central bank should have
known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi Germany during
the war had been looted from the national treasuries of occupied
countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds) of
gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   During the war, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold in
the face of demand for the Swiss franc, the only internationally
acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   The central bank has said it will oppose vigorously any
class-action suit filed against it. The Swiss government called the
suit, filed last month, ``unacceptable.''
	   Both have refused to become involved in negotiations over a
settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups
and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders said the banks
should be paying more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   An open letter obtained by The Associated Press, to appear in
the New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times over the
next week, reiterated Swiss arguments against sanctions.
	   The letter, addressed to U.S. President Bill Clinton, was signed
``members of the Swiss business community,'' but no names or
companies are mentioned.
	   It expressed concern that sanctions against Swiss firms ``could
trigger a vicious circle of threats and counter-measures.''
	   The Swiss government said President Flavio Cotti will meet on
Sept. 7 with some 12 officials from major Swiss companies, as well
as central bank and government officials, to discuss the sanctions
threats.

Lithuania deals U.S. rude awakening, 84-82
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Argentina, Canada wins in last 2 grafs. AMs will
be filed. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Lithuania, behind Arturas Karnisovas' 29
points, beat the United States 84-82 Thursday at the World
Basketball Championship to snap the Americans' 26-game winning
streak at major international events.
	   Jimmy Oliver's desperation 3-point shot rolled around the rim
and dropped out after the United States inbounded with half a
second left.
	   The U.S. string of victories, which includes two Olympic golds
and a world title, was built by Dream Teams of NBA stars.
	   Because of the ongoing NBA labor dispute, this U.S. team is a
mixed bag of mostly anonymous players from the CBA, European
leagues and college.
	   They were outplayed and often outmuscled by Lithuania, which was
without its own two NBA players, Arvydas Sabonis and Zydrunas
Ilgauskas.
	   ``Today we came out and wanted to play like they play, which is
powerful physical basketball,'' Karnisovas said. ``We wanted to be
very aggressive and run, run the ball. That's why we stayed in the
game and that's why we won.''
	   The United States (1-1) never found a defensive solution for
Karnisovas, who played at Seton Hall and was the 1997 European
player of the year. The 2.03-meter (6-foot-9) forward scored 20 of
his points after halftime, on a mix of slashes to the basket and
timely outside shooting.
	   ``Karnisovas was a big factor,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``They played a very aggressive offensive game. I thought we
finally got it under control but it was too late.''
	   In another key game Thursday, 1990 world champion Yugoslavia
came back to beat Russia 82-74 in overtime. Dejan Bodiroga made six
free throws in the final 52 seconds as Yugoslavia (2-0 to top Group
B) scored the last 10 points of the game.
	   While Karnishovas delivered points in bunches, the United States
suffered without a go-to player.
	   Oliver was the closest thing to a consistent threat, scoring 18
points on 7-of-14 shooting. The former Purdue standout, who now
plays in Spain, had a good look at the basket before firing the
final shot.
	   ``I told Jimmy Oliver I'd put my money on him making that shot
every time,'' Tomjanovich said.
	   Lithuania took the lead for good seven minutes into the game,
and was up by as many as 16 points, but the United States did make
two strong runs.
	   Tomjanovich's team, which has been together for less than a
month, scored 10 straight points early in the second half to
whittle its deficit to single digits at 54-51.
	   With a chance to cut it to one with 13:43 to go, Oliver missed a
dunk at the end of a 2-on-1 breakaway with Michael Hawkins (16
points). Lithuania built up its lead again, and a late rally by the
United States fell short.
	   Lithuania used a 23-8 run midway through the first half to build
a 47-34 lead at the break.
	   The last loss by a U.S. team at either the Olympics or a world
championship was at the 1990 worlds, when a team of collegians lost
99-91 to Yugoslavia in the semifinals.
	   Lithuania now tops Group C in preliminary round play with a 2-0
record. Like the United States, Brazil is 1-1 after beating South
Korea 76-73 Thursday behind 17 points from Caio Cazziolato and 14
from Rogerio Klafke.
	   Veteran center Jose Ortiz had game-highs of 22 points and 11
rebounds to lead Puerto Rico (1-1) past winless Japan 78-57 in a
Group B game. The 2.08-meter (6-foot-10) Ortiz once played for the
Utah Jazz.
	   Elsewhere, Martin Keane had topped all players with 14 points
and 11 rebounds to lead Canada (1-1) past Senegal 70-57 in Group A
action. Senegal is 0-2.
	   Marcelo Nicola's 14 points helped Argentina improve to 2-0 in
Group D with a 68-51 win over Nigeria (0-2).

Gamberale steps down as head of Italy's TIM cell phone unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The chairman of Italian Telecom's highly profitable
cellular phone division TIM has stepped down, TIM said Thursday.
	   Chairman Vito Gamberale had been managing director of TIM before
becoming Telecom Italia's director general of operations, a
position he left last month in a power struggle.
	   Gamberale had helped build TIM into Europe's largest cellular
phone operator.
	   His departure as TIM chairman had been expected for weeks.

Albania orders measures to protect border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano
ordered the government Thursday to prepare a plan to halt
``unlawful and criminal activity'' in the northeast of the country
-- which borders Kosovo province.
	   A government statement said instructions had been issued to the
Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry and the domestic intelligence
service to submit the plan by Aug. 10.
	   No further details were released. It was unclear whether the
measures were aimed at protecting the border against incursions by
Yugoslav forces or infiltration by Kosovo Liberation Army rebels
into Yugoslav territory from sanctuaries in northeastern Albania.
	   Nano's government needs foreign aid to rebuild the country's
shattered economy, and major donor powers are anxious for the KLA
to stop military operations and sanction peace talks with the
Yugoslav government.

China's Yin lifts gold in women's 5,000 meters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANNECY, France (AP) _ Chinese prodigy Lili Yin added to her
growing international reputation Thursday by winning the 5,000
meters gold at the World Junior Championships.
	   Yin, an 18-year-old from Liaoning province, recorded a personal
best time of 8 minutes, 57.09 seconds to win the race, more than
four seconds ahead of Ethiopia's Yimenashu Taye, who lifted silver.
	   The second fastest junior of all time at 1,500 meters, Yin is
the reigning Asian 5,000 junior champion and last year - when aged
only 17 - became the fastest ever junior at 5,000 meters, though
that time was never ratified as a world record because no doping
tests were in place.
	   In the men's 10,000 meters, firm favorite Said Berrioui of
Morocco did not finish, leaving the way open for Benison Barus of
Kenya to win gold in a time of 29:24.28.
	   In the men's discus, Hungary's Zoltan Kovago, bronze medalist in
last year's European junior championships, clinched gold with a
throw of 59.36 meters.
	   Britain's Emeka Udechuku, the reigning European junior champion,
picked up the silver, with a throw of 57.99.
	   Russia's Roman Rasskazov won the 10,000 meter walk, with Yunfeng
Liu of China lifting silver.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ India on Thursday formally rejected
Pakistan's proposal for outside mediation to help resolve the
dispute over the restive Kashmir region, a senior government
official said.
	   ``India is in favor of direct and sincere dialogue and we
believe we can work out an acceptable position,'' said the
official, who could not be identified under briefing regulations.
	   India expressed its position to Pakistan during a meeting of
foreign ministry officials of the two countries at a seaside
resort. The meeting came a day after their prime ministers agreed
to resume stalled talks.
	   Strained relations between the two South Asian neighbors were
frozen in May after India conducted five underground nuclear tests
and Pakistan responded with six of its own. The testing raised
fears of a nuclear war over Kashmir, one of the world's most
volatile regions and a major irritant between Muslim Pakistan and
mostly Hindu India.
	   The official said Thursdays' talks remained inconclusive. The
officials may meet again Friday before leaving Sri Lanka at the end
of the seventh South Asian summit.
	   It was the first meeting between the two foreign secretaries
since the May tests by the two neighbors, who have fought three
wars since independence 50 years ago.
	   The two officials accompanied leaders of the seven South Asian
nations to Bentota for a day of informal summit talks.
	   Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Atal Bihari
Vajpayee of India met for more than an hour in Colombo on Wednesday
and agreed to resume official-level talks, hoping to ease tensions
that worsened after the nuclear explosions.
	   ``Kashmir is the core issue. The sooner it is resolved, the
better it is for the two countries,'' Sharif said after meeting
Vajpayee.
	   Sharif had called on India to drop its opposition to outside
mediation. Vajpayee declined to discuss Kashmir publicly, but said
the topic had been discussed in their meeting.
	   India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and the rest is with
Pakistan.
	   Three rounds of talks were held last year between the foreign
ministry officials, but were stalled after their meeting last
September over the priority they should give to Kashmir while
dealing with other problems.
	   India wanted to move quickly on easier issues _ separation of
forces, a boundary demarcation and economic relations _ but
Pakistan insisted on parallel movement on Kashmir.

<TEXT>
	   CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) _ Arab nations belonging to the
Organization of the Islamic Conference on Thursday condemned Israel
for its plans on the future of Jerusalem.
	   At the end of a meeting of the Al Qods Committee, the
participating nations objected to Israel's June decision to extend
Jerusalem's municipal services to West Bank Jewish settlements.
	   That move has angered many Palestinians, who accuse Israel of
violating the Israeli-Palestinian accords by unilaterally making
decisions on Jerusalem's future.
	   The committee adopted 16 resolutions, including one calling on
Arab and Islamic nations to ``review'' their relations with Israel.
It also called on the United Nations and the United States to put
pressure on Israel to prevent the isolation of Palestinians in
Jerusalem.
	   The committee also issued an appeal to the Vatican not to
recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Chareh said the meeting was
``relatively positive.''
	   Earlier, Syria's demand to cut ties with Israel due to the
stalled Mideast peace process delayed the close of the two-day
meeting of Muslim countries on Jerusalem.
	   Syria, on the seven-member drafting committee that met earlier
behind closed doors, pressed for the statement to urge Muslim
countries to stop normalizing their relations with the Jewish
state, including cutting trade and closing offices. on condition of
anonymity. The final statement was more moderate.
	   Morocco's King Hassan II, a moderating influence in the Arab
world and head of the Al Qods Conference, sought to block any such
move, demanding that the committee statement focus on the issue of
Jerusalem only.
	   The Al Qods Committee is part of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference.
	   A similar clash took place Wednesday when Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa chided the gathering for not getting
tough on Israel by revising their relations.
	   Hassan dismissed that comment, saying the meeting was ``to talk
about the Judaization of Al Qods.''
	   The draft committee included the Palestinians, Syria, Egypt,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Indonesia and Iran.
	   In a gesture of reconciliation, Iraq asked Wednesday that its
longtime foe Iran be part of the draft committee, and Hassan
agreed.
	   Officials and delegations from 16 nations attended the session
at the royal palace of King Hassan II, hoping to voice a clear
warning to Israel and find ways to oppose Israel's Jerusalem
policy.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state, and Israel's
decision in June to extend Jerusalem's municipal services to West
Bank Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians.
	   The full Jerusalem Committee is made up of Morocco, Saudi
Arabia, Palestine, Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, Niger, Guinea,
Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Senegal and
Syria.

Archeologists rediscover the Great Palace of Byzantium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos ANK902-904 &QL; 
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Recently unearthed floral frescoes from
the palace of the Byzantine emperors provide a window into the
ancient world _ but other secrets remain locked beneath some of the
world's most visited tourist sites.
	   The Great Palace of Byzantium, the home to emperors who governed
most of the Western world from the 4th century to the 12th century,
lies beneath the Blue Mosque and next to St. Sophia.
	   Alpay Pasinli, director of Istanbul's Archeology Museum in
charge of the excavations, said it would be impossible to unearth
the entire Great Palace, and that it is doubtful that most of the
ruins will ever become visible.
	   ``So many people live on (the site) and we would have to dig
under the Blue Mosque,'' he said.
	   The dilemma is starkly visible at the sight of the dig: Look up,
and you are confronted symbols of the Ottoman takeover of Greek
Constantinople: St. Sophia, the Orthodox
church-turned-mosque-turned-museum, and the Blue Mosque, the
magnificent tile-paneled mosque built in the 1600s by the great
Ottoman architect, Mehmet.
	   Look down, and the frescoes, with their striking colors, are a
vivid reminder of the city's Byzantine past.
	   First built by Constantine the Great, who made Constantinople
the capital to the Roman Empire, the palace was constantly enlarged
and modified until it became a grand complex of courtyards, throne
rooms and churches.
	   By closely studying the remains, scholars are hoping to discover
more on the lives of the emperors.
	   ``We would be able to put an element of reality into what we
know of Byzantine life,'' said Robert Ousterhout, an expert in
Byzantine architecture from the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign, who is currently studying the Zeyrek mosque, a
former Byzantine monastery in Istanbul.
	   ``We would find out how people moved through the palace, how it
was organized. Did it look like the Palatine in Rome?'' he said,
referring the Rome's best preserved imperial palace.
	   Archeologists and art historians have been searching and finding
ruins of the grand complex, which covers most of Istanbul's
historical area, for over a century.
	   In 1935, British archeologists dug out mosaics that were
probably part of a walkway leading out of the imperial apartments.
Depicting lively scenes such as tiger hunts, they were opened to
the public in November.
	   The latest excavation reveals a labyrinth of vaulted corridors
probably used to store the imperial archives, and a floral wall
painting that could date back to the 5th century.
	   Unearthed while excavating an Ottoman decoration center, it
``gives us an idea of the architecture of the palace,'' Pasinli,
the museum director, said, and may pave the way for more research
into Istanbul's Byzantine history.
	   Despite the location of the palace, Ousterhout believes there is
still a great potential for excavation.
	   ``There are very significant Byzantine remains just inches under
the ground,'' he said. ``This is the heart of Byzantium. For ten
centuries this was the most important place in the Western world.
It deserves to be better known.''

Ex-health minister in Italy indicted in corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Former Italian Health Minister Francesco De Lorenzo
was ordered to stand trial for an alleged 150 million lire (dlrs
more than 80,000) kickback, Italian news reports said Thursday.
	   Trial will begin in February for De Lorenzo, who was convicted
in 1997 of corruption and criminal association in a case of
multimillion-dollar payoffs from pharmaceutical companies.
	   In the latest case, the former Liberal Party politician is
accused of having taken a kickback in exchange for granting a
health facility special status as a scientific institution, the AGI
news agency said.
	   De Lorenzo, who resigned as health minister in 1993, had been
jailed during his trial but later was released because of poor
health. He was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison
for the 1997 conviction.
	   The corruption probes grew out of the Milan ``Clean Hands''
kickback probes which began in 1992 and wound up toppling an entire
political class as the investigations spread through Italy.

Report: Rolls-Royce boss quits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The boss of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. has
resigned _ just two days after German auto rivals BMW and
Volkswagen signed a deal to carve up the legendary luxury carmaker,
a news agency reported Thursday night.
	   The report from Britain's Press Association cited ``industry
sources,'' whom it did not identify, as saying Graham Morris, the
Rolls-Royce chief executive, had quit.
	   The report quoted a spokesman for Rolls-Royce as declining
comment on Morris but saying ``a full statement'' would be issued
on Friday. The report did not name the spokesman and there was no
immediate indication about why Morris would have stepped down.
	   Rolls-Royce spokesman Richard Charlesworth did not immediately
return a message that The Associated Press left with his mobile
telephone answering service Thursday night.
	   Volkswagen AG bought Rolls-Royce early this month for 479
million pounds (dlrs 790 million). But the sale by the engineering
group Vickers PLC did not include the rights to the Rolls-Royce
brand name and logo, which were held by the British jet engine
maker Rolls-Royce PLC.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC sold the brand name on Tuesday for 40 million
pounds (dlrs 66 million) to BMW, its partner in an aerospace
venture, and BMW signed a deal that will let VW use the name for
free until Dec. 31, 2002.
	   After that, BMW plans to create a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
company, while VW will keep the Rolls-Royce plant in Crewe,
England, and continue making Bentleys, the company's other line of
luxury cars.

Two small planes crash in western France, at least seven dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with condolences from President Jacques Chirac &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VANNES, France (AP) _ Two small planes collided over the
Atlantic Ocean just off the Brittany coast Thursday, police said.
Seven people were killed and another eight were reported missing
and presumed dead.
	   The crash between a Cessna and a twin-engine plane belonging to
the Proteus company took place at 3:58 p.m. (1358 GMT) in the bay
just off Quiberon, a port 505 kilometers (311 miles) southwest of
Paris.
	   The Cessna belonged to a local flying club, while the Proteus
plane, a Beechcraft 1900D, was on a regularly scheduled commercial
flight from Lyon to Lorient, a coastal city about 50 kilometers (30
miles) northwest of Quiberon.
	   The Beechcraft apparently had deviated from its regular flight
plan to overfly the giant cruise ship Norway, formally the France,
which was sailing just off Quiberon, police said.
	   Fourteen people were aboard the Proteus plane, including 12
passengers and two crew members, said Franklin Deveux, president of
the company. One person was in the Cessna.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   Rescue officials, including several helicopter and two teams of
divers aboard speedboats, rushed to the accident site, police said.
	   Rescuers recovered seven bodies from the ocean and were
attempting to locate the other eight people reported missing and
who were presumed dead.
	   French President Jacques Chirac extended his condolences to the
families.
	   ``In these painful hours, my thoughts are with the families who
are still uncertain and those already grieving. I express my
support and my deep sympathy,'' Chirac said.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot flew to the accident site

	   FUJINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ Lisa Fernandez homered and pitched a
one-hitter to single-handedly give the United States its fourth
straight Women's World Softball Championship, beating Australia 1-0
in a game that stretched into Friday morning.
	   After torrential rain and lightning delayed the start for more
than five hours Thursday night, the game was suspended after the
Americans had gone ahead 1-0 on Fernandez's home run in the top of
the first inning.
	   After the game resumed at 12:30 a.m. (1530 GMT Thursday),
Fernandez went the distance and held Australia to one hit.
	   The U.S. team, a 2-1 loser to Australia Wednesday, rebounded and
won a place in the final by ousting host Japan 4-0 earlier
Thursday.
	   With the defeat, Japan took the bronze medal.
	   China took fourth Wednesday with a 2-1 record in the final
round.
	   In another game Thursday for fifth place and a berth at the
Sydney Olympics, Canada edged Italy 1-0.
	   The top four teams, excluding Olympic host Australia, qualify
for the 2002 games.
	   Australia, the bronze medalist at Atlanta, was seeking its
second world title. It won the inaugural world championship in
Melbourne in 1965.

Norwegian unemployment rises to 2.6 percent 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's official unemployment rate rose to
2.6 percent at the end of June from 2.4 percent a month earlier,
but remained well below the 3.3 percent rate reported for July
1997, the state Labor Directorate announced Friday.
	   The agency said 58,900 people were registered as being
completely unemployed as of Friday, compared with 55,800 one month
ago and 81,800 a year ago.
	   The main reason for the increased joblessness rate was that
fewer people were employed in government work and training
programs. Those programs employed 6,100 people in July, down
sharply from the 11,500 people reported for June.

EU holds talks with Togo on questioned elections

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Concerned that Togo's president did not
fairly win last month's presidential ballot, senior EU officials
held talks Thursday with a Togolese delegation to determine whether
the electoral process was flawed.
	   President Gnassigbe Eyadema, who has ruled Togo for 31 years,
won the June 21 ballot. He ruled as a dictator for 26 years, after
taking power in a bloody coup, and was elected to his first term in
1993.
	   Days of protests and riots followed Eyadema's declaration of
victory. The European Union and United States criticized the polls
in which vote-counting was interrupted and the chief electoral
officer resigned.
	   ``The EU side requested these consultations because it considers
that the election process of 21 June was not completed, that
therefore the election result appears to be incorrect,'' the EU
said in a statement.
	   The EU noted in its statement that several teams of election
observers reported that the election procedure was ``seriously
flawed.''
	   It said it would examine explanations offered by the Togolese
delegation, which ``differ considerably from the assessment of the
EU observers' mission,'' before deciding whether to pursue further
talks.
	   The Togolese delegation was headed by Prime Minister Kwassi
Klutse.
	   Since 1993, the EU has suspended most of its trade and
development cooperation with Togo. An EU spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said it was unlikely that the Togo
delegation would persuade the EU to change its position.

Russian finance chief happy, more taxpayers paying up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Fischer's title in graf 8. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More Russian taxpayers are paying their bills and
filling up the government's empty coffers, the country's finance
minister reported with satisfaction Thursday.
	   Mikhail Zadornov said tax collection improved in July over June,
and predicted the trend would continue.
	   He refused to give specifics, but the Interfax news agency said
tax revenues in July were expected to total 12 billion rubles (dlrs
1.9 billion), up 7.1 percent from June.
	   The government's inability to collect taxes is one of the
fundamental problems plaguing the Russian economy.
	   Russians have no history of paying taxes, as all salaries were
paid by the state in the Soviet era, and only a small percentage of
workers comply. Most of the country's biggest companies, including
the largest, gas monopoly Gazprom, are also tax deadbeats.
	   Improved tax collection was a condition set down by the
International Monetary Fund before approving its portion of a dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package.
	   ``In June, the collections were better than in May, and in July
they were better again,'' Zadornov said at a news conference. ``I
expect this tendency to continue in August.''
	   Worries remain that the bailout package is not big enough, and a
top IMF official was due in Moscow on Friday to review it. Stanley
Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director, will hold talks
with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and other senior government
officials.

Mexican presidential candidate blasts party for being soft on foes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A major contender for Mexico's next
presidential election, Puebla Gov. Manuel Bartlett, is urging the
governing party to take a tougher stand against opposition parties,
newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Bartlett charged that after 69 years in power, his Institutional
Revolutionary Party had grown weak by allowing opposition parties
to portray it as corrupt and scandalous.
	   ``In silence and in complacency and at times in cowardice, we
have allowed them to impose those ideas,'' Bartlett said at an
appearance in the central state of Aguascalientes, where he was
campaigning for the gubernatorial candidate of his party, known as
the PRI.
	   Bartlett is one of the few openly declared candidates for the
presidency in the 2000 elections for his party, known as the PRI,
which has won every presidential election _ often using fraud _
since it was formed in 1929.
	   As interior minister, Bartlett oversaw the 1988 election of
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, which most analysts say was marred by
fraud.
	   As governor in Puebla, east of Mexico City, he has frequently
clashed with leaders of the conservative National Action Party,
Mexico's second-largest party, and has criticized his own party's
occasional agreements with National Action on political reforms.
	   National Action, he said Wednesday, ``is a party expert in
images of purity, integrity, incorruptibility, designed to
disqualify its adversary.'' But he charged that it is compromised
by ties with ``reactionary businessmen'' and claimed it would
attack free education and aid for Mexico's poor.
	   Reforms worked out in agreement with opposition parties have
made Mexican elections more competitive. Opposition parties have
won several governorships since 1989 and broke the PRI's majority
in Congress last year.

Tehran says missile domestically produced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's defense minister said Thursday that
the medium-range missile Tehran tested last week was produced
without foreign assistance.
	   The Shahab-3 has a range of about 800 miles (1,200 kilometers)
and could reach Israel and U.S. soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia.
	   The missile is believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong
missile.
	   Reports from Washington have indicated that the CIA believed
that Iran has received missile technology from Russia and China.
	   The missile ``is absolutely domestically produced and has no
assistance from any foreign country,'' Ali Shamkhani said.
	   Iranian officials have said the Shahab-3 missile will not be
used in a first strike against others.
	   Shamkhani warned that if Iran were attacked ``we will react ...
massively.''
	   He was speaking on Iranian television.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk said Tuesday that
Iran was working on a long-range missile that could be deployed in
two to five years.
	   He said Washington will increase its efforts to curb the
transfer of technology that Iran will need to develop it.
	   Shamkhani said Iran has the capability to produce an
intercontinental missile ``but we do not feel any need to do so.''
	   ``Once you have missiles with more than a 1,000 kilometer (600
mile) range, it would not be too difficult to increase that
range,'' he said.
	   ``At the moment we don't have any ... plans to produce these
missiles but if we feel this need, we would do so,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ After his election in 1980, then-Prime
Minister Edward Seaga shut down the Cuban embassy in anger over an
earlier experiment with socialism that bankrupted Jamaica.
	   But on Thursday Seaga met with Fidel Castro, who is making an
unprecedented tour of the Caribbean region, saying afterward he no
longer viewed the Cuban president with animosity.
	   ``Every conflict has a beginning and has an end, and we have
come to the end,'' Seaga told The Associated Press after the
hour-long meeting in Kingston, the Jamaican capital. ``We are not
dealing with memories. We are dealing with the future.''
	   The first private meeting between Castro and Seaga reflected
Caribbean nations' reconciliation with Cuba and their increasing
impatience with Washington's isolation of the Communist island.
	   Castro did not speak to reporters after the meeting. But on
Wednesday, at a rally in Montego Bay's Sam Sharpe Square _ named
for another revolutionary who led an unsuccessful slave rebellion
in Jamaica _ he railed against U.S.-led economic globalization.
	   ``We need to know which will be our places in that globalized
world,'' he said. ``We need to put up a fight for the Caribbean
nations and for all the peoples of the Third World region. Our
strength united cannot be ignored.''
	   Castro's host, Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, condemned
the U.S. embargo and the Helms-Burton law, which aims to punish
foreign firms investing in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba.
	   ``We are implacably opposed to the economic blockade against
Cuba, which is morally wrong,'' Patterson said. Helms-Burton, he
added, undermines international law and ``constitutes a threat to
the sovereignty of other nations.''
	   To applause, Patterson welcomed Castro as ``one of the great
leaders of the 20th century.''
	   The first stop on Castro's three-island tour, Jamaica has led a
Caribbean movement to re-establish diplomatic and trade links with
Cuba and has urged Washington to increase its contacts with Havana.
	   Seaga said Jamaica could learn from Cuba's successes, especially
in education and health care _ but he also noted that a revitalized
Cuba, as the largest nation in the region, could pose a challenge,
	   ``If Cuba becomes a powerhouse it will radically change the
Caribbean,'' he said. ``We all produce the same product: sugar cane
and its products, rum, citrus.''
	   Jamaican tourism officials also worry that Cuba might lure away
U.S. tourists, who are Jamaica's biggest customers.
	   At the rally in Montego Bay, Castro stressed the importance of
cooperation in tourism and mentioned the possibility of package
tours to both islands.
	   Castro will spend six days in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada. In
August, he joins other Caribbean leaders at a summit in the
Dominican Republic, which this year restored diplomatic relations
with Cuba after 37 years.
	   The most visible opposition to Castro's trip has come from
Grenada, where some politicians call his visit an insult to
Americans who invaded in 1983 to oust hard-line Marxists. At the
time, some U.S. strategists feared Grenada could help Castro export
his revolution.
	   Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 U.S. troops were killed
during the invasion.

Goodwill Games? New Yorkers moderately interested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK ELTMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press W iter &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sure, the out-of-town notices weren't so hot.
	   Moscow, Seattle and St. Petersburg, Russia, were tough places to
build a buzz, and impresario Ted Turner lost an estimated dlrs 109
million on the first three editions of the Goodwill Games.
	   So, for the fourth round, Turner picked the biggest stage for a
part of his media-and-sports empire that is among the nearest and
dearest to his heart.
	   Has Goodwill overrun New York? No. Have the games made it here?
Sort of.
	   Organizers say they're pleased with ticket sales, although they
estimate only 400,000 of the 600,000 available will be sold by the
time the games end Sunday.
	   ``When you measure that, you know that's about a half a dozen
Super Bowls and that's not bad,'' Harvey W. Schiller, president of
Turner Sports, said at a news conference.
	   Television ratings on the TBS Superstation are actually up 42
percent from the games four years ago in St. Petersburg, according
to Turner officials.
	   On the streets of New York, however, the games barely register.
	   Police say they haven't had to arrest anyone for scalping _ this
in a town where ticket scalping is legion. (FREE tickets to see
Pope John Paul II were reportedly scalped for dlrs 75 a few years
ago.)
	   A survey of ticket brokers advertising in the New York Post this
week found that the Goodwill Games aren't even on their radar. One
phone salesman even thought the games, which were inspired by the
Cold War-era Olympics boycotts, were something akin to the Special
Olympics. ``We don't handle charity events,'' he snapped.
	   Among those not filling the empty seats was Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
	   He welcomed the games during an opening ceremony/concert at
Battery Park City, but spokesman Dwight Williams said the mayor's
schedule has been busy, preventing him from watching any of the
competition.
	   Giuliani, an unabashed Yankees fan, did join 55,000 fellow New
Yorkers at Yankee Stadium last Saturday for the annual Old-timer's
Day celebration, where heroes such as Joe DiMaggio were cheered.
	   And that could be the problem for Goodwill, New York style. For
Giuliani and his fellow sports fans, there's too much going on.
	   Besides the Yankees, chasing the best record ever in baseball,
and the Mets, contending for a National League wildcard, sports
fans are drawn to the WNBA's Liberty and Major League Soccer's
MetroStars. There was a boxing match featuring Roy Jones, perhaps
the best fighter in the world, at Madison Square Garden the night
of the opening ceremonies. Minor league baseball and soccer are
just a short drive away. And in a few weeks, the U.S. Open tennis
tournament comes to town.
	   The city's Economic Development Corporation, which usually
tracks the impact of large events like conventions on the local
economy, said no study of the Goodwill Games was even planned. A
review of the impact on Nassau County on Long Island, where most of
the competition is taking place, would be conducted after the
games, said David Vieser, a spokesman for Nassau County Executive
Thomas Gulotta.
	   Like the first three, Goodwill Games '98 is almost guaranteed to
lose money. But Turner and Time-Warner, Inc., its parent company,
already have announced that edition No. 5 will be held in 2001 in
Brisbane, Australia.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds hide in a crumbling stone
farmhouse. Others wander from village to village for food by day
but sleep in the woods at night. A shelter of tree branches feels
more secure than a village, feared as a target of more shooting,
more bombing, more burning.
	   Some 20,000 ethnic Albanian civilians are on the run after a
six-day Serb offensive against Albanian rebels. Aid groups made
another attempt to reach refugees on Thursday. For days, Serb
police have blocked them from driving up into hills where thousands
of terrified people have fled.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told diplomats he had
ordered an end to the recent onslaught on the Kosovo Liberation
Army. The loosely organized guerrilla group seeks independence for
Kosovo, a province in the Serb republic of Yugoslavia where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   The Serb operation cleared two strategic arteries of KLA
fighters, as well as Albanian civilians. Roads open to traffic for
the first time in months are now desolate, rural villages vacant of
all but emaciated cows and horses. Mortar fire blasted roofs from
dozens of red-brick houses. Serb forces apparently set some
villages on fire, leaving behind charred walls and the acrid smell
of smoke.
	   After visiting Kosovo, a European delegation said Thursday it
was dismayed with the level of destruction by Serb forces, which it
called ``an excessive use of military force ... totally out of
proportion with military targets.''
	   ``What has been created is literally a wasteland,'' German
diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said.
	   In southern hills over Malisevo, a KLA headquarter town emptied
by the fighting, thousands of refugees were hiding in a labryinth
of small villages.
	   Women wearing long skirts and head scarves chopped tomatoes and
baked flat bread in one village Wednesday, using flour saved by a
local farmer to feed hundreds of people living in a courtyard and
stone house. The farmer said he had enough food for another week.
	   New arrivals trudged the winding dirt roads looking for space in
villages already overflowing with people. A tractor-pulled wagon
carried an elderly woman holding a black umbrella as shelter from
the piercing sun.
	   Some refugees sleep in the woods on blankets or thin mattresses
because they claim the villages are unsafe. Rumors whispered among
the refugees say that this or that village is next on a Serb
``list'' for destruction. People pleaded with visiting reporters
not to identify villages for fear of becoming targets.
	   They speak of ``ethnic cleansing,'' of a Serb push to wipe the
mostly Muslim Albanian population from the face of Kosovo. Other
rumors passed among refugees claim that Serbs have butchered
civilians in recent fighting, particularly in the town of Orahovac
last week.
	   Serb police say no Albanian civilians have been killed. The
wildly differing reports are nearly impossible to verify in Kosovo,
a region seared by centuries of ethnic hatred. Serbs accuse the KLA
of atrocities against their people, and Albanians claim the
opposite.

Security Council extends mandate for Lebanon peacekeepers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council agreed Thursday to
keep U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon for another six months
and reiterated its support for Lebanese sovereignty.
	   The 15-member council decided to extend the mandate of the
4,500-member U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon until Jan. 31. The
mandate for the force, established in March 1978 after Israel
invaded Lebanon, had been scheduled to expire in July.
	   The council issued a statement in support of Lebanon's
``sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and
national unity,'' and expressed concern over the region's
continuing violence.
	   Israel has 1,500 soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen in a zone
it set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from cross-border attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   In a statement, America's deputy ambassador, Peter Burleigh
said, ``we have long maintained that we want to make progress in
Arab-Israeli negotiations wherever and whenever progress is
possible.
	   ``We believe Lebanon-Israel negotiations would provide a way for
Israel and Lebanon to resolve all the issues that divide them and
to advance the security of both countries,'' the statement said.

Tehran says missile domestically produced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's defense minister said Thursday that
the medium-range missile Tehran tested last week was produced
without foreign assistance.
	   The Shahab-3 has a range of about 800 miles (1,200 kilometers)
and could reach Israel and U.S. soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia.
	   The missile is believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong
missile.
	   Reports from Washington have indicated that the CIA believed
that Iran has received missile technology from Russia and China.
	   The missile ``is absolutely domestically produced and has no
assistance from any foreign country,'' Ali Shamkhani said.
	   Iranian officials have said the Shahab-3 missile will not be
used in a first strike against others.
	   Shamkhani warned that if Iran were attacked ``we will react ...
massively.''
	   He was speaking on Iranian television.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk said Tuesday that
Iran was working on a long-range missile that could be deployed in
two to five years.
	   He said Washington will increase its efforts to curb the
transfer of technology that Iran will need to develop it.
	   Shamkhani said Iran has the capability to produce an
intercontinental missile ``but we do not feel any need to do so.''

Opposition party calls for human rights investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ At least 10 people were wounded in an
explosion in a bus in the Algerian capital Thursday, France Info
radio reported.
	   The bomb was concealed in a package on the bus, the radio said.
No further details were immediately available. Such explosions
occur frequently in Algeria.
	   Meanwhile, an opposition political party held a rally in Algiers
on Thursday to demand an investigation into human rights by a U.N.
mission now on a fact-finding mission in Algeria.
	   Said Sidi, a leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy, said
Algeria was in the midst of a crisis and welcomed the U.N. mission,
Associated Press Television reported.
	   The U.N. panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares,
arrived in Algeria last week to look into an Islamic insurgency
that was sparked in 1992 after the government canceled
parliamentary elections an Islamic party was set to win.
	   Some 75,000 people have died in the last six years.

Swedish amateur Hultman shares first-round lead with Davis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish amateur Anders Hultman tied the
course record with a 6-under-par 65 Thursday to share the
first-round lead with England's Brian Davis after the first round
of the dlrs 1.3-million Scandinavian Masters.
	   Hultman, who's heading to Oklahoma State University in two
weeks, started on the 10th hole in the last group of the day and
had five birdies and an eagle-3 on the long 17th on his card.
	   ``Really, was it a (tied) course record? That's great,'' said
Hultman, who is hardly known in his own country.
	   His fine performance on the 6,791-yard European Tour Club came
only two weeks after then-English amateur Justin Rose tied for
fourth in the British Open, just two shots behind winner Mark
O'Meara of the United States.
	   Hultman, a 19-year-old from Goteborg in western Sweden who plays
for a club named Albatross, faced Rose two years ago in the
European Junior Championships.
	   Hultman won (the match play) contest.
	   ``I won on the last hole,** he said.
	   Hultman is looking forward to become a Cowboy.
	   ``Playing college golf for Oklahoma State will be great,'' he
said.
	   Hultman played only one professional tournament going into the
Scandinavian Masters, one of the richest and best attended European
Tour events. Last year, he crashed out of a Challenger Tour event
in Sweden after going 22 over par on 36 holes.
	   Rose, who turned 18 Thursday, was happy with a level-par 71, six
shots of the pace, especially after dropping three shots on his
first four holes. But he recovered with four birdies on his last 14
holes and only one more bogey.
	   **I had to get up at 5.45 in the morning,'' said Rose, who
missed the cut in the Dutch Open last week. ``I'm not doing
anything special tonight. I'll go out for a meal with my dad and
then have an early night. I want to make the cut tomorrow.''
	   Davis, who turns 24 on Sunday, had seven birdies and one bogey
on the tight, tree-lined course designed by Anders Forsbrand,
Sweden's top male golfer ever but a non-starter here.
	   Last week, Davis tied for 11th in the Dutch Open at Hilversum,
where he shot 66 in the first round.
	   ``That was my best round of the year until today,'' he said.
	   Jesper Parnevik, a U.S. Tour regular and member of Europe's
winning Ryder Cup team last year, shared third with Darren Clarke
of Northern Ireland and David Howell of England at 67.
	   Parnevik arrived late for his early-morning tee time and dropped
three shots on his first six holes, but then settled down to make
seven birdies on his last 12 holes.
	   Craig Hainline, an unheralded American from Houston, was another
stroke back and shared sixth with five others.
	   Colin Montgomerie of Scotland shot a 70. Defending champion
Joakim Haeggman of Sweden was 10 shots off the lead.

	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) - Amnesty International called on Cyprus
Thursday to grant political asylum to more than 100 illegal
immigrants that the government is planning to repatriate.
	   Amnesty said the immigrants from about a dozen Arab and African
states may be at risk in their homelands.
	   Some 70 members of the group, which includes pregnant women and
children, have been on a hunger strike since Monday to protest the
government decision to repatriate them.
	   The members of the group have been at a hotel under police
guard.
	   The illegal immigrants were rescued from a Syrian fishing boat
that was drifting off southern Cyprus last month.
	   The immigrants had paid the Syrian captain as much as dlrs 5,000
each to be taken to either Greece or Italy.
	   Officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who came
to Cyprus to examine their applications, decided that only three of
the 107 immigrants qualify for political asylum.
	   The government has said it is arranging to repatriate the
remainder.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Dalia Rakutyte touched her forefinger to
her thumb and scrunched it up to make the circle she formed even
smaller.
	   ``That's Lithuania, 3 million people,'' she said, almost
trembling amid about 200 other Lithuanian fans after her team's
84-82 win over the United States Thursday in a first-round game of
the world championship.
	   ``America is a hundred times that big,'' she said, gesturing now
with her arms to draw a bigger circle in the air. ``Beating an
American team _ any team. It's still an American team.''
	   An American basketball hide is still a big prize in world
basketball and _ if anyone needed reminding - they're easier to
come by when the United States fields anything but its best
players.
	   Former Seton Hall star Arturas Karnisovas scored a game-high 29
and, though the United States could have won on a 30-foot, 3-point
attempt at the gun by Jimmy Oliver _ who finished with 18,
Lithuania deserved the victory.
	   ``They were a little bit better than we were today,'' said coach
Rudy Tomjanovich, who has assembled this hodgepodge of non-NBA
talent over the last month since the lockout began.
	   ``I'll go a bit farther,'' he added. ``They were better for most
of the game than we were. They played a very intense, aggressive
style of basketball.''
	   In fact, they played American-style basketball.
	   ``We came out and wanted to play like they (Americans) play,
which is powerful, physical basketball,'' Karnisovas said. ``We
wanted to be very aggressive and run, run the ball. That's why we
stayed in the game and that's why we won.'' We came out and played
like they do.''
	   The last time the United States lost in a world championship or
Olympics was _ pre-Dream Team _ in the 1990 world championship to
Yugoslavia 99-91 in the semifinals. Since then the U.S. had won 26
straight.
	   The Lithuanians out-ran the Americans and the defense-oriented
U.S. team tried to be too free-wielding in the first half and
trailed 47-34.
	   ``Karnisovas was a big factor, driving and slahsing for the
basket,'' Tomjanovich said. ``They played a very positive,
offensive game. By the time we got it under control it was too
late.''
	   The newly independent Baltic state, the engine of Soviet
basketball before the breakup, took bronze behind the Dream Team in
the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics, but failed to reach the '94
worlds.
	   Granted, this isn't the best U.S. team _ but it isn't the best
Lithuanian team either. The NBA's Zydrunas Ilgauskas _ the Z-man of
the Cleveland Cavaliers _ bowed out with an injury and towering
Portland center Arvydas Sabonis no longer plays with the national
team because of injuries.''
	   Donn Nelson, the Dallas Mavericks assistant who has worked as an
assistant coach for Lithuania for six seasons, was not surprised.
	   ``During the dark years it was kind of the thing that they
(Lithuanians) could use to thumb their nose at the Soviet Union.
They would go into Moscow and kick butt when it came to basketball.
	   ``Except for Arturas and (center) Gintaras Einikis this is a
very young team, but now they believe they can beat anybody.''
	   Lithuania is 2-0 to lead Group C and the Americans fell to 1-1
and will face South Korea Friday. Lithuania plays Brazil, which
defeated South Korea 76-73 behind 17 points from Caio Cazziolato
and 14 from Rogerio Klafke.
	   Two other contenders for medals also played as European champion
_ and 1990 world champion _ Yugoslavia defeated Russia 82-74 in
overtime. Dejan Bodiroga made six free throws in the final 52
seconds as Yugoslavia (2-0 to top Group B) scored the last 10
points of the game.
	   Zeljko Rebraca, the 2.11-meter (7-foot) center led Yugoslavia
with 23 points. Bodiroga added 16, with 14 from the line.
	   ``We always had the thought that we might lose the game and that
mind-set resulted in us winning it,'' Yugoslavia coach Zeljko
Obradovic said.
	   The victory gives Yugoslavia control of preliminary round Group
B with a 2-0 record. Russia and Puerto Rico are 1-1, with winless
Japan last. Russia, which got 20 points from Vassily Karassev, had
four players foul out.
	   Veteran center Jose Ortiz had game-highs of 22 points and 11
rebounds to lead Puerto Rico (1-1) past winless Japan 78-57.
	   Elsewhere, Martin Keane topped all players with 14 points and 11
rebounds to lead Canada (1-1) past Senegal 70-57 in Group A action.
Senegal is 0-2.
	   Marcelo Nicola's 14 points helped Argentina improve to 2-0 in
Group D with a 68-51 win over Nigeria (0-2).
	   Italy faced Greece in a late Group A game and Spain played
Australia in Group D.

Tyson may get license despite missteps before New Jersey

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thursday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo TN102 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Yes, Mike Tyson lost his cool
and cursed in front of the people he's asking to license him. But
it may take more than that to keep him from fighting again in New
Jersey.
	   The state Athletic Control Board will meet next week to consider
Tyson's application for a boxing license.
	   The multimillion-dollar question is: How much weight will it
give to Tyson's behavior in Wednesday's licensing hearing in
Trenton?
	   While Tyson didn't do himself any good, the money he can make _
for promoters, casinos and the state _ might outweigh whatever
damage he did.
	   ``To lose your cool with your attorney, say something out of
frustration, why should that have such a big impact?'' promoter
Dino Duva, president of Main Events, said. ``It wasn't like he
cursed at the panel.''
	   Tyson was banned from boxing last year after biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during their WBA heavyweight title fight at Las
Vegas. The ban, issued by Nevada regulators, allowed Tyson to apply
for a license after one year. He chose to do so in New Jersey
instead, and if turned down there, he can still apply in Nevada.
	   His supporters told board members Wednesday he was remorseful
for biting Holyfield and eager to return to the ring. Tyson was on
the verge of tears during some of his testimony, but as the hearing
ended, he grew angry and uttered a profanity in an exchange with
his lawyer.
	   ``I didn't take it that he was swearing at me or the board
personally. He was talking to his attorney at the time,'' board
member Gary Shaw said.
	   Board chairman Gerard Gormley did not return telephone calls to
the board office Thursday.
	   The third member of the panel, Steven Katz, missed the hearing
because he was on vacation. He will not vote on Tyson's license,
leaving it to Gormley and Shaw.
	   ``They are going to deal with all the testimony, evidence as
well as public comments, which is entered into the record,'' said
Rhonda Utley-Herring, executive assistant to boxing commissioner
Larry Hazzard. ``That's what they'll focus on, not just that little
five minutes we've been seeing on television.''
	   What if it's a split decision? Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for
attorney general Peter Verniero, did not know the answer when asked
that question Thursday.
	   Shaw would not say what bearing Tyson's behavior would have on
the license application. The board has 45 days to decide. It will
meet next in a private session Thursday.
	   Promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank, who said New Jersey should direct
Tyson back to Nevada for a license, said Tyson showed he still has
problems.
	   ``There's civil, rational behavior and there's uncivil
behavior,'' he said. ``This is not appropriate behavior,
particularly when you're applying for a license, which is a
privilege. Something is wrong here.''
	   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, said Thursday he would not try to prejudge what New
Jersey regulators would do. He declined comment on Tyson's conduct.
	   Duva said Tyson _ who was licensed to fight after serving a
three-year prison term for rape _ deserves another chance.
	   ``The boxing business needs him,'' Duva said. ``He's certainly
the biggest draw. If he ever (bit someone) again, you'd have to
wonder what's going on.''

Swedish amateur Hultman shares first-round lead

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish amateur Anders Hultman tied the
course record with a 6-under-par 65 Thursday and shared the
first-round lead with England's Brian Davis in the dlrs 1.3-million
Scandinavian Masters.
	   Hultman, who's heading to Oklahoma State in two weeks, started
on the 10th hole in the final group of the day and had five birdies
and an eagle-3 on the long 17th.
	   ``Was it a (tied) course record? That's great,'' said Hultman,
who is little known outside his country.
	   His fine performance on the 6,791-yard (6,180-meter) European
Tour Club came only two weeks after then-English amateur Justin
Rose tied for fourth in the British Open, two shots behind winner
Mark O'Meara.
	   Hultman, a 19-year-old from Goteborg, faced Rose at the 1996
European Junior Championships.
	   Hultman won the match play meeting.
	   ``I won on the last hole,'' he said.
	   Hultman had played only one professional tournament going into
the Scandinavian Masters. Last year, he crashed out of a Challenger
Tour event in Sweden after going 22 over par for 36 holes.
	   Rose, who became 18 Thursday, was happy with a par 71, six shots
off the pace, especially after dropping three shots on his first
four holes. He recovered with four birdies on his last 14 holes and
only one more bogey.
	   ``I had to get up at 5.45 in the morning,'' said Rose, who
missed the cut in the Dutch Open last week.
	   Davis had seven birdies and one bogey on the tight, tree-lined
course.
	   Last week, Davis tied for 11th in the Dutch Open, where he shot
66 in the first round.
	   ``That was my best round of the year until today,'' he said.
	   Jesper Parnevik, a PGA Tour regular and member of Europe's
winning Ryder Cup team last year, shared third with Darren Clarke
of Northern Ireland and David Howell of England at 67.
	   Parnevik arrived late for his early-morning tee time and dropped
three shots on his first six holes, but then settled down and made
seven birdies over his final 12 holes.
	   Craig Hainline, an unheralded American from Houston, was at 68
and shared sixth with five others.
	   Colin Montgomerie of Scotland shot a 70.

IMF official to discuss bailout package with Russian leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund official
will visit Moscow this weekend for talks with Russian authorities
on the fund's rescue package as the country's financial markets
continue to decline.
	   Confirming the trip by Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing
director of the fund, a spokesman said Thursday, ``The purpose of
the visit is to review the IMF-supported program ... He is not
there to discuss extra money'' for President Boris Yeltsin's
government.
	   Russia's Interfax news agency reported from Moscow that Fischer
would meet with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Anatoly
Chubais, the country's special IMF negotiator.
	   Russian markets, which have declined by 60 percent since the
beginning of the year, closed slightly up Thursday after Kiriyenko
met with a large group of foreign investors to explain the
government's economic plans. He said he would hold such meetings
regularly.
	   The fund and other lenders agreed earlier this month on a dlrs
17 billion rescue package that the government and its lenders hoped
would restore investor confidence and provide a few months of
breathing space. But communists in parliament have resisted
Yeltsin's financial stabilization plan, which includes numerous
tax-raising measures.
	   Coming 11 days after fund's executive board met in Washington
with top Russian negotiators, Fischer's trip appeared to be hastily
arranged and aimed at examining the financial market's negative
reaction.
	   IMF directors agreed July 20 to expand an existing dlrs 9.2
billion credit program with Russia by dlrs 11.2 billion. Of that
total, dlrs 4.8 billion was disbursed immediately.
	   However, the size of the first payment was trimmed by dlrs 800
million from dlrs 5.6 billion previously offered because of the
Russian authorities' failure to get parliament to approve the tax
measures.
	   In a statement after the IMF board decision, Fischer had pointed
to a legislative session planned in August as an important
benchmark for disbursements of further IMF aid. Since then a number
of prominent credit rating agencies have issued warnings about
Russian debt.
	   There is also renewed talk of a ruble devaluation, which would
be catastrophic for Russian banks, importers and others who have
financial obligations in dollars. Those debts would be hard to
service with rubles that were diminishing in value. The government
has vowed to avoid a devaluation.
	   Questions about the IMF bailout have been mounting on Capitol
Hill, prompting U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin earlier this
week to warn in a private letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich
that a cutoff of IMF assistance would lead to a Russian market
collapse and spark ``damaging turmoil in other emerging markets.''
	   The IMF commitment forms the backbone of more than dlrs 22
billion in added financial assistance to Russia.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) - Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed Israelis
troops in southern Lebanon Thursday, killing one soldier and
wounding five.
	   Israeli helicopters evacuated the wounded to hospitals in
Israel, security officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said guerrillas ambushed the
soldiers as they were practicing in a live fire exercise.
	   Staff Sgt. Sachar Mintz, 21, was killed and five other soldiers
were slightly wounded, the army statement said.
	   Security officials in Lebanon said the fighting began when
guerrillas opened fire at positions of the Israeli army and
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia at Sojod, Rihan, Bir
Kallab, and Ghozlan inside the Israeli-occupied security zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia said its guerrillas
attacked the posts, and also detonated bombs under an Israeli
Merkava tank. It gave no casualty figures.
	   The Israeli army said a bomb was thrown at Israeli forces, but
there were no injuries.
	   The guerrillas are trying to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 allied militiamen from the security zone, which Israel
established in 1985 to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.

Hrudey retires after 15-year NHL career
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ Goalie Kelly Hrudey, who spent the
past two seasons with the San Jose Sharks, retired Thursday after
15 years in the National Hockey League.
	   Hrudey, who was a backup last season to Mike Vernon, had been
pondering his retirement for awhile.
	   ``I have no feelings of sadness,'' he said. ``I just cannot
believe the opportunity I've had.''
	   Hrudey, 37, signed with the Sharks as an unrestricted free agent
in 1996, and compiled a 20-40-7 record with a 3.03 goals-against
average.
	   Drafted by the Islanders in 1980, Hrudey came into the NHL in
the 1983-84 season and spent six years in New York.
	   He was traded to the Los Angeles Kings late in the 1988-89
season, and helped the team to the Stanley Cup finals in 1993. He
was chosen team MVP in 1991-92 and 1994-95
	   Overall, Hrudey has played in 677 career games with a 271-265-88
record, 16 shutouts and a 3.43 GAA. His 271 victories put him 24th
on the NHL's all-time win list.
	   Hrudey has played in 85 Stanley Cup playoff games, with a 36-46
record.

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) - Amnesty International called on Cyprus
Thursday to grant political asylum to more than 100 illegal
immigrants that the government is planning to repatriate.
	   Amnesty said the immigrants from about a dozen Arab and African
states may be at risk in their homelands.
	   Some 70 members of the group, which includes pregnant women and
children, have been on a hunger strike since Monday to protest the
government decision to repatriate them.
	   The members of the group have been at a hotel under police
guard.
	   The illegal immigrants were rescued from a Syrian fishing boat
that was drifting off southern Cyprus last month.
	   The immigrants had paid the Syrian captain as much as dlrs 5,000
each to be taken to either Greece or Italy.
	   Officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who came
to Cyprus to examine their applications, decided that only three of
the 107 immigrants qualify for political asylum.
	   The government has said it is arranging to repatriate the
remainder.

Swiss central bank carries out own Nazi gold study
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank is
carrying out its own study to shed more light on its gold dealings
with Nazi Germany during World War II, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   The Swiss National Bank, charged with maintaining the strength
of the Swiss currency, faces a U.S. suit by Holocaust survivors
seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   The study, which aims to provide a clearer picture of economic
policy during the war, is already under way, bank spokesman Gabriel
Juri said. He declined to give further details.
	   Studies in recent months have said the central bank should have
known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi Germany during
the war had been looted from the national treasuries of occupied
countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds) of
gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   During the war, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold in
the face of demand for the Swiss franc, the only internationally
acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   The central bank has said it will oppose vigorously any
class-action suit filed against it. The Swiss government called the
suit, filed last month, ``unacceptable.''
	   Both have refused to become involved in negotiations over a
settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups
and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders said the banks
should be paying more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   An open letter obtained by The Associated Press, to appear in
the New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times over the
next week, reiterated Swiss arguments against sanctions.
	   The paid advertisement, addressed to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, was signed ``members of the Swiss business community,''
but no names or companies are mentioned.
	   It expressed concern that sanctions against Swiss firms ``could
trigger a vicious circle of threats and counter-measures.''
	   The Swiss government said President Flavio Cotti will meet on
Sept. 7 with some 12 officials from major Swiss companies, as well
as central bank and government officials, to discuss the sanctions
threats.

Military court rejects civilian trial for U.S. woman in Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru's Supreme Military Tribunal has rejected
a request for a new trial in a civilian court for an American woman
serving a life sentence for treason, army officials said Thursday.
	   U.S. officials and the family of Lori Berenson had requested the
civilian trial, saying she had been denied a fair trial by the
secret military court that convicted her.
	   A hooded military judge found Berenson, 28, of New York City,
guilty of treason on Jan. 11, 1996, for helping leftist Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement rebels plan a thwarted assault on Peru's
Congress.
	   During the trial, Berenson's lawyer was not allowed to challenge
evidence or cross-examine witnesses.
	   Berenson has already exhausted all of her appeals through normal
legal procedures.
	   The highly secretive panel did not say why it had considered the
case. But its decision, released Wednesday, appeared to be a
reaction to concerns by top U.S. officials and even Peru's Prime
Minister Javier Valle Riestra over the fairness of Berenson's
trial.
	   The ruling also suggests that the government will not bend to
U.S. demands for a new trial since President Alberto Fujimori has
close ties to the military.
	   Fujimori, who holds the American's last chance for clemency, has
said Berenson should serve out her full sentence and would get no
special treatment as an American.
	   In its ruling, the military tribunal said Berenson's case falls
within the jurisdiction of the military justice system, since it
involved planning acts of terrorism, said tribunal spokesman
Alfredo Vignolo.
	   The tribunal also said her trial was fair and the request for a
civilian trial was ``unfounded.''
	   The tribunal said there was evidence Berenson was a rebel leader
and lived in a home that housed the group's arsenal. Her mission
was to enter Congress posing as a journalist and obtain information
on its layout and operations in preparation for the attack.
	   These charges were corroborated by her own confession and the
testimony of rebel leaders Miguel Rincon and Adbiel Castrellon, the
communique said.
	   Since her arrest, Berenson, a former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology student, has been held in the frigid Yanamayo prison,
525 miles (850 kms) southeast of Lima, high in Peru's Andes
mountains.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad is calling for a ``national
debate'' on steps to take if the United Nations does not soon lift
its eight-year embargo against Iraq.
	   Iraqi leaders, in a Thursday statement, said they would wait
first for their next round of talks with chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler.
	   Butler is expected in Baghdad in early August.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will only be
lifted after U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of
banned weapons.
	   ``We shall call for a comprehensive national debate on this
subject shortly,'' the Iraqi statement said. It was carried by the
state-owned Iraqi News Agency.
	   It was not clear how the government planned to hold such a
debate or what impact it could have. Public meetings such as
rallies are illegal in Iraq unless they are government organized.
	   The statement was issued following a meeting of the powerful
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath party. The
meeting was chaired by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraq, which denies possessing any banned weapons, has threatened
unspecified actions if the sanctions are not lifted soon.
	   Butler repeatedly has accused Iraq of hiding banned material.

Security council extends Georgia mandate, condemns attacks on
</HEADLINE>
peacekeepers &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council agreed Thursday to
keep U.N. military observers in Georgia for another six months and
condemned recent violence that has uprooted thousands of people and
resulted in the deaths of several peacekeepers.
	   The 15-member council voted unanimously to maintain the
116-member unarmed United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia in
the republic through Jan. 31.
	   An estimated 40,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled the Ghali
region in May during fighting between Abkhazian separatists and
militia groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   The U.N. refugee agency says some 1,600 houses were burned down
_ including several which had been built with dlrs 2 million in
international aid.
	   The council condemned the violence and the house burnings and
also recent attacks on Russian peacekeepers working with the U.N.
force. Five peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in
land mine and other attacks this month.
	   ``We are appalled by the continuing subversive terrorist acts
directed against the collective peacekeeping force and demand of
the Georgian side decisive steps to put an end to them,'' said
Sergey Lavrov of Russia, which has been mediating the dispute.
	   The Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war in which Abkhazian
separatists drove out Georgian government troops. Large-scale
fighting has ended, but sporadic clashes have continued, despite
the peacekeepers' presence.
	   Several council members, including Britain and the United
States, urged Abkhaz officials to drop their opposition to a
special protection unit for the U.N. force.
	   In Geneva last week, negotiators from Georgia and Abkhazia
rededicated themselves to the search for peace despite the new
outbreak of fighting.
	   The council welcomed the meeting and called on both sides to
continue talks.
	   ``That last week's meeting in Geneva took place despite this
unpromising background shows that both sides at least wish to avoid
a repeat of the events of May,'' said Britain's new U.N.
ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock.
	   Greece has offered to hold another round talks in Athens before
the end of this year.

<TEXT>
	   VANNES, France (AP) _ Two small planes collided over the
Atlantic Ocean just off the Brittany coast Thursday, killing all 15
people aboard both aircraft, police said.
	   The crash between a Cessna and a twin-engine plane belonging to
the Proteus company took place at 3:58 p.m. (1358 GMT) in the bay
just off Quiberon, a port 505 kilometers (311 miles) southwest of
Paris.
	   By nightfall, rescuers had recovered seven bodies, but they held
out no hope any of the eight missing were still alive. The search
for the remaining bodies was halted late Thursday and was to resume
early Friday.
	   The Cessna belonged to a local flying club, while the Proteus
plane, a Beechcraft 1900D, was on a regularly scheduled commercial
flight from Lyon to Lorient, a coastal city about 50 kilometers (30
miles) northwest of Quiberon.
	   The Beechcraft apparently had deviated from its regular flight
plan to overfly the giant cruise ship Norway, formerly called the
France, which was sailing just off Quiberon, police said.
	   Fourteen people were aboard the Proteus plane, including 12
passengers and two crew members, said Franklin Deveux, president of
the company. Among the passengers were two babies and two small
children. One person was flying in the Cessna.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   Rescue officials, including several helicopter and two teams of
divers aboard speedboats, rushed to the accident site, police said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
extended their condolences to the families.
	   ``In these painful hours, my thoughts are with the families who
are still uncertain and those already grieving. I express my
support and my deep sympathy,'' Chirac said.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot flew to the accident site
on Thursday afternoon.
	   It was the worst air catastrophe in France since 1992 when an
Airbus 320 crashed near Strasbourg killing 87 people.

Castro reconciles with old Jamaican enemy in sign of Caribbean

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ In a triumphant tour marking Fidel
Castro's return to the Caribbean fold, the Cuban leader met
Thursday with Edward Seaga, an old enemy who once severed Jamaica's
ties with Havana.
	   ``Every conflict has a beginning and has an end, and we have
come to the end,'' Seaga, now the opposition leader, told The
Associated Press after the meeting.
	   The hour-long meeting reflected the regional reconciliation that
has taken several Caribbean leaders to Havana over the past 18
months and inspired them to launch a diplomatic offensive against
the United States' hard stance on Cuba.
	   In a six-day trip ending Aug. 3, Castro is visiting Jamaica,
Barbados and Grenada _ all countries that shunned him at one time
or another.
	   The only opposition to his visit has been voiced in Grenada.
Some politicians on that island say Castro's visit is an insult to
the United States, which lost 18 soldiers in a 1983 invasion to
oust Marxist hard-liners who had overthrown a Cuban-allied
government. Forty-five Grenadians and 29 Cubans also were killed.
	   Seaga said his meeting with Castro, the first ever between them,
was ``very amiable, very frank and vintage Castro, in that we both
had an opportunity to talk around the subject.''
	   ``The subject'' referred to fears from the 1970s that Castro
might export his revolution, taking over Jamaica through proxies.
In Cuba, military training camps were run for Jamaicans and the
Kingston government of Michael Manley nationalized businesses under
a Cuban-inspired program that badly harmed the economy and caused a
flight of educated and skilled Jamaicans.
	   ``Thousands upon thousands left the country,'' Seaga said. ``It
caused the split of many, many families.''
	   In 1980, when Seaga was elected prime minister, ``the economy
was in shambles, almost bankrupt ... and the ambassador was
boasting about Cuban might and what Cuba would do to its enemies.''
So Seaga expelled him and cut ties with Havana.
	   ``We were locked in conflict,'' he said.
	   But on Thursday, Seaga said, ``We made it quite clear that those
days are behind us. We are not dealing with memories. We are
dealing with the future.''
	   That future should include a Cuba fully integrated in the
region's affairs and free of the three-decade-old U.S. sanctions,
said Seaga, a conservative.
	   ``We also do not believe that the embargo has any purpose. (It)
has certainly not demonstrated any usefulness.''
	   Castro did not speak to reporters after the meeting, but he was
expected to deliver a speech later Thursday.
	   Seaga admitted that as the biggest Caribbean nation, a
revitalized Cuba might pose an economic challenge.
	   ``If Cuba becomes a powerhouse ... and its prospects are very
bright ... it will radically change the Caribbean in terms of our
ability to compete,'' he said, noting that they produce the same
goods, such as sugar, rum and citrus.
	   But Jamaica might benefit from its proximity to Cuba by
expanding on an existing program offering the islands as twin
destinations to tourists, he added. Tourism is Jamaica's biggest
foreign currency earner, followed by bauxite and sugar.
	   Castro himself addressed such fears at a rally Wednesday, when
he began his Caribbean tour in Montego Bay, Jamaica's tourist
mecca. ``It is beneficial cooperation and not competition that must
guide our actions in this (tourism) field and in our other
relations,'' he said.
	   Later Thursday, Castro met with Jamaican Cabinet ministers and
the governor-general, who represents Britain, the former colonial
power here.
	   He changed from the military fatigues that he wore to meet Seaga
to a dark business suit and tie for the meeting with Gov. Gen. Sir
Howard Cooke, where he appeared tired and walked stiffly and
slowly.
	   Castro has vigorously denied reports that he was treated last
October for high blood pressure around the brain.
	   ``Castro assured me of his good health,'' Seaga said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Dalia Rakutyte touched her forefinger to
her thumb and scrunched it up to make the circle she formed even
smaller.
	   ``That's Lithuania, 3 million people,'' she said, almost
trembling amid about 200 other Lithuanian fans after her team's
84-82 win over the United States Thursday in a first-round game of
the world championship.
	   ``America is a hundred times that big,'' she said, gesturing now
with her arms to draw a bigger circle in the air. ``Beating an
American team _ any team. It's still an American team.''
	   An American basketball hide is still a big prize in world
basketball and _ if anyone needed reminding - they're easier to
come by when the United States fields anything but its best
players.
	   Former Seton Hall star Arturas Karnisovas scored a game-high 29
and, though the United States could have won on a 30-foot, 3-point
attempt at the gun by Jimmy Oliver _ who finished with 18,
Lithuania deserved the victory.
	   ``They were a little bit better than we were today,'' said coach
Rudy Tomjanovich, who has assembled this hodgepodge of non-NBA
talent over the last month since the lockout began.
	   ``I'll go a bit farther,'' he added. ``They were better for most
of the game than we were. They played a very intense, aggressive
style of basketball.''
	   In fact, they played American-style basketball.
	   ``We came out and wanted to play like they (Americans) play,
which is powerful, physical basketball,'' Karnisovas said. ``We
wanted to be very aggressive and run, run the ball. That's why we
stayed in the game and that's why we won.'' We came out and played
like they do.''
	   The last time the United States lost in a world championship or
Olympics was _ pre-Dream Team _ in the 1990 world championship to
Yugoslavia 99-91 in the semifinals. Since then the U.S. had won 26
straight.
	   The Lithuanians out-ran the Americans and the defense-oriented
U.S. tried to be too free-wielding in the first half and trailed
47-34.
	   ``Karnisovas was a big factor, driving and slashing for the
basket,'' Tomjanovich said. ``They played a very positive,
offensive game. By the time we got it under control it was too
late.''
	   The newly independent Baltic state, the engine of Soviet
basketball before the breakup, took bronze behind the Dream Team in
the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics, but failed to reach the '94
worlds.
	   Granted, this isn't the best U.S. team _ but it isn't the best
Lithuanian team either. The NBA's Zydrunas Ilgauskas _ the Z-man of
the Cleveland Cavaliers _ bowed out with an injury and towering
Portland center Arvydas Sabonis no longer plays with the national
team because of injuries.''
	   Donn Nelson, the Dallas Mavericks assistant who has worked as an
assistant coach for Lithuania for six seasons, was not surprised.
	   ``During the dark years it was kind of the thing that they
(Lithuanians) could use to thumb their nose at the Soviet Union.
They would go into Moscow and kick butt when it came to basketball.
	   ``Except for Arturas and (center) Gintaras Einikis this is a
very young team, but now they believe they can beat anybody.''
	   Lithuania (2-0) leads Group C and the Americans (1-1) will face
South Korea Friday as the first round ends. Second-round play
begins Sunday with the top three in each group advancing.
	   Lithuania on Friday plays Brazil (1-1), which defeated South
Korea 76-73 behind 17 points from Caio Cazziolato and 14 from
Rogerio Klafke.
	   Two other contenders also met as European champion _ and 1990
world champion _ Yugoslavia defeated Russia 82-74 in overtime.
Dejan Bodiroga made six free throws in the final 52 seconds as
Yugoslavia (2-0 to top Group B) scored the last 10 points of the
game.
	   Zeljko Rebraca, the 2.11-meter (7-foot) center led Yugoslavia
with 23. Bodiroga added 16, with 14 from the line.
	   ``We always had the thought that we might lose the game and that
mind-set resulted in us winning it,'' Yugoslavia coach Zeljko
Obradovic said.
	   Russia got 20 points from Vassily Karassev and had four players
foul out. The victory gives Yugoslavia control of preliminary-round
play in Group B. Russia (1-1) and Puerto Rico (1-1) are ahead of
winless Japan. Veteran center Jose Ortiz had game-highs of 22
points and 11 rebounds to lead Puerto Rico past Japan 78-57.
	   In another key game between medal contenders, Greece (2-0)
defeated Italy (1-1) 64-56 in Group A with 18 points from Fragiskos
Alvertis. Gregor Fucka had 19 for the Italians. Also in the group,
Martin Keane topped all players with 14 points and 11 rebounds to
lead Canada (1-1) past winless Senegal 70-57.
	   In Group D, Marcelo Nicola's 14 points helped Argentina (2-0)
win 68-51 over Nigeria (0-2). Spain (2-0) slipped by Australia
(0-2) 77-76 as Alberto Herreros led all scorers with 24. Tony
Ronaldson had 17 for Australia with 10 from Chris Anstey and Andrew
Gaze.

Detention of U.S. diplomats heats debate about foreigners in

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ When suspicious local officials detained an
American military attache for 4 1/2 hours in a remote Chiapas
village, they added fuel to the always simmering national debate
about alleged U.S. interference in Mexico.
	   Since Maj. Thomas Gillen and Sgt. Elizabeth Krug were stopped
Sunday night, talk has heated to the point that a top opposition
party urged the government to consider expelling the two diplomats.
	   The government made no public response to the call, but the
Foreign Relations Secretariat summoned U.S. Charge d'Affaires
Charles H. Brayshaw late Wednesday and asked that embassy staff
give advance notice of travel to the tense southern state, saying
it was for their own protection.
	   Though there is no official obligation to do so, the U.S. State
Department said Thursday the embassy would ``consult informally to
ensure safe travel'' of its staff.
	   ``As was explained to the foreign ministry's representative, as
diplomats we have freedom to travel anywhere in Mexico without
giving prior notice,'' the department said. ``At the same time,
Mexican diplomats are free to travel to any part of the United
States without notifying the Department of State.''
	   The Mexican government has been cracking down on foreign
involvement in Chiapas, where the leftist Zapatista National
Liberation Army took up arms in 1994, calling for greater democracy
and for Indian rights.
	   Local officials claim foreign leftists have encouraged and even
helped finance the rebellion.
	   And all politicians in Mexico _ still stung by the loss of half
its territory to the United States 150 years ago _ are always
sensitive to perceived U.S. intervention
	   Javier Corral, spokesman for the conservative National Action
Party, said the government should determine if Gillen and Krug
violated Mexico's constitutional ban on political activity by
foreigners and expel them if they did.
	   This year, more than 150 foreigners have been expelled for
alleged political activity.
	   Gillen and Krug were detained in Los Platanos, a village
controlled by government supporters but which sits in a county
where support for opposition parties and leftist guerrillas runs
high.
	   Last month, a clash in Los Platanos killed one government
supporter and left five others injured. The Zapatistas denied
involvement, but the next day hundreds of police and soldiers and
police raided three nearby pro-Zapatista settlements. Ten people
died in gunfire.
	   The State Department said the diplomats were on a routine
fact-finding mission when they were detained because they refused
to allow villagers to search their diplomatic vehicle.
	   Mexican lawmakers quoted by newspapers Thursday derided the trip
as ill-conceived. They also criticized a U.S. congressional hearing
Wednesday where witnesses criticized the Mexican government's
strategy in Chiapas.
	   Enrique Ku, coordinator for Indian affairs for the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, said the events demonstrated ``a
meddlesome attitude that does nothing to find a solution to the
indigenous problems,'' the daily Reforma reported.

	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Matt Kuchar, tempted to turn pro after
strong performances at the Masters and U.S. Open, will defend his
U.S. Amateur title next month, then return to Georgia Tech.
	   ``He was very close'' to turning pro, his father, Peter Kuchar,
said Thursday from his home in Orlando, Florida. ``Whenever you're
feeling pressure, the best thing you can do it to take a step
back.''
	   Golfweek first reported the decision in its ``Fax Extra'' weekly
newsletter distributed Thursday.
	   ``It was a decision that did not come easily, and one we now
feel comfortable with,'' the father said.
	   Kuchar left out a slim possibility his son could change his
mind, but ``I'll bet you a lot of money come September that he's in
class at Tech.''
	   He said his son would likely make a formal announcement Aug. 17
during a previously scheduled interview on The Golf Channel.
	   The decision capped a whirlwind year for Kuchar, a 20-year-old
whose happy-go-lucky smile and calmness under the pressure of
competing in major championship endeared him to galleries and
agents alike.
	   Kuchar tied for 21st at the Masters and was in the hunt at the
U.S. Open in June until the back nine in third round. He finished
tied for 14th, making him eligible for both those tournaments next
year.
	   At the British Open, where he missed the cut, Kuchar said he was
``dead in the middle'' over whether to turn pro.
	   Industry sources estimated his endorsement value at about dlrs 2
million, although one source said most proposals relied heavily on
Kuchar meeting incentives.
	   Kuchar has been in Britain for nearly all of July. He played at
Loch Lomond with a sponsor's exemption and missed the cut, then
missed the cut at Royal Birkdale a week later.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a bus in a suburb of
the Algerian capital Thursday, killing two people and wounding 15
others, rescue workers said.
	   The bomb was concealed in a plastic bag that had been placed
behind one of the seats before the bus stopped in the Baraki
neighborhood in southeastern Algiers where the blast occurred.
	   A government communique said 10 people had been injured, two of
them seriously. However, rescuers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, provided higher figures for the number of victims.
	   The bomb went off about 4:30 p.m. (1530 GMT).
	   The Armed Islamic Group (GIA), a radical organization that
vehemently opposes the current government, claimed responsibility
for the bomb.
	   The GIA normally does not take credit for such bombings,
although these type of explosions are often attributed to the
group.
	   Two Islamic activists were killed by Algerian security forces in
the Baraki neighborhood on Tuesday, which may have prompted the bus
explosion.
	   The violence came as a U.N. fact-finding mission into the
violence that has continued unabated in Algeria for the last six
years continued its work.
	   An opposition political party held a rally in Algiers on
Thursday to demand an investigation into human rights by a U.N.
mission now on a fact-finding mission in Algeria.
	   Said Sidi, a leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy, said
Algeria was in the midst of a crisis and welcomed the U.N. mission,
Associated Press Television reported.
	   The U.N. panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares,
arrived in Algeria last week to look into an Islamic insurgency
that was sparked in 1992 after the government canceled
parliamentary elections an Islamic party was set to win.
	   Some 75,000 people have died in the last six years.
	   The U.N. mission is expected to spend about two weeks in
Algeria.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Leftist Shining Path rebels knocked down three
towers supporting electricity cables, cutting off energy to 100,000
people in a remote part of Peru's northern jungle, police said
Thursday.
	   The rebels downed the metal towers, located near the town of
Angasyacu 230 miles (370 kms) northeast of Lima, on Sunday by
cutting through the metal framework at the towers' base with hand
saws, police said.
	   More than a dozen villages and towns in the jungle province of
Huanuco were blacked out. Authorities were still working to repair
the towers and restore power.
	   The rebels spray-painted revolutionary messages and the
hammer-and-sickle on the toppled towers.
	   In past years, Maoist Shining Path rebels destroyed electricity
towers with bombs, blacking out large parts of Peru. But after the
capture of top rebel leaders in the early 1990s, the number of
attacks reduced sharply.
	   Rebels columns continue to operate in remote areas of Peru's
northern jungle, and its southern and central highlands.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A judge ordered a ship belonging to
environmental group Greenpeace released, two days after it was
seized on charges of damaging a local shrimp fishery.
	   The Rainbow Warrior, and its 16-member crew, were expected to
leave the port of Muisne, 120 miles (190 kms) northwest of Quito,
on Thursday for Costa Rica after being detained two days by port
authorities.
	   The detention order was reversed Wednesday night by the
president of the court in Esmeraldas, Holger Vivar, who fired the
judge who had issued the order.
	   The environmental activists had come to Ecuador to protest the
destruction of its coastal mangrove swamps by the shrimp fisheries.
During their protest, they planted several mangrove trees and
occupied a fishery.
	   The owner of the fishery has sued Greenpeace for dlrs 40,000,
charging its activists caused a wall to collapse in his fishery,
releasing his shrimp into the ocean.
	   Environmentalists say the shrimp fisheries are damaging the
mangroves through their use of pesticides, antibiotics and
fertilizers.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican education officials have decided to
begin teaching sex education in 5th grade, one year earlier than
before, arguing students should know about sexuality by the time
their bodies begin to change.
	   ``We must know the origin and nature of our impulses and
(sexual) appetites at an early age,'' education minister Miguel
Limon Rojas said, the daily El Financiero reported Thursday.
	   This year, new science textbooks for students ages 10-11 will
address the physical differences and similarities between the
sexes, the Public Education Secretariat said.
	   The illustrated lessons will include an explanation of
menstruation and the use of calendars to determine when a woman is
most likely to become pregnant.
	   A national parents group welcomed the change as a step towards
fighting disinformation and reducing the number of unplanned
pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted disease.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A 15-year-old boy accidentally
killed his friend when a loaded revolver went off in a class room,
police said Thursday.
	   Luciano da Silva, who allegedly brought the gun to school with
him, died instantly after the weapon went off as his friend was
holding it Wednesday, police spokesman Carlos Camargo said.
	   The pair were in the back of a classroom in Londrina, 400 miles
(650 kms) southwest of Rio, when da Silva showed the gun in a bag
to his friend. The friend, a 15-year-old boy identified only as
EMM, picked the gun up. When the teacher asked what the two were
doing it went off.
	   ``The school has been closed temporarily. We are trying to find
where the weapon came from,'' said Camargo.

Screening fetal bump may help detect Down syndrome earlier

	   LONDON (AP) _ Measuring the bump at the back of a fetus' neck
near the beginning of a pregnancy could help doctors detect earlier
and more accurately whether it is carrying Down syndrome, according
to a study published Friday.
	   Scientists believe that swelling under the skin at the back of
the neck of the fetus at 10 to 14 weeks' gestation is associated
with increased risk of Down syndrome and other birth defects.
	   Researchers at the Fetal Medicine Foundation in London say they
used ultrasound to measure such swellings in 96,127 British women
and were able to predict Down syndrome successfully in 82 percent
of cases.
	   The study was published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal.
	   Researchers said the risk of Down syndrome was high _ estimated
at 1 in 300 or more _ in 268 of the 326 pregnancies that
subsequently were confirmed to be accompanied by the chromosome
disorder. The women had an average age of 31.
	   ``Assessment of risk of chromosomal defects in the first rather
than the second trimester provides the option of earlier invasive
diagnostic testing; consequently, termination of an affected
pregnancy may be less traumatic for couples who choose this
option,'' the researchers wrote.
	   Women not considered to be at high risk, such as those under 35,
are routinely given blood tests for Down syndrome. Older women
often have amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling _ invasive
tests that give much more definitive answers.
	   In the younger childbearing years, the risk of Down syndrome is
1 in 2,000 births. For women over 40, the risk is 1 in every 40
births.
	   The researchers said amniocentesis, where a needle is used to
draw a sample of amniotic fluid from around the baby, identifies
about 30 percent of fetuses with Down syndrome in women aged 37 or
over.
	   Screening women who are at high risk because of their age and
blood chemistry during the middle period of pregnancy gives a
detection rate at 60 percent, they said.
	   Dr. James Haddow of the Foundation for Blood Research in
Scarborough, Maine, said the new technique of earlier screening
represents an important advance.
	   It shows that ultrasound can be applied as a prenatal screening
test in a routine setting for large numbers of women in Britain,
Haddow said in a telephone interview from Maine. However, the U.S.
health care system has not yet been set up to widely accommodate
the new screening method.
	   But in The Lancet, he wrote that similar studies in the United
States and Finland yielded detection rates considerably lower than
the 82 percent claimed in this study. Haddow said not all results
can be positively determined because of various factors, such as
miscarriage.
	   Haddow, who figured the results of the study differently, using
known rates of occurrence as a guideline, believed that the rate of
detection would be closer to 60 percent than 80 percent. He said
that he wasn't finding fault with the study, only the way the data
was calculated.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed Israelis
troops in southern Lebanon Thursday, killing one soldier and
wounding five.
	   Israeli helicopters evacuated the wounded to hospitals in
Israel, security officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said guerrillas ambushed the
soldiers as they were practicing in a live fire exercise.
	   Staff Sgt. Sachar Mintz, 21, was killed and five other soldiers
were slightly wounded, the army said.
	   Security officials in Lebanon said the fighting began when
guerrillas opened fire at positions of the Israeli army and
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia at Sojod, Rihan, Bir
Kallab, and Ghozlan inside the Israeli-occupied security zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia said its guerrillas
attacked the posts, and also detonated bombs under an Israeli
Merkava tank. It gave no casualty figures.
	   The Israeli army said a bomb was thrown at Israeli forces, but
there were no injuries.
	   The guerrillas are trying to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 allied militiamen from the security zone, which Israel
established in 1985 to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.

Olympic brochure omits Salt Lake City introduction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A million copies of a 2002 Winter Olympic
brochure will not include a planned section featuring Salt Lake
City entertainment and tourism highlights.
	   The brochure mock-up submitted to the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee included the information, but Rick Davis, head of the
Salt Lake Convention and Visitors Bureau, which proposed the
brochure, said he did not realize ``the legal ramifications of
doing anything with the Olympic logo.''
	   Davis said bureau attorneys told him non-Olympic information
should be deleted _ including a dozen paragraphs at the beginning
of the brochure about Salt Lake City.
	   ``There could have been a great deal more promotional material
in there, but because it had the Olympic rings and logo, it could
only refer to different Olympic venues,'' Davis said.
	   SLOC spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said organizing committee
attorneys did not review the brochure, but said the changes were
not a legal issue.
	   ``There isn't an edict or a law that says we can't talk about
other stuff. We just never have,'' she said. ``We're just supposed
to talk about the Olympics.''
	   So the finished product rolled out Tuesday omitted references to
area attractions, ranging from Temple Square, to the city's bars
and some ``extremely lusty, feisty entertainment offerings.''
	   Now the brochure includes a single paragraph calling Salt Lake
City ``one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United
States.''
	   Davis offered earlier this year to print 1 million copies of the
brochure for Olympic organizers at a cost of about dlrs 150,000.
The pamphlet was to be used by the visitors bureau and others
agencies _ including Olympic organizers _ to respond to inquires
about the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The brochure still includes a map pinpointing every venue site,
as well as names, addresses, phone numbers and web sites for
agencies that can provide additional information.

White extremists caused last election riots, panel finds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A white extremist group bears
the major blame for trying to disrupt the first democratic
elections in a black homeland, a commission said Thursday.
	   In a report sent to Parliament, the Tebbutt Commission found
that Eugene TerreBlanche's neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging
(Afrikaner Resistance Movement) entered Bophuthatswana in March
1994 intending to kill blacks and frighten people from voting.
	   The ``chilling and horrendous prayer'' of the white extremist
minister that ``it will be expected of us today to shoot dead
kaffirs'' is testimony to their intent, the commission said.
	   In South Africa, kaffir is a derogatory term used by white
racists to describe black people.
	   About 50 people died in the homeland unrest, 250 kilometers (150
miles) west of Johannesburg, which preceded the April 1994 South
African elections. President Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress won the elections.
	   The attack was notable for televised images of a black policeman
publicly killing, execution-style, three white extremists who lay
injured.
	   Ontlametse Bernstein Menyatsoe, who has confessed to the
shootings, is expected on Monday to seek amnesty from a committee
that is investigating human rights abuses from both sides during
white minority rule.
	   Bophuthatswana, one of 10 homelands created under apartheid as
part of a plan to deny blacks citizenship rights, is now a part of
South Africa.
	   Instead of interfering with the elections, the intervention of
white extremists solidified the resolve of the last apartheid
government and the ANC that the balloting should include the whole
country.
	   The commission also blamed the violence on former President
Lucas Mangope, who allied himself with white extremists to keep
control of his homeland; on another white extremist organization;
and on former South African security forces.
	   Violence feared to be intended to create unrest before the 1999
elections has been brewing elsewhere in South Africa over the past
month.
	   Political violence has claimed 40 lives in KwaZulu-Natal, about
280 miles (450 kms) southeast of Johannesburg.
	   The slayings mark a resurgence of violence that claimed 10,000
lives over a decade, then dropped off shortly after 1994. Those
clashes were attributed to fighting between the ANC and the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.
	   The more recent violence is attributed to a simmering feud
between the ruling ANC and a new opposition party, the United
Democratic Movement.

Campaign launched to eliminate violence against women in Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations launches a campaign
Friday to combat violence against women in Africa.
	   The launch coincides with Pan-African Women's Day, which honors
women's contributions to the development in Africa.
	   Violence against women and girls has been pervasive in Africa,
where economic problems, civil and religious wars plague the
continent. Women are often kept from significant social positions
because of the prevalence of male-dominated communities.
	   ``It is critical to raise awareness and build the capacity at
all levels of African societies to create a nonviolent environment
for women and girls, and to broaden the platform from which their
voices against violence can be heard,'' Felicia Ekejiuba, chief of
the Africa section of UNIFEM, said in a statement.
	   UNIFEM is a U.N. women's fund that provides financial support
and technical assistance to programs that promote women's human
rights and their economic and political power.

Arafat to visit South Africa Aug. 11
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
plans to meet with President Nelson Mandela and other top leaders
on a visit Aug. 11 to 13, a foreign affairs spokesman said
Thursday.
	   Arafat is expected to brief Mandela on the Middle East peace
process and discuss bilateral relations, officials said recently.
	   Arafat, on his first visit to South Africa since he attended
Mandela's inauguration in 1994, will also address the South African
Institute of International Affairs on the Middle East peace process
on Aug. 12.
	   Earlier this month, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad visited
Israel, the highest-ranking South African official to visit the
country since the end of the apartheid era. Pahad also visited the
autonomous Palestinian areas on the trip.
	   Israel maintained close ties with South Africa's apartheid
government before Mandela's government came to power in the
country's first all-race elections in 1994.
	   Earlier this year, South Africa signaled its support for
Arafat's Palestinian leadership by refusing to grant a visa to a
the spiritual leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas,
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with sources confirming Morris has quit, details and
background, ADDING byline
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The boss of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. has
resigned _ just two days after German auto rivals BMW and
Volkswagen signed a deal to carve up the legendary luxury carmaker,
an industry source said Thursday night.
	   Graham Morris decided to leave as chief executive of Rolls-Royce
after it became clear earlier this week that in a few years the
fabled automobiles will no longer be made at the company's factory
in Crewe, England, the source said.
	   The source, who is familiar with the situation at Rolls-Royce,
spoke to The Associated Press only on condition of anonymity and
did not provide any extra details.
	   Rolls-Royce declined any comment on the situation. A company
spokesman, Richard Charlesworth, said Rolls-Royce planned to issue
a statement Friday morning.
	   Morris would be leaving the top job at Rolls-Royce at a time of
radical change at the carmaker that through the decades has come to
epitomize hand-made English craftsmanship.
	   Volkswagen AG bought Rolls-Royce early this month for 479
million pounds (dlrs 790 million). But the sale by the engineering
group Vickers PLC did not include the rights to the Rolls-Royce
brand name and logo, which were held by the British jet engine
maker Rolls-Royce PLC.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC sold the brand name on Tuesday for 40 million
pounds (dlrs 66 million) to BMW, its partner in an aerospace
venture, and BMW signed a deal that will let VW use the name for
free until Dec. 31, 2002.
	   After that, BMW plans to create a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
company, while VW will keep the Rolls-Royce plant in Crewe and
continue making Bentleys, the company's other line of luxury cars.
	   The dispute over the brand name left a cloud over Rolls-Royce
that aggravated earlier concerns among some English Rolls-Royce
owners who were angered by the very thought of the company going
German.
	   Morris said Tuesday that new orders for Rolls-Royce and Bentley
automobiles had fallen by about 30 percent in the past six weeks.

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Gerald Williams and Andruw Jones each homered
and drove in three runs in a balanced attack that carried that
Atlanta Braves to a 13-3 victory Thursday over the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Denny Neagle (11-9) gave up five hits in eight innings as the
Braves took three of four in the series and completed a 7-2 road
trip. At 72-37, the NL East leaders are 35 games over .500 for the
first time this season and have the best record in franchise
history.
	   The Reds lost for the 12th time in 14 games and lost two players
to injury. Infielder Pokey Reese tore a ligament in his right thumb
while diving for a ball at third base in the fifth inning and will
require surgery. Second baseman Bret Boone sprained his left ankle
while catching a grounder in the seventh and left the game.
	   Williams got the Braves going by drawing a game-opening walk
from Rick Krivda (0-2) and stealing second and third in a
three-pitch span off the left-hander's slow move to the plate. He
scored on a sacrifice fly by Tony Graffanino, the only Braves
position player who finished without a hit.
	   Barry Larkin and Willie Greene homered for the Reds.
 &UR; Marlins 4, Astros 3
	   In Houston, Livan Hernandez pitched a five-hitter and Cliff
Floyd hit a three-run homer as the Florida Marlins beat the Astros
and avoided a sweep.
	   The Astros won the first three games of the series, but Florida
came back to snap a four-game losing streak and finish its road
trip 2-8.
	   Floyd gave the Marlins a quick 3-0 lead with his home run in the
first inning off Shane Reynolds (12-7).
	   Hernandez (9-7) struck out seven and walked three in his sixth
complete game, third-most in the NL. He struck out Ricky Gutierrez
with runners on first and second to end the game.

Tyson may get license despite missteps in New Jersey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with New Jersey lawmaker calling on board to reject
Tyson &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo TN102 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Yes, Mike Tyson lost his cool
and cursed in front of the people he's asking to license him. But
it may take more than that to keep him from fighting again in New
Jersey.
	   The state Athletic Control Board will meet next week to consider
Tyson's application for a boxing license.
	   The multimillion-dollar question is: How much weight will it
give to Tyson's behavior in Wednesday's licensing hearing in
Trenton?
	   While Tyson didn't do himself any good, the money he can make _
for promoters, casinos and the state _ might outweigh whatever
damage he did.
	   ``To lose your cool with your attorney, say something out of
frustration, why should that have such a big impact?'' promoter
Dino Duva, president of Main Events, said. ``It wasn't like he
cursed at the panel.''
	   Tyson was banned from boxing last year after biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during their WBA heavyweight title fight at Las
Vegas. The ban, issued by Nevada regulators, allowed Tyson to apply
for a license after one year. He chose to do so in New Jersey
instead, and if turned down there, he can still apply in Nevada.
	   His supporters told board members Wednesday he was remorseful
for biting Holyfield and eager to return to the ring. Tyson was on
the verge of tears during some of his testimony, but as the hearing
ended, he grew angry and uttered a profanity in an exchange with
his lawyer.
	   ``I didn't take it that he was swearing at me or the board
personally. He was talking to his attorney at the time,'' board
member Gary Shaw said.
	   Board chairman Gerard Gormley did not return telephone calls to
the board office Thursday.
	   The third member of the panel, Steven Katz, missed the hearing
because he was on vacation. He will not vote on Tyson's license,
leaving it to Gormley and Shaw.
	   ``They are going to deal with all the testimony, evidence as
well as public comments, which is entered into the record,'' said
Rhonda Utley-Herring, executive assistant to boxing commissioner
Larry Hazzard. ``That's what they'll focus on, not just that little
five minutes we've been seeing on television.''
	   What if it's a split decision? If that happens, action would be
delayed until Katz could review the record and a videotape of the
hearing so he could deliver the deciding vote, said Roger Shatzkin,
spokesman for Attorney General Peter Verniero.
	   Shaw would not say what bearing Tyson's behavior would have on
the license application. The board has 45 days to decide. It will
meet next in a private session Thursday.
	   Promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank, who said New Jersey should direct
Tyson back to Nevada for a license, said Tyson showed he still has
problems.
	   ``There's civil, rational behavior and there's uncivil
behavior,'' he said. ``This is not appropriate behavior,
particularly when you're applying for a license, which is a
privilege. Something is wrong here.''
	   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, said Thursday he would not try to prejudge what New
Jersey regulators would do. He declined comment on Tyson's conduct.
	   Duva said Tyson _ who was licensed to fight after serving a
three-year prison term for rape _ deserves another chance.
	   ``The boxing business needs him,'' Duva said. ``He's certainly
the biggest draw. If he ever (bit someone) again, you'd have to
wonder what's going on.''
	   A lawmaker called on the board to reject Tyson's application,
saying approval would make New Jersey ``the International
Embarrassment State.''
	   ``In the end, Mike Tyson showed that he remains a captive of his
inclinations to act out in rages of intolerable behavior, whether
it is with a woman in an Indianapolis hotel room or in the ring
with Evander Holyfield,'' state Sen. Richard Codey said.
	   A co-sponsor of legislation that is aimed at regulating certain
elements of boxing said he was troubled by comments made by the
Control Board's executive director regarding the Tyson hearing.
	   U.S. Sen. Richard Bryan took issue with Larry Hazzard's
contention that the state's consideration of Tyson's request for a
license was consistent with the spirit of the federal legislation.
	   Bryan said in a letter to Hazzard that he had contradicted
himself by saying that New Jersey's consideration of Tyson's
request is ``entirely consistent with both the letter and the
spirit'' of the Professional Boxing Safety Act.

Lowe retires, stays with Oilers as assistant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) _ Kevin Lowe, the defenseman who was
Edmonton's first draft pick, scored the Oilers' first National
Hockey League goal and stayed with them through five Stanley Cups
and more than 1,000 games, retired Thursday.
	   ``I just listened to myself and knew that although last year
wasn't great, it wasn't bad, and perhaps that's a good way to call
it quits,'' said Lowe, 39, who will remain with the Oilers as an
assistant coach. ``I played my whole career on instinct and heart,
and that's what I followed.''
	   The decision to retire came after talking it over with his wife,
former Olympic skier Karen Percy, as well as Oilers general manager
Glen Sather.
	   ``I didn't consult with anybody. Other than family, Mess (Mark
Messier) was the first guy I called. He thought I'd be a good
coach,'' said Lowe, who played in seven All-Star games. ``It's not
an easy decision. As I told Mess, I hope it's easier for him when
it comes time.''
	   Lowe played on five Stanley Cup championship teams in his first
13 seasons with Edmonton, then helped the New York Rangers to the
1994 title. He rejoined the Oilers two years ago, but was limited
to only seven games last season because of an ear infection.
	   ``Kevin was never the guy getting the headlines or setting the
records for scoring the goals,'' Oilers
	   Sather said. ``He was the consummate team guy who helped keep
everything together when things were getting a bit scratchy.''
	   Lowe said he's been thinking about coaching for about 10 years,
but Sather said he knew by Lowe's second season that he would
eventually coach.
	   ``He always wanted to know how things worked and why they
worked. He's going to be a terrific coach.''
	   Lowe's role behind the bench hasn't been determined.
	   ``(Head coach) Ronnie (Low) has all the systems and we're the
foot soldiers,'' Lowe said. ``I look forward to learning from
(Low).''
	   Lowe had 84 goals and 347 assists in 1,254 regular-season games,
and added 10 goals and 48 assists in 214 playoff games.

General Assembly fails to approve key reform proposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly failed Thursday to
approve a key element of Secretary-General Kofi Annan's reform
plan, but U.N. officials were nevertheless upbeat that a weakened
proposal also failed to pass.
	   Instead, the assembly put off until the next session any
decision on so-called ``sunset provisions.'' These time limits
would prevent new U.N. programs from continuing indefinitely after
their effectiveness ends.
	   The United States, one of the most outspoken on the need for
U.N. reform, as well as the European Union, Japan and the Nordic
countries had pressed for the assembly to approve the time limits
this year.
	   The Group of 77, led by Indonesia, wanted the assembly to
delegate the issue to other, technical groups for further study.
Developing countries have the most to lose with sunset provisions,
since new initiatives to eradicate poverty, for example, would have
a definite time and therefore money limit.
	   Though the time limits would only cover new programs, many in
the G77 feared that down the line they could become retroactive,
cutting off programs from which they had benefited for years.
	   The limits had been an important part of Annan's plans to reform
the cash-strapped United Nations and increase its efficiency. The
United States, which strongly backed Annan's candidacy for the top
U.N. post, has made U.N. reform a condition of paying the estimated
dlrs 1.3 billion in arrears it owes.
	   But the failure of Washington to pay up even as Annan works to
reduce U.N. waste has hurt its credibility in reform debates. It
was the European Union which took a strong stand to prevent the G77
from pushing off the issue to technical groups, where it could have
languished.
	   ``It could've been worse,'' said John Ruggie, a special advisor
to Annan on policy issues. ``Considering the circumstances, we're
pleased that it was kept at the level of the plenary,'' as a policy
issue rather than pushed off as a technical one.
	   Under Annan's proposal, the General Assembly would have to
assign a time limit, of say five years, for any new initiative they
approve. After five years, they must specifically approve the
initiative's continued life. Otherwise, it would automatically end.

B.C. Open to move to July in 2000, opposite British Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ENDICOTT, New York (AP) _ The B.C. Open always has been unique.
No network television, no major corporate sponsor.
	   And for much of the past 25 years, it has been a fixture of
fall, played in the cool days of September.
	   But starting in 2000, the B.C. Open will be played in July _
opposite the British Open _ for at least three years.
	   Although the field for the B.C. Open is not usually as strong as
most of the other stops on the PGA Tour, once the schedule switch
is effective, the premier players will opt to play in the British
Open, one of golf's four major tournaments.
	   In 2000, the British Open will be held July 20-23 at St.
Andrews, but organizers of the B.C. Open remain optimistic.
	   ``The British Open has been around over 100 years, so I don't
think we're going to hurt them too much,'' former B.C. Open
director Alex Alexander said jokingly Thursday. ``It's the week
before the Ryder Cup. It's a super date for us.''
	   The B.C. Open, to be staged Sept. 17-20 this year, will have a
purse of dlrs 1.5 million, a record for the tournament but still
one of the lowest on the PGA Tour. The tournament has existed since
its inception in 1971 without financial benefit of a major
corporate sponsor.
	   And it is not in danger of disappearing.
	   ``We're going to be on tour, we're not going to be kicked off,''
Alexander said. ``They didn't want us to leave.''

Paralyzed gymnast transferred to Manhattan rehab center

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Paralyzed gymnast Sang Lan was moved to a
Manhattan rehabilitation clinic Thursday, the first step in what
her family hopes will be a return to athletic competition.
	   Doctors warn the 17-year-old from China may never even walk
again.
	   Sang arrived in Manhattan by ambulance from Nassau County
Medical Center. Immobilized on a stretcher, with her parents
walking alongside, she was carried through a media horde into the
Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Institute.
	   The teen-ager broke her neck a week ago during a warm-up vault
at the Nassau Coliseum. She underwent surgery Saturday, but has
little sensation from the chest down. Doctors have discounted some
toe movement as an involuntary twitch.
	   At Mount Sinai, she will benefit from ``one of the few model
spinal-cord-injury centers in the United States,'' said Dr. Brock
Schnebel, chief medical officer for the Goodwill Games. However, he
said in a statement, ``there has been no change in Sang Lan's
neurological condition.''
	   In addition to physical treatment _ including an experimental
nerve-building drug _ the teen-ager will get moral support from
Chinese staff doctors and students at the hospital on Manhattan's
Upper East Side.
	   ``We're going to translate for her. And we can give her another
kind of care _ make her feel she's not alone,'' Dr. Jian Dong said.
	   For the next several weeks, she will learn to ``optimize her
physical skills ... and enhance her transition back to everyday
activities,'' Mount Sinai spokesman Mel Granick said in a
statement.
	   It was here that New York Jets defensive end Dennis Byrd was
treated for a paralyzing spinal cord injury he suffered during a
game six years ago. His recovery was termed ``miraculous.''
	   To buoy her spirits at the center, Sang also brought a treasured
item: a bulletin board adorned with actor Leonard DiCaprio's
picture and cards from hundreds of well-wishers.
	   Sang was disappointed when told the movie ``Titanic'' wasn't yet
available on video, but Paramount Pictures rushed to the rescue,
sending a studio copy.
	   As for DiCaprio, the actor's Los Angeles publicist, Cindy
Guagenti, said she had informed him of Sang's wish to meet him, and
arrangements were being made for some kind of encounter. For
security reasons, Guagenti would not discuss details.

ready to talk peace. ``Milosevic assured us that the military
action has come to a halt,'' said Albert Rohan, an Austrian
diplomat who headed a three-member European Union delegation in
talks with the Yugoslav president. During the offensive over the
past week, many people have been reported killed and tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled their homes. The Kosovo
rebels are fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic
within Yugoslavia. The province's population of 2 million is 90
percent ethnic Albanian. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ In a triumphant tour marking Fidel
Castro's return to the Caribbean fold, the Cuban leader met
Thursday with Edward Seaga, an old enemy who once severed Jamaica's
ties with Havana. ``Every conflict has a beginning and has an end,
and we have come to the end,'' Seaga, now the opposition leader,
told The Associated Press after the meeting. The hour-long meeting
reflected the regional reconciliation that has taken several
Caribbean leaders to Havana over the past 18 months and inspired
them to launch a diplomatic offensive against the United States'
hard stance on Cuba. In a six-day trip ending Aug. 3, Castro is
visiting Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada _ all countries that shunned
him at one time or another. (JAMAICA-CASTRO)
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ India on Thursday formally rejected
Pakistan's proposal for outside mediation to help resolve the
dispute over the restive Kashmir region, a senior government
official said. ``India is in favor of direct and sincere dialogue
and we believe we can work out an acceptable position,'' said the
official, who could not be identified under briefing regulations.
India expressed its position to Pakistan during a meeting of
foreign ministry officials of the two countries at a seaside
resort. The meeting came a day after their prime ministers agreed
to resume stalled talks. (INDIA-PAKISTAN-NUCLEAR)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Truth and Reconciliation
Commission shuts down part of its work on Friday and turns to
producing the report aimed at shaping a nation emerging from
apartheid's emotional rubble. Friday's deadline for testimony
affects the commission's human rights committee, which since 1996
has heard or read reports from 21,000 victims of abuse during white
minority rule. A separate committee considering amnesty for those
accused of political crimes continues its work. Chaired by Nobel
Laureate Desmond Tutu, the commission was created by President
Nelson Mandela's government after 1994's first all-race elections
to help heal the breaches of apartheid. (SOUTH AFRICA-TRUTH

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The number of refugees and asylum seekers
worldwide dropped by about 6 percent in 1997, according to a survey
released Thursday, aided by a reduction in the fighting in some
regions and the repatriation of refugees. Sudan led the world in
the number of internally displaced people, the survey said. Among
the reasons for the drop in refugees _ from 14.5 million people in
1996 to 13.6 million in 1997 _ were the decrease in conflict and
the repatriation of a large number of refugees to places like
Rwanda and Bosnia, said Bill Frelick, senior policy analyst at the
U.S. Committee for Refugees. (WORLD REFUGEES)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks rallied Thursday as bargain
hunters tried to take advantage of a nearly continuous slide from
the record highs set earlier this month. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 111.99 points _ or 1.2 percent _ to 9,026.95, wiping
out the losses of the prior two days, but still more than 300
points from July 17's record of 9,337.97. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Growth in Americans' wages and benefits is
slowly accelerating, rising 3.5 percent during the year ended in
June _ a figure well above inflation in consumer prices. It was the
biggest 12-month increase in 4 1/2 years and compares with 3.3
percent for the 12 months ended in March and 2.8 percent for the
year finishing in June 1997, the Labor Department said Thursday.
The report illustrated why Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
told Congress earlier this month that, despite the dampening impact
on the United States of the Asian economic crisis, he continues to
worry more about inflation than a recession. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Japan's new government needs to move rapidly
to fix its banking system and stimulate its recession-mired
economy, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
Thursday. He declined to comment on a report in The New York Times
that bad debts held by Japanese banks approach dlrs 1 trillion,
nearly twice the official estimate. Summers said that among the
economic areas new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has to address is
the need for ``an aggressive infusion of public funds'' to resolve
the banking crisis and boost the domestic economy. (US-JAPAN)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In its first sale of dollars in global currency
markets since 1992, the United States spent a total of dlrs 833
million last month to prop up the faltering Japanese yen. The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Thursday provided the first
details of the June 17 foray into the foreign exchange markets,
which the United States carried out with Japan to halt a freefall
in the yen. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had announced the
coordinated intervention at the time, but gave no details of the
extent of the operation. Currency traders had estimated that the
United States sold around dlrs 2 billion to buy yen and that Japan
sold a similar amount. (US-JAPAN-DOLLAR)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Glaxo Wellcome PLC said Thursday its half-year
profits fell 21 percent to 827 million pounds (dlrs 1.36 billion),
mainly because it lost U.S. patents on two key medicines, but the
drugmaker encouraged investors with a bullish outlook for new
products. Traders pushed Glaxo Wellcome up by 9 percent to 1,905
pence (dlrs 31.24) per share by late afternoon on the London Stock
Exchange. Glaxo Wellcome said its earnings for the six months
ending June 30 compared with profits of 1.05 billion pounds in the
same period a year earlier. Glaxo Wellcome attributed the big
decline to last year's loss of U.S. patents for two top-selling
medicines, the ulcer drug Zantac and the herpes medication Zovirax.
(BRITAIN-EARNS-GLAXO WELLCOME)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Industrial production in the 15-nation
European Union rose by 1.3 percent between February and April 1998,
compared with the previous three-month period, the EU's statistics
office said Thursday. It was also up 1.3 percent for the 11
countries that qualify for the launching of the single currency,
the euro, on Jan. 1, 1999, Eurostat said in a statement. Germany
registered the highest three-month rise, with 1.8 percent, followed
by France and Portugal, with 1.6 percent. Italy registered the
lowest growth, with 0.1 percent, followed by Britain (0.2 percent)
and Austria (0.2 percent). (EU-INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank is
carrying out its own study to shed more light on its gold dealings
with Nazi Germany during World War II, a spokesman said Thursday.
The Swiss National Bank, charged with maintaining the strength of
the Swiss currency, faces a U.S. suit by Holocaust survivors
seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims. The study, which aims to provide a clearer
picture of economic policy during the war, is already under way,
bank spokesman Gabriel Juri said. (SWISS BANKS-NAZIS)

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Actor and producer Michael Douglas took on
a new role Thursday when he was recognized as a United Nations
Messenger of Peace.
	   ``This role means as much to me as the two Oscars I've won,'' he
said at a press conference. ``I've always been a great admirer of
the United Nations.''
	   The citation is given to those in arts, literature, music or
sports who have agreed to focus worldwide attention on the work of
the United Nations. Other Messengers of Peace include tenor Luciano
Pavarotti and basketball star Magic Johnson.
	   Douglas said he plans to concentrate on the issues of
disarmament and human rights.
	   ``I hope to use the attraction of entertainment ... to talk less
about movies and hopefully a lot more about these issues,'' he
said.
	   In a statement, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``emissaries
such as Michael Douglas promote the important work of the United
Nations in world affairs.''
	   Douglas, who has more than 20 years experience in theater, film
and television, earned his first academy award as a producer of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' which won best picture in
1975.
	   He won his second as best actor for his portrayal of a ruthless
inside trader in ``Wall Street'' in 1988.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Stevie Wonder, whose music was
banned by the former apartheid government, visited the jail cell
Thursday where Nelson Mandela was held.
	   ``As I always say when I speak of President Mandela, he's our
king and president,'' Wonder said.
	   Wonder traveled by helicopter to Robben Island, where South
Africa's first black president spent much of his 27 years in
custody. The prison has been converted to a national monument.
	   Wonder also visited the rock quarry where Mandela did hard labor
and was given a piece of stone by officials.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Tired of children cutting class to
search for spiders, school officials in the southern Philippines
are cracking down on a favorite pastime in rural areas: spider
wrestling.
	   A ban on spider wrestling, in which spiders are placed on a
stick to fight to the death, began last week in North Cotabato
province after school officials traced numerous absences to the
game, Isidro Valeroso, superintendent of schools in the province,
said Thursday. The matches also encourage gambling, Valeroso said.
	   Children usually go out spider hunting at dawn or dusk,
sometimes skipping classes or arriving late. Aficionados search for
spiders on trees and power lines, housing their best ``gladiators''
in matchboxes. A prized fighter can sell for more than dlrs 2.
	   Valeroso cited another reason to stop children from killing
spiders: ``We have to teach children that spiders are a farmer's
best friend because they catch insects that destroy or damage
crops.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. has tightened its
grip on the James Bond film franchise.
	   A preliminary injunction ordering Sony Entertainment Corp. to
halt work on its own 007 thriller was signed Wednesday by U.S.
District Judge Edward Rafeedie. It prohibits Sony from developing
the film until MGM's copyright infringement lawsuit is resolved.
	   The case is scheduled to go to trial Dec. 15.
	   ``We're going to prove Sony is a corporate predator,'' MGM
attorney Pierce O'Donnell said. ``We're going to seek millions upon
millions of dollars in damages.''
	   MGM showed that it owns U.S. film and television rights for all
Bond novels written by Ian Fleming, Rafeedie wrote. The injunction
bars Sony from working on a Bond film or seeking agreements with
Hollywood talent or advertisers for a Bond movie.
	   Sony attorney David Steuber said he likely would appeal the
decision. He said it was possible that work could go on outside the
United States.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Glitzy neon shining from new hotels and
fast-food shops brightens the shabby streets of this tropical
capital.
	   Earth movers are clearing the way for Zambia's first
state-of-the-art shopping mall. New cars ply the streets, while
minibus taxis jockey ferociously for fares. The first independent
radio station blares American hits.
	   Seven years after the first democratic elections swept a
reform-minded president to power, Zambia seems a country on the
move.
	   Critics say that appearance is just that _ an appearance.
	   The government of President Frederick Chiluba, a former labor
leader, boasts it has created the freest economy in southern
Africa, replacing nearly three decades of autocratic socialism that
bankrupted one of the region's potentially richest nations.
	   Import duties have been slashed and currency controls abolished.
Accounting for 80 percent of economic activity, state-owned
enterprises _ everything from dry cleaners to chemical factories _
have mostly been sold to private buyers, some from South Africa and
Europe.
	   ``I don't care if the cat is black or white as long as it
catches the mouse,'' Chiluba declared at a regional economic summit
in May.
	   The prosperity is only skin deep, say business and community
leaders in this nation of 10 million people.
	   Outside the towns, social services are minimal, road travel is
tortuous and less than 10 percent of arable land is under
cultivation. The average income is about 748,000 kwacha (dlrs 400)
a year.
	   Investment has largely gone into shops and other trading
facilities rather than in building agricultural or industrial
production that creates jobs, said Ngande Mwanajiti, an economist
and development specialist.
	   ``It is difficult to assess whether we are actually moving
forwards or backwards,'' Mwanajiti said.
	   The government has failed to sell its biggest asset, the
overstaffed and inefficient state copper mines, which account for
10 percent of the economy and earn 90 percent of Zambia's foreign
currency holdings.
	   It has dithered over the price, and been slowed by emotional
debate over the loss of the ``national patrimony'' to foreigners,
who are described by opponents of privatization as new
colonialists.
	   ``The government is in a hole. The sale is an economic
imperative but a huge political risk to a party that wants to stay
in power and always turns in the end to selfish political
interests,'' Mwanajiti said.
	   Officials concede the government is losing 1.8 billion kwacha
(dlrs 1 million) a day keeping Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
running.
	   Western donors and lending institutions, which now provide about
15 percent of the government's revenues, are unlikely to tolerate
the mines' losses much longer, Mwanajiti said.
	   Industrial production slumped 15 percent from January to March,
accompanied by a dramatic slowdown in the overall economy and a 35
percent fall in the value of the Zambian currency, said Mark
O'Donnell, the head of the Zambia Association of Manufacturers.
	   Manufacturers blame the slump on the government losing its nerve
on pressing ahead with economic reforms. Executives say a failed
military coup Oct. 28 and a sweeping two-month state of emergency
afterward did not affect the economy.
	   As many as 15,000 jobs are at risk from the copper mines sale
and tens of thousands more have been lost under the economic
liberalization program.
	   ``After years on the gravy train, people losing their jobs make
up quite a considerable constituency of voters,'' O'Donnell said.
	   ``I'd say some way down the road the bubble is going to burst
and we could be seeing food lines again,'' he added.
	   Pervasive top-level corruption remains largely unchecked is
another problem, Mwanajiti said.
	   Western nations also have voiced concern about slippage in
democratic governance. Electoral and constitutional reform has
stalled, Chiluba retains overwhelming powers and a ruling party
``image building committee'' has warned the government's critics
against being ``unpatriotic.''
	   Independent Radio Phoenix has been refused a broadcast license
to operate in the populous Copperbelt province, the industrial
heartland and home of the troubled state mines.
	   Chiluba's party, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, came to
power in a 1991 election victory that drove President Kenneth
Kaunda from power after 27 years of single party rule.
	   Kaunda was disqualified from running in 1996 and led an
opposition boycott of that election.
	   After last fall's coup attempt, Kaunda was put under house
arrest on charges he knew about it in advance. The charges were
dropped June 1, and the 74-year-old Kaunda announced his retirement
from politics.
	   ``Kaunda's departure doesn't resolve anything. He was never a
real threat,'' said Mwanajiti.

Researchers in Germany isolate gene mutation for colorblindness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Researchers at Tuebingen University in
southern Germany say that they have isolated the defective gene
that causes full colorblindness.
	   The discovery means that potential parents will be able to find
out whether they carry the recessive trait that causes the rare
inherited disorder, called rod monochromacy. Eventually, it could
lead to gene therapy to treat the colorblindness, researchers said.
	   People with rod monochromacy cannot sense any colors from birth,
seeing only various shades of gray.
	   About one in 50,000 people suffers from the disorder, chronicled
by Oliver Sacks in his 1997 book ``The Island of the Colorblind,''
about the Micronesian island of Pingelap where 10 percent of the
inhabitants are fully colorblind.
	   German geneticist Bernd Wissinger and Canadian vision scientist
Lindsay Sharp said their research, published in this month's New
York-based Nature Genetics journal, involved tests on colorblind
people in Germany, Norway, Italy and the United States.
	   Sharp said the team isolated a gene mutation on Chromosome 2
that blocks light reception in parts of the eye's retina known as
cones.
	   ``We just happened to be focusing on this particular gene, and
in a sense got lucky,'' Sharp said, adding that other researchers
have been looking for the gene. ``There is always a race going on
in molecular genetics.''
	   The mutation affects reception in each of the three cones linked
with the sensation of red, green and blue light. The defective gene
blocks the production of a cell component necessary for the cones
to function properly, Sharp said.
	   Sharp said he could not rule out the existence of other
defective genes capable of causing the same disorder.
	   Joel Pokorny, a colorblindness expert at the University of
Chicago, said the Tuebingen research represented ``an interesting
find.''
	   ``If you have an understanding of what the genetics are, you can
maybe at some point find a treatment,'' Pokorny said.
	   Though babies with full colorblindness often show symptoms of
the disorder almost immediately, isolating the gene responsible
will allow doctors to confirm the presence of the disorder earlier,
Sharp said.

Milking the benefits of Zambia's privatization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Deceptive Zambia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Privatization means dairy farmers around
Zambia's capital get paid on time and the milk doesn't get watered
down anymore.
	   Milk production has soared from about 660 gallons (2,500 liters)
a day to 2,200 gallons (8,300 liters) in Lusaka and four provincial
towns.
	   Since Bonnita, a South African company, bought one division of
the state Dairy Produce Board in 1996 for nearly dlrs 1 million it
has tested all milk deliveries for butter fat content and paid cash
up front to farmers for their milk.
	   ``Before, payments were very irregular and there was a tendency
to add water,'' said Stuart Cruickshank, technical director of the
Zambia Privatization Agency.
	   Bonnita now markets a wide range of flavored yogurts, butter,
cream and fresh juices, replacing imported dairy products for the
first time in years.
	   The government dairy company was one of 226 state businesses
that have been ``unbundled'' and converted to private ownership.
Negotiations for selling 55 others are under way.
	   Breweries, sugar plantations and chemical plants went to large
foreign companies. But about 70 percent of privatized businesses
have been small- and medium-size concerns sold to local buyers, the
agency says.
	   Though many still have to find their feet, commercialization is
the success story of Zambia's economic reforms, Cruickshank says.
	   Under state control, less than 15 percent of state companies
made profits, basic commodities were constantly in short supply and
many state employees regarded their jobs as ``social welfare.''
	   ``There are still hurdles to cross, but our productive skills
are being upgraded all the time,'' Cruickshank said.

<TEXT>
	   BAN KHOK SA-NGA, Thailand (AP) _ There probably aren't many
things scarier than having a four-meter (13-foot-long) king cobra
chomp down on your shoe, fangs dripping venom that can kill a man
in 20 minutes.
	   For Somchai Phimsaimol, it's a routine hazard of performing in a
stage show with cobras.
	   ``I've been bitten 28 times,'' Somchai said after two men pried
the serpent off his foot. The sneaker was damp with poison, but
he'd curled his toe back just enough to miss being punctured.
	   Last year, he wasn't so lucky. A king cobra latched on to his
finger and the knuckle remains bent at a weird angle.
	   Somchai, 52, forgave the snake, as would most people in Ban Khok
Sa-Nga, which is rapidly gaining fame as the ``king cobra village''
of Thailand.
	   Whenever paying visitors turn up at the otherwise ordinary
village in the arid, poor northeast, Somchai or another of his
neighbors puts on a show with a king cobra or two, dancing and
playfully sparring with them on a stage about the size of a boxing
ring.
	   Snake shows are common in Thailand, but these are special. Ban
Khok Sa-Nga is home to the King Cobra Conservation Project, backed
by the Wildlife Fund of Thailand, which is trying to preserve the
fearsome serpents.
	   The goal is to get more people to view king cobras as valuable
money earners, rather than dangers best killed and maybe stir-fried
into a chili-laden local delicacy.
	   Rapid clearing of land for farming has brought king cobras to
the brink of extinction in Thailand. Most Thais probably don't
mind. The reptiles inspire instinctive fear _ one killed a few
years ago measured 18 1-2 feet (5 1/2 meters) long.
	   Ban Khok Sa-Nga has always been a bit different. Rice
cultivation is difficult here, so a few families long ago turned to
supplementing their incomes by performing with snakes and taking
them on traveling medicine shows.
	   The wildlife project has modernized and expanded that
friendship.
	   Now, 70 of the village's 120 families are involved with king
cobras, keeping and breeding 80 full-grown serpents in wooden
hutches at their homes. Offspring are kept or sold to other snake
shows or introduced into the wild.
	   Newly captured king cobras are purchased from other people in
the region for 1,000 baht (dlrs 25) a meter (yard), spreading the
idea that it's more profitable to let the snakes live.
	   Proceeds from the shows, held on a stage built with money
provided by the project, are shared equally among the cobra-keeping
families. They average about 1,000 to 2,000 baht (dlrs 25 to dlrs
50) a month, a significant sum in a country where rural families
earn about 24,000 baht (dlrs 600) a year from farming.
	   ``I respect the snakes, because in this village we have extra
money from breeding and raising them,'' Somchai said. ``It's like a
member of my family. I would cry if I couldn't feed him, as if he
was my child.''
	   When one dies _ some live as long as 30 years _ it gets a
three-day funeral. The remains are buried deep in the forest, since
local legend says the bones can poison soil.
	   One of the more unusual snake shows is given by Suphap
Pothisuwang and a 10-year-old female cobra he calls Baby Disco.
	   Suphap, 36, puts the snake's head inside his mouth _ ``she
flicks her tongue onto my Adam's apple'' _ and removes her, then
stuffs her down his baggy trousers. She eventually slithers out the
cuff.
	   The performers also box with the cobras. Keeping in an athlete's
crouch, the performer darts from side to side in front of the
snake. He moves his hands and feet close to the cobra trying to
entice a strike, then quickly backs away when the snake hurls
forward.
	   ``When you box a cobra, you have to anticipate the move,''
Suphap said. ``They normally lunge to the left.''
	   Not everyone finds the shows an ideal way to preserve the
species.
	   Dr. Montri Chiobamroongkiat, chief of quality control at the
main Bangkok snake serum center, says the shows stress the snakes
and shorten their lives. He also worries about the human
performers.
	   The villagers of Ban Khok Sa-Nga say no one there has been
killed by a snake bite because they all carry a root known as ``wan
ngu,'' which is a folk herbal cure for snake bites in Thailand.
	   Health experts say that by itself, wan ngu is not always enough
and anyone getting a serious bite will need real serum made from
snake venom. The villages have just been lucky with their king
cobras, Montri said.
	   ``It's the biggest poisonous snake in the world, so it has the
most amount of poison,'' he said. ``When it bites, it hangs on, so
more poison goes into the body than with any other snake.''

Albanian actor's rise and fall: a calamity in three acts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY379-382 &QL; 
 &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the reshuffled ethos of post-Cold War Europe,
Albania remains a huge wild card. Anything seems possible. An
unruly incarnation of capitalism legitimizes mafia bosses and
flusters foreign investors. Police are outgunned by looted weapons.
Many people have lost their footing in the jolt from paranoid
isolation to frontier-style tumult. One of them is a celebrated
actor named Victor Zhusti. His fall from grace is a metaphor for
Albania.
 &UR; ___ &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The end.
	   One night, about six or seven years ago, credits rolled across a
cinema screen. The music faded. People stretched and headed for the
door.
	   Movies died that night in Albania, a country then just emerging,
naive and ill-prepared, from its thick, communist-spun cocoon.
There was no time or money for frivolities such as films.
	   The end. Of evenings watching double bills of Albanian-produced
dramas in cinemas with spine-pinching seats and cheap speakers
distorting the sound. The end of a state-coddled film industry that
employed thousands. The end for actors like Victor Zhusti, who knew
only the insular, pampered life of an artist approved by an
authoritarian regime.
	   That last picture show symbolized another step toward a new and
combustible Albania, lurching from political crises to gun-looting
anarchy to, most recently, the edge of a potential blood bath
between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Albania was the most isolated, mysterious corner of the
communist edifice. Now, open to the outside world, it presents a
picture of almost surreal squalor.
	   Rutted roads lead past the abandoned hulks of giant
communist-era factories. Bandits hold up an international aid team
in the heart of the capital in broad daylight, demand dlrs 5,000,
then, over coffee with their hostages, settle for dlrs 1,000. Kids
skateboard on the slopes of a monstrous concrete pyramid built to
honor former dictator Enver Hoxha.
	   Meanwhile, the outside world reaches Albanians via video
cassettes and satellite dishes, and the old movie houses that once
fostered the fantasy of a worker's paradise now limp along showing
porn films.
	    &UR; ___
	   Prologue: Athens.
	    &UR; ___
	   The deal, as portrayed in Greek police documents, was supposed
to be quick and uncomplicated: money for heroin. Just a few seconds
on an Athens sidewalk, and Victor Zhusti, film star turned drug
middleman, could walk away richer.
	   But what was happening? Nothing was going as rehearsed. There
shouldn't be so much arguing. Nervously, Zhusti looked around. At
least no one was paying them any attention. The post-Christmas
sales were in full swing and the next day was Jan. 6, the Epiphany
holiday.
	   The deal fell apart. Zhusti went home.
	   Just before midnight, he heard a knock at the door.
	   He was about to hit bottom.
	    &UR; ___
	   ACT I: The rise
	    &UR; ___
	   ``He was like, I don't know, Albania's John Wayne and Dustin
Hoffman rolled together,'' said Aida Sama, a drama student in
Tirana.
	   But today, like the crumbling igloo-shaped bunkers on every
Albanian hillside, Victor Zhusti represents a past left untended
and unmourned.
	   At least there's some use for the concrete bunkers. Built to
keep out phantom enemies during decades of fanatical
totalitarianism, they are being demolished for building material,
or converted into convenience stores where cigarettes and soft
drinks are sold through the gun-barrel slits.
	   What happens, though, to an actor with nowhere to act?
	   Zhusti's story is a set piece for these orphans of the post-Cold
War, for whom freedom is weighed down by heavy millstones of
insecurity.
	   Across Eastern Europe and the Balkans, the collapse of communism
cast adrift artists, professors and others who enjoyed
state-sanctioned privileges and must now cope with the open market.
	   The transition was most stark in Albania, ruled for more than 40
years by Enver Hoxha as a private fiefdom. In this mountainous,
Massachusetts-size country of 3.5 million people, generations were
raised in a cloistered society ruled by an odd mix of political
repression and timeless village traditions.
	   State media was unvarnished propaganda, and mosques and churches
were looted and burned in atheistic purges _ not unusual in most
communist regimes, but enforced with a vengeance in Albania.
	   About the only approved diversion was the homegrown cinema and
theater. Directors churned out dozens of productions each year,
always following the accepted formulas: patriotism, socialism,
sex-free romance.
	   This was Zhusti's world. When the regime started to unravel, so
did Zhusti's life.
	   ``To understand what happened in Albania, just look at what
happened to Victor Zhusti,'' said Luljeta Andoni, a staff member at
the Albanian newspaper Illyria in New York. ``He once represented a
movie-studio version of Albania. He now is showing another side of
the story in real life.''
	   Zhusti (pronounced ZOO-stee) grew up believing he was an orphan.
He was born in Athens in 1942, and at age 3 was taken across the
border by his Greek-Albanian father to Gjirokastra, in southern
Albania. As Hoxha's birthplace, the town had such luxuries as paved
side streets _ rare for provincial cities.

TIRANA: provincial cities.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Zhusti's father told the boy his mother had died in World War
II. He left him with an uncle and disappeared from his life.
	   As Zhusti grew up, Albania grew ever more isolated. It was the
only communist country bent on making its way alone, without a
superpower _ the Soviet Union or China _ to hold its hand.
	   As Albania slid deeper into poverty and backwardness, Zhusti
turned to theater, crafting his own universe on the warped and
termite-chewed stage of the Cajupi playhouse in Gjirokastra.
	   He never stopped working, often crafting his lines and gestures
late into the night. He began to amass fans, whose bouquets
brightened his uncle's drab apartment.
	   ``He needed to act. It was like food to him,'' said fellow actor
Kico Londo.
	   In 1970, Zhusti joined the National Theater troupe. Here he got
his first sample of foreign fare: Shakespeare, clandestine readings
of Tennessee Williams.
	   He became a virtuoso of the intricate Albanian language, the
only surviving branch of the ancient tongue called Illyrian. ``He
could bring people to tears with just the way he used the Albanian
language,'' recalled Gezim Kame, director of the National Theater.
``He had a gift.''
	   Soon after arriving in Tirana, Zhusti made the first of about 20
films. From playing fearless fighters battling fascists, he moved
to light comedies and social dramas: a bachelor caught in the web
of an arranged marriage, a confused villager coping with urban
life, a parent deciding whether to have a second child.
	   Tall, and lean, with dark, soulful eyes, strong chin and
beguiling smile, Zhusti made a natural leading man.
	   But he preferred to hunt and fish when he should have been
appearing at Communist Party functions, and that gave him a faint
rebel aura. So the state discouraged critics from praising his
performances too lavishly.
	   ``He was not a favorite of Big Brother,'' said Remzi Lani,
executive director of the Albanian Media Institute.
	   Then, in 1983, Zhusti became too big to ignore. Word reached him
that his mother was, in fact, alive. His father had concocted the
story to keep Zhusti from searching for her. Zhusti was allowed the
rare privilege of traveling to Greece to see her. Their reunion was
staggering news in a country unaccustomed to revelations.
	   The state spin-doctors took full advantage.
	   A letter signed by Zhusti's mother appeared in the government
press, thanking the country for raising her boy.
	   ``All Albania should be proud,'' she wrote.
	   But for communist Albania, the end was already approaching.
	    &UR; ___
	   ACT II: Departure
	    &UR; ___
	   By 1990, Hoxha was dead and his political heirs were foundering.
The Berlin Wall was breached. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
were free. Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator, and his wife
had died before a firing squad. The tremors were finally
penetrating Albania's corner of the Balkans.
	   It began with a student revolt and attacks on monuments and
museums extolling Hoxha. In Gjirokastra, Zhusti watched as a mob
toppled a bust of Hoxha.
	   The frontiers opened, and Albanians poured out. Freighters,
speedboats _ just about anything that could float _ ferried
Albanians to Italy. Others hiked overland to Greece.
	   For Zhusti, there was nothing left in Tirana. Stripped of state
funding, the film industry crashed and theaters were boarded up.
Half the National Orchestra left the country in a matter of weeks.
	   Zhusti, his wife and their two children headed for Greece in
1991.
	   They left behind very little: a three-room apartment with a
small balcony and Zhusti's monthly income worth about dlrs 115.
	   But the psychological jump was huge. Isolated for decades, many
Albanians didn't know the simplest things about life beyond their
borders, such as how to work a pay phone. Bricklayers and
carpenters would manage, but what skills could artists, professors,
writers and other members of the old intelligentsia offer?
	   Zhusti found work in a gas station in Athens, then as a clerk in
some small shops. His wife began teaching. But money was still
tight. He grew disillusioned and began to think of returning.
	   But to what? Albania was descending into chaos. Hungry for a
taste of quick prosperity, Albanians had bought into pyramid scams
that promised super-high returns. When the pyramids inevitably
collapsed, Albanians got their refunds by looting the country.
	   It was a feeding frenzy. Stores were emptied. Rocket launchers
and machine guns were seized from police stations and armories. A
kid with a pistol and some debris for a roadblock could be king of
all he surveyed _ until a bigger kid came along with a bigger gun.
	   Workers at the National Theater took home props and lights in
case the place was looted.
	   The nation needed a villain and chose President Sali Berisha,
accusing him of letting the pyramid scams function with impunity.
	   In Gjirokastra, near the theater where Zhusti began his career,
a gang of men mercilessly beat a member of Berisha's party on a
cool March afternoon last year. The man bled to death. In December,
the Hoxha museum in the town was blown up by unknown bombers.
	   Last June a new government was elected. The United Nations wants
to conduct a weapons buyback but can't raise the funds to pay for
the looted hardware. The ousted Berisha is back in his stronghold
in northeast Albania, capitalizing on the nationalist passions
unleashed by fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Thus, as if it doesn't have enough troubles, Albania now risks
ultimately being sucked into the Yugoslav conflict.

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Matt Stairs hit a two-run homer and
Kenny Rogers got his 11th win as the Oakland Athletics defeated the
Boston Red Sox 6-5 Thursday to snap a nine-game losing streak.
	   Stairs hit his 16th homer of the season in the seventh. Kevin
Mitchell and Jason Giambi had two-run singles as the A's, who had
tied their longest longest streak since 1978, scored four in the
third inning.
	   Rogers (11-4) allowed five runs on eight hits in 7 2-3 innings.
Three of those runs came in the eighth inning and were unearned.
	   Billy Taylor got two outs for his 22nd save as Oakland stopped
Boston's four-game winning streak.
	   Steve Avery (7-4) lasted just 2 2-3 innings for Boston.
 &UR; Orioles 6, Tigers 4
	   In Detroit, Eric Davis hit two homers, including a tiebreaking

finished a three-game sweep by beating the Tigers.
	   Jeffrey Hammonds hit a two-run double for the Orioles, who won
for the 17th time in 20 games since the All-Star break. Davis'
third multi-homer game of the season extended his hitting streak to
a career best-matching 17 games.
	   Davis hit a solo homer in the first off Justin Thompson, and his
home run off hard-throwing rookie Matt Anderson (2-1) snapped a 4-4
tie in the seventh.
	   Pete Smith (1-3) relieved starter Jimmy Key and pitched three
innings, allowing one run and two hits. Armando Benitez pitched the
ninth for his 15th save.
 &UR; Royals 7, Twins 3
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Terry Pendleton and Jeff King each had
three hits, leading Tim Belcher and the Kansas City Royals over the
Minnesota Twins.
	   The start of the game was delayed by rain for 1 hour, 54
minutes.
	   Dean Palmer homered and hit an RBI single, King scored three
runs and Pendleton and Johnny Damon both drove in two. Jose
Offerman extended his career-best hitting streak to 19 games,
getting a double and single.
	   Belcher (10-9) allowed four hits in 6 2-3 innings. Dan Serafini
(4-4) took the loss.

TIRANA: Yugoslav conflict.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Some Albanians think the only route to stability lies in
restoring its monarchy, in exile since 1939. The claimant to the
throne, King Leka, a businessman in South Africa, returned briefly
last year. He fled after the state took legal action over a wild
shootout at a pro-royalty rally that left one person dead.
	   Meanwhile, Albanian immigrants have become scapegoats for
Greece's crime and social ills. Graffiti near Zhusti's apartment in
Athens says: ``Save Greece. Albanians Out.''
	   Last summer, the National Theater director received a letter
from Zhusti. ``I want to come back,'' he wrote. ``There's nothing
for me here.'' ``We had such hopes the first couple of years after
Albania opened up,'' said Mihallaq Sevo, a former history
professor. ``Now, we know it was silly to be so happy. Good things
don't just happen because you have freedom. Victor Zhusti is just
one example: a good man with good dreams that didn't work out. It's
sad.''
	    &UR; ___
	   ACT III: Desperation.
	    &UR; ___
	   Last year Zhusti translated a Greek play into Albanian. He hoped
to return to Albania and stage it at the National Theater. It's
about patients in a psychiatric ward who discover they are sane and
the outside world is crazy.
	   It seemed like a rich metaphor for Albania's predicament. But
when Zhusti eventually returned to Albania, Greek authorities
allege, it was not to stage the play but to play middleman in a
drug deal.
	   The network of drugs and weapons moving from Albania to Greece
is vast. Caravans of mules laden with hashish and automatic rifles
cross the border. At sea, the Greek coast guard wages firefights
with speedboat crews trying to smuggle in drugs and guns.
	   After speaking to traffickers about a drug shipment for a
Greek-American buyer, police allege, Zhusti headed back to Greece.
A rendezvous was arranged on an Athens boulevard.
	   ``I didn't know who I was going to meet, but he would recognize
me for sure because I'm a famous actor in Albania,'' he told
police.
	   According to Zhusti's account to police, the sale price was dlrs
20,000 for 24 pounds of heroin. The buyers showed up with a sack of
money, but not the dealers and the heroin. When Zhusti called
Albania to find out what had happened, he was told the deal was
off.
	   That night, Jan. 5, he was arrested.
	   ``He got caught up in something that just grew out of control,''
says his lawyer, Dimitra Baka. ``He's a good man. An actor. An
artist. He's not a drug smuggler. He made some bad choices.''
	   Zhusti is in jail on the Greek island of Crete. No trial date
has been set. Zhusti's wife returned to Tirana for a while. She has
stopped calling the lawyer for updates.
	   ``I'm not trying to justify what Zhusti allegedly did,'' said
Lani of the Media Institute. ``But I think I can explain it. We are
a corrupted society now and sometimes we don't use honest ways.
There is a very wild capitalism now and people think they should be
rich very quickly ... This makes them do crazy things sometimes.''

	   In July, the Albafilm Studio where Zhusti made his movies burned
down. Faulty wiring is suspected. The next day the government
ordered the National Theater to close after an international team
of inspectors said it was in danger of collapsing.
	   Inside a glass kiosk, near the incongruous whimsy of a little
amusement park in the center of gritty Tirana, the proprietor
looked through her stacks of videos. Sunlight through dirty panes
gave the place a coffee-shaded tint.
	   ``They must be here,'' whispered Rita Djirja.
	   She found them near the bottom of a pile of Rambo movies and
Italian erotica.
	   ``I knew we had some Zhusti movies. We don't get too many people
asking for them now,'' she said. ``People don't want to revisit the
old times. Not yet, at least. There's no nostalgia yet.''

Swiss visit a relief for Tour de France

	   NEUCHATEL, Switerland (AP) _ With so much police attention
happening, it seemed almost a relief that the Tour de France left
home and visited Switzerland.
	   Tom Steels and Erik Zabel provided a near-normal backdrop for
the Tour with a sprint finish and Marco Pantani stayed in the
leader's yellow jersey after the 18th stage.
	   Yet behind the surroundings, the riders couldn't escape news of
the widening doping scandal, which continued to claim new victims.
	   And 20 minutes after the start of Friday's 19th stage, the
riders are back in France to continue on a 242-kilometer (150-mile)
leg to end up in Autun.
	   Just three more days until the end of the Tour.
	   But six teams are gone and the numbers of riders left are under
100 now.
	   Two more teams pulled out Thursday to protest police behavior,
and investigators for the first time prevented a cyclist from
competing after finding drugs in his possession.
	   Rodolfo Massi of Italy and the Casino team was still in police
custody for questioning afterd drugs were found in his room during
a search earlier in the week according to prosecutors in the
northern city of Lille, where the probe is centered.
	   After the chaotic Wednesday, when the race was stopped twice and
rides coasted the rest of the way to force an annullment of the
stage, Thursday's leg from Aix-les-Bains to Neuchatel, Switzerland,
seemed almost normal.
	   The pack whittled down an early lead by a quartet of riders that
included two former yellow jersey wearers, Stephen Heulot and
Laurent Desbiens, both of France.
	   Steels edged Zabel in a sprint finish to post his third stage
victory of the Tour. Stuart O'Grady of Australia was third.
	   Ironically Steels' three victories came in the three different
countries the Tour visited already - Ireland, France and now
Switzerland.
	   Steels' victory the day after the disarray Wednesday also
brought to mind his other victory last Friday when the riders first
protested with a two-hour delay at the start of the stage.
	   All this is wearing on the riders.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   ``We were all afraid to give up after 20 days of racing,'' said
Pantani. ``I've made sacrifices to get the yellow jersey.''
	   Pantani has a lead of 5 minutes 42 seconds over American Bobby
Julich with defending champion Jan Ullrich another 14 seconds back.
	   After Friday's stage, there is the final time trial on Saturday
Le Creusot. In the last time trial of the Tour, Ullrich beat
Pantani by 4:21.
	   Before Thursday's start, two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio,
angrily quit the field, joining two other Spanish teams and an
Italian team, who quit Wednesday. A sixth team, Festina, was thrown
out on July 17 after police found dopants in a team masseur's car _
sparking the current scandal.
	   There was uncertainty as to whether the race would go on at all.
Many riders, angered at the growing investigation, had threatened
to pull out entirely.
	   Some, like former world road champion, Luc Leblanc did on an
individual basis.
	   ``Everybody needs to make their own decision. Those who decided
not to continue today were right, but those who are leaving the
race are also right,'' Leblanc said.

Japan's jobless rate hits record high 4.3 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate surged to a record high
of 4.3 percent in June, the government announced Friday.
	   The jump followed two consecutive months at the previous high of
4.1 percent, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   The June figure is the highest recorded since the government
began its current system of compiling unemployment data in 1953.
	   The bad news comes as Japan, struggling with its worst recession
since World War II, is under increasing pressure from allies to
repair its troubled financial system.
	   The jobless rate for women also rose to an all-time high of 4.2
percent in June, the agency said. The rate for men remained
unchanged at a record 4.3 percent.

Stanley returns to Boston for two minor leaguers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Mike Stanley was traded into the pennant race for
the second straight year, going from Toronto to the Boston Red Sox
on Thursday for two minor leaguers.
	   Less than a year after Boston traded Stanley to the Yankees to
shore up their pennant drive, Stanley returns to the Red Sox as
they attempt to hold onto the AL wild-card spot.
	   Stanley batted .240 with 22 homers and 47 RBIs this year for
Toronto, which signed him as a free agent in the offseason.
	   Boston sent minor league pitchers Peter Munro and Jay Yennaco to
the Blue Jays, who entered the day 10 1/2 games back in the
wild-card race and may be signaling a surrender. If so, bigger
trades _ perhaps including AL Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens _
could follow.
	   After signing with the Red Sox as a free agent before the 1996
season, Stanley hit .270 with 24 homers. He batted .297 with 16
homers last year, when he was traded on Aug. 13 to the Yankees for
Jim Mecir and prospect Tony Armas Jr.
	   The 35-year-old Stanley fills a need at right-handed designated
hitter and emergency catcher that Boston has had since trading
disgruntled Jim Leyritz to San Diego earlier this summer.
	   Munro, 23, is 5-4 with a 4.05 ERA in 17 starts with Triple-A
Pawtucket this year. Yennaco, 22, is 3-2 with a 5.83 ERA in 11
starts at Pawtucket, having compiled a 3-3 record and 4.86 ERA in
Double-A Trenton earlier this summer.

No Dream, No Team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; first games Friday start at 1215 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Maybe the Dream Team wasn't such a bad
idea.
	   That's what USA Basketball must be thinking. And Donn Nelson,
the Dallas Mavericks assistant who has worked with the Lithuanian
national team for six years, agrees.
	   ``All the international guys I've talked with are kind of
disappointed they are not able to go against the best from the
U.S.,'' Nelson said after Lithuania held on for an 84-82 win over
the mix-and-match crew of castoffs and collegians the United States
sent in place of NBA stars to the World Basketball Championship.
	   The effort was there from the U.S. players. The talent wasn't.
	   Where a Kevin Garnett might have gone strong to the basket, Bill
Edwards, who plays in Italy, had back-to-back jump shots blocked by
Lithuanian center Eurelijus Zukauskas in the first half. Where a
Grant Hill or a Vin Baker might have carried the U.S. offense, too
many players missed too many shots in a key second-half scoreless
stretch of nearly 5 minutes.
	   ``They were a little better than we were,'' coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``I'll go a bit farther: They were better for
most of the game than we were.''
	   The United States (1-1) was still in position to advance to the
second preliminary stage by beating South Korea Friday. The day's
other pivotal games included Russia against Puerto Rico and Canada
against Italy.
	   The 12 players chosen for the latest version of the Dream Team
threatened to boycott the tournament because of the NBA labor
dispute _ and USA Basketball dumped them.
	   While Tomjanovich has steadfastly refused to comment on the
issue, Nelson didn't pull any punches when discussing whether the
Dream Teamers should be in Athens.
	   ``In my opinion, there's nothing more important than your
country,'' he said, ``and there's nothing more important than if
your country asks your service in war or stepping up to the plate.
There's no higher calling. They should be here.''
	   Without them, the United States _ a perennial power in the sport
_ saw its 26-game winning streak in major international events end.
That run dates to the 1990 worlds, when Yugoslavia beat a group of
American college players en route to the title.
	   Yugoslavia looks likely to contend for the gold again.
	   The reigning European champions needed overtime, but got past
Russia 82-74 Thursday to improve to 2-0. Greece, boosted by a
near-sellout crowd at 18,000-seat Olympic arena, also stayed
unbeaten with a 64-56 victory over Italy.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Although India has rejected a
Pakistani proposal for conducting negotiations over the restive
Kashmir region, the two sides may meet again during a seven-nation
conference in Sri Lanka.
	   An Indian official said representatives from the rival countries
may hold a third day of talks Friday before leaving Sri lanka at
the end of the seventh South Asian summit.
	   Relations between the longtime adversaries have been frozen
since May, when India conducted five underground nuclear tests and
Pakistan responded with six of its own.
	   The testing raised fears of a nuclear war over Kashmir, one of
the world's most volatile regions and a major irritant between
Muslim Pakistan and mostly Hindu India. India controls two-thirds
of the predominantly Muslim region; Pakistan controls the rest.
	   On Wednesday, Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Atal
Bihari Vajpayee of India agreed during a meeting in Colombia to
resume official-level talks in hopes of easing tensions.
	   After the meeting, Sharif said that Kashmir, a majority Muslim
area, is the ``core issue'' dividing the two countries. ``The
sooner it is resolved, the better it is for the two countries,''
Sharif said.
	   Sharif had called on India to drop its opposition to outside
mediation. But on Thursday, India formally rejected the proposal.
	   ``India is in favor of direct and sincere dialogue and we
believe we can work out an acceptable position,'' said the Indian
official, who could not be identified under briefing regulations.
	   India expressed its position to Pakistan during a meeting of
foreign ministry officials Thursday of the two countries at a
seaside resort. The official said the talks were inconclusive.
	   Talks between foreign ministry officials became stalled last
September over the priority they should give to Kashmir while
dealing with other problems. India wanted to move quickly on easier
issues, but Pakistan insisted on parallel movement on Kashmir.

UNC's Ndiaye angry at lack of playing time

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It's not easy to impress scouts when
you're riding the pine. That's Makhtar Ndiaye's dilemma at the
World Basketball Championship.
	   The 2.00-meter (6-foot-7) forward, who played the last two
seasons at North Carolina and now is looking for a pro contract,
has been used sparingly so far by Senegalese coach Bassirou Badji.
	   And the big guy is not pleased.
	   ``We have a coach who is strong-headed and he believes in using
the players who are always in the country,'' Ndiaye said Thursday
night after Senegal lost 70-57 to Canada to drop to 0-2. ``He
doesn't feel it's right to mix in guys who play in other places.''
	   Ndiaye has totaled 6 points and 2 rebounds in two games here,
averaging less than 8 minutes per night.
	   ``We have the talent, we just need a good head on the bench,''
he said. ``I hate to point fingers, but we got out-coached.''
	   Ndiaye said he has an agent looking for offers from professional
teams. About 20 NBA teams are scouring this tournament, which ends
Aug. 9, for fresh talent.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOME SWEET HOME: &LR;  Lithuania's Arturas Karnisovas played like he
felt at home in the Peace and Friendship arena.
	   That's because it is his home court.
	   The 2.03-meter (6-foot-8) forward, who poured in 29 points _ 20
in the second half _ to lead Lithuania past the United States 84-82
Thursday, plays professionally for Olympiakos Piraeus in the Greek
League.
	   He's teammates there with Team USA's starting point guard
Michael Hawkins.
	   ``When the bus first pulled up I felt like I was coming to play
for Olympiakos,'' said Karnisovas, who played college basketball at
Seton Hall.
	   ``When I came out and saw Michael I wished him well, but on the
court I wanted to win as badly as he did.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LESS FILLING: &LR;  Arvydas Sabonis might not play internationally
any more, but the Portland Trail Blazers center was smiling down on
Lithuania's win over the United States.
	   Or was he?
	   One of the Baltic state's many loud supporters in the stands
brought a life-size cardboard cutout of the 2.24-meter (7-foot-3)
Sabonis. The fan, Vytautas Baltusis, said it was an advertising
sign for a Lithuanian non-alcoholic beer.
	   ``I brought this to scare the Americans,'' Baltusis said, ``but
it would have been better to have Sabonis play.''

Doctors, home care workers off the job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ British Columbia's health care system was under
siege on two fronts Thursday as both doctors and community health
workers were off the job.
	   Almost 1,000 health workers were on a short-lived strike over
stalled contract negotiations.
	   A full-blown strike today by all 14,000 union members was
averted by a new contract offer by the Health Employers'
Association, but union members are ready for picketing next week.
	   ``There could be a settlement, but we're continuing with our
strike preparation for next week because it's still up in the
air,'' said union spokeswoman Carol Adams.
	   Labor Relations Board mediator Brian Foley asked the union to
postpone rotating strikes for 48 hours, and will meet with the two
parties Friday. Contract negotiations broke down last Friday over
seniority and benefit issues.
	   The strike affected several health units in Greater Vancouver
and on Vancouver Island.
	   Adding to the province's health care woes was another round of
so-called reduced activity days by physicians.
	   Most doctors closed their clinics for the first of five days
Thursday at the urging of the British Columbia Medical Association.
	   ``It's not our choice,'' said Dr. Jim Lane, head of the
association. ``It's the government's choice to force this on
doctors and patients.''
	   Closing clinics will help make up for an $88-million shortfall
in the medicare budget _ a shortfall that would otherwise come out
of doctors' pockets, Lane said. Doctors continue to work emergency
shifts.  &QC; ___
 &UR; U.S. and Canada to monitor toxic air around Great Lakes
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canada and the United States have agreed to join
forces in a fight against toxic substances in the air around the
Great Lakes.
	   Environment Canada and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
announced Thursday they will be monitoring contaminants using the
Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network.
	   The international network assesses the magnitude of chemicals
including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides,
and trace metals such as lead and mercury.
	   Stations on remote shores of each lake collect contaminant data
representative of the air over each lake.
	   Concentrations of target chemicals are measured in rain and
snow, airborne particles, and airborne organic vapors.
	   ``We recognize that global action will be required to ultimately
remove these chemicals from the environment, but the network is our
insurance to confirm the effectiveness of pollution reduction,''
John Mills, Environment Canada's Ontario regional director, said in
a news release.
	   The agencies signed a seven-year commitment to the co-operative
effort which will help assess progress in reducing levels of toxic
pollutants in the shared Great Lakes ecosystem.

	    &UR; Two people killed in shooting incidents &LR; 
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Two biker gang members died after being shot in
separate incidents on Thursday that suggested a possible rekindling
of the smouldering biker war.
	   Provincial police said the deaths were the first Montreal-area
biker slayings in some time.
	   The area has been littered with corpses and bomb debris in five
years of battling between the Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine
over the city's lucrative drug trade.
	   Police were cautious about tying the killings to any resurgence
in the biker war.
	   ``I don't know,'' said Cpl. Richard Bourdon of Quebec provincial
police. ``We had the investigators from the provincial police and
from the Wolverine (anti-biker task force) on the scene to analyse
all the information that we have.''
	   In Thursday's first shooting, Richard Lagace, 32, of the Rock
Machine, was hit by a hail of bullets as he left a health club in
St-Lin, northeast of Montreal.
	   ``Someone heard some shooting and saw two suspects running
behind the arena,'' said Bourdon. ``They stole a car and after that
we found the car in the cemetery of Ste-Sophie.''
	   There was more gunfire about 45 minutes later in Repentigny on
the eastern tip of Montreal Island.
	   ``The Repentigny police got a call for a shooting and when they
arrived they saw a man on the ground,'' Bourdon said.
	   Yvon Roy, 57, a member of the Alliance, a group affiliated with
the Rock Machine, was shot down outside his house on a residential
street. Roy died in hospital.
	   Bourdon said, ``A witness saw two suspects leave the place.''

 &UR; Atlantic Canada loses another fish
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ Atlantic Canada has lost another fish and, until
Thursday, authorities didn't even know it.
	   Two scientists at Dalhousie University have discovered that one
of the largest flatfish in the Northwest Atlantic, the barndoor
skate, has gone the way of the northern cod and all but
disappeared.
	   ``Long-term research surveys on the continental shelf between
the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and southern New England reveal
that ... the barndoor skate _ Raja (aevis) _ is close to
extinction,'' says an article published Thursday in the esteemed
journal Science.
	   The metre-wide fish was probably one of the first casualties of
efficient harvesting methods introduced by large-capacity,
transatlantic fleets in the 1950s.
	   Ransom Myers, who occupies Dalhousie's Killam chair of ocean
studies, and Memorial University graduate student Jill Casey made
the discovery after theorizing the probabilities and assessing the
data.
	   The fish, a member of the shark family found only between
Newfoundland and Cape Hatteras, has little value and was primarily
taken as a secondary or bycatch on trawls for more lucrative
species such as cod and redfish.  &QC; ___
	   Resource prices on the rebound: TD study
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Since last fall, Canadian economists have been
using an odd, little phrase to describe their gloomy outlook for
the country's natural resource industries.
	   ``If it's in the ground, it's going down.''
	   Though stock prices have been hammered by reports of slack
demand from Asia, a TD bank study released Thursday shows prices
for oil, lumber, gold, base metals and natural gas have in fact
enjoyed a recent upswing.
	   ``There are some that are going up and some that are going
down,'' said Teresa Courchene, TD's director of economic research.
	   ``So we're not looking at an across-the-board decline in July...
That's important because for a while every single bit of news was
bad for commodities.''
	   The numbers are crucial to Canada's economic well-being because
the country is highly dependent on international trade, with
commodities making up more than 40 per cent of Canadian exports.
	   The most encouraging news is from the oil patch, where
production cuts by major crude oil producers raised prices for West
Texas intermediate crude to just over $14 US per barrel in July.
	   ``There was a lot of concern earlier in the year when prices
went close to $13 US,'' said Courchene. ``Prices back above $14 is
a little reassuring, especially for producers in the West.''
 &UR; In short
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ One of the RCMP's key drug officers in British
Columbia is attacking the idea of providing free heroin to some
addicts to treat their cravings. Insp. Richard Barszczewski made
his views clear Thursday in a wide-ranging assessment of a common
front on B.C's injection drug problem raised by the province's top
coroner, Vancouver's police chief and other health officials. They
backed a report by provincial health officer Dr. John Millar
calling for $6 million in new provincial funding to help British
Columbia's estimated 15,000 drug addicts, many now using heroin and
cocaine. Millar's proposals include controlled heroin distribution
to help stabilize addicts along with better treatment programs.

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Better safe than sorry, says Mihaela. The
26-year-old Romanian has resigned herself to a full summer plying
the southern Ontario strip club circuit rather than risk a vacation
home to the parents and younger brother and sister she helps
support back in Bucharest. ``Many girls were planning to go on
vacation in the summer,'' she said this week. ``But rumors started
going around that there are problems (overseas) and you cannot get
back.'' Earlier this month, Citizenship and Immigration Canada
closed a loophole that allowed virtually any exotic dancer with a
Canadian job offer to show up at the border and receive a temporary
working visa.  &QC; ___

Monastery and raise awareness of plight of Nova Scotia forests.

Colombia inaugurates civilian peace assembly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ More than 1,000 attorneys, businessmen,
workers, students, academics, clergy, indigenous leaders and
politicians attended a peace assembly Thursday designed to involve
civilians in efforts to end Colombia's 34-year civil war.
	   ``Until now we have been spectators of the war between the army
and armed groups,'' said Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, a former foreign
minister who helped organize the event. ``Today, we are all
committed to becoming constructors of peace.''
	   The assembly's chairman, Archbishop Alberto Giraldo, said more
than 60 peace proposals will be reviewed during the two-day
conference dubbed the Permanent Assembly for Peace.
	   ``This is the point of departure on the long road to peace
because it isn't only about looking for a solution to the armed
conflict, but to create a culture of peace in the country,''
Giraldo said.
	   Hopes for peace intensified earlier this month when
President-elect Andres Pastrana met with the leader of Colombia's
largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia. Another rebel group, the National Liberation Army, held
peace discussions with Colombian civic leaders in Germany this
month.
	   The conflict between leftist-guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary
squads and the armed forces has escalated under President Ernesto
Samper, who leaves office Aug. 7. Thousands of civilians caught in
the crossfire die every year.
	   On Thursday, rebels of the National Liberation Army attacked a
gold mine in northwestern Colombia with explosives, killing five
people and injuring three before stealing 25 pounds (11 kilos) of
gold, the army reported.

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Former champion Nick Price, Paul
Azinger and Russ Cochran shot 65s Thursday to share the first-round
lead in the St. Jude Classic.
	   Scott Hoch and 19-year-old amateur David Gossett were in a group
of four players a shot off the lead with 66s on the par-71 TPC at
Southwind course. The others a shot back are Mark Carnevale and
Donnie Hammond.
	   Seven players were at 4-under, including Dudley Hart, who led in
the clubhouse on Sunday here last year before Greg Norman overtook
him with birdies on the last three holes to win it. Norman is off
the tour now because of an injury.
	   The day was dry, breezy and steamy as the waterlogged course
dried. The players were allowed to lift, clean and place balls in
the fairways. Nearly a third of the 156-player field broke par.
	   ``Apart from the first hole I hit the ball really well,'' said
Price, the 1993 winner, who hooked his first shot of the day into a
lake and bogeyed No. 1. He recovered to post five birdies and an
eagle the rest of the way.
	   Price and Azinger eagled the 16th hole, a 528-yard (480-meter)
par-5. Price hit a 3-wood 265 yards (241 meters) to within three
feet for his; Azinger reached in two and sank a 40-foot (12-meter)
putt.
	   ``It was just a real solid day tee to green,'' said Azinger, who
has not won on the PGA Tour since a bout with cancer five years
ago, but said he feels his game returning.
	   ``It would be hard to shoot 65 unless I was pretty healthy,'' he
said.
	   Price and Azinger are somewhat rejuvenated this season, Azinger
from his health problems and Price from a slump that started after
his big year in 1994, when he won six tournaments.
	   ``I don't know why it is starting to turn around,'' said
Azinger, 65th on the money list in 16 starts, with seven top-25
finishes. The most top 25s he's had since his illness was eight in
'96.
	   ``Everything is just getting better. I think the big difference
has been in my chipping and putting. My putting was lousy for
probably the last three years.''
	   Price tied for fifth here last year and said he just picked up
where he left off.
	   ``I like this course,'' he said. ``You've got to drive the ball
well, especially with the rough up like it is this year. That's one
of the things I have always felt I have done well on this course.''
	   Cochran, a tour veteran who got his only victory in 1991,
finished on the front nine. He made the turn at 2-under, then
birdied four of six holes in one stretch to catch the leaders.

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Wave Gary Hall in front of Aleksandr
Popov, and the world's fastest swimmer in the '90s never holds
back.
	   ``I was watching the news last night, and they said the U.S.
team is weak because it doesn't have Gary Hall,'' Popov said at the
Goodwill Games on Thursday. ``Well, I saw Gary Hall at Perth (at
the World Championships in January), and he wasn't that good.''
	   Popov's comments about Hall, suspended from swimming
indefinitely for using marijuana, came as the U.S. men's team was
reeling from a close dual-meet defeat to Germany on Wednesday.
	   ``It doesn't bother me that Gary is not here,'' Popov said. ``He
should be disappointed that he is not here.''
	   Popov's Russian team lost to the World All-Stars despite his
victory at 50 meters and as the anchor man on two winning relay
teams. He did not swim the 100 because individuals are limited to
three events per night.
	   Popov swam the 50 in 22.37 seconds to win Wednesday against the
World team, and American Bill Pilczuk was timed in 22.63 seconds to
finish first against Germany.
	   Popov shrugged off his World Championships loss in the 50 to
Pilczuk that broke Popov's seven-year winning streak in that event.
	   ``The 100 is my favorite, and he didn't beat my winning streak
there,'' Popov said. ``In the 50, you can't make any mistakes, or
you lose.''
	   Popov won both the 50 and 100 at the last two Olympics, and he
holds the world record in the 100.
	   Pilczuk said earlier this week that he regards the Olympics and
World Championships as the only important swimming events, and saw
the Goodwill Games as a fun interlude.
	   ``I think Bill will find out that the Olympics are much more
serious than the World Championships,'' Popov said. But he agreed
with Pilczuk that the Goodwill Games are more for fun.
	   ``There's no pressure here that you've got to win,'' Popov said.
``People just thank you for coming.''
	   But Popov said he will definitely swim the 50 against Pilczuk on
Sunday, when the United States meets the Russians.
	   ``We'll step on the blocks and do it,'' he said.
	   Popov said the media created a rivalry between him and Hall at
the 1996 Olympics that didn't really exist.
	   ``It made me mad and kind of sick of it,'' Popov said. ``I
wanted to make the opposite of what you guys think.''

Sprewell's challenge to suspension dismissed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB EGELKO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Latrell Sprewell's dlrs 30 million lawsuit
against the NBA challenging his 68-game suspension for choking his
coach was dismissed by a federal judge.
	   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker suggested Thursday that the
former All-Star guard didn't prove his allegations that the
suspension was racially discriminatory and violated his right to
make a living.
	   The judge did, however, leave room for the suit to be revived,
giving Sprewell's attorneys 30 days to tie their claims more
closely to the facts of the case.
	   But Walker said they should seriously consider dropping the
matter.
	   Frank Rothman, a lawyer for the National Basketball Association,
asked Walker to dismiss the suit permanently and impose a financial
penalty on Sprewell's lawyers for a ``scurrilous'' claim of racial
discrimination, which had not been made while the case was in
arbitration.
	   ``We have had enough of Mr. Sprewell,'' Rothman told the judge.
``I think he came away from this arbitration very, very fortunate
because of the compassion of the arbitrator, more compassion than I
would have given him.''
	   Robert Thompson, a lawyer for Sprewell, said afterward he
thought the suit could be narrowed and revived, but that no
decision had been made.
	   ``It depends on how we evaluate it,'' Sprewell, who attended the
hearing, said when asked if he would continue the case.
	   The NBA initially suspended Sprewell for a year and allowed the
Golden State Warriors to terminate the last three years and dlrs 24
million of his contract after he choked coach P.J. Carlesimo at a
practice last December.
	   But after a lengthy hearing, arbitrator John Feerick ruled in
March the punishment was excessive, and ordered Sprewell reinstated
July 1, cutting his suspension to 68 games.
	   Sprewell's suit against the NBA and the Warriors claimed that
the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by allowing the league
and the team to impose separate punishments.
	   The suit also contended he was punished more harshly than white
players who had attacked coaches, that the NBA and the Warriors had
conspired to cut off his endorsement contracts, and that a ban on
attending games during his suspension violated his civil rights.
	   Rothman, the NBA's lawyer, said he thought Sprewell should have
been suspended for life.
	   ``He choked his head coach, he threatened to kill him, left
bruises and scars,'' and returned after 20 minutes for a second
attack, Rothman said.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks gain moderately in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Friday
amid speculation Japan won't soon intervene in currency markets to
support the yen. Tokyo stock prices continued to gain moderately.
	   The dollar bought 143.56 yen in early trading, up 1.26 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 143.66
yen overnight.
	   The dollar's strength came after Japan's newly appointed Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa dimmed intervention fears.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister, told a news conference early
Friday that the yen and stock markets should move ``on their own''
and intervention in foreign exchange markets should occur only
rarely.
	   Traders interpreted Miyazawa's remarks as diminishing the
likelihood that Japan's central bank will try to prop up the yen,
even if it falls further.
	   U.S. and Japanese monetary authorities sold dollars and bought
yen in a dramatic intervention June 17 to prop up the faltering
Japanese currency.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices advanced on
expectations new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration will
carry out permanent tax cuts and implement measures to write off
massive bad debts held by Japan's banks.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 133.37 points or 0.83
percent, to 16,334.97 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Thursday, the average closed up 43.51 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 8.10 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,256.29. The TOPIX
closed up 7.49 points, or 0.60 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.210 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.225 percent, driving its price up to 111.74 yen from 111.63 yen.

Dubai prison to provide inmates five-star treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK AL-ISSAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ No wonder prison officials
call them ``guests.'' The white-collar criminals in Dubai's new
prison will have everything they need to conduct business behind
bars _ including a hotel-style conference center complete with
access to the Internet.
	   There is one hitch though _ their activities must be legitimate.
	   ``Instead of destroying them, we will help them get back on
their feet. This in turn will help their families and subsequently,
the economy,'' said Brig. Abbas Ali, chief of prisons for this
affluent emirate on the Arabian peninsula.
	   Construction begins in September on the multimillion-dollar
facility for 2,000 ``guests'' _ Ali refused to call them inmates or
prisoners. Replacing Dubai's main prison, the new jail also will
provide room for 500 inmates convicted of violent crime.
	   Unlike many prisons in the Middle East, this one will have
central air conditioning, a gym and a theater. And because many of
the convicts have legitimate businesses, a state-of-the-art
business center is planned ``with everything you might see in an
international company,'' Ali said. Along with fax machines,
computers and telephones, prisoners will have access to the
Internet.
	   ``Everyone has certain rights. If you make one mistake, it
doesn't mean you should be humiliated throughout your life,'' Ali
said.
	   But while planners say the prison will operate on Islamic
principles of respect for human rights regardless of a person's
background, only those convicted of white-collar crimes and jailed
for more than one year will be get the luxury treatment.
	   Inmates serving time for violent crimes and stealing will remain
in ordinary conditions in a separate section.
	   Dubai can afford to be generous with its criminals. There aren't
that many.
	   Strict laws keep down violent crime, leaving authorities to deal
mostly with offenses such as fraud, embezzlement and debt default.
	   Most criminals are foreigners _ Indians, Pakistanis, other Arabs
and citizens of former Soviet republics, reflecting the population
mix of Dubai, whose 100,000 natives depend on more than 600,000
expatriate workers to run the economy.
	   The new facility, a brainchild of crown prince Sheik Mohammed
bin Rashid al-Maktoum, will be adjacent to the existing prison,
which will be converted into a library, an auditorium and
workshops.
	   In a region known for its harsh treatment of convicts, even the
old prison is no dive. Up to six inmates share a cell about 10 feet
by 13 feet (3 meters by 4 meters), sleeping on comfortable
mattresses and eating meals of rice, meat, chicken, soup and
vegetables.
	   Inmates are free to practice their religions and not forced to
abide by Islamic regulations such as fasting during the holy month
of Ramadan.
	   Some prisoners interviewed said their only complaint was the
ear-numbing noise of window air conditioners in their cells.
	   That will not be a problem in the new prison, which will have
central air when it opens in 2000.
	   ``I think the new prison will be excellent. It will help the
prisoners to try and solve their problems,'' Hussein, a Pakistani
convict, said in an interview at the prison.
	   Hussein, 28, will complete a three-year term for fraud next
year. He spoke on condition his second name would not be published.
	   Asked if such good treatment would not encourage crime, Ali
shook his head vehemently.
	   ``Nothing compares to freedom. Never underestimate freedom.''

Number of worldwide refugees drops by 6 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA ABU-NASR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The number of refugees and asylum seekers
worldwide dropped by about 6 percent in 1997, aided by a reduction
in the fighting in some regions and the repatriation of refugees,
according to a survey.
	   Sudan led the world in the number of internally displaced
people, said the survey which was released on Thursday.
	   Among the reasons for the drop in refugees _ from 14.5 million
people in 1996 to 13.6 million in 1997 _ were the decrease in
conflict and the repatriation of a large number of refugees to
places like Rwanda and Bosnia, said Bill Frelick, senior policy
analyst at the U.S. Committee for Refugees.
	   In addition to the refugees, the private group's annual World
Refugee Survey documented 17 million internally displaced last
year. This refers to civilians who have been forced by persecution
or armed conflict to flee their homes, but remain within their own
country.
	   Famine-stricken Sudan, which has been plagued by a 15-year civil
war in which southern rebels have been seeking autonomy for
Christians and animists from the Muslim north, has more than four
million internally displaced people, topping a list of 37 countries
with large numbers of internally displaced civilians.
	   ``Sudan is a case study in the dangers that can come from having
a high number of internally displaced persons,'' said Roger Winter,
executive director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees. ``The
current famine conditions in Sudan are directly related to the
displacement of ... civilians.''
	   Frelick noted that despite the decline of the refugee
population, the condition of many longstanding refugee groups _
Palestinians, Afghans and Bosnians _ has not changed.
	   He also said that new flows of refugees were reported last year.
For instance, 70,000 Cambodians and 20,000 Burmese have fled to
Thailand, 50,000 have gone from Afghanistan to Pakistan and 750,000
Congolese have been uprooted by the civil war.
	   Frelick said that in the past two weeks, there has been an
increase of up to 100,000 new refugees fleeing Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanian rebels are fighting for independence from Serbia. Most of
the refugees have remained in the embattled province and have not
been able to flee to neighboring Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro.
	   ``It's quite scary to see what looks like a repetition of what
we saw in ... Bosnia,'' said Frelick, referring to the situation in
Kosovo. ``We certainly hope that the international community will
respond very quickly to this and address ... and prevent what could
be an enormous bloodbath.''
	   Frelick said international boundaries should be reconsidered in
the cases of Sudan and Kosovo, where the central government belongs
to a different ethnic and religious background from the rebels.
	   ``Where there's a complete incompatibility between the central
government and a sub-group ... these borders that in both cases
were created during an imperialist era don't make any sense
today,'' said Frelick. ``We now have to take a fresh look at
borders and we really have to determine ultimately do we want
people to be moving or do we want to move some borders around.''
	   The survey also found that the United States led the list of 20
donor countries to international refugee relief agencies in 1997,
with dlrs 352.9 million. But it ranked tenth on a per capita basis,
with dlrs 1.32, compared to leading Norway's dlrs 12.46.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Dead dogs have been found in a canal
running into the water treatment plant that pumped
parasite-polluted water throughout Sydney, forcing millions to boil
water to drink, the state urban affairs minister said Friday.
	   Fleets of trucks rushed through the streets delivering bottled
water to businesses, schools, hospitals and homes as Sydney's 3.7
million residents were warned to boil their drinking water to make
it safe. Bottled water vanished off store shelves as customers
bought a half-dozen or more bottles each.
	   The anger of Sydney residents was also boiling as they demanded
to know how the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium spread
through the city's water system.
	   No illness has been reported so far as a result of the
contamination, but the parasites have an incubation period of about
a week.
	   In 1993, 100 people died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in an outbreak
of cryptosporidium in the city's drinking water. More than 400,000
others got sick.
	   The tainted water prompted fears that Sydney's reputation has
been damaged ahead of the 2000 Olympic Games, for which Sydney is
the host.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of
Defense William Cohen arrived Thursday with a contingent of
American reporters, to be greeted by Intercontinental Hotel
bellhops informing them the tap water is not safe to drink.
	   The two officials are in Australia for annual consultations
Friday with their counterparts here.
	   This is the second major urban infrastructure failure this year
in the region.
	   A power failure struck downtown Auckland in February, plunging
the commercial heart of New Zealand's largest city into darkness.
Sporadic power failures and electricity shortages continued for
five weeks.
	   Several dead dogs were found in an open canal running into the
water treatment plant that has been pinpointed as the source of the
contamination, Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles said.
	   ``How they've got in there, goodness only knows, but they've
either fallen in or been thrown in by uncaring owners,'' Knowles
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Friday.
	   But Sydney Water managing director Chris Pollett said he doubted
a few dead animals could have caused the citywide problem, and said
it was more likely that the parasites were generally present in
water running into the system.
	   He said the water system was being flushed and he hoped the tap
water would be safe to drink in 48 hours.
	   Water mains have been opened, and water gushed down curbs as the
system was flushed.
	   Meanwhile, city residents must boil water for at least 60
seconds _ and preferably for three minutes _ to avoid the
parasites.
	   Giardia, normally spread from human or animal fecal matter, can
cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
	   Cryptosporidium causes symptoms similar to flu. It can kill
people with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, patients
recovering from surgery and victims weakened by other diseases.
	   New South Wales State Premier Bob Carr vowed to fire those
responsible but played down damage to the Olympic city's
reputation.
	   ``It's got nothing to do with the Olympics, it's got to do with
being able to drink water from a tap knowing you're not in danger
of getting a stomach bug,'' he told reporters.
	   Sydney Water had previously been so proud of its water supply
that it ran ad campaigns featuring prominent Olympic athletes
endorsing its purity.
	   State opposition leader Peter Collins said Sydney's reputation
was on the line because of the contamination.
	   ``Two years out from the Olympics, we get a reputation for being
a city whose water supply has to be boiled before you can drink
it,'' Collins said.
	   ``If this was Dakar (Senegal) after the flood, you might
understand it but how has this been allowed to happen in Sydney?''

Milosevic promises end of Kosovo offensive

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International relief workers are
searching remote areas of Kosovo for the tens of thousands of
civilians believed to have fled the government offensive that drove
ethnic Albanian rebels from their village strongholds.
	   The search intensified after teams from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees found about 500 terrified Albanians,
including women and children, sheltering Thursday in the rugged
hills near Malisevo. The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
abandoned the town on Tuesday.
	   UNHCR official Maki Shinohara said the Albanians had little food
and no water and were fearful they would be hunted down by Serb
police. She said U.N. refugee workers would try to send a convoy of
food and supplies to them Friday or Saturday.
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said at least 100,000
people had been displaced within the rebellious province since
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian militants in February.
	   The latest offensive, which began last week, sent an estimated
20,000 people from their homes, although precise figures had not
been determined because police were blocking access to wide areas
of conflict.
	   Milosevic promised a European Union delegation Thursday that the
latest offensive was over. He offered again to begin talks on the
future of the province if the Albanians can put together a
negotiating team.
	   ``President Milosevic promised to make returns (of refugees)
possible, but it's hard for us to see how without additional
confidence-building measures,'' said German representative Wolfgang
Ischinger.
	   Prior to their meeting with Milosevic, members of the EU
delegation traveled to villages targeted in the offensive to assess
the level of destruction.
	   ``We were shocked by what we saw. It gives the clear impression
of an excessive use of military force,'' Austrian diplomat Albert
Rohan said. ``The consequences to the civilian population seem
totally out of proportion with any military targets.
	   Ischinger said the Serb attacks had created ``literally a
wasteland.''
	   Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people. Many
of them want independence from Serbia, the largest of the two
republics that form Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. and European diplomats have been trying for months to
arrange peace talks under the leadership of Ibrahim Rugova, the
most prominent Albanian leader and an opponent of violence.
	   But Rugova's opposition to violence has angered the KLA, which
has refused to accept his leadership. On Thursday, U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin said Serb intimidation of
civilians in Kosovo was making it difficult for U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill to ``lock-in'' an Albanian delegation.
	   The United States and the Europeans also reject independence for
Kosovo, fearing it would lead to similar demands among
Albanian-speaking communities elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   U.S. officials have expressed support for restoring autonomy in
the province, which Milosevic revoked in 1989.
	   Much of the funding for the armed struggle comes from Albanian
communities in Western Europe. Germany's foreign minister, Klaus
Kinkel, said he would meet KLA representatives in Bonn on Friday to
warn them that continued fighting in Kosovo would damage Albanian
relations with the West.

Rafter advances in Mercedes Cup

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Australia's Pat Rafter, preparing for his
U.S. Open title defense, beat Martin Damm of Czech Republic 6-3,
5-7, 6-1 on Thursday in the second round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
	   ``I thought I played well, but he got fit in the second. Then I
got to a fast start in the final set. This is the best I've played
in Los Angeles,'' said Rafter, who will face Justin Gimelstob in
the quarterfinals.
	   Gimelstob advanced when eighth-seeded Vince Spadea retired
because of exhaustion. Gimelstob led the match 6-3, 3-0.
	   ``It will be very tough, very intense. The last time we played
it was very close,'' said the second-seeded Rafter, who beat
Gimelstob 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 last year in Philadelphia.
	   In a night match, fifth-seeded Andre Agassi faced Jan-Michael
Gambill, with the winner advancing to a quarterfinal match against
Sandon Stolle of Australia. Stolle beat countryman Andrew Ilie 6-3,
7-6 (8-6).

Former Beijing Mayor sentenced to 16 years imprisonment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Former Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong was sentenced
Friday to 16 years imprisonment for his part in China's largest
graft scandal.
	   In its verdict, Beijing's Municipal Higher People's Court also
ordered that bribes Chen accepted should be confiscated and handed
over to the State Treasury, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Chen, who also was the former Communist Party boss of Beijing,
is the most senior party member to be prosecuted in a five-year
campaign against corruption that already has seen Chen's son and
other high-level politicians jailed.
	   Xinhua said Chen was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment on the
charge of corruption and to four years imprisonment on the charge
of dereliction of duty.
	   In all, Chen will serve a total of 16 years imprisonment, Xinhua
said. It was not immediately clear why the two sentences were not
added together to make a total of 17 years.
	   Chen can appeal the verdict in the next 10 days, but Xinhua did
not say if he would do so.

Nicaragua reaches accord with Costa Rica on river rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua defused a diplomatic tiff
with neighboring Costa Rica by agreeing to allow Costa Rican police
to carry out armed patrols of the San Juan river on the two
countries' border.
	   Nicaragua will retain control over river traffic, but will allow
the Costa Rican police to carry arms on the river as long as they
are accompanied by their Nicaraguan counterparts, under an
agreement signed by the two nations Thursday.
	   The dispute began earlier this month when Nicaraguan troops
blocked Costa Rican police boats trying to patrol the river.
	   A few small stretches of the river have been contested by both
sides for more than a century. But the disputed area has frequently
been used by Nicaraguan illegal immigrants entering Costa Rica in
search of temporary work.

Japan's jobless rate hits record high 4.3 percent in June
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with new details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Corporate retrenching and rising bankruptcies sent
Japan's unemployment rate to a record high of 4.3 percent in June,
the government announced Friday.
	   The jump followed two consecutive months at the previous high of
4.1 percent, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   Layoffs were the main cause of the surge in the jobless rate as
companies step up restructuring efforts to remain competitive
during Japan's recession and corporate bankruptcies soar, the
agency said.
	   The number of people forced out of their jobs increased to
900,000 in June, up by 340,000 from last year, the agency said.
	   The June unemployment figure is the highest recorded since the
government began its current system of compiling unemployment data
in 1953.
	   Demand for labor also slumped, with 51 jobs being offered in
June for every 100 seekers, compared to 53 in May. The ration of
job offers to seekers was the lowest in Japan since January 1978.
	   The total number of people out of work actually fell due to
seasonal factors to 2.84 million from the record high of 2.93
million set in May, the agency said. But the number of jobless grew
by 550,000 from last year.
	   The bad news comes one day after the inauguration of a new
administration headed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who has vowed
strong measures to combat Japan's worst recession since the end of
World War II.
	   Japan is under increasing pressure from its trading partners to
repair its troubled financial system.
	   The jobless rate for women also rose to an all-time high of 4.2
percent in June, the agency said. The rate for men remained
unchanged at a record 4.3 percent.
	   Japan's unemployment rate would be significantly higher if
calculated by U.S. and European standards. The country counts
anyone who has worked one hour or more in the month surveyed as
fully employed.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ It came down to the freestyle relay
again in Goodwill Games swimming. This time, the U.S. team won.
	   A night after the U.S. men were burned by a rare defeat in the
400-meter freestyle relay to narrowly lose to Germany, the U.S.
women gained a 65-57 victory over the World All-Stars with a relay
triumph anchored by five-time Olympic gold medalist Jenny Thompson.
	   It also put the Americans on the inside track for the team gold
medal.
	   The two teams each won seven of the 14 events, but the United
States won the meet because it finished 2-3 in five of the seven
events the All-Stars won.
	   The U.S. stars of the night were the veterans _ Thompson, 25;
Lea Maurer, 28; and Cristina Teuscher, 20.
	   Thompson won the 100 butterfly, swam the butterfly leg on the
winning medley relay and the anchor on the decisive freestyle
relay.
	   Maurer won both backstroke events and swam on the medley relay,
while Teuscher won the 800 and 400 freestyles before coming back
for a leg on the freestyle relay.
	   No other U.S. woman won an individual event.
	   But Richelle Fox played a big role in the freestyle relay.
Swimming first, she took a one-second lead over Rania Elwani of
Egypt.
	   Sylvia Bereknyei maintained a half-second edge over Nadezhda
Chemezova of Russia before Teuscher completed her grueling night by
extending the margin to 1.3 seconds over Wilma Van Hofwegen of the
Netherlands.
	   Martina Moravcova of Slovakia cut into the margin against
Thompson, but couldn't catch her. The times were 3 minutes, 45
seconds for the United States and 3:45.39 for the World team.
	   In women's beach volleyball, the top two teams stayed unbeaten,
while the defending champions got their first win.
	   No. 1 Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil beat Julien Manser
and Kerri Pottharst of Australia, 15-9, before Lisa Arce and Holly
McPeak defeated Eva Celboa and Sona Dosoudilova of the Czech
Republic by the same score.
	   If they keep winning, the Brazilians and the Americans will meet
for the championship Sunday in Central Park.
	   ``We want to play them in the gold-medal match,'' Arce said.
``That's the best scenario. They're good friends of ours and that's
what we kind of said, `Win all your matches and we'll see you in
the finals.'''
	   Liz Masakayan and Karolyn Kirby of San Diego, losers in the
opener against Manser and Pottharst, beat Canada's Kristine Drakich
and Guylaine Dumont 15-5.
	   World champions Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov led the
ice dance after the figure skating short program, ahead of another
Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh. Americans
Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler were fourth.
	   Meanwhile, gymnast Sang Lan was moved from a hospital on Long
Island to Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan to begin the next
step of rehabilitation from a practice accident that left her
paralyzed.
	   The 17-year-old from China had been at Nassau County Medical
Center since she landed on her head during vault warm-ups July 21.
Doctors say she probably never will walk again.

Despite problems, new ASEAN chairman optimistic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The new chairman of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations said he is optimistic, but admitted the
challenge of lifting the region out of its economic malaise is a
difficult one.
	   ``We must bite the bullet by addressing weaknesses, implementing
sound policies and staying the course on globalization,''
Singapore's Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar said in a speech
Thursday night, summing up a just-concluded week of ASEAN meetings
in Manila with Western and other Asian powers.
	   ``If we can do so, the pain, while acute, will pass and we will
be the stronger for it,'' said Jayakumar, who was chosen ASEAN
chairman for the next year.
	   He said that despite vast differences in race, religion,
political style and nation size, ``past experience has shown ASEAN
has a remarkable capacity to work together to achieve common
aspirations, especially when the going gets tough.''
	   Ministers at the Manila meetings had expressed optimism that as
the East Asian economies implement reforms, confidence will return
and they will ``eventually regain their position as among the
faster growing in the world,'' he said.
	   Jayakumar went out of his way to challenge observers who have
suggested ASEAN may be developing fissures, particularly on the
issue of human rights oppression by newest member Myanmar, and the
desire by the group's two democracies _ Thailand and the
Philippines _ to speak more publicly about problems.
	   Jayakumar was one of the chief opponents of any change in
ASEAN's policies of quiet, closed-door diplomacy, decision by
consensus, and ignoring member states' internal politics.
	   In his speech to a Southeast Asian research group after
returning to Singapore, Jayakumar said, ``If I may paraphrase Mark
Twain, rumors of ASEAN's death are greatly exaggerated.''
	   ``During these trying times, ASEAN must stay focused on basic
principles: sovereign equality, consensus decision-making, domestic
noninterference and open economies,'' Jayakumar said.
	   Rejecting comparisons with the European Union, which takes an
interest in human rights as well as economic policies of member
states, Jayakumar said: ``Unlike the EU, ASEAN is an organization
for regional cooperation, not a supranational body at the expense
of individual sovereignty.
	   ``It was designed to manage political and security relations
within the region and with major powers,'' and has kept the peace
for 30 years, he said. ``We need not be distracted by `expert'
opinions proposing that we adopt new or different ways to handle
our affairs.''

U.S. struggles early again in the ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was another rocky night for the United States
at the Goodwill Games boxing semifinals.
	   Michael Evans lost a tight 3-2 decision to Russian featherweight
Andrei Koslovsky in the first fight on the Thursday card, before a
13-9 loss by light middleweight Jermain Taylor to another Russian,
Gaidarbek Gaidarbekov.
	   ``I landed some good shots,'' Evans said. ``But they didn't
count.''
	   Koslovsky will meet the winner of the bout between Teaunce
Shepherd and Russia's Aleksandr Mitishev in Saturday's final.
	   The United States placed a fighter in 10 of the 12 Thursday
bouts at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. Only three of the
seven American semifinalists who fought on Wednesday advanced to
the final round.
	   ``We're a good team, but we're young,'' Evans said. ``It's a lot
of our first times boxing in international competition.''
	   Taylor agreed that the team has overachieved.
	   ``Everyone was saying that we were only going to win one medal,
but look where we are,'' he said.

Kwan, Russian dancers lead Goodwill skating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Michelle Kwan skated brilliantly to
be where she was expected to be _ in the lead after the women's
short program at the Goodwill Games.
	   Kwan, the Olympic silver medalist and two-time world champion,
was the next-to-last skater Thursday night. She made it worth the
wait with a flawless show as one of the headliners of these games,
earning a perfect score from one of the judges.
	   The crowd, which included Goodwill Games creator Ted Turner and
his wife, Jane Fonda, responded to Kwan's every move, even during
warmups. And the 18-year-old gave her fans plenty to cheer about.
	   Skating to Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 3, Kwan dazzled the
audience in a performance that counted for one-third of her final
mark. The other two-thirds comes in Saturday night's free skate.
	   With longtime rival and Olympic gold medalist Tara Lipinski gone
to the pros and Nicole Bobek withdrawn because of fatigue, Kwan was
left as headliner of the Goodwill competition. She did not
disappoint.
	   Wearing a red-and-pink sequined outfit, she opened her 2-minute,
40-second program with a triple lutz/double toe loop and flowed
effortlessly through the eight required elements, finishing with a
spiral sequence and combination spin that left the Nassau Coliseum
crowd of 5,581 standing and roaring. They littered the ice with
flowers as Kwan skated off.
	   She embraced coach Frank Carroll after leaving the ice, then
watched the scoreboard flash her scores, which included six 5.9s
and a perfect 6.0 from the English judge for presentation.
	   European champion Maria Butrskaya of Russia, skating to
``Fever,'' was second and Viktoriya Volchkova of Russia, who was
celebrating her 16th birthday and skated to Doga's Waltz, was
third.
	   Displaying a sense of joy that captured the crowd, the
world-champion Russian team of Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov maintained their lead in the dance.
	   With ``Five Months, Two Weeks,'' as their music for the original
dance, the Olympic silver medalists dashed around the ice with
abandon, earning a sweep of 5.9 scores for presentation from the
five judges.
	   ``We feel great,'' Krylova said. ``We have so much fun skating
here. We enjoy the public and they enjoy our show.''
	   The performance was worth 30 percent toward their final score
following the 20 percent from Wednesday night's compulsory dance.
The final 50 percent of the score comes in Saturday night's free
dance.
	   Second place belonged to another Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva
and Ilia Averbush, who skated to ``Tuitti Fruitti. The Ukranian
pair of Elena Grushina and Rusian Goncharov, who used ``Rock Around
The Clock'' as their music, were third.
	   American teen-agers Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler received a
rousing reception from the crowd of as they skated to ``Great Balls
of Fire,'' but remained last among the four pairs.
	   ``This is our favorite program,'' Joseph said. ``We love to do
it. It's a ton of fun and it seems so short. I wish we could be out
there longer.''

One year on, relatives return to Thredbo to mourn landslide
</HEADLINE>
victims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THREDBO, Australia (AP) _ Hundreds of people turned out Friday
for memorial services to commemorate 18 people killed in a
landslide on an Australian ski slope one year ago.
	   Sole survivor Stuart Diver was among several hundred people who
lit candles at the site of the disaster in the Snowy Mountains
resort town of Thredbo in New South Wales state.
	   They gathered at the hillside where a massive landslide swept
away two ski lodges at 11.30 p.m. Thursday night, a year to the
minute since the collapse. Among those killed were U.S. ski
instructors Miriam (Mim) and Mike Sodergren.
	   The candles from the silent vigil burned into the early hours of
Friday as the wind dropped to a whisper.
	   Family and friends of the dead wept and hugged each other as
they placed candles in the snow and in the rock terraces built to
stabilize the hillside since the disaster.
	   A private service was held earlier at the town's tiny ecumenical
chapel and a plaque unveiled as a memorial to the dead. A second
service was held Friday morning at the chapel, packed with about
200 people.
	   The church bell tolled as each of the 18 names was read out from
the plaque.
	   Several police attending the service went straight back to a
search for a snowboarder missing on the Thredbo slopes since
Thursday morning.
	   About 30 relatives of the dead have come to the village for the
anniversary, which the Rev. Harvey Sloane said would help provide
them with some closure to the tragedy.
	   ``Some haven't been able to come. It's too soon,'' he said.
``This year is not the right time for them. Next year might not be
right either.''
	   Many relatives had expressed fear about returning to the town,
which held many tragic memories for them of the weeklong wait
during the search for bodies buried beneath tons of earth and
rubble, he said.
	   But they were comforted when they arrived to see so many
familiar faces _ people who shared and understood their pain, he
said.
	   One regular visitor to Thredbo, who asked not to be named, said
returning to the town this week had been difficult.
	   ``Today, when we drove in, I got a lump up to here just thinking
about it,'' he said.
	   Now, the ugly scar in the hillside left by the slide is almost
unrecognizable _ the wreckage has been taken away, much of the hill
has been terraced and the entire area is blanketed in snow.
	   The formal memorial services will end Friday afternoon with an
ecumenical service to be attended by Governor-General Sir William
Deane, emergency services workers who took part in the rescue and
family and friends.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Jenny Thompson thought she was tired
after a tough night at the Goodwill Games. Then she remembered how
grueling, and successful, Cristina Teuscher's night had been.
	   ``I am so spent,'' Thompson said after holding on in the final
decisive event, the 400-meter freestyle relay. ``The last 5 meters
were fuzzy and in slow motion, like I was in `Saving Private
Ryan.'''
	   A night before, the final relay was the downfall of the U.S. men
against Germany. This time, the U.S. team won.
	   The American women gained a 65-57 victory over the World
All-Stars with a relay triumph anchored by Thompson, a five-time
Olympic gold medalist. But Thompson said the real hero was
Teuscher, who won the 800 and 400 freestyles and swam an
outstanding third leg on the final relay.
	   ``I shouldn't be complaining,'' said Thompson, 25, holding her
cramping side. ``Cristina had a tougher night and she did a
tremendous job.''
	   ``At least it got easier as the night went on _ from 800 to 400
to 100,'' said Teuscher. ``On relays, the energy and momentum take
over. But I was pretty nervous about the three races I had to do.''
	   The dual meet victory over the All-Stars put the Americans on
the inside track for the team gold medal.
	   The two teams each won seven of the 14 events, but the United
States won the meet because it finished 2-3 in five of the seven
events the All-Stars won.
	   ``It was a team effort because every single place counts in a
dual meet,'' said Lea Maurer, 28, who won both backstroke events
and swam a leg on the medley relay.
	   Thompson swam the butterfly leg on the medley relay and won the
100 butterfly in the seventh-fastest time in history, just five
minutes before the freestyle relay.
	   No U.S. woman besides the three veterans won an individual
event.
	   But Richelle Fox played a big role in the freestyle relay.
Swimming first, she took a one-second lead over Rania Elwani of
Egypt.
	   Sylvia Bereknyei maintained a half-second edge over Nadezhda
Chemezova of Russia before Teuscher completed her grueling night by
extending the margin to 1.3 seconds over Wilma Van Hofwegen of the
Netherlands.
	   Martina Moravcova of Slovakia cut into the margin against
Thompson, but couldn't catch her. The times were 3 minutes, 45
seconds for the United States and 3:45.39 for the World team.
	   ``It was slow motion, but I made it to the wall,'' Thompson
said.
	   Michelle Kwan dazzled the crowd and the judges at figure
skating.
	   The two-time world champion and Olympic silver medalist scored a
string of 5.9s and one perfect 6 to take the lead after the women's
short program.
	   European champion Maria Butrskaya of Russia was second and
Viktoriya Volchkova of Russia was third.
	   It was another rough night for American boxers in the
semifinals. They started with two straight losses to Russians _
Michael Evans in a 3-2 decision to featherweight Andrei Koslovsky,
then light middleweight Jermain Taylor in a 13-9 loss to Gaidarbek
Gaidarbekov.
	   World champions Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov led the
ice dance after the figure skating short program, ahead of another
Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh. Americans
Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler were fourth.
	   In women's beach volleyball, the top two teams stayed unbeaten,
while the defending champions got their first win.
	   No. 1 Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil beat Julien Manser
and Kerri Pottharst of Australia, 15-9, before Lisa Arce and Holly
McPeak defeated Eva Celboa and Sona Dosoudilova of the Czech
Republic by the same score.
	   If they keep winning, the Brazilians and the Americans will meet
for the championship Sunday in Central Park.
	   ``We want to play them in the gold-medal match,'' Arce said.
``That's the best scenario. They're good friends of ours and that's
what we kind of said, `Win all your matches and we'll see you in
the finals.'''
	   Liz Masakayan and Karolyn Kirby, losers in the opener against
Manser and Pottharst, beat Canada's Kristine Drakich and Guylaine
Dumont 15-5.
	   Meanwhile, gymnast Sang Lan was moved from a hospital on Long
Island to Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan to begin the next
step of rehabilitation from a practice accident that left her
paralyzed.
	   The 17-year-old from China had been at Nassau County Medical
Center since she landed on her head during vault warm-ups July 21.
Doctors say she probably never will walk again.

 &UR; Former Beijing Mayor sentenced to 16 years imprisonment
 &UR; Eds; RECASTS to UPDATE with detail, background, Chen's sentence
announced on national TV; adds byline
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A once powerful Communist Party leader was
sentenced Friday to 16 years imprisonment in China's largest graft
scandal, signaling Chinese leaders' renewed determination to clean
up their corruption-tainted government.
	   Chen Xitong, a former mayor and party boss of Beijing, is the
most senior party member to be prosecuted in a five-year campaign
against official corruption that already has seen Chen's son and
other high-level politicians jailed.
	   Many Chinese had believed that Chen was too powerful to put on
trial. So his sentence, while less harsh than those handed down to
some other, lower-ranked officials, indicated that Chinese leaders
are determined to push ahead with their anti-corruption battle.
	   In pursuing their campaign, Chinese leaders have acknowledged
that rampant official graft has provoked widespread public anger
that could undermine Communist Party rule unless assuaged.
	   Indicating that Chinese leaders hope to make an example of his
case, Chen's conviction was announced nationwide on state-run media
shortly after the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court passed
sentence.
	   The court sentenced Chen to 13 years imprisonment for corruption
and to four years imprisonment for dereliction of duty, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   In all, Chen will serve 16 years imprisonment, Xinhua said. It
was not immediately clear why the two sentences were not added
together to make a total of 17 years.
	   The court also ordered that bribes Chen accepted should be
confiscated and handed over to the State Treasury, Xinhua said.
	   Chen can appeal the verdict in the next 10 days, but Xinhua did
not say if he would do so.
	   Chen ruled Beijing first as mayor and then party secretary from
1987 to 1995. His downfall confirmed the suspicions of many Chinese
that corruption reached into the highest levels of the party.
	   Chen stepped down as Beijing's party secretary in 1995 after a
protege committed suicide rather than face arrest for corruption.
Chen's administration was described as a hotbed of graft, kickbacks
and misdeeds that possibly cost the city as much as 18 billion yuan
(more than dlrs 2 billion) in public funds.
	   Chen was expelled from the Communist Party in September and
handed over to prosecutors. Officials announced in March that
prosecutors had finished their investigations and that court
proceedings against Chen would be launched soon.
	   Since his arrest, Chen has been kept out of public view. Rumors
circulating in Beijing had him detained in Inner Mongolia or kept
at a seaside mansion. Hong Kong media recently reported Chen was
moved to a Beijing hospital this year for health problems.

Paralyzed gymnast transferred to Manhattan rehab center

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan was moved to
a Manhattan rehabilitation clinic, where she was visited by actor
Leonardo DiCaprio.
	   She arrived Thursday in Manhattan by ambulance from Nassau
County Medical Center for what her family hopes will be the first
step in a return to athletic competition. Immobilized on a
stretcher, with her parents walking alongside, she was carried
through a media horde into the Mount Sinai Rehabilitation
Institute.
	   Her dreams of gold in the Goodwill Games were dashed, but the
vivacious young woman quickly revealed another desire this week _
to meet DiCaprio.
	   The actor paid a private visit to Sang Lan at the hospital
Thursday night, according to a one-sentence statement released by a
public relations firm on his behalf. The visit was confirmed by
hospital spokesman, Mel Granick, who said he had no further
information except that the pair met for about an hour.
	   To prepare for the 23-year-old ``Titanic'' star's visit, the
young woman even learned a few words of English. She can say, ``Hi,
how are you?''
	   Sang, who was China's 1997 national vault champion, ``is
fascinated with American pop culture,'' said Shelley Lotenberg,
spokeswoman for Nassau County Medical Center, where she stayed in
the pediatric intensive care unit.
	   The teen-ager broke her neck a week ago during a warmup vault at
the Nassau Coliseum. She underwent surgery Saturday, but has little
sensation from the chest down. Doctors have discounted some toe
movement as an involuntary twitch.
	   Still, her spirits were soaring.
	   ``I am so happy. I feel no more pain in my neck,'' she told a
Chinese reporter earlier this week at the hospital in East Meadow.
	   At Mount Sinai, she will benefit from ``one of the few model
spinal cord injury centers in the United States,'' said Dr. Brock
Schnebel, chief medical officer for the Goodwill Games. However, he
said in a statement, ``there has been no change in Sang Lan's
neurological condition.''
	   In addition to physical treatment _ including an experimental
nerve-building drug _ the teen-ager will get moral support from
Chinese staff doctors and students at the hospital on Manhattan's
Upper East Side.
	   ``We're going to translate for her. And we can give her another
kind of care _ make her feel she's not alone,'' said Dr. Jian Dong
of Mount Sinai.
	   For the next several weeks, she will learn to ``optimize her
physical skills ... and enhance her transition back to everyday
activities,'' Granick said in a statement.
	   It was here that New York Jets defensive end Dennis Byrd was
treated for a paralyzing spinal cord injury he suffered during a
game six years ago. The former American football player's recovery
was termed ``miraculous.''
	   To buoy her spirits at the center, Sang also brought a treasured
item: a bulletin board adorned with DiCaprio's picture and cards
from hundreds of well-wishers.
	   Sang was disappointed when told the movie ``Titanic'' wasn't yet
available on video, but Paramount Pictures rushed to the rescue,
sending a studio copy.
	   As for DiCaprio, the actor's Los Angeles publicist, Cindy
Guagenti, said earlier in the day that arrangements were being made
but she would not discuss details for security reasons.
	   Sang had also expressed a desire to meet singer Celine Dion and
the Spice Girls and their representatives said they were trying to
get in touch with their clients about the visit.
	   Before her parents left China, Sang's friends made 1,000 paper
birds for her _ symbols of their wishes for a quick recovery.
	   ``I am sure she will be back to the competition circle because
she is very courageous, and with the excellent medical (care), the
doctors and hospitals in America,'' her father, Sang Shisheng, said
earlier in the week.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks gain moderately in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Friday morning
amid speculation Japan won't soon intervene in currency markets to
support the yen. Tokyo stock prices continued to gain moderately.
	   The dollar bought 143.66 yen in morning trading, up 1.36 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and unchanged from its late New York
rate of 143.66 yen overnight.
	   The dollar's strength came after Japan's newly appointed Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa dimmed intervention fears.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister, told a news conference early
Friday that the yen and stock markets should move ``on their own''
and intervention in foreign exchange markets should occur only
rarely.
	   Traders interpreted Miyazawa's remarks as diminishing the
likelihood that Japan's central bank will try to prop up the yen,
even if it falls further.
	   U.S. and Japanese monetary authorities sold dollars and bought
yen in a dramatic intervention June 17 to prop up the faltering
Japanese currency.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices advanced on
expectations new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration will
carry out permanent tax cuts and implement measures to write off
massive bad debts held by Japan's banks.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 164.98 points, or 1.02
percent, to close the morning session at 16,366.58. On Thursday,
the average closed up 43.51 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 11.39 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,259.58.
The TOPIX closed up 7.49 points, or 0.60 percent, the day before.
	   Traders were also encouraged by an overnight rise on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 111.99 points
to 9026.95.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.230 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.225 percent, driving its price down to 111.59 yen from 111.63
yen.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Recently unearthed floral frescoes from
the palace of the Byzantine emperors provide a window into the
ancient world _ but other secrets remain locked beneath some of the
world's most visited tourist sites.
	   The Great Palace of Byzantium, the home to emperors who governed
most of the Western world from the 4th century to the 12th century,
lies beneath the Blue Mosque and next to St. Sophia.
	   Alpay Pasinli, director of Istanbul's Archaeology Museum in
charge of the excavations, said it would be impossible to unearth
the entire Great Palace, and that it is doubtful that most of the
ruins will ever become visible.
	   ``So many people live on (the site) and we would have to dig
under the Blue Mosque,'' he said.
	   The dilemma is starkly visible at the site of the dig: Look up,
and you are confronted symbols of the Ottoman takeover of Greek
Constantinople: St. Sophia, the Orthodox
church-turned-mosque-turned-museum, and the Blue Mosque, the
magnificent tile-paneled mosque built in the 1600s by the great
Ottoman architect, Mehmet.
	   Look down, and the frescoes, with their striking colors, are a
vivid reminder of the city's Byzantine past.
	   First built by Constantine the Great, who made Constantinople
the capital to the Roman Empire, the palace was constantly enlarged
and modified until it became a grand complex of courtyards, throne
rooms and churches.
	   By closely studying the remains, scholars are hoping to discover
more on the lives of the emperors.
	   ``We would be able to put an element of reality into what we
know of Byzantine life,'' said Robert Ousterhout, an expert in
Byzantine architecture from the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign, who is currently studying the Zeyrek mosque, a
former Byzantine monastery in Istanbul.
	   ``We would find out how people moved through the palace, how it
was organized. Did it look like the Palatine in Rome?'' he said,
referring the Rome's best preserved imperial palace.
	   Archaeologists and art historians have been searching and
finding ruins of the grand complex, which covers most of Istanbul's
historical area, for over a century.
	   In 1935, British archaeologists dug out mosaics that were
probably part of a walkway leading out of the imperial apartments.
Depicting lively scenes such as tiger hunts, they were opened to
the public in November.

One year on, relatives return to Thredbo to mourn landslide victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THREDBO, Australia (AP) _ Hundreds of people turned out Friday
for memorial services to commemorate 18 people killed in a
landslide on an Australian ski slope one year ago.
	   The sole survivor, Stuart Diver, was among several hundred
people who lit candles at the site of the disaster in the Snowy
Mountains resort town of Thredbo in New South Wales state.
	   They gathered Thursday night at 11:30 p.m. at the hillside where
a massive landslide swept away two ski lodges, a year to the minute
since the disaster struck. Among those killed were U.S. ski
instructors Miriam (Mim) and Mike Sodergren.
	   The candles from the silent vigil burned into the early hours of
Friday as the wind dropped to a whisper.
	   Family and friends of the dead wept and hugged each other as
they placed candles in the snow and in the rock terraces built to
stabilize the hillside since the disaster.
	   A private service was held earlier at the town's tiny ecumenical
chapel and a plaque unveiled as a memorial to the dead. A second
service was held Friday morning at the chapel, packed with about
200 people.
	   The church bell tolled as each of the 18 names was read out from
the plaque.
	   Several police attending the service went straight back to a
search for a snowboarder missing on the Thredbo slopes since
Thursday morning.
	   About 30 relatives of the dead have come to the village for the
anniversary, which the Rev. Harvey Sloane said would help provide
them with some closure to the tragedy.
	   ``Some haven't been able to come. It's too soon,'' he said.
``This year is not the right time for them. Next year might not be
right either.''

Two Korean banks announce merger, seek government money

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two major commercial banks announced a
merger Friday, giving a much-needed boost to President Kim
Dae-jung's efforts to clean up the country's debt-ridden banking
system.
	   The marriage between two of the nation's top five banks _ Hanil
Bank and Commercial Bank of Korea _ will create South Korea's
largest bank with combined assets of 102 trillion won (dlrs 82
billion).
	   The two banks said they will become more efficient by cutting
their work force and shutting down many of their combined 950
retail branches. But they also asked the government to take over a
portion of their non-performing loans estimated at dlrs 10.4
billion.
	   ``We realized that we can not survive on our own in this
difficult time for the banking industry,'' said Bae Chan-byung,
head of Commercial Bank of Korea.
	   Lee Kwan-woo, head of Hanil Bank, said the banks will ask the
government to invest up to dlrs 6.4 billion to help write off bad
loans or buy new shares.
	   Restructuring the ailing banking system is the cornerstone of
President Kim's plan for reviving South Korea's economy, which was
bailed out by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The government had previously shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks, or finance companies, and five small commercial banks. But
critics have said that was not enough.
	   Although both Commercial Bank and Hanil said their planned
merger was voluntary, Kim has been urging major commercial banks to
strike mergers to improve their capital-to-asset ratio to
internationally accepted levels.
	   Also Friday, the Ministry of Finance and Economy reaffirmed its
promises to help such mergers by writing off bad loans and giving
tax benefits.
	   Domestic news media said more banks were discussing mergers.
	   With Korean banks struggling under their own debts, government
efforts to restructure the debt-ridden industries has been
stalling.
	   In its annual economy survey report, the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said a
political system of implicit collusion between the government,
banks and large corporations created the structural faults lines.
	   During the past military rulers, banks were accused of paying
little attention either to the true financial condition of
borrowers or the long-term profitability of the projects being
funded.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, banks were left with mounds of bad loans, triggering a sudden
loss of international confidence that led to the financial crisis.
	   Hanil Bank reported a loss of dlrs 659 million in the first six
month of the year, shifting from a profit of dlrs 26 million a year
ago.
	   Commercial Bank also swung to a net loss of dlrs 447 million
from a dlrs 34 million profit a year before.

Politicians demand action to help child migrants trace parents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thousands of people who were sent as children to
Britain's colonies as cheap labor, often without their parents'
knowledge or approval, must be given immediate help to trace their
families, a government committee has urged.
	   Members of Parliament urged the government Thursday to apologize
to children who were victims of a policy, started in the 17th
century and stopped only in the late 1960s, in which they were sent
to countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
	   The children were sent as young as three and hardly any were
orphans. On arrival, they were frequently subjected to physical,
sexual and emotional abuse, the House of Commons health committee
said in a report released Thursday.
	   The migration was a joint enterprise between governments and
religious and children's charities in Britain. But former child
migrants now trying to trace their relatives in Britain say that
the charities which sent them abroad are refusing to help.
	   The health committee said the migrants and their descendants
should be given immediate access to all files containing
information about their background and that organizations must be
compelled to cooperate. Those who cannot afford to come to Britain
to find their families should be funded, the committee added.
	   The group also said therapy should be made available to those
left psychologically damaged by their childhood experiences.
	   The committee called on the government of Australia to
investigate the allegations of physical, mental and sexual abuse at
institutions where child migrants lived and said any surviving
members of staff implicated should be prosecuted.
	   ``We would expect the full weight of the law to be felt in cases
where physical and sexual abuse against former child migrants can
be proven,'' the committee said. ``Courts should award the maximum
possible damages when a conviction is obtained.''
	   About 150,000 children were dispatched to the colonies over a
period of 350 years. In the final period from 1947-1967, between
7,000 and 10,000 children were sent to Australia alone.
	   The committee took evidence from migrants that they were told,
wrongly, that their parents were dead, that they were beaten,
raped, treated as slave labor and given inadequate food, clothing
and shoes.
	   Often their names were changed and they were not told of their
true identity or even their birthday.
	   ``These children were placed in large, often isolated,
institutions and were often subjected to harsh, sometimes
intentionally brutal, regimes of work and discipline,'' the report
said.
	   The Christian Brothers have already issued a public apology for
the abuse that took place in their institutions.
	   Barnardos, a well-regarded children's charity, told the
committee that it looked back with ``shock and horror'' on its past
as one of the agencies which sent the children abroad.
	   The report concluded that the child migration policy was ``a
sorry episode in British history'' and said the government is under
a moral and legal duty to help the migrants now.
	   Lawmakers warned that time is running out because the former
child migrants are getting older and their parents, if alive, are
in extreme old age.
	   Surviving migrants are divided over whether compensation should
be paid to them, and the report does not recommend payments. It
says most former migrants are more interested in getting
information about their identity and background.
