<HEADLINE> Russian PM Says Chechnya Policy Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that Moscow's policy toward the settlement
of the conflict in Chechnya had not been changed by the death of
Chechen rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here that "all aspects of the settlement of
the crisis in the region (Chechnya), both political and economic,"
will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue negotiations and we are prepared to
negotiate with anyone in order to restore peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Denisov, an aide to the speaker of the State Duma
(lower house of parliament), said that Russian authorities wanted
to contact new Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev to
try to negotiate a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The move to make contact may take place next week, Denisov told
the Itar-Tass news agency over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts with Yandarbiyev are designed to establish peace in
the Chechen republic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denisov arrived in Chechnya a week ago to try to establish
contact with Dudayev, who was killed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Denisov said Yandarbiyev, who has assumed Dudayev's powers
according to the "separatist constitution," is now "the most
legitimate figure" in the Chechen separatist camp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov told
reporters that the next development in Chechnya was now difficult
to predict.
</P>
<P>
He said there were Chechen rebel field commanders who wanted to
stop hostilities and establish direct contact with the Russian
military command.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed the peace plan announced by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin for a political settlement of the Chechen
crisis would be fulfilled soon.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here disagree that a settlement can be reached
soon, pointing to figures in the Chechen separatist camp who, they
say, are more radical and militant than Dudayev.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- 9,651 video tapes, 8,237
cassette tapes, 207,046 books, and 354,982 CDs and LDs, which were
eigher pornographic or illegal, were seized during a massive
anti-pornography campaign, that ran from last winter to this
spring.
</P>
<P>
The efforts proved to be fruitful, because the Beijing
municipal government and various other government departments had
worked out a number of strict measures since last November. These
involved a more wide-spread crackdown on the pirating of electronic
audio and video products, and on the spread of pornographic
publications.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, the departments conducted a total of 14
inspections that focused on the Zhong Guancun Area in northwestern
Beijing, where most of the capital's publishing houses and
electronics companies are located.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has also developed a series of
regulations on registration of publishing houses, book
circulation, film releases, and video shows.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Beijing is to continue the drive to contribute to
the betterment of society.

<HEADLINE> Campaign for First Phase of Poll Ends in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Campaigning for the first phase
of polls for India's 11th Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament)
and some local assemblies ended today with contestants making
their final bid to woo over 130 million voters.
</P>
<P>
As many as 3,300 candidates raced against time to seek as much
support as possible through door-to-door visits and meetings as
the deadline approached at 5:00 p.m. local time today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of various political parties also made last minute bids
to woo over 590 million voters in the country for the coming
general elections which will be held between April 27 and May 30.
</P>
<P>
However, the campaigning for the first phase of polls was
unusually lackluster.
</P>
<P>
The deafening sound and the fanfare usually witnessed in the
general elections were missing this time following India's supreme
court's recent directive for the strict implementation of the
ceiling on election expenses and the election commission's
decision on the observance of the model code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The usual display of colorful posters and banners and
widespread use of audio and visual aids to attract voters were
hardly seen in the campaign this time.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of polls on April 27, elections will be held
for 150 Lok Sabha seats and 535 assembly (state parliament) seats.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and a number of sitting
cabinet ministers will be among those political heavyweights whose
fate would be decided in the polling on Saturday.

<P>
HEFEI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 120 experts on
environment protection and businessmen attended a Sino-American
symposium in Bengbu City, in east China's Anhui Province from
April 23 to 25.
</P>
<P>
The basic topic was "Technology for Water Pollution Control on
the Huaihe River". Xie Zhehua, director of State Bureau of
Environment Protection, said that Chinese government has paid a
great deal of attention to controlling water pollution in the
Huaihe, which runs through central China's Henan Province, Anhui
Province and east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The government has mapped out a plan to make water in the
Huaihe River clear by the year 2000, and has urged local
enterprises to control the discharge of waste water into the
river, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that pollution of the river water is getting
worse: in half of the 191 branches of the Huaihe, the water has
become useless.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jentai Yang, director of the International Affairs
Department of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said that
the United States will launch long term co-operative projects with
China and offer financial support and technological help to solve
the problem.

<HEADLINE> Plight Of Zimbabwean Workers Worse: Says Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Senior official of Zimbabwe's
largest trade union said today that plight of the majority of
Zimbabwean workers are now worse off than they were before the
government introduced market reforms five years ago.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe National News Agency, the
Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions,
Morgan Tsvangirai, said more workers are now insecure about
security of employment, while real incomes have plummeted due to
a spate of tax rise and high inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said that labour laws in Zimbabwe, until 1990 strictly
controlled by the government, have now been liberalized, and
employers have the right to hire and fire workers.
</P>
<P>
Welfare of the workers has been compromised by the
cost-cutting measures being implemented by both the government
and the private sector, Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
He said over 50,000 workers have been retrenched since 1990
and he alleged some of the retrenchments were not justified.
</P>
<P>
''We are asking for substantial increases in wages because of
the good rains we have had, whereas employers hope to use the
anticipated increased profits to cover for losses incurred in
previous years,'' He added.

<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The murder trial of Aum Shinrikyo
leader Shoko Asahara for last year's subway gas attacks opened in
the Tokyo District Court today.
</P>
<P>
The trial, which had been delayed for months, started amid tight
security and huge crowds as media cameras and helicopters and
thousands of people vied for a glimpse of the bearded, partially
blind cult guru outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
Asahara, 41, faces three charges: murder of a rebel follower,
attempted murder for the sarin gas attacks in the Tokyo subway
that killed 11 people and sickened thousands in March last year,
and illegal drug production.
</P>
<P>
He has been indicted on 14 other charges, such as mass murder
and plotting to overthrow the government and install himself as
head of state, in separate trials that have not yet started.
</P>
<P>
Asahara refused to enter a plea to today's charges.
</P>
<P>
After prosecutors read out the charges against him, he spoke
for three minutes about his religious creed, then said, "I have no
intention to say anymore here."
</P>
<P>
He also said he did not care about restrictions on his freedom
or any pain that may result from his practices to help people
obtain what he called "absolute freedom, absolute happiness and
absolute joy."

LHASA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A forum to mark the anniversary of
a national campaign to learn from a model official, the late Kong
Fansen, who dedicated his life to Tibet, was held in the Tibetan
capital.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched on April 29, 1995, when Jiang Zemin,
Chinese president and general secretary of the Communist Party of
China, wrote the inscription "Learn from Comrade Kong Fansen."
</P>
<P>
Kong was the party secretary of Ngari Prefecture of Tibet who

</P>
<P>
Danzim, deputy secretary of the Party committee of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, pointed out at the forum that in the past year

"Kong's spirit has become a great treasure deeply cherished by
the Tibetan people, as well as a powerful impetus for the reform
and opening up in Tibet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gaisang, a student from the University of Tibet, said that Kong
Fansen's deeds are especially encouraging and inspiring for the
younger generation.
</P>
<P>
"Last year there were 50 graduates from my university who
applied to go to work in areas with harsh conditions, such as
Ngari," he explained.

<HEADLINE> EU Wants Role in Freezing DPRK's Nuclear Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
presented a proposal today to give the European Union (EU) a key
role in the body coordinating global efforts to freeze the nuclear
program in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The proposal, now pending the approval by the EU Council of
Ministers, is for the European Atomic Energy Community to become a
member of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO).
</P>
<P>
KEDO was established in March 1995 by the United States, Japan
and South Korea to raise money and provide technical aid for the
DPRK to build two light-water reactors instead of graphite
reactors, which have potential weapons-making capability.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative, according to EC, is aimed at making DPRK's
nuclear program "safer and less military-oriented".

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's sugar production has
reached four million tons this season, up 20 percent from last
year's harvest, the Cuban government said today.
</P>
<P>
It said the production can reach 4.5 million tons in May, a
month before the current season ends.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is Cuba's biggest export, which suffered great setback in
1995. Fifty-five percent of Cuba's arable land grows sugar cane,
but the production last year was merely 3.3 million tons, the
lowest in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban daily Granma said the growth in sugar production, a
major source of income, helps revitalize the stagnant economy of
the Caribbean island.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Widespread in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-seven forest and
grassland fires are raging in all 10 Mongolian provinces except
one, killing one people, injuring 16 and displacing more than 300
others.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 personnel and 200 vehicles have been mobilized
to put down the fires, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tsolmon told a
news conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said details of the overall damage are not immediately
available but said reports from across the country showed 3
million hectares of forests and 5 million acres of pastureland are
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
Bayar, member of Mongolia's National Standing Special
Committee, also told the press conference that the latest forest
fire broke out Monday in a large area of Dornod Aimak Province
bordering China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He said the conditions of the fire were not yet known because
the telephone links between the capital and the province have been
cut off after the fire burned down 250 wire poles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, forest fires in the northwestern Khobsgol
and Bulgan provinces continued to spread.
</P>
<P>
The government will meet Friday to discuss how to mobilize all
walks of life in the rescue operation and to decide whether to
appeal for international emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of Mongolia, the world's largest land-locked
country of about 1.6 million square kilometers, is covered with
forest. Its grassland makes up 80 percent of the country, or 124
million hectares, ranking sixth in the world.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Finland Won't Guarantee Security of Baltic Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden and Finland have ruled
out the possibility of giving security guarantees to other
countries around the Baltic Sea, said a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
During Prime Minister Goran Persson's one-day visit to Finland
on Wednesday, the two countries signed an agreement to enhance
security cooperation in the Baltic region, the Svenska Dagbladet
reported. But both countries ruled out providing a security
umbrella for their smaller neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that some NATO members, such as U.S., Germany
and Britain, have suggested that if the alliance expands to
include only Poland, the five Baltic states outside NATO - Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden and Finland - will have to take care of
their own security. In this event, Sweden and Finland should take
on greater responsibility for the security of the other three
states.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also proposed that the five Baltic countries form a
non-aligned security bloc.
</P>
<P>
But at their joint press conference on Wednesday, Persson and
his Finnish counterpart Paavo Lipponen made it clear that the two
countries oppose these ideas.
</P>
<P>
Persson said the idea that Sweden take special responsibility
for the security of its Baltic neighbors was out of the question.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, UK Investments Pact Endorsed In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania National
Assembly has ratified an agreement between the Tanzanian
government and the United Kingdom government which seeks to
protect investments of their nationals in either country from
nationalisation.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press report today, the Minister of State
in the President's Office, Daniel Yona, told the house in Dodoma,
central Tanzania, on Wednesday that the agreement was aimed at
giving double assurance to investors from the UK that their
investments in Tanzania would be safe.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed by the two governments on
January 7, 1994, enables the aggrieved party in case of
nationalisation to refer the dispute to the international centre
for settlement of investment disputes.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that in case diplomatic efforts to settle
such disputes failed, the two countries would constitute a special
"arbitral tribunal" to resolve the dispute and its decision would
be final.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the agreement offered a "favoured
status" to British investors.
</P>
<P>
He added likewise, Tanzanians who wanted to invest in Britain,
would get the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
Debating the motion, several mps said the government should
enter into such agreement with as many countries as possible.
They said presently, there was stiff competition for investors
among developing countries and Tanzania should not lag behind.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns Cholera Outbreak in Monrovia Could Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today said a cholera outbreak in Monrovia could quickly
spread amid the chaos and deteriorating sanitation conditions
caused by weeks of fighting.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, it confirmed the presence of cholera in a district
of the beleaguered Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven cases of cholera have been reported at a refugee
compound in Greystone, where about 15,000 people have sheltered
since gunbattles broke out between rival factions early this month.
</P>
<P>
"Under the chaotic conditions, the cholera outbreak could
quickly spread and endanger the lives of large numbers of
residents and displaced persons in Monrovia," the U.N. health
agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Without treatment, case fatality rates can reach 50 percent or
higher, said WHO.
</P>
<P>
The massive looting of relief agency warehouses two weeks ago
has led to a lack of medical supplies to treat the epidemic, WHO
said, adding that its second consignment of medicines for treating
cholera is on the way to Freetown, Sierra Leone, for transshipment
to Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, WHO airlifted by helicopter from Freetown to
Monrovia emergency medicines and equipment, including surgical
supplies for treating an estimated 1,450 wounded -- its most
immediate priority.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 of the wounded stay in the refugee compound in
Greystone.
</P>
<P>
Some 450 others, including 100 children, have taken refuge at a
health centre in the cholera-stricken district, where at least 350
acute diarrhoea cases have been reported, resulting in 70 deaths,
50 of whom were children, said WHO.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that it is working to limit the spread of other
epidemics in the city due to the water and sanitation problems.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Dudayev's Death Complicates Situation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Russia's
breakaway republic of Chechnya is likely to become more
complicated after the death of rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, who
was reported to have been killed Sunday night in a Russian missile
attack.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Dudayev, 52, Russia's most wanted man,
was seriously wounded in the attack on the village of Gekhi-Chu,
about 30 kilometers southwest of Grozny. He died later in the
night.
</P>
<P>
However, Moscow has denied such reports with Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov, Russia's military commander in Chechnya, attributing
Dudayev's death to a power struggle within the Chechen separatist
leadership.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Dudayev declared the southern region of Chechnya
independent, and armed conflict came in December 1994 when Moscow
sent troops and tanks to put down the secessionist movement. So
far, the 16-month war in Chechnya has left 30,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Political and military analysts here say that the question is
not whether Dudayev was killed by the Russians or by his
comrades-in-arms, but to what extent his death will complicate the
situation in Chechnya and damage any prospects for a settlement in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
They fear that the war will go on because Dudayev's successor,
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, and some other rebel field commanders are
even more radical than Dudayev and do not want to see the end of
the bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I am certain this (Dudayev's death) makes things worse in
every way," said Alexander Iskandaryan, director of the Center for
Caucasian Studies. Chechnya is located in the north Caucasus in
southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, an uncompromising advocate of Chechnya's
independence from Russia, was named Dudayev's successor
immediately after the latter's death.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev and a rebel field commander, Shamir Basayev, have
declared in recent days that they will continue the struggle for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Yandarbiyev is an interim leader and that
real power is likely to devolve to either Basayev or to Aslan
Maskhadov, who is considered more conciliatory toward
Moscow. Maskhadov was Dudayev's chief of staff and is popular
among his troops.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is clearly hoping to see Maskhadov rise to the top in
the Chechen separatist camp.
</P>
<P>
"We know him, and he knows our approach," said Arkady Volsky,
head of the Russian delegation in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts said, Basayev, whose power base is in the
mountains, may assume the leadership, with Maskhadov remaining in
his post as chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
The analysts believe that "there will undoubtedly be a power
struggle" in the rebel camp. "If Basayev wins, he is likely to
want to fight on and on. If Maskhadov wins, he seems more ready
for compromise," one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
If nobody manages to concentrate power in his own hands, "the
structure of the (separatist) resistance may break down into many
independent structures, forces and groups," because there are
field commanders, who are "very independent," the analysts pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
This would be a more dangerous development of the situation in
the breakaway republic, they said.
</P>
<P>
Whoever finally comes to power in the rebel camp, the immediate
future looks like one of disarray which will dampen the prospects
of any serious peace talks for some time.
</P>
<P>
Although Russian leaders, including President Boris Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, have confidently declared that
peace will come to Chechnya "with or without Dudayev," Moscow's
peace initiatives are not likely to make headway anytime soon.

<HEADLINE> Zambia To Produce 16.5 Million Bags Of Maize This </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Fisheries Suresh Desai said today the National Early
Warning Unit of his ministry has forecasted a preliminary maize
yield of 16.5 million bags (90 kg per bag) in coming harvest
season.
</P>
<P>
Desai told a press briefing here that the country would also
produce 386,200 bags (90 kg per bag) of sorghum and 573,460 bags
(90 kg per bag) of millet this year.
</P>
<P>
The government would release 10 billion kwacha (8.33 million
U.S. Dollars) to purchase crops from farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that apart from the government assisted marketing
arrangements, a significant proportion of the total crop would be
bought and sold by small scale traders at public markets and by
large scale traders who were getting export orders from foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who obtained fertilizers on loan from government
stockists under the agricultural credit management program would
be allowed to pay back with maize or other produce, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In selling their produce, farmers are reminded to hold back
enough for their own household food security and sell only what
is surplus to their requirement," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of the estimated bumper harvest this year,
some people have expressed fears that the government may have not
enough funds to purchase crops from the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's annual consumption of maize stands at some 11 million
bags.

Kunda said LAZ had not seen any form of commitment from the
government to withdraw some clauses on the autonomy of the
judiciary despite President Drederick Xhiluba making an
affirmation that such clauses would not be introduced in the
bill.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that an autonomous independent judiciary was
essential in a democratic society like Zambia.
</P>
<P>
LAZ wished to make its stand known that should the government
go ahead and include the contentious clauses, the association
would use the existing law and fight to ensure that the
provisions were scrapped from the statute books, he said.

<P>
The controversial constitutional amendment bill will be

<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda may be barred from contesting in the coming presidential
election as incumbent President Frederick Chiluba today backed a
proposed constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment, which insists that only indigenous
Zambians are entitled to running for the presidency of the
country, is widely considered as aiming to rid Kaunda, whose
parents are Malawians, from the polling contest.
</P>
<P>
It added that the parents of any presidential aspirant should
also be indigenous Zambians.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba declared that 90 percent of the people
supported the constitutional amendment, to be presented at
parliament next week.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Injuries Drop, Costs Rise in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Fewer Canadians are getting hurt
on the job, but the cost of their injuries is rising -- to at
least 7.3 billion U.S. dollars annually at last count.
</P>
<P>
The cost of occupational injuries is estimated to be at 7.37
billion U.S. dollars in 1994, the latest year for which figures
are available.
</P>
<P>
The total figure is actually double when damage to materials
and equipment, lower staff morale and a number of other related
costs are added to the bill, according to today's Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The number of fatalities has dropped from 918 in 1970 to 709 in
1994, and the rate of injury declined to 6.9 percent of all
workers from 11.3 percent during the 25-year period.
</P>
<P>
The apparent incongruity between a decline in the number of
accidents and mounting costs can be explained by the sharp upward
turn in the time workers spend recovering from their injuries, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
A greater awareness in the workplace about injuries has led to
a longer recovery period, it added.
</P>
<P>
Health and safety problems are growing in many countries. Some
220,000 workers die worldwide every year in work accidents or from
illness contracted at work, the report quoted the International
Labor Organization as saying.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company Claims Blood Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian biotech company said
Wednesday that it has made a breakthrough in sterilizing blood.
</P>
<P>
Walter Dermott, chief executive of LifeTech Corp., said his
company has used its patented ozone transfusion technology to kill
viruses in blood, without damaging red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based company presented preliminary findings last
week to the Congress of the International Society for Analytical
Cytology in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The company is still about two years away from being able to
test treated blood on humans, Dermott was quoted by today's
Financial Post newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Before LifeTech can receive a go-ahead from Canada's Health
Protection Branch or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it
must complete pre-clinical trials proving the process is safe, and
clinical trials proving it is effective, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that Canadians fear transfusions more
than surgery. Given a choice, only 7 percent of Canadians would
accept a transfusion using blood from the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization figures show 120 million units of
blood are collected each year worldwide. And LifeTech's rival
companies such as Boston-based Hemasure Inc. are also working on
blood sterilization techniques.

<HEADLINE> Suspected IRA Bomb Seen as Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A partially exploded bomb at the
Hammersmith Bridge in London may have been the largest amount of
high explosives ever planted in Britain, police said today.
</P>
<P>
Two devices found in a box the size of a briefcase contained
upwards of 30 lbs of high explosives.
</P>
<P>
Two small explosions occurred about 2300 hours Wednesday night,
but the main devices had not been ignited and no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the bomb was suspected to be planted by
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) on the 80th anniversary of the
Easter uprising against British rule in Dublin in 1918.
</P>
<P>
It is considered that the bomb planted also marked the third
anniversary of a huge blast in the financial district of London,
which killed one person and caused millions of pounds worth of
damage.
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts were quoted as saying that the bomb may have been
intended as an IRA warning to the British government on the
Northern Ireland peace process and was never meant to go off.
</P>
<P>
The two small blasts took place only hours after Gerry Adams,
leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, announced that his
party had decided to take part in the elections in Ulster
scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator with the
British government Martin McGuinness stressed that there would be
no new IRA cease-fire as demanded by the British government unless
Sinn Fein and the IRA were convinced that there were going to be
real and meaningful negotiations on the future of the
conflict-torn Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The two explosions Wednesday night was the second IRA attack in
a week and the sixth since the IRA's 17-month cease-fire ended on
February 9.

<HEADLINE> Report: US Students Increase Science, Math Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
increased science and math education in recent years, with
elementary students spending more time on science and math and
more college students receiving engineering and science degrees.
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation in a research report released
Wednesday said that U.S. students have improved their performance
on math and science achievement tests over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a variety of national studies and surveys
through 1993, said that between 1977 and 1993, the amount of time
elementary teachers allocated to science and math rose. In grades
one through three, the average math time rose from 40 minutes to
50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, only 15 percent of states required high school
students to complete two or more years of math, but in 1992, the
percentage increased to 90, though the states' requirements still
remained below the four years of science and math recommended by
national standards.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the percentage of high school
graduates earning math and science course credit rose between 1982
and 1992 and the number of women receiving bachelar's degrees in
science and engineering has increased in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the research has also found that more white and Asian
students are likely than black or Hispanic students to take
advanced science or math courses. Blacks earned only 6 percent and
Hispanics received 4 percent of all the degrees in 1991.

<HEADLINE> UK Finance Minister Warns Referendum Party's Supporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke warned Eurosceptic members of parliament
within his Tory party and newspaper editors today that they were
playing a dangerous game by backing Sir James Goldsmith, leader of
the Referendum party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC radio, the finance minister argued that the
ultimate aim of the Referendum party and the Eurosceptics was to
secure a British withdrawal from the European Union, not to make
proposals to improve the 15-state club.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said that Goldsmith had "maverick" views on Britain's
relationship with the EU, such as trade.
</P>
<P>
He shared the view of Prime Minister John Major, saying that it
would be a "folly" for Britain to pull out of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Major defended the EU at the annual convention of Britain's
Institute of Directors Wednesday, saying that he did not seek
confrontation with it.
</P>
<P>
Referendum parch chief Goldsmith is still stepping up pressure
on the Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
He pledged Wednesday to keep his plan to fund 600 candidates in
contesting the seats with Tories in the next general election
scheduled for May 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sales Growth Forecast for Chips Slashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Dataquest Inc., a research firm
of the electronic industry, slashed its forecast for worldwide
semiconductor sales growth this year to less than 8 percent from
22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it is a discouraging sign for the chip industry.
The change stemmed from excess inventories, a sharp fall in memory
chip prices and the U.S. dollar's resurgence against the yen,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that DRAM, a type of memory heavily used
in computers, accounts for about a third of the semiconductor
industry's output, and prices are generally expected to fall 50
percent to 60 percent this year, because of over supplies. Memory
chips now cost about half what they did last October.
</P>
<P>
However, the company said, the fact that chip unit sales
haven't plunged as much as the dollar volume was a sign that
personal computer sales growth remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor manufacturers revenue climbed 37 percent in 1995,
becoming a 150 billion-U.S.-dollar industry worldwide. The company
predicts the industry will more than double in size to 309 billion
U.S. dollars in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. and Japan's
Casio Corp. agreed to work together on a new category of
consumer-electronic devices, a new indication of the software
giant's plan to move beyond personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported here today that they are
planning to develop both hand-held computers and appliance-like
products that can swap data with PCs running Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
They will combine each other's expertise in developing the new
gadgets, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Hand-held computers have proved a difficult task, the paper
said. Apple Computer Inc.'s products hit the market with little
success, partly because of problems in handwriting recognition.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the company has to develop small, but fast and
effective software for hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
Japan's consumer products companies have established a series
of alliances to get closer to U.S. leaders in PC technology, such
as Sony Corp.'s arrangement with Intel Corp. to develop a home
computing appliance, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Hewlett-Packard Co., a printer and
computer maker of the U.S., also sells hand-held devices that
can swap data with Windows PCs.

<HEADLINE> US House Blocks Bid to Raise Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Divided along party lines, the
Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives today blocked
an attempt by Democrats to force legislation to the floor to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 220-200.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration put out a plan earlier this year
seeking to raise the current hourly minimum wage from 4.25 dollars
to 5.15 dollars over two years. Republicans have been forced on
the defensive on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that the current minimum wage is at a level that
supporters say will soon be at a 40-year low in purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans were accusing the Democrats of "playing
politics" on the matter in the election year, asking why Democrats
had neglected the rising when they controlled both the U.S. Senate
and House.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and House Majority Leader Dick
Armey Wednesday virtually ruled out scheduling such a vote this
year and said Republicans would propose other measures to raise
take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
Democrats used a routine parliamentary motion to try and
overrule the GOP leadership. Their attempt drew the support of 186
Democrats, 13 Republicans and independent Bernard Sanders of
Vermont. Voting against the motion were 216 Republicans and four
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Democrats led by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
are also pressing for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
thus far has maneuvered to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich and Armey said they would advance their own
legislation, probably this summer, that would "increase take-home
pay, stimulate economic growth and raise the standard of living of
hard-working American families."

MAPUTO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Defence Minister
Aguiar Mazula has denied the allegation that Renamo general
Mateus Ngonhamo will be lowered from his army rank of
lieutenant general to major general.
</P>
<P>
Ngonhamo, as an opposition Renamo member, is serving as a
deputy chief of general staff in the Mozambican national defence
army.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique Information Agency reported today that Aguiar
was reacting to the remarks made on Tuesday by Renamo leader
Afonso Dhlakama about the Renamo general's possible demotion.
</P>
<P>
The army has never received any directives of the kind from
its commander in chief, President Joaquim Chissano, the defence
minister said.
</P>
<P>
But the army does have a plan to promote the rank of Chief of
General Staff Lagos Lidimo, who is a member of the ruling
Frelimo, so as to show difference from other army generals, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Ngonhamo complained that there are too many high ranking
generals in the 12000-strong defence army and that a
restructuring will be needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- British industry's confidence
dipped for the fourth consecutive quarter and factories shed jobs
at the fastest rate since April 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest quarterly industrial trends survey from
the Conferation of British Industry (CBI), manufacturers have been
facing the slowest growth in exports since the Autumn of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that manufacturing activity has failed to pick
up and is now at a standstill, with output and total new orders
flat, business confidence continuing to fall and employment in
manufacturing falling at its sharpest rate for two years.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that 16,000 people had lost their jobs in
manufacturing in the first three months of this year after a fall
of 12,000 in the final three months of last year. It expected a
further 11,000 jobs to be lost in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of 1,225 companies, 25 percent of
manufacturers said output volume was up over the last four months,
which was matched by 25 percent reporting reduced output.
</P>
<P>
The balance of zero is the first time there has been no net
growth since October 1993.

LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A new round of rows on Europe
within the British Conservatives has erupted as Prime Minister
John Major launched a fierce defense of the European Union by
attacking the Eurosceptics in his party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual convention of the Institute of
Directors, Major flatly dismissed the notion made by the
Eurosceptics that Britain should withdraw from the 15-state club.
</P>
<P>
Britain should stay on in Europe, Major said, adding that he
did not seek confrontation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in recent years, more and more countries in
Europe, including some of the most prosperous, decided to join the
EU. If Britain were outside the EU, the national interest of
Britain would have been severely hit.
</P>
<P>
He described the Eurosceptics as living in "cloud-cuckoo-land".
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here today, 66 Tory members of
parliament showed disdain for the EU by backing a personal bill
made by a backbencher Duncan Smith to limit the power of the
European Court of Justice in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Leading Eurosceptics like John Redwood, former Welsh secretary,

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Calls for Coalition to Back Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today called for the formation of a powerful
coalition of "democratic" and "centrist" forces in support of
President Boris Yeltsin in running for a second term of office in
June elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third congress of the "Our Home Is Russia" (NDR)
movement, Chernomyrdin, also the leader of the NDR, described it
as the "chief objective" for the "democrats" and "centrists" to
win the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the time now to compete to see who is the biggest
democrat or centrist in the country," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the tightening of the political struggle in the
next few weeks and spoke against belief in easy victory. In
running the Russian presidency, Yeltsin faces a strong challenge
at least from Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NDR's 10 million active supporters will vote
for Yeltsin as a representative of the 21st-century Russia and for
the completion of reforms for the first time in a century.
</P>
<P>
In the next few weeks, Chernomyrdin said, the NDR should
concentrate its efforts on campaigning for Yeltsin. Among
priority tasks in the near future, he named guarantees of
stability in the economy, a reform of the armed forces, and the
transformation of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading
industrialized nations into a G-8 involving Russia.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone President Vows To Probe Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 25 (Xinhua) - President Tejan Kabbah today
promised to investigate rebel claims that the government forces
are violating the ceasefire agreement which expired and was
extended three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The president made the pledge after his talks with rebel
leader Foday Sankoh in Cote D'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing at State House, Kabbah said he is
investigating the claim of "some breach on our part and will
communicate back to Sankoh."
</P>
<P>
Military officials said they "cannot immediately confirm the
claim" as the Rotifunk area in the south where the violation is
said to have taken place is linked by poor communications with
the capital.
</P>
<P>
"We have already set up a machinery to find out as soon as we
were informed of the claim," one senior officer said.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said the claim "should not be instantly
dismissed as there is a possibility that some violation may have
taken place by overzealous soldiers opposed to the current
coziness to the rebels."
</P>
<P>
"There might have been some violation but definitely not of
the magnitude the rebels are claiming," observed a West African
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies in the capital said they have not "received

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today said that Tanzania's policy was to have a
small but well equipped defense force.
</P>
<P>
Discussing with former president of Costa Rica Dr. Oscar Arias
at the State House here today, President Mkapa said a small army
was better for a state not only for cost reduction but for a
defense force that could be well cared for.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arias is heading a campaign for de-militarization in
developing countries under the Arias Foundation for Peace and
Human Progress. He is currently touring sub-Saharan African
states as part of his world-wide crusade.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president reaffirmed that part of the country's
strategy is to ensure peace in the region by reducing the need of
maintaining large army in the area.
</P>
<P>
The former Costa Rican president's mission also includes
persuading rich countries to reduce shipments of arms to
developing countries and assist in the funding of
de-militarization measures.

<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's retail sales rose by
just 0.2 percent in March, much less than most observers'
expectation of a rise of around double that.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report today, February's sales increase,
however, was revised upwards to 0.8 percent from 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In year-on-year terms, sales were 2.2 percent higher in March,
after February's 2.1 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Food sales increased by a marginal 0.1 percent last month. But
clothing and footwear sales rose by a sharp 1.0 percent and sales
of household goods by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The relatively modest retail sales growth in March has
heightened hopes of a further easing of UK interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that there were no signs of overheating on the
high street and a rate cut in May or June "is still on the cards".

UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Thursday expressed concern over the situation in Abkhazia,
Georgia, which it said had adverse impact on the humanitarian
situation and economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the parties, particular the Abkhaz side, to
achieve substantive progress without further delay.
</P>
<P>
The council, in a presidential statement, reaffirmed its full
support for the efforts of the U.N. secretary-general, its envoy
and of the Russian Federation as facilitator aimed at achieving a
comprehensive political settlement of the conflict that broke out
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Both the United Nations and Russia are trying to help the
Georgian government and the rebel Abkhaz side to agree on the
political status of Abkhazia and the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
While rebel Abkhaz side has agreed to stay in Georgia, it
insisted that the two parties should get reunited as one under
a confederation system instead of federation system.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Abkhaz side continues to obstruct the
return of refugees it previously drove out from Abkhazia and lay
mines in Gali, a U.N.-monitored region between the government
troops and the Abkhaz rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The council calls upon the parties to take all measures in
their power to prevent it," the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) - In tiny Cangnan County, in east
China's Zhejiang Province, some 500 rural households, most from
townships with a highly developed private economy, have used
lawyers to help them avoid some two million yuan in losses.
</P>
<P>
Hiring lawyers to defend them, it seems, has become something
of a fad among the farmers of the county.
</P>
<P>
Most of them used to know very little about the law and often
fell prey to some cunning businessmen who took advantage of the
formers' ignorance of the law through the convenience of
unscrupulous contracts.
</P>
<P>
The situation started to change when the notion of the
socialist market economy began to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
Chen Renhua, a farmer from Linxi Township in the county, filed
a lawsuit against a company from whom he had purchased some bad
seeds. With the help of a local lawyer, he soon not only got his
money back, but was paid compensation for other losses as well.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a lawyer helped a farmer from Yanting
Township, who discovered that the cement he had just bought for
building houses was of poor quality, to get 5,000 yuan in
compensation from the manufacturer.

Talking to newsmen at the first-ever Iranian Industrial

<HEADLINE> Ford Orders Biggest Recall to Repair Faulty Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co., the second
largest car maker in the U.S., ordered Thursday its biggest recall
ever -- 8.7 million passenger cars and trucks -- to fix an
ignition-switch problem that could create electrical fires.
</P>
<P>
This would also be the largest U.S. safety recall yet by a
single auto maker. It involves 10 Ford and Lincoln Mercury models
built between 1988 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Experts said huge losses could have been avoided had both the
company and the government taken active measures in the earlier
1990s.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1990, Ford Motor had begun paying special attention
to mysterious fires in some of its vehicles, fires that started in
the steering column near the ignition key.
</P>
<P>
There have been 1,100 unconfirmed reports of ignition fires in
the U.S. and about 900 more in Canada, Ford said. The incidents
have resulted in no deaths and only a few minor injuries, as the
short-circuit appeared to occur often when the vehicle was parked.
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit demands Ford recall a total of 23 million vehicles
built between 1984 and 1993, which would affect a wider range of
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said had the early concern about the switches been
translated into a quick recall, or government investigators been
more aggressive when they looked into the problem, hundreds of car
blazes could have been prevented, uncounted garages and homes
could have been spared, and Ford could have saved lots of money in
repairs and damage settlements.
</P>
<P>
Ford said it will cost the company up to 50 U.S. dollars a
vehicle, but it did not wish all the car owners to respond. Some
analysts said the recall will cost the No. 2 auto maker about
300 million U.S. dollars, some of which can be shared by the
switch supplier.

<HEADLINE> Largest Oil Well Set Ablaze in Chechen Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- One of Chechnya's largest and most
profitable oil wells was set ablaze overnight and is losing an
average 2,500 tonnes of oil a day, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The "Groznenskaya" well, in the southern outskirts of the
capital of Grozny, burst into flames after an unknown gunman
opened fire at it with a machine-gun, and the burning oil is
gushing dozens of meters high, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth oil well in Chechnya which has been set on
fire recently. The first three were the "Dubaiskaya" well, near
Grozny, and two wells in the Tersk and the Sunzha mountains.
</P>
<P>
Fires at the four wells are costing the Chechen republic
300,000-U.S.-dollars worth of oil daily, the Itar-Tass added.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets Hong Kong Chief Secretary in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, met with
visiting Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang here
today.
</P>
<P>
Issues of common concern, including cooperation between the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) and the British Hong Kong government, the civil
service, and economy were discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They both agreed that maintaining the stability of transition
and the smooth transfer of power is the common aspiration of both
sides, and that the two sides should increase cooperation in the
remaining days.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the Chinese government has made great efforts for
a stable transition and smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are some divergences between China and Britain,
we hope the two countries will handle them properly and prudently
through cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government will by no means have a second
power center appear in Hong Kong, and that each arrangement made
by the Preparatory Committee is for the normal operation of the
SAR after July 1, 1997, and there will be no interference in the
British Hong Kong administration before July 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lu also expressed the belief that Hong Kong's civil servants
will remain in their office and devote themselves to serving the
Hong Kong residents. "they can continue to make a contribution to
Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted about two hours. Before the meeting,
Ms. Chan presented a Chinese-style painting, done by her mother,
to Lu Ping, saying that the landscape in the painting symbolizes
hopes for the smooth transition.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebel Commanders Meet to Divide Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist field
commanders are meeting today in a mountain village in southern
Chechnya to divide up "authority and spheres of influence" among
themselves, Russian military commander in Chechnya Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency today.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day closed-door meeting, the rebel commanders
will also discuss plans for continued military resistance against
Moscow and may decide to step up action against Russian forces,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first since the death of rebel leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev on Sunday night, is chaired by his successor Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev.
</P>
<P>
It is attended by Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff of the
separatist forces, and Shamil Basayev, who led a hostage-taking
attack on Budyonnovsk in southern Russia last June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Emil Payin, head of the working group of Russia's
State Commission on Resolving the Chechen Crisis, stressed that
the Russian leadership's strategy in Chechnya is to resolve the
crisis through talks, regardless of whether Dudayev is dead or
alive.
</P>
<P>
Payin, who is also a member of the Presidential Council, said
after a meeting in the Kremlin that Dudayev's death is not a fact
until a registry office issues his death certificate.
</P>
<P>
Whether Dudayev is dead or not, he said, it "adds to
uncertainty of the Chechen situation." But he stressed that there
is no alternative to President Boris Yeltsin's peace plan.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India Ready for First Phase of Polling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 160 million Indian voters
in 14 states and union territories will cast their ballots
tomorrow for 150 seats of the 11th Lok Sabha (house of the people)
and 532 seats of five state assemblies in the first phase of the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, the Election Commission and law and
order machinery have made all possible arrangements to ensure free
and fair polls while thousands of preventive arrests have been
made, paramilitary forces deployed and inter-state borders sealed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commission has appointed 1,500 general observers
and election expenditure observers across the country to monitor
possible violation of the code of conduct and the ceiling
expenditures imposed on the election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
In Delhi, where over eight million voters will exercise their
franchise for seven parliamentary seats tomorrow, about 33,000
security personnel would watch to ensure free and fair polling.
</P>
<P>
While over 21,000 Delhi police personnel and home guards would
be deployed in 9,106 polling stations, as many as 1,754
paramilitary forces will keep strict vigils on hundreds of
sensitive booths.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a total of 1,325 additional wireless stations have
been put into operation in the capital to provide effective
communication for both election and security.
</P>
<P>
For Lok Sabha elections, over 3,330 candidates are ready to be
voted in tomorrow's polls, which will cover all the seats in Assam
(14), Himachal pradesh (4), Haryana (10), Kerala (20), Punjab
(13), Delhi (7) and Union territories of Chandigarh (1),
Pondicherry (1), Lakshadweep (1) and Andaman and Nicobar islands
(1).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, partial polling will be held for 25 out of 39 seats
in Tamil Nadu, 21 out of 42 in Andhra pradesh, 17 out of 28 seats
in Karnataka, and 15 out of 25 seats in Rajasthan.
</P>
<P>
For assemblies (state parliaments), polling will be held for
150 seats in Tamil Nadu out of 234 while it will be a full polling
in Assam (122), Haryana (90), Kerala (140) and Pondicherry (30).
</P>
<P>
Prominent politicians among those whose electoral fortunes
would be decided in the first phase include Prime Minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao and a number of sitting cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
In view of the Supreme Court's recent directive to curb
election expenditures, campaigning for the first phase of the
polls which ended on Thursday has turned out to be unusually
lackluster.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the low-key campaigning, the Election
Commission has appealed to the voters to ensure a "high turnout"
for the first phase of the polls and asked the state-owned
electronic media to launch a "voter awareness campaign" to educate
the masses.

<HEADLINE> Five Nations' Spokesmen Answer Border Agreement Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Spokesmen for China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan and Tajikistan answered reporters'
question this evening on the agreement on confidence-building in
the military field in border areas that was just signed.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Jiang Zemin of China, Boris Yeltsin of Russia,
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrghyzstan,
and Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan signed the agreement at a
ceremony in Shanghai this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, the Chinese spokesman, said that the agreement,
which is the result of years of negotiations, is not meant to be
directed against any third party, nor does it mean that China is
forming an alliance with the four nations.
</P>
<P>
Instead, China is willing to cooperate with all its neighbours,
and the document is a concrete demonstration of China's
independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the agreement is not one of increasing trust
among the military forces of the five nations, but of the military
forces and frontier guards stationed on either side of the
boundary line between China and the four nations.
</P>
<P>
The Russian spokesman said that the agreement clearly states
that armed forces from the five nations should increase
cooperation and trust instead of provoking each other. He said
that the five nations will continue their negotiations on
disarmament in border areas.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakhstan spokesman said that the agreement follows a
prolonged period of negotiations between the five nations on
something as sensitive as military affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Kyrghyzstan spokesman said that there are no difficult
problems left to resolve along the boundary between his country
and China, because the two countries have sound cooperation in
that area.
</P>
<P>
The Tajikistan spokesman said that the agreement is the
beginning of a great process, and the five nations will continue
their negotiations and cooperation on boundary issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mali Embarks on Road of Peace and Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAMAKO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Mali has
embarked on a road of peace and development following its
successful implementation of a readjustment plan and an
end to a civil war which lasted almost six years.
</P>
<P>
The country, listed as one of the least developed nations,
successfully reshaped its economy through a three-year
readjustment plan ending in 1995, with its revenues considerably
increased and its inflation rate drastically lowered.
</P>
<P>
Economists here attributed the remarkable progress to the
government's effective restructuring program and its fruitful
efforts to achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, priority was given to developing
agriculture, stepping up enterprise privatization and improving
the management of financial and taxation affairs.
</P>
<P>
A successful peace process, which followed a peace initiative
by President Alpha Oumar Konare in 1994, formally ended an almost
six-year-old rebellion of the Touareg tribe in early 1996, thus
giving a guarantee to the smooth implementation of the economic
revitalization program.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that Mali's economy grew by 5.2
percent in 1995, on top of an increase of 2.3 percent in 1994,
when the country reversed the trend of negative growth for years.
</P>
<P>
The revenues in the year reached 177 billion African francs
(350 million U.S. dollars), 18.3 billion (36 million U.S. dollars)
more than budgeted.
</P>
<P>
The government predicts it will probably no longer need
billions of foreign financial subsidies as of 1997, of which
France provides the bulk. Considering its improving financial
conditions, France already reduced its subsidies to Mali from 15
billion African francs (30 million U.S. dollars) in 1994 to 10
billion (20 million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has paid up years of back wages to
its civil servants and part of its domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to substantial increases in the exports of lint cotton,
its first foreign exchange earner, livestock and gold, Mali had
managed to achieve a balanced foreign trade during the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the improving economic situation, Mali led
the 14-nation African Franc Zone in curbing inflation, with the
inflation rate diving to less than 8 percent in 1995 from 40
percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Steady and sufficient supplies of daily necessities as a result
of bumper agricultural harvests did much in bringing down prices,
which had sky-rocketed since the African franc was drastically
devalued in early 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mali's economic recovery has won commendation from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which pledged in April to give
the country a new loan of 91 million U.S. dollars for its second
three-year restructuring program beginning 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, large numbers of foreign investors are arriving in
this mineral-rich western African nation, after a law was
promulgated recently to offer impressive preferential treatment
for overseas investment in the mining industry.

the country's aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony and an exhibition are part of a series of
festivities that started last week, marking the 45th anniversary
of China's aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the industry say that China is working hard to
expand its plane manufacturing, to catch up with the rapid growth
in air transportation, which has seen an average annual increase
of over 20 percent, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The major Chinese commercial aircraft at present are the Y-7,
Y-8, and Y-12.
</P>
<P>
The 50-seat Y-7 was the first Chinese commercial aviation
aircraft, and has been used on over 100 domestic routes since
1984. The Y-12 is a multi-purpose plane that has become the pride
of the industry as the sole Chinese plane to be certified by the
British and Americans, and has been exported to many countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Chinese aircraft manufacturers have been doing
assembly work on 35 of McDonnell Douglas MD-82/83s, five of which
have returned to the US.
</P>
<P>
At present, production is underway on the MD-90, which is
expected to have an unprecedented localization rate of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has worked out a plan for a 2-billion-US-dollar project
to develop a new 100-seat passenger plane, the "Air
Express". Major Western manufacturers, such as Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas, and the European Consortium Airbus Industrie,
have expressed an interest in it.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, a letter of intent was signed in Paris
between the China Aviation Industry Corporation and France's
Aerospatiale, with details to be settled in June.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to a Beijing exhibition of aircraft engines this
afternoon, General Liu Huaqing praised researchers and workers in
the industry for their outstanding contributions to the country's
economic development and national defense.
</P>
<P>
General Liu is a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, and also the vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, in Shenyang, a military aircraft manufacturing
center in northeast China's Liaoning Province, the J8IIM fighter,
one of the country's most advanced warplanes, made its initial
flight.
</P>
<P>
China's aviation industry in the past 45 years has produced
some 13,000 military planes, 1,400 civil aviation planes, over
5,000 aircraft engines, and other related equipment.

<HEADLINE> Three New CJD Cases Found in Mad Cow Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) --- Three more people have developed
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in the southern English town of
Ashford, where mad cow disease was first identified, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims are men: 29-year-old woodcutter Barry Baker
and 36-year-old fireman Graham Brown. A brain biopsy has confirmed
that one of them is suffering from a new variant of CJD which
affects the young.
</P>
<P>
The third victim, a woman aged 59, is thought to have the
strain of CJD that affects older people.
</P>
<P>
CJD is the human equivalent of mad cow disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which has been found in British
cattle and is thought to have entered the food chain to affect
humans. Both are fatal degenerative brain diseases for which there
is no cure.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been 14 confirmed and suspected cases of the
new variant of CJD.
</P>
<P>
A fourth patient from the same area, a 29-year-old woman
solicitor, died of CJD last month.
</P>
<P>
An Ashford veterinary surgeon, Colin Whitaker, diagnosed the
first case of mad cow disease in cattle in 1985. The alleged link
between BSE in cattle and CJD in humans recently triggered a
Europe-wide scare over the safety of British beef.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Works Towards Liberalized Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has promised to work
with more countries to look for opportunities to achieve a
liberalized global telecommunication market.
</P>
<P>
Communication Minister Mah Bow Tan said here today that such a
move will complement other efforts to open up the market.
</P>
<P>
This includes an earlier announcement that Singapore will
license additional operators by 2002, five years ahead of the
original deadline of 2007, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that with the almost explosive technological
development, the telecommunication industry was forced to open up
at a rate faster than anyone could have envisaged.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Internet and the impending introduction of
global mobile communication services would offer seamless,
cross-border personal communications, he said, adding that such
technological developments would increasingly globalize
competition in telecommunications and render territorial
demarcations meaningless.
</P>
<P>
He said, therefore, Singapore must keep up with and respond to
the changes happening in the global telecommunications market, so
as to face the increasing globalization of competition and exploit
the expanding opportunities available.
</P>
<P>
"This way, Singapore can continue to have the best
telecommunication services provided at the most competitive
prices," he said.

<HEADLINE> Article to Mark "Wang-Koo Talks" Issued (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A signed article was issued in
Beijing today to mark the third anniversary of the first round of
"Wang-Koo talks".
</P>
<P>
The article, by Qing Yuan, reviews and comments on routine
negotiations between both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In the article, the Taiwan authorities are urged to truly give
up their attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"
and return to the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way, can the conditions and atmosphere for the
resumption of the negotiations between the two sides be created,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
The unofficial organizations from the two sides of the straits,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on
the mainland and the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in Taiwan
which are authorized to conduct the negotiations, successfully
conducted the first round of the talks between their leaders Wang
Daohan and Koo Chen-Fu three years ago, the article recalled.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the Taiwan authorities had to agree to hold the
second round of the "Wang-Koo talks", thanks to the efforts
jointly made by the compatriots of the two sides of the straits,
as well as the ARATS and the SEF, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The first preliminary consultations, held in Taipei last May,
signaled that the second round of the talks would give more
impetus to the development of the relations across the straits, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The six points of common understanding reached at the meeting
demonstrated that the negotiations between the ARATS and the SEF
would be more concerned with the topics of policy rather than
those of the general affairs and economy, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, a leader of the Taiwan authorities had already made
plans to undermine the relations across the straits, when he had
to agree to hold the second round of the "Wang-Koo talks", the
article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Despite the oppositions of all the Chinese people, he hastily
went to the United States last June and engaged himself in the
separatist activities by creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", it said.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the "Wang-Koo talks", therefore, had to be
postponed and negotiations at other levels between the ARATS and
the SEF also had to be stopped temporarily, the article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Presidents Nursultan Nazarbayev
of Kazakhstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrghyzstan, and Emomali Rakhmonov
of Tajikistan are here to join the signing of an agreement
on military forces in border areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin told the three presidents that
today is an important day for ties between China and their three
countries and Russia, and that it is the outcome of years of
negotiations by the five countries. It will also help increase the
trust between the peoples and armed forces of the five nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will improve security and stability in border
areas of the five countries and is conducive to good-neighborly
relations and friendship between China and the four countries, and
provides a good example for neighborly relationship among
Asian-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents spoke highly of China's contributions to
peace and stability in Asia, and said that the agreement shows the
great determination of the Chinese government to achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
They said that they are willing to cooperate with China in
making joint efforts to safeguard peace and stability in the

<HEADLINE> Article to Mark "Wang-Koo Talks" Issued (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At present, the Taiwan authorities' attempts to split China
suffered a heavy blow. The leader of the Taiwan authorities
repeatedly expressed his hope to improve the relationship between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, in an attempt to shake off
pressure, the article said.
</P>
<P>
More than once some personages concerned within the Taiwan
authorities have expressed their willingness to resume the
"Wang-Koo talks" and negotiations between the ARATS and the SEF,
it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan authorities' words are not enough, more
attention should be focused on their deeds, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits long for the
development of relationships between the two sides, hoping that
the negotiations between the ARATS and the SEF will promote the
development of relationships between the two sides and the
peaceful reunification of the motherland, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS has consistently insisted on promoting the
negotiation process between the ARATS and the SEF, under the "one
China" principle.
</P>
<P>
However, the article said that the historical experience from
the past three years of the negotiations between the ARATS and the
SEF and the cross-straits relations shows that the Taiwan
authorities lack sincerity to settle general affairs between the
two sides, instead, they make use of negotiations between the
ARATS and the SEF to create "separate ruling" and a false
impression of "detente" of cross-straits relations, in a move to
support and cover up their activities of creating "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan" in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the article noted, before Taiwan authorities truly
give up their attempts to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", and truly return to the "one China" principle, general
affairs between the two sides could not be satisfactorily solved.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that the Taiwan authorities might utilize
the resumption of negotiations between the ARATS and SEF as a
cover-up to deceive compatriots on both sides of the Straits who
hope for detente and improvements of cross-straits relations, in a
bid to continue disguising their splitting activities in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
Whether the prospect of negotiations between the ARATS and the
SEF would be gloomy or promising depends on the next step from the
Taiwan authorities, it said.
</P>
<P>
On negotiations between the ARATS and the SEF over the past
three years, the article pointed out that the "one China"
principle is the basis of the negotiations, adding that the ARATS
has safeguarded the "one China" principle by fighting resolutely
against the attempts of creating "separate ruling" by the Taiwan
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Gene Is Driving Force Of Life: British Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Life's driving force lies not in
religion, poetry or politics but in genes, Oxford Professor
Richard Dawkins said in a lecture here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mankind, like all species alive on Earth, exists simply as a
means of perpetuating its genes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What are all of us but self-reproducing robots?" he asked. "We
have been put together by our genes and what we do is roaming the
world looking for a way to sustain ourselves and ultimately
produce another robot, a child."
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, a reader in zoology at New College, Oxford University,
made the remarks at a forum to promote his new book, Climbing
Mount Improbable, published by Viking.
</P>
<P>
He said critics had asked him that if life was really as
purposeless as he claimed, why did he bother to get up in the
morning. "I have been accused of being bleak and cold," he said,
"And there is a sense in which life is viciously pointless."
</P>
<P>
But he said he saw redemption in the explanatory power of
science, which, he said, had opened our eyes on a sumptuous world.
</P>
<P>
"I think that a noble and grown-up way to spend our time in the
sun is to try to understand the universe and our place in it," he
said, adding that he sometimes felt science was the only
supportable occupation.
</P>
<P>
Dawkins' new book aims to answer the question of how the chance
events of evolution could have produced the complexity of life. He
does so with a metaphor.
</P>
<P>
At the summit of his Mount Improbable is a fully developed
species, or a complex organ like the eye, and to reach it by a
series of random mutations appears impossible. But it is not if
the summit is approached by an easy route, step by step, as
Dawkin's theory of evolution by natural selection prescribes.
</P>
<P>
"Each step is a mutation, small enough to be countenanced.
Eventually the summit can be reached. The sheer height doesn't
matter so long as you don't try to climb it in a single bound," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a consolation to those depressed by his philosophy, he
offered the reflection that they should consider themselves lucky
to be alive at all, since of all the millions of sperm, only one
can form an embryo.
</P>
<P>
"Think of the composers greater than Beethoven, the scientists
greater than Newton and the poets greater than Donne who were
never lucky enough to be born," he said. "In the face of these
stupendous odds, it is we who are here and we should be glad."

<HEADLINE> Fight Against Illegal Futures Trading in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- There are cases of units or
individuals in China handling futures orders illegally in the name
of a legal company, some misleading and cheating clients, or
failing to send the orders to market.
</P>
<P>
"Those illegal activities seriously disrupt China's financial
order and the experiment in futures trading," a spokesman with the
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the securities
watchdog, said here recently.
</P>
<P>
China is cracking down on illegal foreign exchange futures
trading and foreign exchange margin transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1994, the CSRC, the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, and
the Ministry of Public Security have come up with several
documents saying that it is illegal when domestic institutions
engage in these actions," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts by these departments have almost eliminated the
illegal activities. "Recently, however, some units and individuals
are still involved in futures and margin trading in foreign
exchanges," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The State Council has never approved any unit for futures and
margin tradings in foreign exchanges for clients, and those
activities are in violation of the law, and all those parties
involved are not protected by the law," the spokesman emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He urged local futures administrations to cooperate with local
foreign exchange administrations, and industry and commerce
administrations, as well as public security departments to take
action and make checks in this.
</P>
<P>
"Those activities should be punished and stopped once and for
all," he said. "Those institutions which continue with the illegal
activities, will have their earnings confiscated and face heavy
fines."
</P>
<P>
"We should not let them benefit economically in any way, and
their licenses will be suspended if the illegality of their
actions is serious enough," he said.

MACAO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 passengers have
arrived or left Macao via the Macao International Airport since
its inauguration last November, according to a local newspaper
report.
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper reported that passenger flow in the
airport has kept growing over the past five months, with the

November.
</P>
<P>
Among the passengers coming to Macao, about 70 percent are from
Taiwan, 10 percent from South Korea, eight percent from Shanghai
and six percent from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A top executive of the airport authority said passenger growth
in the early years after the opening of the airport will be slow
because of the small size of Macao and its limited population.
</P>
<P>
But he said the airport holds out much hope in the future.

<HEADLINE> HK Boosts Tourism in Cooperation With Inland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's tourism industry
will maintain its develop momentum beyond 1997 and cooperation
between Hong Kong and China's inland in promoting tourism will be
further enhanced, said Lo Yuk Sui, chairman of the Hong Kong
Tourist Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua this week, Lo said the
HKTA's strategy is to position Hong Kong as the hub of travel into
and out of China's inland through close cooperation with its
tourism departments and organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year Hong Kong received a total of 10.2
million visitors, of whom some 30 percent were in transit to or
from the inland.
</P>
<P>
"To boost further cooperation between Hong Kong and the
inland, we are planning to set up an office in Beijing in the
near future, for which the application has already been submitted
to related departments in the inland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's tourism industry has been growing steadily in the
past few years. In 1995 when most economic sectors in Hong Kong
slowed down, tourist arrivals maintained a growth rate of 9.3
percent over 1994 to a record high of 10.2 million.
</P>
<P>
For several years tourism has been the territory's
second-biggest foreign exchange earner, and last year it turned in
75 billion HK dollars (9.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"It is expected to exceed clothing industry to become the No.1
foreign exchange earner in the coming few years," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the tourism industry will be able to maintain
an annual growth rate of five to seven percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the New Airport slated to be completed in 1998 will
greatly improve tourist passage facilities while the extension
project of the Convention and Exhibition Center is expected to
attract more business tourists.
</P>
<P>
"The HKTA is confident that after 1997 tourism will continue
to grow with great vitality," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges 9.1 Million Dollars for Togolese Refugees' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Friday appealed for some 9.1
million U.S. dollars for the repatriation of some 100,000
Togolese refugees now living Ghana and Benin.
</P>
<P>
The yearlong project began Friday in Ghana with the initial
repatriation over two weeks of a group of 9,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR granted each returnee a three-month food ration and 50
dollars in cash to cover the cost of transportation and household
utensils. It is providing transport only for the sick and elderly.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR appeal includes 1.4 million dollars for transportation
and 3.3 million dollars for domestic support.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said most of the Togolese refugees, 75,000 in Ghana
and 26,000 in Benin, are returning to Togolese capital Lome, and
75 percent of them need the UNHCR assistance.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said it is working with the International Organization
for Migration in the project, which followed the spontaneous
return of Togolese refugees.
</P>
<P>
A total of 300,000 Togolese people fled army abuse in 1993 to
Ghana and Benin. Some 200,000 of them have returned to Togo since
the promulgation of an amnesty law there in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
In Ghana, The refugees had settled in villages near the border
with their home country or in UNHCR camps, while in Benin, they
stayed with local families or in government reception centers.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Study On Sewage Disposal to Start in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will initiate a
consultancy study on an environmental impact assessment for
Strategic Sewage Disposal Scheme (SSDS) -- which aims to solve the
problem of water pollution in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today
commissioned the study, which will cost 36 million HK dollars
(4.6 million US dollars), by signing a contract with a local
consultants company.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Chiu, EPD's assistant director, the
consultancy study will result in an early decision on the
implementation of the remaining stages of the SSDS.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Hong Kong government is building a sewage
disposal system, which, when completed in 1997, will provide
treatment to 70 percent of the polluted water now flowing into the
main harbor area.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the problem will not be solved thoroughly until the
full scheme is implemented.
</P>
<P>
The 24-month study will be carried out in two
phases. Researchers will first collect water quality and
ecological data, evaluate the identified treatment and outfall
options and select the best one; then they will provide a
schematic design and a comprehensive environmental impact
assessment of the selected option.

<HEADLINE> Robot to Help Dismantle British Nuclear Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) - A robot will dismantle the
radioactive heart of one of Britain's oldest nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Magnox Electric was named by the British Atomic
Energy Authority on Thursday as the contractor to dismantle the
core of the Windscale Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (WAGR) in the
Sellafield complex in Cumbria, northern England.
</P>
<P>
The contract is worth about 10 million pounds (15.1 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Project WAGR is the Britain's demonstration exercise for
nuclear-station decommissioning and aims to show that a full-sized
nuclear reactor can be taken apart safely, cost-effectively and
with minimal environmental consequences.
</P>
<P>
Much of the early work by Magnox Electric, the part of Nuclear
Electric that remained in the private sector, will prepare the way
for the Remote Dismantling Machine, a robotic manipulator arm that
has been purpose-built at a cost of more than 8 million pounds
(12.08 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The arm's extendible steel mast enables it to maneuver inside
the core of the defunct reactor. A range of attachments can be
fitted to the arm, including an oxy-propane torch capable of
slicing stainless steel. It also carries a remote-controlled
camera.
</P>
<P>
For safety reasons, the operation will be directed from a
separate control room in a nearby administration building.
</P>
<P>
The work so far has cost about 80 million pounds (120.8 million
dollars). Funding comes from the Department of Trade and Industry,
European Commission and the British nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
Low-level waste from the dismantled reactor will be transported
10 miles to British Nuclear Fuels' waste dump at Drigg. The
intermediate-level waste will be stored at a purpose-built
facility on site until a long-term repository, whose location has
yet to be decided, is available.

<HEADLINE> China's Cars With German Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- German automobile giants have
become a driving force in China's auto-industry, with Volkswagen
surpassing most other overseas counterparts in exploring China
market, Dr Herbert Lederle, vice-president of FAW-Volkswagen
Automotive Company, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The company now has two joint ventures in China, with a total
annual production capacity reaching about 400,000 vehicles. The
company has no plans to create more joint ventures at present, but
to focus efforts on expansion of the two existing projects.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Santana, and Jetta produced in Changchun, capital
of northeast China's Jilin Province, are now the most popular
economy cars in China.
</P>
<P>
Data show that the auto industry is one of the country's
economic sectors that have always stayed on a rising curve over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
China's government has listed auto-industry as one of the pillar
sectors of the country's national economy. Shanghai, for example,
will invest 30 billion yuan in the sector over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
No one can imagine what China's market will be with about 1.2
billion potential consumers, Lederle said, And most of the world
giant auto-producers have started operations in China.
</P>
<P>
Walkers nowadays on Beijing's crowded streets can easily name
out the brand of cars produced in Germany, such as Audi, Benz,
Volkswagen, and BMW.
</P>
<P>
The number of Audi 100 cars running on the roads of China has
topped 10,000. A new type of luxury Audi car will also be produced
by FAW-Volkswagen next year.
</P>
<P>
More and more new rich people in Beijing are becoming owners
of the up-market Porche luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
The other Germany-based auto-producers have also established
joint ventures or branch offices in China, and the Sino-German
joint ventures in the sector now are producing a variety of
products, including passenger cars, trucks, sedan cars,
special-use cars, and some auto-parts, Lederle added.
</P>
<P>
Among the auto giants who have successfully got involved in
China is Mercedes-Benz AG, which has permission from the Chinese
government to produce trucks, family cars and chassis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company has established 30 sales offices in the
country's major economic cities, and the company's sales in China
had surpassed 50,000 by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
BMW AG, which got into China market much later than
Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, has established six sales offices in
Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian and so on.
</P>
<P>
As one of the automobile giants that started business early in
China, Volkswagen's two ventures in Shanghai and Changchun now
produce three kinds of cars, including Jetta, Golf and Santana.
Some of cars have been exported to some Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve their economic performance, all of the
joint ventures attached great importance in the upgrading of their
localization, and undertaking training programs for Chinese
employees.
</P>
<P>
Recent data also show that Santana's localization rate reached
89 percent, with Jetta's rate hitting 60 percent by the end of
this year. And Volkswagen also established an advanced training
center in Changchun.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, all of the giant auto-producers have
strengthened their studies on the Chinese market, to increase their
market share in China. Mercedes-Benz and Porche have designed
some cars, catering specially for China's road conditions.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of cooperation with Volkswagen, the First
Automobile Works has put in production a new type of "Hongqi" car,
with a modern fashion. It is the first car that China has
developed independently.

Baghdad in June.
</P>
<P>
The United States was firmly against this plan and had been
pressuring FIDE to change the site.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Riley's Coach Cut in Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The world swimming ruling body
FINA has cut the ban on Scott Volkers from two years to one,
lawyers for the Australian swimming coach of Samantha Riley said
in Sydney on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Volkers is pleased that FINA has decided to accept the
arguments and calls for leniency in his appeal from the original
decision," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
FINA had imposed the two-year ban on Volkers for giving Riley a
headache tablet with a banned substance last December.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ban on Volkers, originally imposed until
Feb. 20, 1998, would now been in force until Feb. 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
World champion Riley, 23, tested positive in the world
short-coruse championships in Brazil last year. She later escaped
from punishment after Volkers took all the blame.
</P>
<P>
Riley only received a "stern warning" from FINA and she is
clear to take part in the Atlanta Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> More Funds for Medical Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Investment in medical science and
technology should amount to five to ten percent of the total sales
volume of the Chinese medical industry by the year 2000, Chinese
State Councillor Song Jian said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a national medical conference, Song Jian said that Chinese
medical companies should upgrade their production techniques and
improve their workers' skills in a bid to maintain a healthy and
sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the investment in new medicine development
only amounts to 0.7 percent of the sales volume of the country's
medical industry, while the world's big medical enterprises
usually pour over 15 percent of their sales earnings into this
field.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the low investment in medical science and
technology the growth of economic returns is very slow in spite of
the booming output volume of the Chinese medical industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of the exported medicine is non-patent
medicine used as raw materials for production and most profit is
earned by the foreign medicine manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Song pointed out that the medical products for export should be
upgraded and restructured, and the medical industry should
introduce GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) in a bid to become
more competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Pharmaceuticals Bureau show that the
output volume of the Chinese medical industry topped 100 billion
yuan-worth and the sales volume totaled 75 billion yuan-worth in
1995. At present, there are nearly 7,000 medical enterprises in
China, and the sales volume of the largest company was more than
two billion yuan-worth last year.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Chinese Have Remains Cremated After Passing Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Over one third of the Chinese
people, who have embraced the tradition of burial for thousands of
years, are now having their remains cremated after death.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Ministry of Civil Affairs say the remains of
more than 2.62 million dead were sent to heaven through
crematoriums in 1995, accounting for 34 percent of those who
passed away.
</P>
<P>
Burying the dead in the ground has been practiced by the
Chinese people from generation to generation, except a few from
ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
And burials have become part of China's cultural and moral
tradition rooted in national psychology.
</P>
<P>
But laying the deceased to rest this way consumes land, timber,
and usually requires a huge expenditure on funeral banquets for
mourners.
</P>
<P>
Corrupt officials even take advantage of the ceremonies for the
dead, by taking "gifts" of money from local people.
</P>
<P>
Balancing all these factors altogether, the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the Chinese government have always been in favor
of replacing burial with cremation, Chinese Minister of Civil
Affairs Doje Cering said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a working conference of the CPC Central Committee on April
27, 1956, 151 top Chinese leaders put forward a signed proposal to
the public to promote cremation, and announced to choose to have
their remains burnt instead of buried after their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
Today, "cremation, as a new scientific, hygienic and economical
way of funeral ceremonies, through the self-exemplary promotion by
top leaders, has been practiced not only by the Communist Party
members, but has also started to be accepted by society as a
whole, and at the same time expanding from cities to rural areas,"
Doje Cering said.
</P>
<P>
"The out-dated, expensive and superstitious practices are being
taken over by civilized and frugal funerals," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 18 years from 1978 to 1995, remains of 30 million dead
were cremated, saving millions of mu (one hectare of land equals
to 15 mu) of land, tens of millions square kilo meters of wood,
and an annual funeral expenditure of billions of yuan, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
To mourn the dead, families now hold memorial meetings instead
of hosting banquets, relatives and friends send floral wreaths
instead of gift money or goods.
</P>
<P>
Starting from late 1980, many organizations promoting cremation
and frugal funerals, created by farmers themselves, have been
spreading across the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, 80-year-old president of the China Association of
Overseas Cultural Exchange and signatory of the cremation
proposal, said that in addition to economic benefits, funeral
reform also helps the Chinese to transform their traditional
concepts, and gives birth to scientific, civilized and a healthy
way of life.
</P>
<P>
And today, with China's land and forestry resources far from
enough, cremation should be further popularized, Doje Cering said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided to raise the ratio of cremation by one
percentage point each year in the next five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
To counter the illegal occupation of arable land, extravagant
spending, superstitious activities and corrupt practices in
funerals, the government has issued a circular to order halt such
problems.
</P>
<P>
It also pledged continued education campaigns to raise the
public awareness on funeral reform.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Vindicated to Challenge EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- British farmers has won the right
to challenge the European Union's (EU) world-wide ban on British
beef exports in the European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court on Thursday gave the British National
Farmers Union (NFU) and other representatives of the meat industry
the go-ahead to take the case to the European Court for an urgent
review of the EU ban on British beef, it is reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mr Justice Turner was quoted as saying: "It is manifestly a
case which should receive consideration by the European Court at
the earliest possible moment."
</P>
<P>
The NFU has claimed that the EU ban, which has inflicted great
damage to the British meat industry, could be heard within two or
three months.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts predict if the European Court rules in the NFU's
favor, British farmers could mount further actions to seek
millions of pounds of damages from the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
The application is also regarded as a vehicle for the British
to seek a ruling that the EU Commission misused its powers by
introducing the ban to allay consumer concerns rather than
potential threats to human health.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the British government has put forward a new
proposal of slaughtering 40,000 cows in a bid to wipe out the BSE
or mad cow disease and seek an early lifting of the EU ban on
British beef.

<HEADLINE> Military Agreement Epoch-making, Says Ye1tsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
described the five-nation military agreement as an epoch-making
political and military document for the five nations and their
people.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters after the
presidents of the five countries signed the agreement on
confidence building in military fields in border areas, Yeltsin
said it was a significant day today.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he noted, the agreement took five years for the
countries concerned to negotiate before it was concluded.
</P>
<P>
This is like what a Chinese saying goes, "many streams can
converge on a torrential river", Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is "unique" one in the Asian-Pacific region and,
for the first time in history, the people of the five countries
are committed to such concrete political and military obligations
for their own interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeltsin, the contents of the agreement provide
that the five countries will neither resort to force, nor threat
to use force against each other, nor seek unilateral military
superiority, nor deploy border forces against the other.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the agreement will exert a great impact
on the Asia-Pacific region and and set a good example for other
countries, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"We should not just rest on small achievements, and the next
step for us to take is to conclude the agreement on cutting back
military forces in the border areas," Yeltsin added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also thanked the Chinese government and President
Jiang Zemin for the efforts to make good arrangements for the
ceremony of marking the grand occasion.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Health Project Regarded as "A Tonic for Yunnan" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank injection of funds
will be a real tonic for almost 39 million people in southwest
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
A funded health project worth 12 million US dollars includes a
planned vaccination program and a health promotion drive, will
benefit 38.85 million people in the province's 17 regions, 127
counties, 1,607 townships and 13,474 villages.
</P>
<P>
The free interest loan, amounting to 108 million yuan, or 12
million US dollars will be repaid to the World Bank within 15
years after the project is fully completed in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The project will eliminate polio and tetanus in the province's
newborn by enabling all children to have free vaccinations, and
reducing the incidence of measles, pertussis and diphtheria.
</P>
<P>
It will also raise the vaccination rate and improve the
vaccination service for hepatitis-B and other infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Before 1950, smallpox, the plague and cholera were rampant in
the province, which is located in a China border area.
</P>
<P>
After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the
provincial government strived to control acute infectious
diseases, and eliminated smallpox and other diseases by 1960.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the incidence of infectious diseases has
dropped 95.08 percent from 1980.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is the seventh World Bank-funded health
project for the province, will focus on disease control and
prevention in remote and border areas and poor areas, and on the
reduction of infant and children's diseases and on the prevention
of deaths from liver cancer and other liver diseases caused by
Hepatitis-B.
</P>
<P>
The project also plans to improve the professional skills of
medical workers and the management of medical units.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Be Polio Free Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is expected to obtain a polio free certification by the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
With the high per capita income of more than 15,000 dollars and
 improving sanitation, the UAE has maintained its recod of nil
cases of polio in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Preventive Medicine of the
Health Ministry, the transmission of infection with wild polio
virus has declined sharply in the country in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
There has been no case of polio reported in the UAE since 1988
and it has a 90 percent coverage of polio immunization.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide polio immunization program was held in March
of 1995, under which additional doses of the oral polio
vaccine was administered to all children up to the age of
five.
</P>
<P>
Any country is entitled to polio-free certification by the
WHO if it remains polio free for three consecutive years and
the absence of the circulating wild polio virus in the local
environment is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
In the UAE, the polio cases declined from 14 in 1984 to nil in
1988 and only two cases, probably new entrants to the country,
were announced in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua)-- Bank of Zambia (BOZ) has quietly
sold off its gold reserves in London, the local press revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's foreign exchange reserves in March this year stood at
158.45 million US Dollars, below the due debts the central bank
owed to internatinal creditors, the press reports said.
</P>
<P>
But the reports did not indicate the quantity of the gold
reserves sold in London.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some assets of BOZ had been frozen in London by a
London court ruling for failure to clear a staggering 86 million
Pound debts accumulated in oil procurement from a Kuwaiti
company.
</P>
<P>
BOZ Acting Public Relations Manager David Kalumba declined to
comment on both the sale of gold reserves and the bank's frozen
assets in London.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian currency, Kwacha, has been devaluated by some 20
percent in the past four months due to shortages of hard foreign
currencies. enditem

<HEADLINE> Agreement Is of Historical Significance: Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Presidents of China, Russia,
Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan have unanimously cited an
agreement on confidence building in the military field in border
area as a document of historical significance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed later today in Shanghai, covers border
areas and is of political and military significance.
</P>
<P>
These Presidents are of the view that the agreement shows that
the people of the five countries aspire to trust one another and
be on friendly terms with each other.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Russian President Yeltsin,
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, President Askar
Akayev of Kyrghystan, and President Emomali Rakhamonov of
Tadzhikistan made statements to Chinese and overseas journalists.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would not only provide a solid legal guarantee
for the sustained and effective growth of bilateral and
multilateral relationship but exert an active and far-reaching
impact on the maintaining and strengthening of peace and stability
in Asia and in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The presidents held that the agreement, which has just been
concluded after repeated, prolonged negotiations, indicates that
peaceful negotiations are of strong vitality in the present
complex and changeable world. They expressed thanks to all those
who have made hard and assiduous efforts in formulating the
document.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said the signing of the agreement
is a "vivid embodiment" of the five nations' common desire to be
"good neighbors, good friends as well as good partners."
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement is also "an enlightenment, an
exploration and a creation," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
President Nazarbayev said Kazakstan will be always ready to
develop its good neighborly, cooperative ties with China.
</P>
<P>
President Akayev said the agreement would be a typical example
and model to the countries "to go by" not only in the Asia-Pacific
region, but also the whole world.
</P>
<P>
President Rakhamonov described the signing of the agreement as
"of major historic significance."
</P>
<P>
"What is happening here of of 'inestimable significance' to the
people of the five countries," Rakhamonov said, adding that with

<HEADLINE> British Loan to Improve Shanxi's Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain has promised a gratis
payment of one million pounds for North China's Shanxi Province to
implement an energy efficiency project.
</P>
<P>
The money will be granted by the Overseas Development
Administration under Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
A delegation headed by Dr. Alan Heyes, program director of the
department's Clean Coal Technology Research and Development
Programme, paid a seven-day visit to Shanxi this month, to seek
long-term co-operation in clean coal technology with the province,
which is China's major coal producer.
</P>
<P>
The project, covering the fields of coking coal, environmental
protection, boilers, comprehensive use of water, high-efficiency
power generation, control of pollution, etc., will take two years.
</P>
<P>
This is the second project Britain has assisted Shanxi
with. During the period 1992-1993 the first project, named the
"Taiyuan Environmental and Energy-Efficiency Demonstration", was
successfully carried out with 950,000 pounds provided by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
The British government was highly satisfied with the success of
the first project, Heyes said.
</P>
<P>
The crude coal output of Shanxi is 340 million tons annually,
accounting for one quarter of the total in China. Shanxi is
China's most important province in terms of coal exports and power
transmission to the rest of the country. But the province has also
caused heavy pollution to the environment due to lack of
technology for coal processing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the British government has provided
annual 140 million yuan (about 17 million US dollars) for
environmental protection work in China. Projects have been carried
out in Sichuan, Jiangsu, Shandong and Yunnan provinces, and
Beijing and Shanghai municipalities.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Groups to Help Fuel Fujian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian Province
plans to set up a number of sizeable enterprise groups in the next
few years, in a bid to gear up the local economy.
</P>
<P>
These groups will be based on large and medium-sized
enterprises in the local pillar industries of petrochemicals,
machinery and electronics, construction and building materials,
forestry, and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province saw the emergence of nearly 40 new
enterprise groups, bringing the total to over 150.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period the province hopes that such groups
will each achieve annual sales and pre-tax profits of two billion
yuan and 200 million yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The groups will be awarded preferential policies by local
governments, including the right to handle property management,
foreign trade, investment and fund raising.

MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Power rates in Metro Manila will
be raised by 2.69 centavos (25 centavos equal 1 US cent) per
kilowatt-hour effective this month.
</P>
<P>
Guldo Delgado, president of the National Power Corporation

that this will have a minimal effect on the country's inflation
rate," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new rate will translate into a rate increase of some 3.41
centavos per kilowatt-hour for the city of Luzon's commercial and
industrial consumers.
</P>
<P>
For residential consumers, it will mean an increase of 1.37
centavos per kilowatt-hour.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Labor Ministers Oppose Labor-Trade Linkage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Labor Ministers today
reaffirmed their position that there should be no linkage between
international labor standards and international trade.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of a two-day ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) labor ministers' meeting
today, they also reiterated the position that they would continue
to oppose any such linkage at all international fora.
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern that any such linkage would seriously
undermine the economic growth of developing countries, which in
turn would affect the economy of the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
They said the issues of international labor standards should be
discussed in the International Labor Organization (ILO), which is
the most competent body to deal with the issue, and not in
international trade or other non-labor related fora.
</P>
<P>
But they reaffirmed their commitment to improving the economic
and social well-being of workers in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
They also put forth the view that ILO instruments should be
used to help member states to improve their socio-economic
conditions and not as a tool to penalize member states for
non-compliance.
</P>
<P>
They said in the communique that many of the ILO conventions
which were formulated decades ago have become outdated and do not
reflect the actual social and economic conditions of member
states.
</P>
<P>
They urged the International Labor Organization to review seven
of the international labor conventions including the so-called
fundamental workers' rights conventions.
</P>
<P>
Pending the review, ASEAN labor ministers requested the ILO to
adopt a more flexible approach in applying ratified conventions
with due consideration given to the stage of development of each
member state.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers called upon the ILO to review and update
ILO conventions with a view to facilitating ratification of
relevant conventions by member states.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that the 12th ASEAN Labor Ministers'
Meeting would be held in Vietnam in 1998, while an informal
meeting would also take place in Vietnam in 1997.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Consultations on Ceasefire in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Intensified international
consultations have been continuing in Damascus, Beirut and
Tel-Aviv for a week in a bid to reach an understanding to secure a
ceasefire and end the Israeli military operations in southern
Lebanon, which entered the 15th day.
</P>
<P>
These consultations have scored some progress, but there is
still a number difficulties that hamper the realization of a final
solution to the present crisis between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The talks held by the foreign ministers from the U.S., Russia
France, Italy (in the capacity as head of a European Union
delegation) and Iran with Syrian, Lebanese and Israeli leaders
have focused on how to hammer out and execute a ceasefire accord.
</P>
<P>
An initiative put forward by France is based on the necessity
of abiding by the July 1993 understanding reached by Israel and
Hezbollah (Party of God), which forbids molesting civilians in
both Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The French initiative has won the support of both Syria and
Hezbollah, while the American Administration and Israel believe
that any initiative intended to secure a ceasefire in southern
Lebanon should involve some amendments to the July 1993
understanding so as to freeze guerrilla operations against the
Israeli occupation of part of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Political observers think that diplomatic contacts are
continuing with the aim of crystallizing an accord wider than the
July 1993 understanding so as to include forging a ceasefire,
making security arrangements and speeding up the Middle East
peace process on both the Syrian-Israeli and the Lebanese-Israeli
tracks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese sources announced Wednesday that diplomatic contacts
have scored some progress, noting that the parties concerned have
come to agreement on two points: the first point is that Lebanon
should be a key party to any accord, and the second is that the
security of civilians should be ensured by both the Lebanese and
Israeli sides.
</P>
<P>
As far as restricting Lebanese guerrilla activities against the
Israeli occupation, the Lebanese government has announced that it
rejects any formula that affects the right of resistance against
the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
There are also other differences over the membership of the
the proposed international ceasefire-monitoring commission.
Whereas Lebanon has suggested that the U.S., France, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel participate in such a commission, the
U.S. welcomed the participation of Syria, but makes a reservation
on the participation of France on the pretext that it is opposed
to the formation of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with the Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri and
Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in the town of Chtaura, east of
Beirut, on Wednesday evening, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher told reporters that "though there are difficult
problems that still hamper the settlement of the Lebanon crisis,
we are coming closer to each other."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hariri described his talks with Christopher
as "important and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Israel has agreed to execute U.N. Security Council Resolution
425, which calls for Israel's pullout of its troops from southern
Lebanon, on condition that Hezbollah be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe that a new understanding to secure
a ceasefire in Lebanon will be reached soon, as Syria, Lebanon and
Israeli are willing to see a ceasefire forged as soon as possible,
and are seeking to achieve peace in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Man Killed in Bomb-Making Explosion in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police today found a
body of a man dressed in Israeli army's uniform died when a bomb
he was making exploded, according to an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The body was discovered in a soccer field in the Arab
neighborhood of Um Taba in east Jerusalem, and a Koran, the
Islamic holy book, was found beside the body.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Jerusalem police chief Ariel Amit as saying
that the man was instantly killed when 10 kilograms of TNT
exploded as he was making a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the man was planning to carry out a
suicide bombing attack on a Jerusalem bus or at a bus-stop in the
city.
</P>
<P>
No identifying paper was found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Izzadin Kassam, military wing of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas), carried out a series of suicide bombing attacks
on buses in late February and early March, which killed at least
60 people and wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
A number of new security measures have been implemented
following those attacks, including a total closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinian
workers from doing their jobs inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of soldiers, Civil Guard volunteers, and police
cadets have been brought into cities to beef up the police forces,
and to patrol and check in heavy populated areas, including
shopping malls, buses and bus-stops.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Hamas said it would carry out attacks to
avenge the killing of civilians by Israel's military operation
against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 people have been killed and hundreds of others
wounded since the military operation, code-named Operation Grapes
of Wrath, began on April 11.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hamas said today it will continue its military
struggle against Israel despite that the Palestinian National
Council Wednesday voted to amend the Palestinian charter calling
for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by a Hamas spokesman in Amman, capital of
Jordan, said that the "Palestinian concessions to Israel are
humiliating," and many Palestinians remain faithful to the old
charter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Gaza, the Palestinian security forces announced
today that they have arrested Adnan Al-Agha, No. 2 Hamas fugitive
wanted by the Israeli General Security Services.
</P>
<P>
Al-Agha, second commander to Mohammed Dief, head of Izzadin
Kassam, was arrested last Saturday during a raid by Palestinian
security forces in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials said Al-Agha was involved in
planning the February and March suicide bombing attacks.

<HEADLINE> More Civilian Casualties in Continuous Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel today continued its air
raids and bombardment at southern Lebanese villages, causing more
civilian casualties, when its Operation Grapes of Wrath entered
the 15th day.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that Israeli warplanes today carried out
more than 50 air raid missions at villages in eastern and western
sectors in southern Lebanon, which were accompanied by intensive
artillery shellings.
</P>
<P>
Timor Goksel, spokesman of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Lebanon, announced that seven civilians in a building at the
southern village of Yater, Sour, were wounded in an Israeli air
raid this afternoon. The Yater village is located insided the area
controlled by the multi-national peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardment at Aitit led to the killing of one
villager and the wounding of three others who were later
hospitalized in the southern Lebanese port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warships today continued to bombard the coastal
highway stretching from Beirut southward along the country's
Mediterranean beach, cutting the traffic between the Lebanese
capital and the country's southern part.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli warships fired over 50
shells at the coastal road, some 20 of which hit the northern
entrance of the port city of Saida, wounding one civilian.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warships started to impose a naval blockade on
Beirut Port and other Lebanese ports on April 13, or the third day
since Israel launched the military operations in Lebanon. Israel
has enforced the road blockade since April 19.
</P>
<P>
To foil the Israeli road blockade, the Lebanese army set up a
steel-framed bridge on Awali River to pave a new way parallel to
that one under the Israeli fire.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge started last Sunday and the
newly simple-built road between Bakasta and Alman was opened today
through which a number of vehicles have rushed southward or
northward.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they have
launched five volleys of Katyusha rockets at Jewish settlements
in northern Israel since dawn today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance said that "the Katyusha
rockets would not be stopped and any Jewish settlement in northern
Israel would not be excluded from the attacks as long as Israel
continues the aggression against the Lebanese civilians."
</P>
<P>
In a second statement, the Islamic Resistance announced that
one group of its guerrillas launched attacks at an Israeli
position at Toumat Niha in the so-called "security zone" in
southern Lebanon at 9:55 a.m. (06:55 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
It added that the guerrillas used machineguns and rockets in
the fighting, in which a number of the Israeli soldiers were
killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
It also announced that another group of its fighters detonated
an explosive device targeting a joint patrol of the Israeli
occupation force and its client South Lebanon Army militia on
Marjayoun road, causing heavy casualties to the patrol.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, international diplomatic efforts are under
way seeking a cease-fire in Lebnon.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher at the eastern Beqaa Valley town of Chtaura Wednesday,
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik al
Hariri had separate meetings in Beirut with French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati today.
</P>
<P>
Berri and Hariri also held a meeting with Deputy Russian
Foreign Minister Victor Posevalyuk before going to Damascus for
more talks with the Syrian leaders this afternoon. This is the
second visit by Berri and Hariri to the Syrian capital in 48
hours.

<P>
DAMASCUS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto and her accompanying delegation left here today for home
winding up a three-day visit to Syria.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Labor Party Drops Opposition to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ruling Labor Party
today gave up its opposition to the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The move came a day after the Palestinian National Council
(PNC) voted in Gaza Wednesday evening to cancel the clauses in the
PLO charter that called for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv, about 1,000 Labor Party delegates, in a show of
hands, almost unanimously voted for a new platform that does not
oppose to the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Peres said the new platform "gives the government a free hand
to negotiate."
</P>
<P>
He said that he wants "a total elimination of the conflict
between us and the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
But the new platform maintains some hardline points. It says
Jerusalem, including the eastern sector claimed by the
Palestinians, will remain united under Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for eventual Israeli sovereignty over parts of
the West Bank such as the Jordan Valley.

<HEADLINE> US State Department Spokesman on Ceasefire in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. State Department
spokesman disclosed here today that Thursday is a decisive day for
the ongoing U.S. efforts to end military operations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He told journalists that U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher's talks with Syrian officials were focused on a U.S.
plan strictly based on American ideas, underscoring that "there
should only be one channel, namely, the American channel."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the U.S. proposals include a set
of agreements and ideas based on the July 1993 understanding. He
emphasized that Christopher's mission was not over and that no one
side had declared its approval of the U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the U.S. efforts had not ended, saying that
"we shall stay so long as it is necessary."
</P>
<P>
He also said that no decision had been taken with regard to
the committee that will monitor ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political observers in Damascus say that the central
points of difference are two. The first is to authorize the
Israelis to reply to sources of gunfire should Israelis inside the
occupied border strip be hit. This was rejected by both Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The second point demands Syria to guarantee the agreement, but
Syria said that it is merely a broker for Lebanon in the same way
as the U.S. is for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had earlier declared that Syria
was no party to the July 1993 understanding which had been
reached between Israel and Hezbollah (Party of God) to safeguard
civilians' lives in Israel and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Stresses Necessity to End Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati stressed here today the necessity to end the
Israeli aggression against Lebanon, enabling some 500,000 refugees
to return to their homeland in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following his meeting with Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, Velayati
announced that they had talks over a cease-fire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the cease-fire should be established as soon
as possible," the Iranian foreign minister told reporters in the
Beirut Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the Iranian side believed that the cease-fire
needs an existence of observers from different countries,
including France.
</P>
<P>
"We need some observers from different countries, including
France," he said.
</P>
<P>
The essence of a cease-fire agreement may be the same as that
agreed upon in July 1993, Velayati said, referring to the U.S.-
mediated understanding between Israel and the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which put an end to Israel's blitz
in southern Lebanon at that time.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iran preferred the French proposal on cease-fire
in Lebanon to the proposal raised by the United States, adding
that the first U.S. proposal was not filled with enthusiasm by
Washington itself after it was refused by all the parties
concerned except Israel.
</P>
<P>
"That forced the United States to verify its proposal and make
it include some suggestions basically derived from the French
project," he said, noting that the present U.S. proposal contained
the essence of the July 1993 understanding.
</P>
<P>
He underlined a very close coordination among Syria, Iran,
Lebanon and Hezbollah "which is an important part of the
resistance in the southern part of Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said Iran must be sure that "Hezbollah will not be
ignored," nor will it be excluded in any agreement to be signed by
the government of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that Syria is not going to agree to sign any
cease-fire agreement with another country" without an agreement by
the Lebanese government and Hezbollah, said the Iranian foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Velayati arrived in Beirut from Damascus this morning, one day
after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's first visit to
Lebanon since 1993 and his meeting with Lebanese House Speaker
Berri and Premier Hariri here.

MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
criticized the World Bank for its interference in the country's
export incentives package.

Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today,
"the World Bank needs to keep its policies in step with actual
conditions in East Asia and check whether the economic development
tools the bank uses are still helpful."
</P>
<P>
A World Bank position paper has warned Manila that the
implementation of incentives under the export development act may
violate rules of the World Trade Organization.

Bautista described the World Bank's warning as "unsolicited and
outdated."

He said that the Basecon is now accepting project proposals

SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the signing of the five-nation military
agreement is a significant step for Asian-Pacific countries to
build up trust as well as develop good-neighborliness and
friendship.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is a good demonstration of the five nations'
shared desire to become good neighbours, friends and partners, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here late this afternoon following the
signing of an agreement on confidence-building in the military
field in border areas by himself and the presidents of Russia,
Kazakstan, Kyrghystan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
China shares boundaries of over 7,000 km with the four
countries, all of which are China's good neighbours, Jiang said,
and China's relationship of good-neighborliness and friendship
with the four countries has been developed and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that all the five countries are facing major tasks
of economic construction and raising the living standards of their
peoples. Therefore, it is their common desire to maintain a sound
neighborly environment.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the agreement was designated to strengthen
their mutual confidence in the military field in border areas,
maintain tranquility and stability there and promote the
development of China's long-term good-neighborliness and
friendship with the four countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the end of the Cold War the world is not tranquil,
Jiang said. Peace and security are still two major issues facing
the peoples of various countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that, with a foreign policy of peace as well as
maintaining independence and keeping the initiative in its own
hands, China is willing to engage in friendly co-operation based
on peaceful co-existence and promote mutual confidence with all
its neighbors so as to make its due contribution to regional and
world peace.

<HEADLINE> First Egyptian Ambassador to China on Sino-Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hassan Raggab, first Egyptian
ambassador to China, affirmed that the friendly relations and
cooperation between Egypt and China have seen developing since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1956.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on the occasion of the 40th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and Egypt, Raggab, currently board chairman of the Papyrus
Research Institute, said "The Sino-Egyptian friendly ties date
back to the time when late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and late
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser met while attending the
Afro-Asian Conference held in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955, paving
the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the
two countries."
</P>
<P>
"These ties have been developing thanks to the efforts made by
leaders of the two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Raggab said that he went to Beijing in 1956 as the first
Egyptian ambassador to China, and Egypt was the first Arab and
African country to establish diplomatic relations with China at a
time when most countries of the world had not yet recognized China.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's recognition of China encouraged many Arab and African
countries to recognize it, and the recognition of China by those
countries helped it restore its lawful seat at the U.N.," Raggab
said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and China also supported each other and sympathized
with each other in their struggle against colonialism and
imperialism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Raggab made it clear that Egypt and China support each other
at international assemblies, and they have identical or similar
views on many international and regional issues particularly the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There is good cooperation between Egypt and China in all
fields, as China has extended a great deal of help to Egypt in
the field of construction. It was China which designed and
constructed the Cairo International Convention Center, which
is considered the biggest of its kind in the Middle East and
Africa," Raggab said.
</P>
<P>
He described this convention center as a remarkable achievement
and a symbol of the friendship between the Egyptian and Chinese
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Raggab also pointed out that several contracts for the
execution of textile and agricultural projects have been
concluded by between Egyptian and Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the wide strides made by China toward updating
electronics and automobile industries, as well as the economic
achievements secured by the People's Republic of China since it
was founded.
</P>
<P>
Raggab affirmed that, though he is now 85, he will do his best
to develop the Sino-Egyptian ties of friendship.
</P>
<P>
Assessing the coming visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Egypt, he welcomed it cordially and described it as very important.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Egyptian people look forward to the arrival
the Chinese President to Egypt, and Jiang's coming visit to Egypt
will certainly contribute to boosting the ties of friendship and
cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> French FM Calls for Fast Solution to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette today called on the countries concerned to find a
solution to the Lebanon crisis "as quick as possible."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following his meeting here with Lebanese
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, de
Charette announced that a settlement would be reached "soon."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the agreement should be a "written" one, the
French foreign minister said that the understanding should be a
start to return to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic that a cease-fire in Lebanon would be
achieved in the "near future," stressing that the two proposals
raised respectively by France and the United States for an end of
the Israeli aggression in Lebanon "are going in the same
direction."
</P>
<P>
"We will not rest as long as the Israeli bombardment continues
in Lebanon," de Charette said upon his arrival at Beirut
International Airport earlier today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were still some difficulties before
reaching an agreement, hoping that the agreement would be
completed today.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said he would not leave the region until a
cease-fire was achieved.
</P>
<P>
"I will stay till the problem is solved," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister's visit to Lebanon came
coincidently with a similar one by his Iranian counterpart Ali
Akbar Velayati within his efforts to seek a cease-fire between
Israel and the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz is currently in the
United States with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher carried out a
prompt visit to this country Wednesday and held a meeting with
Berri and Hariri at a hotel in Chtaura, a city on the western edge
of Lebanon's eastern Beqaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
After meetings with Velayati and de Charette, Berri and Hariri
left for Damascus this afternoon for more talks with the Syrian
leaders. This is the second visit by the two Lebanese leaders to
the Syrian capital in 48 hours.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Order Still Irrational: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Trade Minister Wu
Yi said that the international community should help developing
countries in overcoming their shortage of foreign investment and
weak service sector.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the world economy is now in a profound and
complicated change, but the growth of world economy has not yet
changed the irrational world economic order.
</P>
<P>
The trade minister made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua
here this afternoon prior to her departure for South Africa to
attend the Ninth Session of the United Nations Conference on
Development and Trade (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the Chinese government has always attached great
importance to UNCTAD's positive role in promoting the South-North
dialogue and the trade and economy of its member countries, and
assisting to channel the developing economies into the
multilateral trade regime.
</P>
<P>
She said she believes that UNCTAD and the World Trade
Organization (WTO) complement each other in their functions and
roles, and the WTO can not replace UNCTAD in terms of promoting
the developing economies and urging developed ones to fully
implement the multilateral trade agreements in a balanced way.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the WTO has not settled the problems of the
developing countries for their interests were not reflected in the
final act of the Uruguay Round, Wu said, and certain big trading
countries are restricting the exports of developing countries by
the wanton use of anti-dumping regulations and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the world economic growth upon developing
countries, Wu said that developing countries have enormous
opportunities while facing great challenges.
</P>
<P>
Most of the developing countries are readjusting their economic
structures to meet the needs of the external economic environment,
she said, but they have not attained the desired results.
</P>
<P>
The unchanged poverty of developing countries should be
attributed to the disorderly world economy, the minister said, and
therefore, developed countries should help the developing ones in
avoiding trade protectionism, overcoming the shortage of foreign
direct investment and improving service industries.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Can Help Bolster HK's Economic Strength After 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- How to improve economic
co-operation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong has become a hot topic
in both places. This was the view of Shenzhen mayor Li Zibin in an
interview with a Hong Kong-based French publication.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the deepening of the co-operation can help Hong
Kong to enhance its status as a financial center in the
Asia-Pacific region and as a center of international shipping and
trade after 1997, when China resumes the exercise of its
sovereignty over the region.
</P>
<P>
To keep such a status is the key to the long-term stability of
Hong Kong after 1997, the mayor noted.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation in four major aspects should enjoy priority, he
suggested:
</P>
<P>
First, the two places should enhance co-operation in urban
infrastructure construction and the development of urban
amenities.
</P>
<P>
Second, co-operation should be stepped up in transportation,
customs and excise work, air, rail and highway transportation, and
in the industrial and commercial fields, including finance,
commerce, information and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Third, Shenzhen should try to learn more from the advanced
management and business experience of Hong Kong, so as to
accelerate compliance with international standards.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, co-operation should be strengthened in the supply of
power, water and foodstuffs, environmental protection and
anti-flood measures.
</P>
<P>
Such co-operation can also help the Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone to enhance its role as a show-window of China's opening up
and economic reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Good co-operation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong can also serve
as an example for the mainland's relations with Macao and Taiwan,
the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Reclaims More Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province is taking vigorous measures to protect arable land for
the purpose of further stabilizing grain production this year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has urged various localities to step
up reclamation of arable land lying idle and set strict limits for
the allocation of land for non-farming uses, confining the amount
within 25,333 ha.
</P>
<P>
The local source said that no land will be allowed this year
for the construction of luxury entertainment facilities, including
hotels and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province plans to develop 20,000 ha of
farmland, including 10,000 ha of arable land. The provincial land
department will give priority to the 50 reclamation projects
each with an area of over 66.6 ha.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will appropriate an annual 50 million
yuan to ensure financial guarantees for land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The province reclaimed nearly 35,000 ha of land in 1995,
contributing a great deal to the increase of grain production in
the province in the same year.

<HEADLINE> BOJ Likely to Change Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's central bank, the Bank of
Japan (BOJ), is studying the possibility of raising its official
discount rate charged on loans to commercial banks, prompoted by
the growing prospects that the nation's economy will continue
moving on a recovery path.
</P>
<P>
According to a Kyodo News Service report quoting the Asahi
Shimbun Friday, the policy shift may be delayed into June,
depending on economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The discount rate, a pacesetter for interest rates in general,
now stands at a record low 0.5 percent per annum. The key rate
was cut to the present level in September last year, the ninth
reduction since July 1991.
</P>
<P>
The bank now believes that the economy is moving on a gradual
recovery track, underpinned in large part by greater public
investment.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan also observes that corporate capital spending
will become buoyant in the months ahead and that consumer spending
will regain its strength due to a moderate improvement in
employment, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The economy thus appears likely to show a self-sustained
recovery even if the central bank discontinues nudging interest
rates lower, the BOJ was cited as analyzing.
</P>
<P>
In the present circumstances, the BOJ may tolerate a rise of
around 0.25 percentage point in the unsecured overnight call money
rate above the official discount rate, according to the paper.
The unsecured overnight call money rate is viewed as a key rate
reflecting the central bank's policy intentions.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ruling Party Says Opinion Polls Deceptive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of India's
ruling Congress Party has described opinion polls as "deceptive"
and urged people not to believe them, the Patriot reported today.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who also chairs the
Congress Party Publicity Committee, made the remark on Thursday in
response to recent surveys published in local dailies that the
main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will emerge as the
single largest party after the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The opinion polls have predicted that the BJP will garner about
200 seats in the 545-seat Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament),
followed by the ruling Congress Party with a tally of seats
falling between 135 and 150 only.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee expressed doubt that the BJP will get the number of
seats given by the surveys.
</P>
<P>
He said the real popular poll will start on April 27 when
people go to elect the new Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the Congress Party would form the next
government after the general elections, confounding all opinion
polls predicting to the contrary, as "there was a silent wave" in
favor of the party sweeping the country.

<HEADLINE> Smallest Jet Engine Sets World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An 23-year-old Australian
student was awarded a Guinness Book of Records entrance for
building the world's smallest jet engine, the Sydney Morning
Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Terry Burton, a former aerospace engineering student at the
University of New South Wales (NSW), received confirmation from
the book's publishers recently that he had set a world record by
building the smallest gas turbine jet engine.
</P>
<P>
His jet engine only produces half a kilogram of thrust. It is
not used for flying, though the type of engine drives most
airliners in the world.
</P>
<P>
Burton began to build the engine in the garage of his home in
January last year when he was a university student.
</P>
<P>
His supervisor in the university said that small jet turbines
were harder to build than large ones because the wheels had to
spin much faster to pump enough air to make the engine work, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The wheel in Terry's jet turbine was tested at 92,000
revolutions per minute. The highest speed could be 200,000
revolutions per minute.
</P>
<P>
After six months of night work during his spare time, Terry
began to test his combustion chamber, or the centerpiece of the
jet engine. He used a vacuum cleaner to blow air into the engine
and kerosene bought from a local petrol station.
</P>
<P>
"It started first time. When I turned on the fuel, I got a
massive yellow flame a meter long that went out the garage door,"
he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He sent a detailed official test report to the Guinness Book
publishers after reading the book and realizing his engine was the
world's smallest. The report was received on February 28.
</P>
<P>
His jet engine will be used for teaching in the university from
July.
</P>
<P>
He is now working on a jet turbine that produces 50 kilograms
of thrust.

match, the final decision will be made after all the singles
matches, Graf said.
</P>
<P>
Graf enjoyed a clear 6-0 won-loss slate against Date who ranked
seventh in the latest ATP rankings, and won all three ties against
Sawamatsu who ranked 28th.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Huber stood on a 1-1 record against Date and
1-0 against Sawamatsu.
</P>

in the first round of the Federation Cup, the fourth straight win
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Small Hydropower Stations Boost Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Small hydro-electric power
stations across China have generated more than electricity for
rural areas. They have also generated wealth - helping local
people to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming number of small hydro-electric power stations
nationwide have played a key role in rural economic development
and in easing energy shortages in the country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China has so far established over 50,000 such small stations
nationwide with a combined generating capacity of nearly 17
million kw.
</P>
<P>
An international conference in Hangzhou was told that small
hydro-electric power stations in China generated a total power
output of over 55.3 billion kwh in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over 770 counties across China, or one third of the total,
rely mainly on small hydro-electric power stations to fuel
industrial and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Most of these counties have increased their financial revenues
several times over, or have shaken off poverty by taking advantage
of the development of small hydro-electric power stations.
</P>
<P>
Officials concerned noted that China's achievements in this
sector have drawn international attention and the UN International
Center for the Development of Hydro-electric Power Stations has
been set up in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
province.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Researchers Warn of "Andean Ginseng" Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian researchers warned today
about the possible extinction of maca, a plant known as "the
ginseng of the Andes," credited with nutritious and tonic values.
</P>
<P>
The areas where maca was usually found have diminished in an
alarming way since 1982 and now there are just 50 hectares in the
Central Peruvian Mountain Range, said experts from the Econatura
Research Center of Peru in a report.
</P>
<P>
The plant, known also by its Latin name Lepidium meyenii W, is
in danger of extinction, a process that has been accelerated by
mining activities, like those performed around Lake Chinchaycocha,
added the researchers.
</P>
<P>
Maca is a cruciferous plant, just as radishes and turnips.
Considered to be very nutritious, it was the main food staple of
Andean populations during many centuries, even in times predating
the Inca civilization.
</P>
<P>
The last hectares where the "Andean ginseng" can still be found
are threatened by mining enterprises, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Maca growns in sites located at altitudes between 3,800 and
5,000 meters above the sea level, and is adapted to resist
freezing, hailstorms, and pests in those locations.
</P>
<P>
The plant has been dubbed "the ginseng of the Andes" because of
its curative and life-restoring properties.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian doctors are investigating the possibilities for
treating cancer and AIDS through the improvement of the immune
system by using tonics made from maca.

<HEADLINE> Mountain Fire in S. Korea Begins to Get Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The mountain fire, which destroyed
more than 3,000 hectares of forest land in South Korea's Kangwon
Province in the past few days, started to get under control last
night, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began at a United States army training range in
Kosong County of the province on April 23, stopped spreading
yesterday evening as firefighters succeeded in putting out blazes
that were once feared to spread to the Sorak Mountain area, a
famous tourist attraction some 220 kilometers east of the South
Korean capital Seoul, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest-ever mountain fire in recent years has
engulfed more than 150 houses in 20 villages, left about 200
residents homeless and killed over 300 heads of
livestock. Hundreds of villagers were evacuated to safe places,
and no casualties were reported, police sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people, including army soldiers and local
government officials, and 30 helicopters were on the scene to
fight the blaze.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, seven South Koreans were killed when trying to
control a brush fire at a U.S. military base in Tongduchon, north
of Seoul. Some 37,000 American troops are currently stationed in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry has ordered all military
units to suspend their shooting drills till May 15 in woodland
area and to take precautions when burning wastes and garbages to
prevent the recurrence of brush fires.

NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The campaign for the 11th Lok

and the first phase of the elections will start on April 27, yet
the prospects remain uncertain.
</P>
<P>
So far nearly all reports and opinion polls have forecast a

parliament. The Time of India Thursday quoted a latest opinion
poll as saying that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would emerge
as the largest single party in the Lok Sabha, but its tally of
seats would be below 200 and well short of a majority, and a
coalition government seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The Lok Sabha has 543 elective seats and two seats are
nominated by the president, taking the total strength of the house
to 545. The party position in the tenth Lok Sabha as on January
31,1996 was as follows: the ruling Congress Party had 260 seats;
BJP, 113 seats; Communist Party of India (Marxist), 36 seats; and
the Janata Dal, 23 seats.
</P>
<P>
A Delhi-based research organization, the Center for Media
Studies (CMS) has said that the coming Lok Sabha elections might
see the popular votes for the Congress declining to 31 percent
from the 36.50 percent in 1991, and its tally of seats falling
between 135 and 150. This would be the lowest ever for the
Congress, even below its performance in 1977 when it first lost
power at the center and managed to win only 34.5 percent of the
votes and 154 seats. Some poll opinions have given the Congress
170-175 seats. The Congress Party itself could only expect to get
224 seats at most.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indian General Elections' Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past five years, the ruling Congress Party and the P.V.
Narasimha Rao government has pursued an economic reform policy,
achieving good results, especially in the economic field. At the
same time, both the Congress and the Rao government have also
shown their weaknesses and errors.
</P>
<P>
Differences and conflicts within the Congress party have been
intensified, leading to splits. Congress veteran leader, former
human resource development minister Arjun Singh was forced to
leave the party and form a new party in January, 1995 with his
followers. In the "hawala case" recently exposed, seven cabinet
ministers of the Rao government involved in the case were forced
to resign.
</P>
<P>
The Rao government has witnessed a series of economic scandals,
even Rao himself has been involved in some of them, inflicting
severe damage on the party's image. The BJP in the election
campaign called the Rao government "the most corrupted government
seen in Indian history."
</P>
<P>
Poverty and high unemployment still remain a big challenge in
the country. Furthermore, inflation has added more miserable life
to the poor, who are disappointed with the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Rao, over 74-year old, is lack of charisma.
</P>
<P>
Although the BJP, the biggest opposition party in the country,
is being strengthened in the past few years and is expected to get
more seats in the forthcoming elections, the BJP is also facing
some difficulties and problems both within and outside the party.
Differences are developing in the party, especially in the states
under its control.
</P>
<P>
BJP President L.K. Advani and other senior leaders have been
involved in the multi-crore "hawala case," taking away the party's
"clean" image. Furthermore, the BJP stresses Hinduism, isolating
itself from national minorities. Because of this, this time the
party could only expect to consolidate its gain of 1991, not so
much as reported, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the above-mentioned two major rivals, there are
national front-left front combine and other small parties who will
participate in the fight. In comparison, they are still weak and
could not challenge the Congress and the BJP. Yet they will play
an essential role when neither the Congress nor the BJP could get
a clear majority in the elections.
</P>
<P>
With the specter of a hung parliament looming large, a peep
into the post-election scenario has already begun even before the
electorate gives its verdict. So far there is no clear indication
that the stability factor is uppermost in the mind of the voters.
It is clear, however, the future government will be facing more
and more challenges.

<HEADLINE> Russia Should also Practice Market Economy, Yeltsin says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said here today that Russia should also have a market economy with
Russian characteristics just as China is developing its socialist
market economy with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remarks after touring some enterprises and
construction projects in this largest industrial city in China.
</P>
<P>
As every country has its own national conditions, the Russian
president said, Russia should take its own characteristics into
consideration in building a market economy. He added that compared
with Russia, China has richer experience in reform, especially the
experience of Shanghai's reform and opening to the rest of the
world, which is worth studying.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin arrived in Shanghai this morning. He is to
sign an agreement on confidence-building in military field in
border areas with his counterparts from China, Kazakhstan,
Kyrghyzstan and Tadzhikistan this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> India's Poll Expenditure Ceiling Unrealistic: EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission
(EC) has agreed that the expenditure ceiling imposed on the coming
general elections is unrealistic, the Hindustan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the commission believed that the
current ceiling of 450,000 rupees (about 12,900 US dollars) for
each Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) seat is not merely
unrealistic but also comes in the way of ensuring a level playing
field for all candidates in the fray.
</P>
<P>
Hamstrung by the existing law, new faces have remained unknown
to the electorate and established politicians, contesting on
newly-allotted symbols, have not been able to educate their
supporters adequately about their latest political alignments.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission observed that only in the event of the
expenditure ceiling being made realistic, would the canvassing
have a "meaningful" role in serving the basic purpose of electing
the right people.
</P>
<P>
The commission said actions should be taken to make the current
limits realistic and practicable.
</P>
<P>
The campaigning for the first phase of polls for the general
elections, which ended Thursday, turned out to be unusually
lackluster due to the Supreme Court's recent directive on the
strict implementation of poll expenses regulations.

<P>
SHENYANG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A court specializing in
environment-related lawsuits has been established in this capital
of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The major task of the court is to co-operate with local
environmental-protection departments in settling disputes and
safeguarding the rights and interests of citizens in accordance
with the law.
</P>
<P>
The court also plans to provide consultancy services on
environment-related issues and improve the law-enforcement
capability of personnel concerned.

<P>
Last year alone, courts in Shenyang dealt with 112 cases in
connection with environmental protection, imposing fines and
collecting fees for discharging waste water, waste gas and waste
residues topping seven million yuan (about 900,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
As Zhao Chunzhi, an official of the new court, put it, "The

consolidating the legal framework for environmental protection
and effectively dealing with some thorny problems in enforcing

<HEADLINE> Peru Registered 49,589 TB Cases in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 49,589 cases of
tuberculosis (TB) were registered in 1995 in Peru, a 5 percent
reduction in comparison with 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Peruvian Health Ministry today, the
figure represents a morbidity rate of 215.3 cases per 100,000
persons.
</P>
<P>
Patients were given medical attention free of charge, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of diagnostic and treatment for patients in Peru
increased four times during the recent years in Peru, although the
illness has not been eradicated.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five percent of the Health Ministry service centers
executed TB diagnostic and treatment actions in 1990. Five years
later, 85 percent of the centers were still providing the services.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the TB cases documented in 1995 represent a 16
percent reduction in comparison with 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Pan-American Health Organization has reported that TB
killed 75,000 persons in Latin America and the Caribbean in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices remained
stable this week as trade goes on only in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) announced that
the eastern market indicator remained unchanged at 547 cents per
kg clean after two days of sales in Sydney this week.
</P>
<P>
Wool prices fell to a two-year low last week due to over-sized
supply at auctions in Australian markets.
</P>
<P>
ACWE warned that continuing dumping of wool by Wool
International (WI), the statutory Australian body charged with
selling off the country's wool stockpile, would dragged down wool
prices further.
</P>
<P>
ACWE sources said that at least one client had reneged on an
order for 200 tons of wool as a result of last week's price falls.
</P>
<P>
A total of 112,018 bales of wool will be offered at auctions in
Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle next week.
</P>
<P>
Wool brokers fear that WI must dump 75,000 bales from stocks by
the end of June in order to meet its selling quota.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the major source of buying orders at present. Local
brokers said that there was little sign of improvement in the weak
market outlook.

BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslim and Croat officials
discussed ways of consolidating their confederation here today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreement on the establishment of a
united police force in September.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to deploy human rights observers in 10
provinces to ensure freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly

A Muslim-Croat confederation was forged in 1994 to curb the

<P>
However, the confederation, since its birth, has been suffering
discords owing to conflict of interests of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the United States are anxious to bring together the
two sides in the confederation.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned at the beginning of
today's meeting that both sides would face sanctions if no
agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, who chaired the meeting, said that the meeting has
stepped a pace forward, but cannot be dubbed as a breakthrough.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Almost 200,000 of Sri Lanka's
northern refugees displaced as a result of the on-going civil war
have returned to their homes and a further 50,000 are expected to
follow soon, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the government is encouraging the
refugees to return to their own homes and is providing all the
necessary facilities.
</P>
<P>
Roads are being repaired, buildings are being reconstructed and
trading establishments have been reopened.
</P>
<P>
Government organizations have opened offices in Jaffna to enable
the refugees to conduct their normal business, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were displaced when government forces staged
operation "Riviresa I" to liberate the northern peninsula and the
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) compelled
the civilians to vacate the peninsula and flee to rebel-held
territory last December.
</P>
<P>
Now with government forces taking back more territory in the
peninsula, the refugees have opted to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE have been staging a 13-year war for a separate state
during the course of which over 50,000 persons are reportedly to
have died.

<HEADLINE> Seven Developing Countries to Invest More in Basic Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven developing countries have
pledged to seek ways to spend 20 percent of their national budgets
on basic social needs to help wipe out poverty, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The countries -- Guinea, Bourkina Fasso, Bolivia, Vietnam,
Tanzania, Uganda and Nicaragua -- have expressed commitment to a
so-called "20-20" formula for improving social services at a
three-day international conference in Oslo, Norway, according to
Richard Jolly, special adviser to the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The "20-20" formula, agreed at a U.N. social summit in
Copenhagen last year, requires that 20 percent of development aid
be allocated to basic social programs while the recipient nation
in return spends 20 percent of its national budget on social needs.
</P>
<P>
According to Jolly, developing countries could only spend an
average 13 percent of budgets for basic social services at present
while the donor nations provide 10 percent of foreign aid budgets
for such needs.
</P>
<P>
"Until everyone in a country gets the basic minimum of needs
fulfilled you don't have the basis for economic growth, for
poverty reduction, for gender equality," he said. "That is the
lesson of post-Second World War development."
</P>
<P>
The Oslo conference, sponsored by Norway and the Netherlands,
appealed to developing nations to implement the formula for
spending on basic education, health care and other needs.
</P>
<P>
A final communique from the meeting of 120 delegates from 40
countries and organizations encouraged Third World and industrial
countries to implement the formula by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Norwegian Overseas Development Minister
Kari Nordheim-Larsen told a news conference that a new conference
is to be held in about a year.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- West Africa's four bigger
economies are spearheading a free-trade program in 1996 to step
up an overdued process of economic integration in the world's
poorest region.
</P>
<P>
The free trade zone, joined by Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and
Cote d'Ivoire, leads to the drawing of a much larger map of all
the 16 regional states: to create a Customs Union by year 2000
and a comprehensive Economic Union by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"This is our idea of a two-speed West Africa," said Edouard

<P>
Still "crawling" though 20 years old, the largest sub-regional
body in Africa is yearning for "adulthood" as economic
integration is deemed the best way for 200 million West Africans
to shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
Among the 48 "World's Least Developed Countries" tagged by the
United Nations, 10 are located in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
And obstacles continue to hold in check the recovery of the
economies: unbearable burdens of foreign debt, rapid growth of
population, unfair international trade environment, poor build-up
of industry, etc..
</P>
<P>
"But if we take full advantage of the resources available, we
can still make it," said Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the poverty-stricken soils of West Africa boasts of
abundant natural resources and geographical facilities which the
regional leaders believe can be better exploited to achieve the
economic well-being of their people.
</P>
<P>
Mining is one of the economic mainstays of West Africa which
is rich in gold, diamond, uranium, manganese and iron, among
other mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The region also boasts of a Nigeria which is Africa's largest
producer of crude oil and natural gas, and a Guinea which owns
about one third of the world's bauxite reserves.
</P>
<P>
A success story of intra-community cooperation was told about
the multi-billion-dollar West African Gas Pipeline Network which
is to supply Nigeria's cheap-in-price but rich-in-quality natural
gas to its three neighbors -- Benin, Ghana and Togo, and then to
the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
"That's the best example to show how far we can go in our
integration process," said Nigeria's Head of State, General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
"We have succeeded in cooperating in the energy sector. Why
can't we do it in so many other fields?" he asked, adding the
potential is great in promoting intra-community trade.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: West Africa Steps Up Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- In Agriculture, West Africa is a
world-known producer of coffee, palm and natural rubber, among
other products.
</P>
<P>
And 70 percent of the world's coca consumption is supplied by
Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
"That means the room is always there for further cooperation
in agriculture," said a senior official of the ECOWAS Trade
Department.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent business survey conducted by the
department, as much as 40 percent of the goods that the ECOWAS
countries imported from Europe, America and elsewhere, could well
be obtained from within the community.
</P>
<P>
To promote the intra-community trade, an ECOWAS trade fair,
the first ever in 20 years of its history, was held in Dakar,
Senegal last year.
</P>
<P>
Proven a success with multi-million-dollar business deals
struck in the trade of agricultural, fishing, animal husbandry,
forestry and mining products, the regional trade fair was later
decided to be an annual event.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the annual intra-community trade has edged its way up
to 10 percent of the total volume of foreign trade, higher than
all the other sub-regional organisations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
And in 1996, the picture is brighter, according to ECOWAS
officials.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, there are encouraging news about West Africa's
infrastructure building.
</P>
<P>
With the creation of a regional telecommunication network in
1995, the 16 ECOWAS countries now enjoy direct telecom links
without further relying on Europe for connection.
</P>
<P>
The Trans-West Africa Highway Network has also been completed#,
linking by road all the capitals and major commercial centers of
the region.
</P>
<P>
"With my car, now I can tour almost anywhere in the region.
Years ago, that was simply incredible," said Peter Ousmane, a
trader based in Lagos, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
West Africa is especially proud of its harbors which not only
are the sea outlets of the region, but also link Europe to
Southeast Asia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the forming of an ECOWAS Coastal Shipping
Service, now underway to set common customs rates and to
coordinate among the member states, will add to the region's
foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
And the up-coming regional airline authority will provide
direct flights among major cities in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The successful laying down of these infrastructure projects
is all the more important in a sense that regional trade would be
enhanced to a much greater extent," said Dr. John Sessay,
Director of Transport and Telecommunication Department of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, a Ministry of ECOWAS Affairs will be
established in 1996 by each of the 16 governments to supervise
the implementation of various plans for regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Beside the national flag and emblem of all the 16 West African
states, there is now an ECOWAS flag and emblem. It was "to create
a sense of belonging," according to officials of the community.
</P>
<P>
And a new curriculum of "ECOWAS" is being set up in colleges
and high schools of all its 16 member states "to create
integration awareness" among the boys and girls who are the
future of West Africa.
</P>
<P>
"A new momentum is already there. Regional economic
integration is stepped up in West Africa," Ghanian President
Jerry Rawlings who is also the current ECOWAS chairman,
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Private Sector to Help Develop Telecom Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- As the Nepali government began
to evaluate proposals from private companies for mobile phone
service, it seems that the country has adopted a policy to develop
its telecommunication infrastructure with the private sector's
help.
</P>
<P>
Five private companies recently have applied to the Ministry of
Information and Communications for licenses to operate mobile
phone service in Nepal with different technologies including
global system for mobile communications (GSP) and wireless local
loop (WLL), ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also received 12 proposals for wireless paging
service from the private sector, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the ministry, before offering
contracts on such services to private parties, the government
needs some time to adjust the existing laws and regulations in the
field.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of calling for private investment in the
telecommunication sector is to develop such infrastructure
facilities throughout the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
As many parts of the country, especially remote rural areas,
still have no access to telecommunications facilities, the
government will encourage private companies to extend their
service in these areas.
</P>
<P>
If they don't do so, the government will charge them 10 to 15
percent of their total investment for a separate fund for the
development of rural communication infrastructure, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the involvement of the private sector in
telecommunication service was considered helpful urging the
state-run Nepal Telecom Corporation (NTC) to be more competitive
in the market.
</P>
<P>
Stating that NTC needs more autonomy from the government, NTC
General Manager Gajendra Bohara said his company could compete
with private companies if its management was improved.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that after private operators' entry into the
telecom sector, tariff on local phone calls would be increased.
</P>
<P>
According to him, at present local phone call charge in Nepal,
which stands at less than three US dollars one month for one phone
set, is considerably low compared with that in other countries and
the loss was offset by the much higher charge on international
calls.

BUENOS AIRES, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Paraguayans
today expressed their support to President Juan Carlos Wasmosy for
his decision to withdraw the appointment of retired General Lino
Oviedo as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered around the Paraguayan government
palace in Asuncion, capital of Paraguay, today after Wasmosy
decided not to appoint the former commander-in-chief of the
Paraguayan army to a post in his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
President Wasmosy had offered the post of defense minister to
Oviedo as a solution to the crisis touched off by the general on
Monday when he refused to resign. But the president announced
this morning that he would revoke the appointment because it met
opposition from the people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government today gave full support for the Paraguayan
president's decision, which the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion described
as "one more demonstration of the force of Paraguayan democracy."

<HEADLINE> Colombian Producers Happy About Coffee Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Coffee
Producers Federation of Colombia was satisfied today with the
nine-cent rise in the price of a pound of Colombian coffee
registered in the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the inventories of importing countries, less
than eight million bags, and the compliance with agreements to
retain exports by producing countries, improved the price of
coffee, said the federation sources.
</P>
<P>
A pound of coffee, quoted Monday at 1.35 dollars, reached 1.40
dollars on Tuesday and 1.44 dollars on Wednesday in the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The hike will improve the finance of the National Coffee Fund,
which has been affected by the low quotations, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts have said that the poor coffee harvests
forecast for some countries are also a factor for the increase in
the international coffee price.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay's Crisis Difficult to Be Handled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The political-military
crisis in Paraguay looks difficult to be handled after President
Juan Carlos Wasmosy revoked the appointment of rebel General Lino
Oviedo as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presidential palace, Wasmosy announced Thursday
that army chief Oviedo, who retired Wednesday, will not be defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan president said he made the decision according to
the popular demand. They regard the appointment as a retreat in
the South American country's democratic process.
</P>
<P>
He said he will assume all the consequences of the decision,
but he did not go into details about the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Calling a rally Thursday afternoon in the Republic Park, Oviedo
threatened to disclose details of the crisis and why the president
refused to name him defense minister.
</P>
<P>
When Oviedo defied Wasmosy's order not to resign as the army
chief, he confined himself in the First Army Corps headquarters
which is close to the Republic Park.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo retired from his army post as Wasmosy promised to
appoint him the defense minister, which is strongly opposed by the
general public and politicians as well.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Some US Troops to Stay in Bosnia after Dec. 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States will keep a
substantial number of U.S. troops in Bosnia at least month after
the NATO-led peacekeeping mission ends in December.
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced by the Pentagon today, was a departure
from the original plan.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff told the
House International Relations Committee that "our policy is to
have all U.S. troops out on or about the 14th of December. There
is no plan to delay the withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
In a briefing today, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that
NATO commanders had decided to keep a "significant force" in
Bosnia up to the final day of the mission, which tentatively is
set for December 20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that it remained to be determined exactly
how many of the 20,000 U.S. troops now involved in the NATO
Implementation Force will stay beyond December 20.
</P>
<P>
Some officials said it would be at least several thousand.
</P>
<P>
According to Bacon, the change in the withdrawal plans was
because the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
had asked NATO to keep its full force there until after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that General George Joulwan, the top
commander of the NATO-led mission in Bosnia, has decided to let
some troops withdrawn before December 20, but keep most of the
Implementation Force there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves 1996 Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress approved
today the final spending bill of fiscal 1996 and sent it to
President Clinton for signing.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the budget was almost seven months after the
fiscal year started on October 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
With a strong majority of both parties, the U.S. Senate
approved the bill with a vote of 88-11 soon after the House of
Representatives voted 399-25 in its favor.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Clinton would sign it as soon as it
reached his desk, averting a lapse in spending authority at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
The bill covers nine Cabinet-level departments and dozens of
agencies for the remaining five months of the fiscal year. The
enactment of the bill would mark the end of the long 1996 budget
standoff, which included two partial government shutdowns totaling
27 days.
</P>
<P>
With the agreement on the 1996 budget, both parties of the
United States declared the victory on the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans said the new budget's savings over 1995
spending -- about 23 billion dollars, as according Congressional
Budget Office -- represents a Republican win.
</P>
<P>
"In a situation where we have a liberal president trying to get
more spending and trying to get more bureaucracy, it was a
remarkable achievement," said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Clinton's all-but-certain
opponent in the president election this fall, said, "It
demonstrates what a Republican Congress can do and we are very
proud of it."
</P>
<P>
But Democrats also claimed victory in the reordering of
spending priorities over the original House-passed spending bills,
which were vetoed by Clinton. They won roughly 5 billion dollars
more for education, environmental protection, job training and
other domestic priorities.
</P>
<P>
"The president of course did very well in these negotiations,"
said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. "We feel we came out
quite good."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Clinton has been appealing to Congress to
resume work on a plan to balance the budget in seven years.
</P>
<P>
But Gingrich said he and Dole would develop a "yardstick" to
measure the sincerity of any new administration balanced-budget
proposals.
</P>
<P>
"If the president's prepared to do something real, of course we
can reach agreement. But no more phony photo ops," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's GDP Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's economy is well on the
way of recovery as the gross domestic product (GDP) increased by
2.6 percent in 1995 after recording an overall decline of 24.4
percent in the previous six years.
</P>
<P>
The GDP rose to 817.4 billion leva (about 9.9 billion
U.S. dollars) last year, the country's Statistics Bureau reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The private sector contributed 44.7 percent of the GDP,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the state-run enterprises were in the red
with losses totaling 29.5 billion leva (about 335 million dollars)
last year.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov said the government will
speed up the process of privatization, in an effort to boost the private
sector's share of the GDP to 45-47 percent this year and 60-65
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
His economic aides said last week that the government will
close down about 100 loss-suffering firms and punish those
businesses which account for 60 percent of the total
losses.

BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest diamond will
be offered to the King of Thailand to mark his 50 years on the
throne, according to reports today.
</P>
<P>
The diamond, weighing 545.7 carats, was bought by a consortium
of Thai business people early this year and will be given to King
Bhumibol Adulyadej as a present.
</P>
<P>
It will later be inlaid in the royal scepter.

It took more than three years for specialists to cut and polish
the 755.5-carat rough gem which was discovered in the Premier Mine
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The diamond, baptized "Unnamed Brown," exceeded the weight of
the second biggest diamond, the Cullinan (the Great Star of
Africa), by 15 carats.
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazing diamond. It gives a 72 percent yield which is
very unusual. A diamond usually gives a yield of maximum 40, 45
percent from rough to polished but this was an exceptional,
exceptional stone, both in shape as in color," said the chief
polisher, Gabi Tolkowsky.

The diamond is on its way to the United States for a series of
exhibitions, Tolkowsky said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia to Test Missile Defense Jointly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon announced today
the United States and Russia will conduct missile defense training
in a joint exercise in June at the U.S. Space Command in Colorado
Spring.
</P>
<P>
A mock scenario will be used for the exercises to coordinate
the two countries' missile defense systems against a common
enemy's incoming missile, said Ashton Carter, Assistant Secretary
of Defense for International Security Policy. That means the
whole testing will be carried out by computer simulators, with no
missile to be fired.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to test theater missile defenses that protect
forces in the field against short- and medium-range threats. Each
country will have a team of 15 members to participate in the
computer-simulated maneuvers, with the U.S. team operating a
Patriot PAC-3 battery and the Russians using the SA-12
anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
Cater said that U.S. and Russian military officials hope to
learn, through the exercises, how best to divide coverage of the
battle space with their missile defense weaponry to enable the
systems to work efficiently side by side.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was agreed upon by President Clinton and his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin at their 1994 summit in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William Perry in a speech today
criticized a missile defense plan introduced by Congressional
Republicans, which he said could threaten nuclear treaties with
Russia and in turn "jeopardize the elimination of an additional
3,200 former soviet nuclear warheads."
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan calls for deployment of a national missile
defense system by 2003, while a Pentagon plan favors developing a
system over the next three years that could be deployable in
another three years if a future threat assessment proves it
necessary. The Republicans attacked the Clinton administration
for being soft on missile defense. The House of Representatives
will take up the issue next month.

<HEADLINE> Germany Ranks Third in Beer Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany ranks third in the world in
beer production, behind the United States and China, according to
a recent report issued by the German beer industry.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Germans each drank 140 liters of beer on
average last year, but this was not enough for them to retake the
world beer-drinking laurels, which were captured by the Czech
Republic in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, German beer still leads the world beer market in
quality although its production has fallen to third place.
</P>
<P>
Half of the Germans drink beer once or twice a week and most of
them are professional men. About 36 percent of German women and
44 percent of young men never drink beer, which is the second most
favorite "national beverage," next only to coffee.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,250 beer breweries with 49,000 employees in
Germany, producing 5,000 brands of beer in all. The country's
annual beer sales total 20 billion marks (about 13.5 billion U.S.
dollars), giving the government 1.8 billion marks (about 1.2
million dollars) in revenues every year.

<HEADLINE> Germany Plans to Reform Welfare System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The German government finalized
today plans to reform its welfare system, calling for a two-year
wage freeze for government employees and a reduction in sick leave
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl hopes to save 50 billion marks (about 32
billion U.S. dollars) from the budget in a bid to vitalize
Germany's stagnant economy, fight the record-high unemployment and
try to meet the criteria to join the European Union's monetary
union.
</P>
<P>
The success of the plan is still much at stake. Trade unions
and major opposition parties are ready to oppose the measures.
Without the cooperation of trade unions, the wage freeze would be
unlikely to be carried out, and the main opposition party the
Social Democrats have threatened to veto the plan in the upper
house of parliament where they have a majority.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan, to be presented to the parliament on Friday,
also wins some support. Finance Minister Theo Waigel defended
Kohl as saying: "there's no material to play with in such a
serious matter."

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan FM: Crisis in Paraguay Affects MERCOSUR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan Foreign Minister
Alvaro Ramos said today the recent crisis in Paraguay will cast a
shadow over the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) though it
has been averted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press early this morning shortly before
returning from Paraguay, Ramos said the international community
will doubt the political stability of the MERCOSUR, of which
Paraguay is a member.
</P>
<P>
He added that the political unrest in Paraguay will put the
MERCOSUR in a unfavorable condition when it is negotiating with
other international economic and trade organizations such as the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, Paraguay's army commander Lino Cesar Oviedo
refused to resign as ordered by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy,
sparking the most serious crisis since the recovery of democracy
in the South American country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
After some 30 hours of negotiations and under national and
international pressures, Oviedo surrendered his leadership of the
army to General Carlos Diaz Delmas Wednesday morning in exchange
for the post of defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister paid a swift visit to Paraguay to show
Uruguay's full support to President Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
"What happened will affect its international image," stressed
the foreign minister of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he also saw the positive side of the event,
praising the quick and unanimous reaction to the crisis by
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, Paraguay's three partners in the
MERCOSUR.
</P>
<P>
"The MERCOSUR has just shown that it is able to react quickly
and that it is entering into a phase of institutional maturity
without which the results, undoubtedly, would have been different."
</P>
<P>
Asked about his opinion of the crisis outcome, Ramos said he
was not in the place to comment Wasmosy's decision, but he pointed
out that "the crisis was not establishing clear game rules and
there was a real danger that the government could have fallen."

<P>
BUCHAREST, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders from countries
in the Black Sea region gathered here today to discuss how to
strengthen economic cooperation with former Yugoslav republics and
Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a letter to
the forum, said he was glad to know the meeting will be devoted to
reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said the restoration of relations between the former
Yugoslav republics and their neighbors will contribute to the
European integration process.
</P>
<P>
The four-day Business Forum of the 11-nation Black Sea Economic
Cooperation zone (BSEC) will also discuss economic development in
a transitional period, stability and security in the region and
its outlook in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Ion Iliescu, Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov and hundreds of businessmen from non-BSEC countries also
attended this afternoon's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, foreign ministers of 10 BSEC member nations --
Bulgaria, Macedonia, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Russia, Greece,
Albania, Ukraine and Romania -- will also meet here for talks on
regional security and economic cooperation. Another BSEC member,
Azerbaijan, will not send its foreign minister to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Romanian Presidential Office told a news
conference today that the two meetings will be conducive to
progress and cooperation among the BSEC countries.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said Greek and Turkish foreign ministers
would probably discuss the possibility to improve bilateral
relations which have been marred by regular disputes over some
islets in the Aegean Sea.

<P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Elementary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged government departments at all levels to pay closer attention
to the development of elementary education, the China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government departments responsible for elementary
education, which includes preschool, primary and junior middle
school levels, should accomplish the following tasks by the end of
2000: to popularize nine-year compulsory education across the
country, to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged
people, to improve the quality of education and strive to increase
funding for this level of education.
</P>
<P>
"To fulfill these tasks, government departments concerned at
all levels should attach great importance to the promotion of
elementary education," said vice-premier Li Lanqing at a recent
national conference on education.
</P>
<P>
The China Educational Reform and Development Agenda requires
that the growth of government spending on education must outpace
that of a regular revenue. By the end of this century, government
should be spending 4 percent of the gross national product on
education.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), a special
regulation on financial input into compulsory education will be
worked out. "This will give a legal guarantee to funding levels
for the country's compulsory education," said Li.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1990s, primary and junior middle school
students will increase by 25 million. New schools and teaching
equipment will be required. To satisfy the huge demand, other
social sectors are expected to contribute to education funding,
added Li.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Criminal Court of Thailand
has ruled to extradite a second suspected lieutenant of Khun Sa to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meechai Pathumanee, or Wu Chang-lee, could be sent to the US to
stand trial on drug charges within three months if the Appeal
Court upholds the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Meechai, said to be Khun Sa's logistics officer, could be the
third drug suspect extradited to the US after former Chart Thai
Party MP Thanong Siripreechapong and Chao Fu-sheng, or Vicha
Sitthiphan, an associate of Khun Sa, who capitulated to the
Myanmar government in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Meechai and Vicha and eight others were arrested in November
1994 in Thailand at the request of the US Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
A New York Court has indicted them on suspicion of involvement
in an attempt to smuggle 300 kg of heroin into the US three years

<P>
Meanwhile, drug baron Khun Sa has reportedly won the right to
operate a bus company in Myanmar and Thai narcotics agents were

Popov clocked in 48.88 seconds, 0.67 seconds off his world mark
set in 1994.

The Russian championships will be his last Olympic warm-up,
said Popov who will fly to Australia to train for the Olympic

<HEADLINE> More Intellectual Property Rights Lawsuits in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Courts in south China's
Guangdong Province are taking some steps to improve their ability
to handle the rapidly increasing number of intellectual property
rights cases, officials here say.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the intermediate people's court of Guangzhou alone
handled 134 cases, an increase of 65 percent over the previous
year, and settled 93 of them, an increase of 150 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
A large number of the cases involve trademarks and name
brands. Officials said this means an improvement in the legal
system as well as greater awareness of intellectual property
rights both among enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
There are still many difficulties in clarifying facts,
gathering evidence, and getting a conviction in such cases, court
officials say, explaining that there is a growing number of cases
and a limited number of law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
The intermediate people's court of Guangzhou set up an
intellectual property right tribunal last year, and it has
recently sponsored a training program for local court personnel.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Build China's Largest Chemical Industry Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A 30-sq-km chemical industry zone
is to be built in this north China port city in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
When completed, it will be the largest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The zone is estimated to cost a total of nearly 10 billion US
dollars to build, 1.1 billion US dollars of which will be injected
into the first phase of construction before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The first phase is expected to complete construction on two sq
km. There will be 12 complete sets of equipment to produce 200,000
tons of PVC, 50,000 tons of epoxy resin, 100,000 tons of
polystyrene, 50,000 tons of caustic soda, and other products.
</P>
<P>
By then, the zone is expected to have more than 800 million US
dollars in annual sales, with pre-tax profits reaching 180 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A total of five billion US dollars is expected to be poured
into the second phase of construction, during the 2000-2005
period, when installations will be set up in a 10-sq-km area with
the aim of making 3.2 billion US dollars in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
By then the zone will be able to produce 600,000 tons of
ethylene and to refine 10 million tons of petroleum.

<HEADLINE> UN General Assembly Condemns Israeli Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General Assembly
on Thursday voted to condemn the Israeli military attacks against
the civilian population in Lebanon, especially against the U.N.
base at Qana, which it says violate the rules of international
humanitarian law pertaining to the protection of civilian.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was adopted by 64-2 votes in favor with
65 abstention, called upon Israel to immediately cease its
military action against the territorial integrity of Lebanon and
to withdraw forthwith its forces from all Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel were the only two countries which
voted against the resolution. Israel has been arguing that it had
been counter-fighting Hezbollah guerrillas for their rocket
attacks on Northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the resolution was the climax of a three-day
plenary meeting of the General Assembly, during which a majority
number of countries condemned Israel for its military attacks
against Southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the General Assembly requested U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to dispatch a special
technical mission to the area to study and prepare within one
month's time, in cooperation with the United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon, a report on the human and material losses and damage
resulting from the recent and ongoing hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that Lebanon is entitled to appropriate
redress for the destruction it has suffered and that Israel is
responsible for such compensation.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Amend Copyright Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government tabled its
amendments to the Copyright Act in the House of Commons today,
with a view to better protecting the interests of the country's
arts and cultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The copyright reform bill, which was tabled by Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps and
Industry Minister John Manley, will entitle sound recording
performers and producers to royalty payments from those who use
their recordings for public performance or broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Under current laws, only authors such as composers and
lyricists receive royalties.
</P>
<P>
To discourage private copying, a levy will be collected on all
blank audio media such as cassettes and tapes sold in Canada. The
proceeds from the levy will be redistributed to eligible
composers, lyricists, performers and producers of sound recordings
through their professional associations or collectives.
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed measures are also provisions to give
exclusive distributors of books in Canada greater protection in
the Canadian market, and exceptions from copyright laws for groups
such as non-profit educational institutions, libraries, archives
and museums, as well as people with perceptual disabilities.
</P>
<P>
"These measures are about fairness and they acknowledge the
rights of creators to receive recognition and remuneration for the
use of their works," Copps said in a press release from her
office.
</P>
<P>
"With this bill, Canada is joining 50 other countries,
including France, the United Kingdom and Japan, in modernizing its
copyright laws," the woman minister said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's arts and cultural sector employs 670,000 creators and
producers and contributes about 12 billion U.S. dollars to the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
"Measures that strengthen this sector, in both domestic and
world markets, are crucial to Canada's identity," Minister Manley
added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments won support from the recording
industry. In the meantime, they drew immediate opposition from the
Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB).
</P>
<P>
Lost jobs and greatly reduced community service are inevitable
in the wake of new music fees that radio stations would pay under
the amendments, said CAB President Michael MaCabe.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that at least half of any neighbouring rights
money would flow to foreign performers, especially those of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
At present, U.S. television networks, specialty services and
superstations have entered some 80 percent of Canadian homes.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Copyright Act, which came into force in 1924, has
been in the process of modernization since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 amendments included an exhibition right for artistic
works, explicit protection of computer programs. A year later, the
copyright act was further amended to require cable and satellite
companies to pay for retransmission of works included in distant
broadcast signals.
</P>
<P>
The act was further amended in 1993 to redefine "musical work"
to clarify that it covered both graphic and acoustic
representations of music, and to ensure that all transmitters were
liable for royalties.
</P>
<P>
The latest amendment came in 1994, when a rental right for
sound recordings and computer programs was included in the act.

<HEADLINE> Djukic Vows to Prove Innocent of War Crime Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Djordje Djukic, a Bosnian Serb
General who arrived here today after being released from the Hague
tribunal jail, announced that he intended to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
"My reputation must remain untarnished, because I have done
nothing to deserve to be hauled before the international tribunal
and, if my health state permits, I shall return to see this trial
through," said Djukic who is suffering cancer and in poor health.
</P>
<P>
The Hague-based War Crimes Tribunal for former Yugoslavia
provisionally released the Serb general from custody on Wednesday
because of his deteriorated health, but has not dropped charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
Djukic's statement to this effect was read out to reporters at
Belgrade airport today by his lawyer Milan Vujin.
</P>
<P>
Djukic, a logistic officer in the Serb Army, arrived in
Belgrade this afternoon from the Hague, where he had spent more
than two months in the tribunal's detention. He was arrested on
January 30 by the Muslim authority on war crimes charges and
extradited to the Hague from Sarajevo on February 12 for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Djukic does not want the case against him discontinued for
health reasons and would like it to be resumed as soon as his
health makes it possible, until a final verdict of acquittal has
been reached," Vujin said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The NBA Board of Governors
approved on Wednesday the concept of the women's National
Basketball Association to begin play as a summer league in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We think this is an idea whose time has come," said NBA
Commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
"Fans have come to appreciate the excellence of women's
basketball and we believe that singnificant network and sponsor
opportunities exist to create a foundation on which to build a
league."
</P>
<P>
"Today's approval is only the first step in what will be an
intensive, ongoing process," continued Stern.
</P>
<P>
"The new league, which we believe has the greatest chance for
success in the Summer when arena availability and television time
are most plentiful, is dependent upon cable and over-the-air
network arrangement."
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the number of teams, the cities and the
television arrangements will be announced in early July.

<HEADLINE> NZ Forestry Holds Big Promise of Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Trade
Development Board (Tradenz) has selected forestry products as a
priority export item, saying the industry could do better to tap
its potential.
</P>
<P>
In a document entitled Stretching for Growth, Tradenz said the
forestry needs to define its targets more clearly to get the most
from its export potential.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992/93 and 1994/95, forestry earned 2.6 billion NZ
dollars (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) in foreign exchange, an
increase of 360 million NZ dollars (241 million U.S. dollars)
compared with the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Projections suggest that the industry would earn 3.6 billion NZ
dollars (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) for the year 2000/01. But with
more innovation and efficiency, the earnings could reach 5.2
billion NZ dollars (3.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tradenz has identified a number of ways to get more value from
the country's major forestry variety, pinus radiata. The methods
include increasing the use of quality systems in wood processing
to guarantee standards, and reducing waste to reposition the
industry into higher value-added market niches.

<HEADLINE> Howard Flag Plan May Be Unconstitutional: Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian legal experts have
warned that proposed legislation to protect the national flag from
changes could face challenges in the High Court.
</P>
<P>
George Winterton, professor of constitutional law at the
University of New South Wales, said that it would contravene the
Constitution if the Coalition Government puts into legislation the
result of a referendum on the flag issue, The Australian newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard has proposed to pass a legislation
that no political party could change the national flag unless a
referendum or plebiscite is held.
</P>
<P>
Winterton said that according to section one of the
Constitution, federal power vests in the Queen and the two houses
of the Parliament. By ordering that future governments hold a
referendum on the flag to pass legislation, the Howard Government
would be effectively placing a fourth power in the Parliament,
that is, the people who vote through referendum, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Saunders, director of the Center for Comparative
Constitutional Studies, agreed that such legislation had potential
problems because of section one of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said that technically "unconstitutional" legislation had
passed in Parliament previously.
</P>
<P>
However, the legislation proposed by Howard looks set to pass
parliament examination, because the Australian Democrats and the
Opposition Labor party do not oppose the act.
</P>
<P>
But Winterton said the legislation could not be legally
binding.
</P>
<P>
"It would be political," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said interest groups could challenge the legislation in the
High Court or future governments could repeal the legislation and
still change the flag.
</P>
<P>
Both the Labor party and the Democrats have questioned Howard's
timing, raising the flag issue on Anzac Day that fell on
yesterday, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am astonished he thinks this is the most important issue to
talk about on Anzac Day," Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't see why it should be one of his legislative
priorities when there is no mainstream political party seeking to
change the flag," Labor leader Kim Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who personally supports the flag, said that he was not
playing politics on the flag issue, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very simple proposition that we will amend the Flag Act
so that in future there can be no change to the Australian flag
without all of the Australian people being consulted in a
plebiscite or referendum," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Bank to Increase Base Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of Bulgaria
decided today to increase the base interest rate in an effort
to curb the further depreciation of the Bulgarian lev.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the base rate will go up to 67 percent from
the current 49 percent beginning April 26.
</P>
<P>
Lyubomir Philipov, president of the People's Bank, explained
that the decision was made not due to inflation but because of
the serious devaluation of the Bulgarian currency on foreign
exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, the lev has slid by about 10 percent
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the drop, the foreign exchange reserves in
Bulgaria last month fell to 703 million dollars from 1.2 billion
dollars at the end of last year, making it difficult for the
country to repay its 1.2 billion dollar external debts.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Women Seek Chain Store Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,000 unemployed women
in Beijing recently flooded to a local labor market, as the local
Red Apple Trade Incorporated's 100 chain stores advertised for
2,000 to 2,500 sales clerks.
</P>
<P>
According to the "China Youth Daily", 70 percent of the
company's sales clerks will be women, who should be aged above 35,
while the men sales clerks should be aged above 40.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the company is the first one to hire displaced
women from local industrial enterprises and it is rare for so many
sales clerks to be sought at one time.
</P>
<P>
Twenty days after receiving medical checkups and passing
qualification exams those qualified will start work at the
company's 100 chain stores which will be scattered around the city.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has some 100,000 displaced workers, and the
municipal government has decided to offer, as a one-time payment,
3,000 yuan (about 120 US dollars) to units that provide at least
two years' employment for males above the age of 40 or females
above 35.
</P>
<P>
In recent years middle-aged laid-off women have found it
difficult to find new jobs. However, in 1995 an airline company in
Shanghai started to hire such women as stewardesses.

<HEADLINE> Djukic Arrives in Belgrade from Hague Tribunal Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Army General
Djordje Djukic arrived here today after being released on
Wednesday by the Hague international tribunal for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Serb General, suffering pancreas cancer, was
immediately taken to the Military Academy hospital in Belgrade
upon his arrival at the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
The Hague-based tribunal had provisionally released Djukic on
Wednesday "for humanitarian reasons" while his defense lawyers
said in Belgrade today they were only "partly satisfied with this
ruling."
</P>
<P>
Djukic's lawyers said that the tribunal should drop charges
against Djukic because of a lack of evidence against him, Tanjug
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Even the tribunal's chief prosecutor Richard Goldstone filed an
objection to this ruling by the court, saying that the proceedings
against General Djukic should be completely stopped.
</P>
<P>
Djukic and Colonel Aleksa Krsmanovic were arrested by the
Muslim authorities on January 30 in Sarajevo on their way to a
meeting with IFOR officials on charges of committing war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two senior officers were extradited to the Hague on
February 12 for further investigation although they were not on
the list of suspects of war crimes. Krsmanovic was released
earlier this month by the Hague tribunal due to lack of evidence
and sent back to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Djukic pleaded not guilty at the Hague tribunal hearings,
arguing he had not taken part in any battles during the war in
Bosnia as he was a rear officer.

<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mongolian President
Punsalmaagin Ochirbat said today that the on-going economic
reforms in Mongolia have made marked achievements in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Ochirbat, who arrived
here on Monday for an official visit, said that his country was
finally on the verge of long happiness after several traumatic
years of economic reforms
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the country's 6.3 percent economic growth
rate in 1995 was almost respectable even by the demanding
standards of Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the economic reforms over the past few years, he said
that moving from a planned economy to a free market economy was
never an easy task despite Mongolia's rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
After overcoming various difficulties, he noted the country's
economy was now recovering and the capital investment in Mongolia
rose 25 percent to 190 million U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The inflation is officially forecast to fall to 35 percent this
year from 53 percent in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day visit, the Mongolian President held
separate talks with British Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to exchange views
of common interest.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Expressing deep concern at
the recent degeneration of security conditions and political
cooperation in Burundi, the U.N. Security Council condemned all
acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council urged the authorities
and all parties in Burundi to set aside their differences and
demonstrate the necessary peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
It also called upon all Burundians to renounce the use of
violence and to engage in a comprehensive dialogue to ensure a
peaceful future for the people of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The council asked U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
to expedite consultations with member states on steps to support a
comprehensive dialogue and for a rapid humanitarian response in
the event of widespread violence or serious deterioration in the
humanitarian situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council on 23 April, Boutros-Ghali
reported that the security situation in Burundi took another turn
for the worse during the month of March.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting, which used to be concentrated in the northern
part of the country, has now spread to areas in the south
previously untouched by the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, some serious differences have appeared
between the president and the prime minister, particularly on the
issue of negotiations with the armed opposition.
</P>
<P>
The president publicly favors negotiations on condition that
the rebels give up violence, while the prime minister opposes any
negotiation with Hutu-led groups and has invited the Tutsi
community to arm itself.

<HEADLINE> Survey Forecasts Surge in UK Consumer Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain is set for a consumer boom
this year which will outstrip even the government's upbeat
forecast for consumer spending growth, a leading economic
forecaster said today.
</P>
<P>
Business Strategies Limited (BSL) said in its latest survey of
consumer attitudes that it expected spending to grow by four
percent to 4.5 percent in 1996, even outstripping Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke's upbeat forecast of 3.5 percent, which many
economists believed as overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
BSL said that the pick-up would be strong enough to threaten
the government's inflation target of 2.5 percent underlying
inflation, and it also meant interest rates would have to rise.
</P>
<P>
The survey will intensify the debate on whether a return of
consumer confidence would deliver strong economic growth this
year.
</P>
<P>
The upbeat outlook for the consumer side of the economy is in
sharp contrast to gloomy surveys of manufacturing, which point to
stagnating industry.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 6 to 5, with

fewer than the 493.34 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 6.37 to 1,183.20,
setting a new record for the sixth straight session. The index has
