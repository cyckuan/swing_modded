<HEADLINE> State Department Accuses Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States accused Hezbollah guerrillas  
in Lebanon of dramatically escalating a cross-border conflict with 
Israel and asked Syrian authorities to impose ``maximum restraint'' 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to have Israel and Syria reopen peace talks, State  
Department spokesman James P. Rubin expressed anxiety over the 
fighting Friday and said the situation has become ``not a good 
climate for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret the loss of life on both sides,'' the U.S.  
official said. ``We call on all parties, including those with 
influence with Hezbollah, to exercise maximum restraint and to calm 
this dangerous situation.'' The reference to the guerrilla 
organization was a message clearly meant for Syria, the main power 
broker in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	With the election of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister and  
indications from Syria the time may be ripe to resume peace talks, 
this week's breakout of violence disappointed American policy 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Wednesday, Syrian President Hafez Assad was reported to  
have described Barak as ``strong and honest'' while the incoming 
Israeli leader told the Arab newspaper Al Hayat that he saw Syria 
as a cornerstone of peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view is the situation escalated dramatically as a result  
of Hezbollah's firing barrages of Katyusha rockets into northern 
Israel,'' Rubin said Friday. He said Israel then retaliated with 
strikes against civilian facilities in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the new fighting, Rubin said: ``It is difficult to  
see how the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace tracks can 
move forward in circumstances such as these.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports from the Middle East say Israeli warplanes killed nine  
Lebanese and wounded 57 late Thursday and early Friday. Hezbollah 
rockets killed two Israeli civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, defended his  
country's devastating retaliation. In a Fox News Channel interview, 
he said the guerrillas launched an unprovoked attack that killed 
two Israelis, a father of four and a father of two, and seriously 
injured another Israeli. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have exercised restraint for the last three years,'' Shoval  
said. ``But you know, enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ambassador said, ``Maybe the Hezbollah terrorists really  
wanted to test Israel because we have had a change of government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent State Department report on global terrorism  
describes Hezbollah as a radical Shiite Muslim group formed in 
Lebanon and closely allied with, and often directed by, Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Hezbollah is known or suspected of involvement  
in many attacks against the United States, including the suicide 
truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Marine barracks in 
Beirut in 1983 and the U.S. Embassy annex in the Lebanese capital 
in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Opera `Aida' Goes Live on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The image was tiny and the sound lo-fi when a  
production of Verdi's ``Aida'' from Verona, Italy, made history 
Friday as the first opera to be broadcast live over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The sold-out opening-night production at the 77th Verona Opera  
Festival was made available online through IBM, which estimated 
that 50,000 to 100,000 people clicked on to the Web site, 
www.ibm.com/it/aida. 
</P>
<P>
	When watched and listened to on different computers, the sound  
was distant and not fine enough to judge voice quality. On a 
computer with supposedly better sound quality, the voices broke up 
or reverberated. 
</P>
<P>
	Singers' movements were jerky, and the images, which were only 2  
inches high, were dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Next to the tiny picture, a viewer could scroll the libretto of  
the opera in English or Italian. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fascinating precedent. We'll all be watching to note  
video and audio quality,'' David Gockley, general director of the 
Houston Grand Opera, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet clearly will no doubt become the main delivery  
system for in-home fine arts performances. American producers, 
artists and unions need to wake up and make sure we can capture our 
share of the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But David Mann, moderator of a weekly classical-music Internet  
chat session, said: ``Listening to music on a computer speaker is 
like taking a bath with your socks on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rock music has already been here and done that. A group called  
Severe Tire Damage performed live over the Internet in 1993. A year 
later, the Rolling Stones broadcast over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ``Aida'' broadcast, the Web site offered, in addition  
to the libretto, background information such as a history of the 
15,000-seat amphitheater, built in 100 A.D. under the Romans and 
used for gladiator battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, a Verdi biographer, was horrified to  
read that ``Aida'' was commissioned for the opening of the Suez 
Canal in 1869, when it really was commissioned for the opening of a 
new opera house in Cairo that year. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has another Internet first this week: the tennis matches  
from Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The image is small. It's not like watching TV,'' IBM spokesman  
Ian Colley said.''The advantage is, you can pull up background 
information on the players, who's playing who, statistics and 
what's going on on other courts. You can customize what you 
watch.''

<HEADLINE> Little Benefit in Doctor Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer groups, employers and federal  
regulators are warning that a drive by doctors to form unions won't 
deliver on promises for better health care. Even worse, they say, 
powerful doctor unions could bring higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Union supporters say doctors need more negotiating clout to win  
back control of patient care from health maintenance organizations, 
which are often accused of unfairly restricting treatment to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	That argument helped convince the American Medical Association  
on Thursday to support forming doctor unions, a move that reversed 
a long-held position. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side are those who feel the doctors are more  
concerned about restoring lucrative fees they've lost due to HMO 
curbs on care. 
</P>
<P>
	To some, the fight is similar to sports team owners and their  
millionaire athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a debate between those earning six figures (doctors)  
and those earning seven figures (health insurance executives),'' 
said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a Washington 
D.C. consumer health group. ``If doctors salaries escalate, 
consumers will end up paying a price for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pollack said unions may help restore some balance between  
doctors and HMOs in making patient care decisions. But he said 
patient protection legislation now pending in Congress would do 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills would give patients the right to appeal HMO coverage  
decisions to an impartial review board, Pollack said. They would 
also encourage HMO coverage of newer and more effective drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Employer groups -- who pay most health insurance premiums and  
often side with insurers -- worry the HMOs would have to increase 
their premiums if they must give doctors more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors are clearly frustrated, but we don't see this as a  
solution,'' said Sally Coberly, director of public policy at the 
Washington Business Group on Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA's vote was largely symbolic because under current  
federal law only salaried doctors -- such as those employed by 
hospitals, HMOs or government -- have the right to unionize. 
Independent practitioners, who account for six out of seven U.S. 
doctors, are barred from unionizing by antitrust laws designed to 
protect the public from price fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the number of unionized doctors is growing. Of the  
600,000 doctors nationally, roughly 40,000 belong to unions, up 
from only about 25,000 two years ago. Experts predict the numbers 
will continue to grow because of the AMA vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Congress and several states are considering  
legislation giving independent doctors the right to collectively 
bargain. Texas this week became the first to pass a law to give 
doctors that leverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission opposes such laws, saying they  
could hurt consumers. Indeed, the FTC has fined doctors in central 
Virginia for banding together to block a new health plan from 
entering their market because they objected to its lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said  
unions have one main goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unions enhance the quality of life for the union member,'' he  
said. Teacher unions don't necessarily improve education to 
students, said Reinhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barry Liebowitz, president of the National Doctors Alliance,  
a union representing 15,000 physicians, said unions will ensure 
that doctors get enough time to treat patients and provide 
appropriate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, unionized doctors can be more assertive in fighting  
for coverage on behalf of patients without fearing retribution from 
the HMO, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driving force here has not been the loss of income but the  
loss of being able to practice their profession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some doctors aren't sure unions are the solution.  
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors are at wits end because they can't get the message  
across that quality care costs money and we are grasping for 
anything,'' said Dr. Jana Rasmussen, a West Palm Beach plastic 
surgeon. ``The union has been the bright shining star that might 
turn things around so doctors can be paid appropriately.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Look To Finish Off Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jaren Jackson imagined showing off his  
championship ring at the summer pickup games with other 
ex-Georgetown players. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Daniels wondered aloud about the victory parade. Sean  
Elliott talked about getting ``away from the game a little bit,'' 
the day before the biggest game in San Antonio Spurs history. 
</P>
<P>
	Are the Spurs overconfident about their chances of closing out  
the New York Knicks tonight and winning their first NBA 
championship? Or are they simply up on their history, fully aware 
that no team has ever blown a 3-1 lead in the finals? 
</P>
<P>
	Game 5 at Madison Square Garden will provide the answer tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	``You'd have to be an idiot not to want to close it out,'' Spurs  
coach Gregg Popovich said. ``But we also know that if we think in 
terms that it's already done, we'll be in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``You haven't done a thing until you win number four. If you  
don't keep that attitude, you'll be playing a Game 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here, Popovich sounds like the most ardent, optimistic Knicks  
fan. That is exactly the rally cry being used by the Knicks as they 
face a do-or-die fifth game that could end their strange, emotional 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone has to say anything,'' said New York's  
Latrell Sprewell, not ready for his whirlwind return to basketball 
to end just yet. ``If we lose, it's over with. Everyone here knows 
that. I think guys will be ready to come out and play harder than 
we ever have, because there's no tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Spurs, the job is simple. Don't let up, and don't let  
the Knicks send them back to San Antonio for anything other than a 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who seem to play their best when the situation seems  
most desperate, have the most clearly defined situation known to 
sports. Win one game, keep playing. Lose, go home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not out of it until they win it,'' New York's Larry  
Johnson said. ``We're very capable of winning this game. We should 
win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the Knicks have responded to controversy, adversity and  
angst all season, they almost seem more comfortable now that they 
face elimination. This is a team that was 21-21 with two weeks left 
in the season, squeezed into the playoffs and became the first 
eighth-seeded team to make the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, there was Allan Houston's shot against Miami,  
Johnson's 4-point play against Indiana and a stream of rumor, 
innuendo and dissension that never seemed to end; in fact, doesn't 
end to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spree said something to me at the beginning of this series  
that he said stuck with him,'' Johnson said. ``I remember Spree 
saying, `Look at our team, look at our talent. Why can't we win a 
championship?' 
</P>
<P>
	``Should we not play? We've still got to play.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just when the Spurs are on the brink of their first title, a  
championship that would touch the hearts of people like George 
``Iceman'' Gervin, they face a Knicks team that embraces the idea 
of having nothing to lose. Outside the Garden, a three-story tall 
tapestry reads, ``We Still Believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All we have to do is win one home game,'' Knicks coach Jeff  
Van Gundy said. ``Then we can go down there and get one road game. 
And then you're playing the ultimate game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's job was believed to be in jeopardy when the Knicks  
almost failed to make the playoffs, but he said Thursday their 
postseason success has brought assurances from team president Dave 
Checketts that Van Gundy will be asked to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really up in the air,'' Van Gundy told the New York  
Times. ``Dave made it clear to me he wants me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he has no desire to coach elsewhere, but that he  
and Checketts will wait until after the finals to discuss the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never wanted to be someplace else,'' he was quoted as  
telling the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Spurs would no doubt enjoy clinching at home on  
Sunday, the ultimate game for them is tonight. Steve Kerr, who won 
three titles with the Chicago Bulls, understands the difficulty of 
closing out a championship series no matter where it's played. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go out onto the floor beforehand to warm up, and the NBA  
is rehearsing their celebration ceremony,'' Kerr said. ``They've 
got the stage set up and they're actually taking it down and you're 
like, `Hey, we haven't even won yet.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And then you've got to snap out of that and say, `Stop it.  
It's time to play.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	If Kerr had heard some comments from his teammates, he might  
have been quite upset. Jackson, perhaps prematurely, wondered how 
he would approach former Georgetown players like Patrick Ewing, 
Alonzo Mourning and Allen Iverson this summer with his championship 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say anything, I'm not going to initiate  
anything. Let them start, then I'll open my mouth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, one of the Spurs who finally gave some help to Tim  
Duncan and David Robinson with 14 points in a 96-89 victory in Game 
4, said, ``Now is the time to get away from the game a little bit. 
You don't want to think about it too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go back to your hotel and sit there and think about the  
game tomorrow, and it occupies your mind the entire time, I don't 
think you perform as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another victory would allow the Spurs to finish 15-2 and tie the  
1989 Detroit Pistons and 1991 Chicago Bulls for the second-best 
postseason record in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	And another victory would send the city of San Antonio into an  
all-night celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Against these Knicks, who will still be on the court tonight,  
San Antonio had best hold off until the job is done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that you fight. You kind of dream about it. You  
sit in your room and things go through your mind and you fight 
it,'' Avery Johnson said. ``You're not afraid, but you just have a 
little fear of your attitude.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Aid for Aging Foster Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Friday to double federal  
spending on ``independent living'' programs for aging foster 
children who now are dropped from state care at age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which still requires Senate approval, also  
would permit states to continue Medicaid coverage for these 
youngsters through the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
	House lawmakers voted 380-6 in favor of the bill, which also has  
the Clinton administration's backing. Six Republicans voted against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is expected to cost $500 million over five years, paid  
for through new procedures to eliminate fraud and abuse in a 
benefit program for poor people with disabilities as well as other 
projected savings, lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in a statement, said the measure builds on  
proposals in his budget to provide foster care graduates with 
access to health care and increased educational opportunities, 
training, housing assistance, counseling and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our nation's foster youth, their 18th birthday can be the  
start of a very tough road alone,'' Clinton said. ``The end of 
foster care should not be the end of caring for these young 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Children who are removed from their homes because of abuse or  
neglect are supported by the government until they turn 18, when 
the federal and state assistance ends, regardless of how prepared 
they are for the real world. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 children are cut off from foster care annually. But  
two-thirds don't finish high school, 61 percent have no job skills 
and 38 percent are diagnosed as emotionally disturbed, said Rep. 
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., the House Ways and Means human resources 
subcommittee chairwoman and co-sponsor of the bill with Maryland 
Rep. Benjamin Cardin, the panel's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Most end up jobless, drug-addicted, pregnant or in jail, she  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are on their own and truly abandoned,'' Johnson said at a  
news conference following the vote. She described foster care as 
``probably the cruelest social program that our government 
participates in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill that we passed today changes all that,'' Johnson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its provisions, the legislation would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Double funding for the Independent Living Program, which  
teaches foster children such skills as how to find an apartment or 
balance a checkbook, from $70 million to $140 million a year to 
serve both younger and older children. States, for the first time, 
could use some of the money to help them pay for housing 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow states to extend Medicaid coverage, at a cost of up to  
$200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Permit foster care children to save up to $10,000, instead of  
the $1,000 now allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tighten eligibility rules for the Supplemental Security Income  
program, which serves poor Americans with disabilities, to reduce 
fraud and abuse. Savings would be applied to the foster care 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make minor changes in reimbursement rates to state child  
support programs, saving additional dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize $23 million in fiscal 2000 for incentive payments to  
states that increase their adoption levels. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make all World War II veterans eligible for continued, although  
slightly reduced, SSI benefits if they move outside the United 
States, for additional savings.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Down 3 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States has slipped by three to 563. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 110 were exploring for  
oil and 453 for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported 
Friday. During the same week last year, 823 rigs were operating in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom, but has set several record lows this year, bottoming out at 
498 on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Texas rose by six  
and New Mexico and Wyoming gained one rig each. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma lost four rigs, Alaska and Louisiana lost one each and  
California's tally remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE>  First Heisman Winner Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Jay Berwanger won the first Heisman Trophy in  
1935 without a glitzy public relations campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have his University of Chicago highlights shown on  
television. Nor did he have gaudy statistics by modern standards: 
577 rushing yards, 406 passing yards, 359 yards on kickoff returns, 
six touchdowns and five PATs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was enough to inaugurate an exclusive club.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, his 85th birthday, Berwanger was honored by other Heisman  
winners at the start of the second Husker-Heisman Weekend, a 
charity event organized by 1972 winner Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger sat with Rodgers, 1978 Heisman winner Billy Sims of  
Oklahoma, 1980 runner-up Hugh Green of Pittsburgh and former 
Nebraska players Willie Harper and Ahman Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one regret I had, I wish some of you boys with your size  
would have been playing with me,'' Berwanger said, standing with 
stooped shoulders. ``It would have made it easier to get around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger played nearly every position in the days before  
platoon football. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know any better,'' he said. ``I loved playing  
defense as much as offense. Today's platoon system lets more 
players play, so it's good for the game and good for colleges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Berwanger was more excited about winning the Silver  
Football, a trophy that had been given in the Chicago area about 10 
years. The Downtown Athletic Club award, as the Heisman was then 
called, was an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Chicago Tribune, there was an article that big,''  
Berwanger said, holding his thumb and finger two inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Word arrived via telegram at Berwanger's fraternity house,  
congratulating him for being named the nation's top player and 
advising that two tickets to New York were coming in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thrill was that it was going to be my first  
airplane trip,'' Berwanger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger, who grew up in Dubuque, Iowa, never played  
professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't paying enough money,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He tried newspaper work and officiating football but worked most  
of his life for a rubber company. 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger now lives in Oakbrook, Ill., where he enthusiastically  
follows college football and, like other Heisman winners, casts a 
ballot every fall in the Heisman Trophy voting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been lucky,'' he said with a smile. ``I've picked the  
right one the last four or five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger also tries to attend the Heisman ceremony that now is  
broadcast live on television. He said he has met many winners, and 
this weekend he plans to catch up with others at autograph 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some standouts expected in Omaha this weekend include 1980  
Heisman winner George Rogers of South Carolina, 1997 winner Charles 
Woodson of Michigan and last year's winner, Ricky Williams of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Rozier, who won the 1983 Heisman at Nebraska, is holding a  
charity golf event, former Nebraska tackle Eric Anderson has a 
youth football camp and a dinner is planned with Husker coach Frank 
Solich and former coach Tom Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers said the event raised $5,000 for Omaha youth charities  
last year.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Seeks Gun Control Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt prodded  
Republicans Thursday to negotiate a gun control compromise, 
acknowledging it would not contain everything the Senate passed and 
the White House and most Democrats want. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Gephardt, D-Mo., said it may be  
technically feasible over time to complete all background checks on 
purchasers at gun shows in less than three business days, including 
the small share of individuals for whom that is not now the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if there is a way to speed up that process with the 10  
percent over time, why wouldn't we be willing to do that?'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot compromise'' on an insistence that all purchasers at  
gun shows be subjected to an effective background check designed to 
screen out criminals and others who should not possess guns, 
Gephardt stressed in a telephone call later Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we get to that, the whole point ... is that in today's  
world you need three business days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed White House-backed gun control legislation  
last month in the wake of shootings at a Colorado high school and 
elsewhere. The same provisions -- including mandatory background 
checks for all gun show sales -- were rejected by the House. The 
House later killed a measure that contained weaker curbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, since both the House and Senate have approved legislation  
dealing with juvenile crime, negotiations on a compromise are 
expected. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters 
Thursday that ``the American people intend us to'' address guns as 
part of a bill responding to high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said he and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
intend to name negotiators before lawmakers disperse for their July 
Fourth break at the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing concern that Republicans might attempt to bury the  
issue, Gephardt released a letter to Hastert asking him ``not to 
engage in any delaying tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that we're not going to get everything that the  
Senate had,'' Gephardt said at his news conference. ``But if we can 
get close enough to it, that's a good result, and we ought to try 
to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Congress' rules, Democrats may force an advisory vote on  
the floor of either house once negotiators are formally named, and 
officials in both the House and Senate said they intend to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Any such vote would be nonbinding and largely political. Public  
opinion polls show support for the gun control measures passed by 
the Senate, while the National Rifle Association, a key ally of 
Republicans, successfully lobbied for their defeat in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate provisions include background checks for all  
purchasers at gun shows as well as mandatory safety devices for all 
handguns and a ban on importation of high-capacity ammunition 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed bill allows the government three days to  
complete the check. Gephardt said that 70 percent of applicants are 
approved immediately, and another 20 percent in about an hour. For 
the remainder, a time-consuming check of courthouse records is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also said he hopes the final bill will include a  
House-passed provision permitting the posting of the Ten 
Commandments at schools and other state-run and administered 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer personally to leave the Ten Commandments in,''  
he said. ``One of the commandments is `Thou shalt not kill.' That's 
a good message,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy Must Shut Down Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUSSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- For Frankfurt Galaxy coach Dick Curl,  
there's no question as to who his team must shut down if its going 
to win Sunday's World Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Lawrence Phillips, whose troubled career has been  
resurrected in one season with the Barcelona Dragons. His 
performance has earned him raves and NFL Europe's offensive player 
of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sure is the key -- he's a great player,'' said Curl. ``He  
might be the best player that's ever played in this league -- and 
I've been here from the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with every defense geared up to stop him, Phillips has  
shown he may not have lost much since his days carrying for the 
Miami Dolphins and St. Louis Rams. He smashed the developmental 
league's rushing records, becoming the first player to rush for 
1,000 yards and scoring 14 touchdowns in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said trimming his weight from the 240 pounds he'd  
bulked up to in the NFL to 210 has added to his explosiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely a better player than I was in St. Louis and  
Miami,'' said Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	The pass-oriented Galaxy doesn't have anyone with the notoriety  
of the 24-year-old Phillips, whose NFL career was derailed by 
run-ins with the law. But their two quarterbacks have been slapped 
with the most colorful nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-headed monster.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the name given Jake Delhomme, allocated to the league by  
the NFL's New Orleans Saints, and Pat Barnes, from the Oakland 
Raiders. Delhomme and Barnes, in alternating quarters, have riddled 
secondaries for 2,879 yards and 24 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has been nursing an ankle injury for the past three  
weeks but expects to play Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	His Spanish club may not have the lavish treatment facilities of  
his former NFL clubs. But it does boast one thing to ease the 
banging he takes as the focus of Barcelona's offense -- the 
Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have every resource that you have in the States, but  
we make it work,'' said Phillips. ``Get out in the sea and let that 
be a whirlpool for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips is expected to be the focus for NFL scouts attending  
the game, but teammate Mike Maslowski may get some looks too. The 
6-foot-3, 254 pound Arena Football League product was voted the NFL 
Europe defensive player of the year after breaking a league record 
with 105 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragons' coach Jack Bicknell said he's never understood why  
Phillips was considered a problem case in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been terrific -- I don't know one bad thing about this  
kid,'' said Bicknell. ``I've just seen a totally focused player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has had several brushes with the law. He was arrested  
and charged with domestic violence while a student at Nebraska; 
after being picked sixth overall by the Rams in the 1996 draft, 
Phillips was arrested three times and spent 23 days in jail in his 
19 months with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Phillips pleaded no contest in a misdemeanor  
battery charge dating back to June of 1998 involving a Fort 
Lauderdale woman. He was cut by the Miami Dolphins three weeks 
after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcelona is 2-0 against Frankfurt this year, winning both  
matchups in last-minute decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL Europe is expecting about 35,000 to attend the game.

<HEADLINE> 'No Comment' On Mets Reported Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cablevision, the majority owner of Madison  
Square Garden, the NBA's Knicks and the NHL's Rangers, is close to 
buying the baseball Mets, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing two high-ranking team officials it did not identify, The  
Record of Hackensack, N.J., reports today that the deal could be 
announced within the next week. The officials said the price would 
be ``in the neighborhood'' of $400 million, but the newspaper said 
others estimated the price as high as $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Doubleday, who owns 50 percent of the Mets, refused to  
confirm or deny the report when contacted by The Associated Press. 
His partner, Fred Wilpon, did not return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As is our corporate policy, we will not comment on rumors and  
speculation in the media,'' said a statement from James L. Dolan, 
Cablevision Systems Corp. president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically done,'' one source told the newspaper. ``Now  
it's just a matter of when they announce it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday said that was news to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a no comment,'' he said. ``I don't know where this story  
came from. I really know nothing about it, but I'd love to know who 
the Mets officials were. Nobody talked to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wouldn't turn a deaf ear to an offer, but said he  
personally was not involved in talks with Cablevision chairman 
Charles Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've said more than once, I have six children and eight  
grandchildren, and if somebody wants to make me an offer for my 
half of the Mets, I'd have to sit down and listen to it,'' 
Doubleday explained. ``I haven't talked to Chuck Dolan in months, 
and he's a good friend of mine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't negotiate in the press. Obviously, the phone has  
been ringing off the hook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision and the Mets are believed to have been discussing a  
sale since the Yankees broke off talks with the cable television 
company in February and decided to merge with the NBA's New Jersey 
Nets -- a deal still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-to-day operations of the Mets won't change, the newspaper  
reported, adding that Wilpon and Doubleday would retain small 
equity stakes. General manager Steve Phillips has been told not to 
increase the Mets' $70 million payroll until the deal is finalized, 
the newspaper quoted a source as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to owning controlling shares of the Garden, the  
Knicks and the Rangers, Cablevision has the lease on Radio City 
Music Hall. It also has broadcast rights to the Yankees, Mets, 
Knicks, Rangers, the NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New York 
Islanders and New Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision also agreed to help the Devils build an arena in  
Hoboken, where the NHL club's owner said he will move the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolans also have been mentioned as leading candidates to buy  
football's Jets from the estate of the late Leon Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were sold by the family of original owner Joan Payson  
to Doubleday &AMP; Co. in 1980. When the publishing company was taken 
over by a German firm, Doubleday and Wilpon bought the team in 1986 
for $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal would be subject to approval from baseball owners, a  
process that usually takes six to 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Pay Increase in Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is all but threatening to veto  
an Interior Department spending bill over a Republican-written 
provision that would limit Clinton administration efforts to 
restrict mining on federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	That spending measure and two others were approved Thursday by  
the Senate Appropriations Committee, 28-0. One of the bills would 
leave the door open for a congressional cost-of-living pay raise of 
more than $4,600 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee added to the Interior bill an amendment by Sen.  
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, that he said would let at least 300 mines 
ignore a 1997 Interior Department ruling that attempted to limit 
the size of waste dumps permitted for mining operations using 
federal land. That ruling limited those dumps to 5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern mining cannot operate under those standards,'' said  
Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	The language was approved 16-9, with Democratic Sens. Robert  
Byrd of West Virginia, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Daniel Inouye of 
Hawaii joining Republicans in support. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats objected, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.,  
said the Craig amendment ``is asking that our public lands be used 
for larger and larger dump sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, White House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci  
issued a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have warned them time and time again to stay away from  
these extreme anti-environmental riders,'' she said. ``In adopting 
this rider, they're threatening to do serious damage to the 
environment and they are playing with fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Appropriations subcommittee had voted Tuesday to exempt only  
existing waste sites. Craig's amendment would reverse the Interior 
Department ruling, allowing exemptions for waste sites that have 
not yet been approved. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the committee also included language by Sen. Thad  
Cochran, R-Miss., that would block a June 3 executive order by 
President Clinton that federal agencies cut their energy 
consumption by 35 percent, compared with 1985 levels, between now 
and 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran called Clinton's order a ``not well-disguised effort''  
to implement portions of the Kyoto protocol, the international 
agreement by which countries have pledged to cut atmospheric 
pollution by reducing energy use. That agreement has been opposed 
by many Republicans, who worry that it would inhibit economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The $13.9 billion measure to which both provisions were added  
would finance federal land and cultural programs for the coming 
fiscal year. The bill would increase funds for operating national 
parks, but it cuts Clinton's $797 million request for purchasing 
parklands to $265 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved a $28 billion measure financing the  
Treasury Department and several smaller agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill -- and a version approved last month by a House  
Appropriations subcommittee -- so far contains no language blocking 
a pay raise for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers automatically get an annual  
cost-of-living pay raise unless they vote to deny it, and the 
Treasury bill is the traditional vehicle for a provision doing 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort to bar the increase could still be made in the House  
or Senate, as it is most years. But earlier this year, House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., discussed the issue with Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. Lawmakers got their last raise to 
$136,700 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The law pegs the congressional raise to an increase the  
president proposes each year for federal workers. Clinton 
recommended a 4.4 percent increase for the fiscal year that begins 
Oct. 1, and the congressional raise would be expected to be about 
3.4 percent, or more than $4,600. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's Treasury bill proposed doubling the president's  
salary to $400,000, but the Senate version did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate committee also approved a measure that would provide  
$410 million for the District of Columbia's city budget.

<HEADLINE> Salinger's Daughter Writing Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fresh from the auction of his old love letters,  
reclusive author J.D. Salinger has another threat to his privacy 
looming -- this time from his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	What Peggy Salinger will reveal in a memoir to be published next  
year is a closely guarded secret. The book is tentatively titled 
``The Dream Catcher,'' a play on her father's landmark 1951 novel, 
``Catcher in the Rye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Philip Cowan, said Thursday that it will be ``an  
interesting book, and I'm looking forward to reading it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Salinger, 43, received an advance of at least $250,000, The  
New York Observer reported. The memoir is scheduled for publication 
in the fall of 2000 by Simon &AMP; Schuster's Pocket Books. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even as a memoirist, Ms. Salinger is hewing to her father's  
secretive ways. Cowan said he doesn't know what his client does for 
a living, or whether she is married. He wouldn't say where she 
lives. (``Let me put it this way, she doesn't live in Tibet.'') 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Salinger, 80, lives in Cornish, N.H., and has not  
published in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, 14 letters he wrote to onetime lover Joyce Maynard  
were auctioned. The letters from the early 1970s sold for $156,500 
on Tuesday to a retired California software millionaire who 
promised to return them to the author. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Maynard's own memoir detailed her youthful dalliance  
with Salinger.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Negotiate New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins, newly acquired by  
former star Mario Lemieux, were able to resolve their biggest 
hurdle Friday in emerging from bankruptcy by negotiating a new 
lease with their landlord. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which Lemieux bought Thursday after hours of  
contentious negotiations with Civic Arena manager SMG, now appears 
poised to remain in Pittsburgh ``indefinitely,'' said Tom Reich, 
Lemieux's agent and lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teamwork of Pittsburgh came together today,'' said Bill  
Newlin, the city's chief negotiator in the bankruptcy case, in 
describing efforts to forge a truce between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG feared it would be evicted from the arena it has managed for  
years after investing millions in the team. The company argued 
unsuccessfully against the Lemieux plan for hours in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, and players on both sides 
acknowledged Friday evening that SMG could have severely hampered 
the deal by fighting it in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' lease was considered the worst in the NHL and was  
a major factor in the team's financial decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new lease, SMG has agreed to $3 million per year in  
concessions, will invest $5 million in the team and sit on its 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the Penguins will pay $1.8 million per year for the  
regular season through 2004, after which SMG will pick up a 
management contract through 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will basically be within the market standard,'' Newlin  
said. Both sides continue to negotiate how much SMG will be paid 
under the management contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the biggest victory announced Friday was the  
cease-fire in the feud between SMG and the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time to bury hatchets, if there are any that  
exist,'' Reich said. ``There has been enough grief in the history 
of this franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux ownership deal still must be confirmed through a  
closing, a ritual that likely will be much easier without SMG's 
objections, Newlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even once you have a confirmed plan, you have to go through a  
closing,'' Newlin said. ``I suspect they see that as somewhat 
easier than in the past few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy was obviously relieved that the  
Penguins' once-tenuous fate is now resolved, as were those of the 
Pirates and Steelers once they got agreements to build new 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're done, we have all three of them here,'' Murphy said.  
``That's the best news, and the best part of this story.''

<HEADLINE> DNC Donor From '96 Campaign Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A figure in the federal campaign fund-raising  
investigation pleaded guilty Friday to mail fraud, tax evasion and 
assisting in an illegal $325,000 contribution to the Democratic 
Party using funds from a foreign national. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing in federal court in San Francisco, Yogesh Gandhi, 50,  
of Walnut Creek, Calif., also admitted that he obtained a corporate 
American Express card by signing the name of a business associate 
to the application without his permission. In doing so, Gandhi used 
the associate's credit rating to obtain a card, the Justice 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mail fraud charge relates to the American Express card.  
Charges of tax evasion and aiding and abetting an illegal donation 
relate to the May 1996 contribution to the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said in a statement that the money for  
the contribution was wired to Gandhi's account by a Japanese 
national. Gandhi is one of 18 people charged by the Justice 
Department's campaign finance task force in the probe of fund 
raising in the 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang was arraigned this month  
on a conspiracy charge as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Trie, a longtime acquaintance of President Clinton from  
Little Rock, Ark., and Johnny Chung, who delivered a $50,000 DNC 
donation to the first lady's chief of staff, have both pleaded 
guilty in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty for Gandhi for the mail fraud charge is a maximum of  
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, for the tax violation 
five years and a $100,000 fine and for the campaign finance 
violation one year and $975,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement issued through his lawyer, Karen Snell,  
Gandhi said the government has agreed not to oppose a sentence to a 
halfway house for one year, the minimum term under federal 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only were my financial resources no match for the federal  
government, but I needed to put an end to the stress and 
uncertainty this investigation has already brought to my family,'' 
Gandhi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gandhi was arrested in March as he prepared to fly home to  
India. Gandhi's attorney said at the time his client wasn't fleeing 
the country and had a round-trip ticket for what was supposed to be 
a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gandhi claims to be related to Mohandas Gandhi, who won India's  
independence from England.

<HEADLINE> Study: Films Made Abroad Hurt U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When the producers of ``Urban Legend'' wanted  
to film their story of horror in a New England town, they went to 
Canada. The movie ``Down in the Delta'' was shot far from its 
roots, too: Canada stood in for Chicago and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	More U.S.-developed movies and TV programming than ever before  
were shot abroad last year, some for creative reasons -- like the 
filming of parts of the ``Star Wars'' prequel in Tunisia -- and some 
to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter -- so-called economic runaway production -- cost the  
United States thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost 
Hollywood production money in 1998, according to a study released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood insiders disagreed over how serious a threat it might  
pose to continued U.S. dominance of the industry, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could very easily lose this industry,'' said Richard Masur,  
president of the Screen Actors Guild, which commissioned the study 
along with the Directors Guild of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. Can't be,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion  
Picture Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always produced abroad,'' he said. ``We've produced  
dozens of Westerns in Mexico, army pictures ... but it's never been 
a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, based on interviews with executives, union databases,  
estimated film budgets and trade publication articles, will provide 
ammunition as the unions lobby for federal help in keeping 
moviemaking at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was to be presented Saturday to the DGA's national  
board, which will formulate a plan of action, said Jack Shea, DGA 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sky is the limit here,'' Shea said. ``We're going to do  
anything we can to try to protect the whole infrastructure of 
filmmaking in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenti said he would support tax incentives of the kind that  
many countries now use to lure film production. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, the state Assembly has passed two bills that  
would provide tax credits for certain productions that use 
California labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that runaway production for economic reasons has  
doubled since 1990 and in 1998 accounted for about 27 percent of 
all theatrical and made-for-TV films and series developed for the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, 285 of 1,075 U.S.-developed film and TV  
productions last year were economic runaways. That represented $2.8 
billion in production -- nearly a sixfold increase since 1990, said 
Mark D. Lubkeman of Monitor Co., the Santa Monica consultant that 
conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half of all U.S. made-for-TV movies were produced abroad.  
</P>
<P>
	Runaways accounted for the equivalent of 23,500 full-time  
entertainment industry jobs, many of them ``below the line'' 
workers such as assistant directors, wardrobe people and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical Canadian-made production might use three U.S. actors  
or crew members but three dozen locals, Masur said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubkeman said the full U.S. economic loss for 1998 was even  
greater -- $10.3 billion when subsidiary benefits of movie 
production were factored in, such as tax revenues, catering, lumber 
purchases and hotel room rentals. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got 81 percent of the runaway production. The study found  
that it can be 25 percent cheaper to film there -- a big concern 
because a majority of the runaways were small films, independent TV 
shows or miniseries and, especially, TV movies that typically have 
miniscule budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The real lure, Valenti said, is the weaker Canadian dollar,  
which can shave $2 million off a $6 million miniseries. Canada also 
provides filmmakers with about $70 million in tax and labor rebate 
incentives each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada snagged such unreleased major productions as Disney's  
``Mission to Mars,'' ``Reindeer Game'' with Ben Affleck and 
Sylvester Stallone's ``Detox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The once-fledgling industry there has been fed by U.S. demand  
that in effect has trained casts and crews there in how to make 
quality American films. The result is a ``technology transfer'' 
that increasingly could lure bigger-budget movies, Masur contended. 
</P>
<P>
	There's room, said Peter Mitchell, director of the British  
Columbia Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 10 percent of the North American viewing audience and we  
do somewhere between 2 or 3 percent of the work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, like other countries, simply is fighting for a share of  
the increasingly global manufacturing market, Mitchell said. ``It's 
no different than cars or running shoes,'' Mitchell said. ``That 
may be small consolation to the grip that's out of work (in Los 
Angeles).''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Debt Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's government debt reached a record high of  
$3.62 trillion as of the end of March, as bond issues increased to 
finance fiscal stimulus measures, the Finance Ministry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of outstanding government bonds was $2.57 trillion.  
Total borrowings stood at $802 billion, while the value of 
outstanding financing bills was $246 billion, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyodo News Agency quoted a finance ministry official as saying  
the rise in debt was due to increased bond issues to finance the 
third supplementary budget for fiscal 1998, which ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has introduced massive public works legislation to pull  
the economy out of its worst recession in decades.

</P>
<P>
	In 1963, President Kennedy visited West Berlin, where he made

<HEADLINE> Outage Delays Mets-Braves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The opener of a three-game series between the New  
York Mets and Atlanta Braves was delayed 45 minutes Friday night 
when an electrical problem knocked out a section of lights at 
Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The malfunction apparently occurred less than two hours before  
the scheduled 7:40 p.m. start, affecting a section of lights that 
hover above the upper deck on the right-field side. 
</P>
<P>
	Power remained on for the rest of the 49,000-seat stadium, where  
a sellout was expected as the Braves, leading the NL East by three 
games over New York, tried to hold off the streaking Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement was made to the crowd about five minutes before  
the scheduled first pitch. There was little reaction as fans sat 
patiently in their seats or milled about the concourse beyond the 
center-field scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't play a game,'' Braves president Stan Kasten  
joked. ``Everything else is working fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 7:45, the lights began to illuminate against the darkening  
sky, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Odalis Perez made the first 
pitch to Ricky Henderson at 8:25. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in nearly six years that a Braves home  
game was delayed for reasons other than inclement weather. On July 
18, 1993, a press box fire at the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium 
held up the start of a game for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 4 this season, a problem with the lights at Kansas  
City's Kauffman Stadium caused a game between the Royals and 
Cincinnati Reds to be postponed.

<HEADLINE> Utah Law in Olympic Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic visitors will find that you can  
get a drink in Utah -- if you know how. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as peculiar as our reputation suggests,'' said  
Nicholas Hales, chairman of the state Alcohol Beverage Control 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But the truth is almost as peculiar as the reputation, as  
officials preparing for the 2002 Winter Games are finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Their request for bar service for the world's media at the dry  
Salt Palace convention center triggered an indignant response by 
legislative leaders and, now, a search by Hales for a legal end 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's myriad rules and regulations governing liquor can be  
confusing, irritating or even humorous. They are more easily 
understood once a visitor realizes the state's liquor monopoly has 
one overriding aim: Don't promote consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a state without open-door saloons, where full  
liquor service is available only to dues-paying members of 
``private'' social clubs or at the 470 restaurants with liquor 
stocks they cannot advertise, display or even mention unless a 
customer asks first. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 121 taverns can pour only ``light'' beer, 3.2  
percent alcohol by weight. No membership is required at taverns. 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery stores can sell only light beer, too, while wine,  
distilled spirits and heavy beer can be purchased at 36 state-run 
liquor stores -- if you can find them. Typically they are tucked 
away in warehouse districts and off major thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
	Private clubs are limited to one per 7,000 Utah residents, or  
295 clubs concentrated primarily in Salt Lake County and Park City. 
Minimum club dues by law are $12 a year, although visitors can buy 
a two-week membership for $5 that is ``not much different from 
paying a cover charge,'' Hales said. Or visitors can ask the guy on 
the next barstool to sponsor them as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Former ABC Chairman Jerry Fenn says there are ``some hoops'' to  
getting a drink in Utah, ``but I don't think they are that 
onerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to apologize for with our liquor laws,'' said  
Fenn, a teetotaling Mormon and lobbyist on liquor laws for his 
church. ``People will be able to get a drink when they come to 
Utah. The perception people have about Utah is tied more to 
stereotypes about religion and Mormonism. The perception is worse 
than reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap over Utah's liquor laws came last month when an  
International Olympic Committee official said that he and his wine 
could never be parted. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Frenchman, I know that a Frenchman kept from his wine  
might get cranky,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	So an IOC working group asked ``with great respect'' that Utah  
authorities allow unfettered alcohol sales at the Salt Palace, 
where working space will be provided for 9,000 journalists, 
broadcasters and technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's legislative leaders said they wouldn't soften  
any laws and local Olympic organizers quickly backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no attempt to change laws, we are not lobbying to  
change laws and we'll just have to see how the laws apply to the 
situation at game time,'' said Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
spokeswoman Caroline Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to be helpful, Hales said the Olympics can work around  
the laws. Indeed, his proposed solution bares the sheer complexity 
of Utah's system of alcohol licenses and permits. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's media, Hales said, need only find five or six  
sponsors to patch together a succession of 72-hour ``single-event'' 
permits for a month of bar service at the Salt Palace during the 
Olympics and Paralympic Games. Hales said any established press 
group could qualify as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The media, however, is unlikely to get around-the-clock alcohol  
service for filing deadlines matching the world's time zones. Last 
call in Utah is 1 a.m. -- no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	And thirsty visitors who think they can pack their suitcases  
with booze should stand warned. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a misdemeanor to bring alcohol into the state, an offense  
worth up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accepted an invitation  
Friday to serve as honorary chairman for the Presidents Cup matches 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Former presidents George Bush and Gerald Ford have also taken  
the role when the biennial matches have been played in the United 
States. Clinton will be the first president to serve while still in 
office when the matches return to the Robert Trent Jones Club in 
Virginia on Oct. 20-22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that, more and more, people around the world share  
America's enthusiasm for golf,'' Clinton said. ``The Presidents Cup 
helps bring our countries together in spirited and good-natured 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans won both matches at Robert Trent Jones Club in  
1994 and 1996. The International team won for the first time in 
December at Royal Melbourne, Australia, handing the United States 
its worst loss in match-play history, 20 1/2-11 1/2. Australia Prime 
Minister John Howard was honorary chairman for the 1998 event. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attended the 1996 matches in Gainesville, Va.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forward to another display of skill and  
sportsmanship,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Changes in Puberty Lessons Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The National Association of School  
Nurses recommends that girls who mature early should be taught 
about puberty and menstruation in the fourth grade -- a year earlier 
than the current practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier starting date is necessary in part because many  
girls are exposed to issues of sexuality at a younger age, said 
Judy Robinson, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd be amazed at what kids are asking these days,'' she  
said. ``They want to know about (sexual) positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, children in the United States receive sex education  
in the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three decades, the accepted belief was that puberty  
started between ages 10 and 12. But a 1997 study by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics suggested it can begin for girls as early as 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls who develop early -- or who teachers observe using more  
sexual language or behaving in sexual ways -- could be selected to 
take the fourth-grade classes, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan approved by the association's board on Thursday,  
parents could choose to exclude their children from the 
fourth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Gadsden, a board member of the nurses group, said the  
proliferation of sexual images in popular media is another reason 
for teaching girls at a younger age. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are surrounded by sexual messages, and not all of  
them are healthy,'' Gadsden said. ``It's important to establish a 
baseline of information so girls can evaluate all the messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Gadsden said, early education about puberty can  
help reassure girls who may be harassed if they develop earlier 
than their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young girls need to be armed with understanding and knowledge  
to be assertive that their body is their own,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some parents and educators questioned whether a girl still  
playing with Beanie Babies has the emotional maturity to deal with 
such issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Roxanne Flores, a Providence mother of a 1-year-old daughter,  
said a fifth-grade puberty talk sounded appropriate to her. ``A 
fourth-grader doesn't understand anything,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Campbell, a health education specialist at the state's  
Department of Education, said the difference in girls' maturation 
makes it difficult to say whether all fourth-graders could handle 
learning about puberty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be foolish and misleading to say they are all ready  
or they all aren't,'' she said. ``Everyone's different. You have to 
know your community, and you have to know who you're teaching.''

<HEADLINE> Padres' Joyner Back in Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- First baseman Wally Joyner returned to the San  
Diego Padres' lineup Friday night after missing 34 games with a 
chip fracture in his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner, a key player for the NL champions last season, went on  
the disabled list May 17 with the fracture in the sterno-clavicular 
joint. He had a .221 batting average and 11 RBIs in 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very much like just getting back into the lineup,'' Joyner  
said. ``Hopefully, it was worthwhile at Las Vegas (on a 
rehabilitation assignment). I'm good enough to go. I've got to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner went 4-for-17 (.235) with two RBIs in six games with Las  
Vegas, the Padres' Triple-A affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 14th major league season, Joyner got the 1,900th hit of  
his career May 3 in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Joyner, the Padres optioned right-hander Carlos  
Almanzar to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres began Friday night's game against Colorado with a  
six-game winning streak, their longest since winning 11 straight 
last June 7-19.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Seeks Gun Control Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt prodded  
Republicans Thursday to negotiate a gun control compromise, 
acknowledging it would not contain everything the Senate passed and 
the White House and most Democrats want. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Gephardt, D-Mo., said it may be  
technically feasible over time to complete all background checks on 
purchasers at gun shows in less than three business days, including 
the small share of individuals for whom that is not now the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if there is a way to speed up that process with the 10  
percent over time, why wouldn't we be willing to do that?'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot compromise'' on an insistence that all purchasers at  
gun shows be subjected to an effective background check designed to 
screen out criminals and others who should not possess guns, 
Gephardt stressed in a telephone call later Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we get to that, the whole point ... is that in today's  
world you need three business days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed White House-backed gun control legislation  
last month in the wake of shootings at a Colorado high school and 
elsewhere. The same provisions -- including mandatory background 
checks for all gun show sales -- were rejected by the House. The 
House later killed a measure that contained weaker curbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, since both the House and Senate have approved legislation  
dealing with juvenile crime, negotiations on a compromise are 
expected. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters 
Thursday that ``the American people intend us to'' address guns as 
part of a bill responding to high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said he and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
intend to name negotiators before lawmakers disperse for their July 
Fourth break at the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing concern that Republicans might attempt to bury the  
issue, Gephardt released a letter to Hastert asking him ``not to 
engage in any delaying tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that we're not going to get everything that the  
Senate had,'' Gephardt said at his news conference. ``But if we can 
get close enough to it, that's a good result, and we ought to try 
to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Congress' rules, Democrats may force an advisory vote on  
the floor of either house once negotiators are formally named, and 
officials in both the House and Senate said they intend to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Any such vote would be nonbinding and largely political. Public  
opinion polls show support for the gun control measures passed by 
the Senate, while the National Rifle Association, a key ally of 
Republicans, successfully lobbied for their defeat in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate provisions include background checks for all  
purchasers at gun shows as well as mandatory safety devices for all 
handguns and a ban on importation of high-capacity ammunition 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed bill allows the government three days to  
complete the check. Gephardt said that 70 percent of applicants are 
approved immediately, and another 20 percent in about an hour. For 
the remainder, a time-consuming check of courthouse records is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also said he hopes the final bill will include a  
House-passed provision permitting the posting of the Ten 
Commandments at schools and other state-run and administered 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer personally to leave the Ten Commandments in,''  
he said. ``One of the commandments is `Thou shalt not kill.' That's 
a good message,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> EU OKs Tighter Modified Food Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union environment ministers  
agreed today to tighten rules on trading and selling new 
genetically modified seeds in the 15-nation EU, but rejected a 
French moratorium on sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Parliament must now approve the measure, which  
calls for stricter labeling and monitoring of such foods. Officials 
said it may take many months, even up to a year, for the EU 
assembly to vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tightening the rules on genetically modified foods -- notably  
corn, soy and rice -- is bound to upset the United States, which 
already complains about European heel-dragging in approving U.S. 
foods that have been genetically manipulated to make them more 
resistant to diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, such genetic manipulation is seen as a health hazard.  
Newspapers in Britain have called them ``Frankenstein Foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tighter rules the EU nations have in mind would affect  
genetically modified seeds, not food ready for consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would end permanent authorization for genetically  
modified seeds in favor of a system of temporary approvals. Also, 
the risk assessment of genetically engineered foodstuffs would be 
increased through tougher labeling and monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	EU legislation would also seek more public input.  
</P>
<P>
	``If any evidence does arise of risk to human health or  
environment, approval can be withdrawn,'' said Michael Meacher, 
Britain's agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace praised the move as a reaction to Europeans'  
rejection of genetically modified food. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear step in the right direction,'' Greenpeace  
political adviser Louise Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the all-night session of EU environment ministers, France  
pleaded for a moratorium on genetically modified food in the EU 
pending European Parliament approval of the tighter labeling rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It argued that current approval rules date back to 1990 and are  
unclear about labeling. However, Britain and others successfully 
argued that a moratorium would be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The French ``did not feel that the text was ambitious enough,''  
European Commission spokesman Peter Jorgensen told reporters in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've had for years is a factual moratorium,'' he added,  
taking note of European public opposition to genetically modified 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. administration believes genetically modified seeds pose  
no risk to the health of consumers. Almost 40 percent of some 
American crops are genetically modified. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently 18 genetically modified crops approved for  
marketing in the EU. Four more are awaiting approval, but fears 
about genetically modified foods are rising across the 15 EU 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 20, the European Commission said it will delay approval  
of pending requests to sell a genetically modified corn due to 
health concerns raised by an American study.

<HEADLINE> Iowa, NH Hosting 1st Dem Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Democratic Party has quelled a budding revolt  
against Iowa and New Hampshire continuing to have bragging rights 
as the first states to hold presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	But party leaders agreed that the system is fast becoming  
unworkable, as more states jump into the election cycle earlier. 
Change is inevitable, they said, but won't come in time to affect 
the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the rules committee of the Democratic National  
Committee turned aside efforts by Michigan and Washington to 
challenge the supremacy of the two make-or-break states. 
</P>
<P>
	Party rules say states cannot choose delegates until March 7,  
with exceptions carved out for Iowa -- traditionally the first 
caucus state -- and New Hampshire, the time-honored first primary 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan wants to hold caucuses on Feb. 12 or the Saturday  
before New Hampshire's primary, whichever comes first. Washington 
wants to take part in a presidential primary on Feb. 29, the 
tentative date for the New Hampshire primary. Iowa's caucus is 
tentatively set for Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, South Carolina, Delaware and Oregon also have waiver  
requests pending to hold earlier primaries, but the rules panel 
took no action on those Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	During lengthy debate, Iowa and New Hampshire officials conceded  
that their special status is endangered. But they argued their 
states' primaries air important issues and give candidates an equal 
opportunity to strut their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about privilege, but about permission the party has  
long given us,'' said Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack. 
</P>
<P>
	But challengers said many of the other states are weary of  
taking a backseat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a deep resentment in our party and among many of the  
voters,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``The two states think they 
have a God-given right to go first and they don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan has 156 national delegates and Washington state 94,  
compared with 29 for New Hampshire and 56 for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Democratic Chairman Mark Brewer said his party needs  
the early caucuses to compete with the attention homestate 
Republicans will get by moving the state primary up to Feb. 22 -- an 
election he described as a calculated move to help Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush in his bid for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state Democrats said they have little choice but to  
seek the date change. A bipartisan commission created by the 
Legislature picked the Feb. 29 date, state Chairman Paul Berendt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the committee members agreed that change seems  
inevitable. Several mentioned a system of regional primaries, with 
each region taking its turn as the first in the nation. But the 
panel said it's too late to overhaul the system for the 2000 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is broke and getting broker,'' said Alice Travis  
Germond of West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> GDP Grows at 4.3 Percent Annual Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Torrid consumer spending helped the nation's  
economy grow at a brisk annual rate of 4.3 percent at the beginning 
of the year. Economists believe growth has slowed in the current 
quarter but probably not enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve 
from raising interest rates as a precaution against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.3 percent increase from January through March in the gross  
domestic product -- the nation's output of goods and services -- was 
slightly better than the 4.1 percent rate estimated a month ago, 
the Commerce Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement reflected a slight revision in the trade  
deficit, which, while still at a record high, was $6.5 billion 
lower than the government earlier estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy's robust first-quarter pace was far above  
expectations. That has raised concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will push up short-term interest rates at its meeting next week to 
keep the expansion from triggering inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though many analysts believe that growth has slowed in the  
April-June quarter to around 3.5 percent, they feel the drop has 
not been sufficient to keep the central bank from raising interest 
rates next week. Some analysts said solid second-quarter growth 
could spur the Fed to enact another rate increase at its August 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hunch is that they would raise the interest rates again on  
Aug. 24,'' said First Union economist David Orr, who estimates 
second-quarter growth to slow only to 4 percent to reflect a 
slowdown in consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit of refinancing is running out. The benefit of  
lower gasoline is running out, and higher tax refunds are going 
away,'' Orr said, explaining his second-quarter assessment. ``The 
superchargers for consumer spending have faded a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates also  
expects a pullback in consumer spending to lower the second-quarter 
growth rate. He believes the Fed will maintain its existing policy 
bias toward increasing interest rates ``until there is a clear, 
sustained slowing in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter, robust consumer spending, which continued  
to power economic growth, rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, 
the best showing in more than a decade, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have grown increasingly nervous in recent  
weeks that the Fed will raise interest rates, a pre-emptive move to 
keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report indicated that inflation remains low. An  
inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose at an annual rate of just 1.2 
percent in the first quarter, compared with the 1.1 percent 
previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The record trade deficit, meanwhile, shaved 2.2 percentage  
points from economic growth in the first three months of the year. 
While at record levels, the drag from trade was slightly lower than 
an estimated loss in growth of 2.5 percentage points in last 
month's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global  
financial crises, which has cut sharply into American export sales 
while increasing competition on American manufacturers from a flood 
of cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for new homes and apartments increased at a 15.4  
percent rate in the first quarter, the best showing in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a separate report, the National Association of  
Realtors said Friday that sales of existing single-family homes 
plunged 4 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
5.04 million units. That was the lowest level in six months. The 
drop coincided with rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report showed that business investment, spending on new  
equipment and plants, rose at an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the 
first quarter, even better than last month's estimate of 7.9 
percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate profits, meanwhile, rose in the first three months of  
this year to an annual rate of $47.1 billion, a turnaround from a 
drop of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter performance, revised upward by $15.3 billion  
from the initial estimate last month, reflected that tobacco 
companies paid less in court settlements during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the recent weakness in the stock market has reflected  
worries that company earnings in the second quarter will be below 
expectations.

<HEADLINE> GOP Assembling Sweeping Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cutting capital gains tax rates in half,  
fixing the ``marriage penalty'' that affects millions of two-income 
couples and eliminating inheritance taxes are likely cornerstones 
of a huge tax relief plan being developed by Republicans in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying too much in taxes, and, as history has  
shown, any taxpayer money left in Washington will surely be 
spent,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The $778 billion, 10-year plan to be unveiled in July is  
intended to energize the GOP's social conservative and business 
supporters. It also will force Democrats to decide between tax 
relief's appeal and President Clinton's priorities of Social 
Security, Medicare and education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic tax-cutting sentiment is particularly strong in the  
Senate, where as many as eight of the 45 Democrats are either 
co-sponsoring major tax relief bills or have expressed a desire to 
return some of the projected $2.6 trillion budget surplus to 
taxpayers over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to save Social Security this year. Having done that,  
we still have money to be able to cut Americans' taxes,'' said Sen. 
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``I favor tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans generally agree on several major  
items, although Archer will not finalize his bill until mid-July. 
But these cuts are among those with strong support: 
</P>
<P>
	--Reducing the top capital gains tax rate on longer-term  
investments such as stocks, possibly from 20 percent to 10 percent. 
Cost: $143 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Easing the ``marriage penalty'' by adjusting income brackets so  
that a greater share of a married couple's income would be subject 
to the lower 28 percent tax rate and giving married couples a 
higher standard deduction. Combined cost: $187 billion over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gradually eliminating the estate or ``death'' tax over the next  
decade. Cost: $198 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Abolishing the alternative minimum tax, or at least ensuring it  
does not strike middle-class people instead of the wealthy as 
originally intended. Abolition cost: $133 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising IRA contribution limits from $2,000 to $5,000 a year.  
Total cost: $50 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Extending the research and development tax credit, a big  
priority for high-tech industries, and other expiring business 
credits for at least five more years. Cost: $12 billion over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	These proposals were included in a bill introduced Thursday by  
House GOP conservatives, whose plan is strongly backed by 
pro-business organizations and groups such as the Christian 
Coalition and the Family Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax cut is the most important issue for us,'' said the  
group's leader, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. ``We haven't defined 
what the difference is between a Republican Congress and Bill 
Clinton. Cutting taxes really defines the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they search for issues in their bid to wrest House control  
from the GOP in the 2000 elections, most House Democrats are united 
behind Clinton's pledge to use the budget surplus for popular 
government programs and not tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't want to do ... is put a huge tax bill out there  
that robs and takes money from Social Security and Medicare and 
education and other priorities,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, director of Clinton's National Economic Council,  
said the White House also believes it unwise to use projected 
future surpluses for ``exploding or irresponsible tax cuts'' that 
could trigger a new federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any of the projections are wrong, these are large and  
unsustainable amounts,'' Sperling said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is less Democratic unity in the Senate, where the  
party is thrashing out whether to support tax cuts. Senate Finance 
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., says he wants a bipartisan 
bill, but so far Democrats cannot agree on an approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said many Democrats seem to fear  
the political power of a Republican tax relief plan. ``A bidding 
war is starting to take place. If we can't hold ourselves in check 
-- that's what I fear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is urging that GOP  
senators back a bold tax cut, including a capital gains reduction, 
and said the goal for both ends of the Capitol is to finish a 
compromise measure and send it to Clinton by the first week in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Clinton vetoes such a bill, Republicans would have  
their political issue and Democrats could claim they were 
protecting Social Security, Medicare and education. Then the two 
sides would likely be left this fall with only the expiring 
business tax credits, which are extended every year.

<HEADLINE> White Supremacist Sentenced to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A white supremacist convicted of three  
murders as part of a plot to set up a whites-only nation in the 
Pacific Northwest was sentenced Friday to life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just like to continue to maintain my innocence in this  
situation,'' Chevie Kehoe, of Colville, Wash., told U.S. District 
Judge G. Thomas Eisele after the judge asked if Kehoe had anything 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe, 26, and Danny Lee, 26, of Yukon, Okla., were convicted  
last month of three counts of murder for slaying gun dealer William 
Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and her 8-year-old daughter in January 
1996. Kehoe and Lee were also both convicted of one count each of 
conspiracy and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe and Lee were convicted in what prosecutors said was a plot  
to set up a new nation where people of Asian, black, Hispanic and 
Jewish descent would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the pair wanted Mueller's guns to sell or use  
them to further their plot. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Kehoe and Lee's illegal activities  
included the bombing of City Hall at Spokane, Wash. Chevie Kehoe 
and his brother, Cheyne, were involved in a videotaped shootout 
with Ohio police Feb. 15, 1997.

<HEADLINE> CART Drivers Enjoy Cleveland Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Robby Gordon loves a good race. That's one  
reason why he enjoys coming back to Burke Lakefront Airport each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't help but think about the race in 1995,'' Gordon said.  
``I had a good chance to win, but we cut a few tires in the heat of 
battle and ended up sixth. Everyone was scratching and clawing. It 
was like a dogfight with no rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys were going three and four abreast into corners that only  
fit one, and they weren't letting up until it was too late. I had 
an exchange with another driver where we both ended up racing in 
the grass because neither of us would give in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memory of that hard racing brought a smile to Gordon's face  
as his team prepared for Sunday's Medic Drugs Grand Prix of 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the great part about this track. It's wide, and there  
is plenty of room if you do end up in the grass,'' he said. ``Guys 
are going to take more chances here because they're not worried 
about a cement wall taking them out of the running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who became an owner-driver this season, needs to start  
piling up the points if he hopes to get into the CART FedEx Series 
championship chase with 12 of 20 races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	There might not be another venue on the CART circuit as popular  
with the drivers as this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's appropriate that it's on an airport runway because  
sometimes you feel that you're flying out there,'' Patrick 
Carpentier said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 17 summers, CART has been coming to the small  
municipal airport tucked between the high-rises of downtown 
Cleveland and the waters of Lake Erie for this race. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this layout so special to the drivers is the open  
space provided by the runways and taxiways that form the 2.106-mile 
temporary road course. 
</P>
<P>
	At some points on the track, the racing surface is as wide as 70  
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes the track as wide open as the CART points race, in  
which rookie Juan Montoya holds a 90-85 edge over Dario Franchitti 
heading in Sunday's race. Not far behind are Gil de Ferran, the 
winner last Sunday in Portland, Ore.; Greg Moore; Adrian Fernandez; 
Michael Andretti; and Christian Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who hasn't won this season, would love to use the  
Cleveland race, where he finished third last year, as a stepping 
stone to the top of the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of opportunities to pass on this circuit,''  
the Scotsman said. ``There's so much room in turn one that you can 
have four or five cars side-by-side when the green flag drops. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're constantly pushing yourself in this race, so it can be  
physically demanding. It's also usually hot enough to fry an egg on 
the runway. There's no shade to speak of. We'll be sucking back on 
the fluids this weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because there is no way of testing at a circuit that is an  
active airport except for race weekend, the opening practice and 
provisional qualifying today was to be Montoya's first experience 
on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I hear, I think it will fit my driving style nicely  
and be a lot of fun,'' said Montoya, who has three wins and two 
poles. ``If there's as much room for passing as I've heard, I'm 
going to like it.''

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As Washington offered a $5 million  
reward for help in convicting Slobodan Milosevic and others wanted 
for war crimes in the Balkans, Ethnic Albanians reportedly torched 
Serb houses and looted Serb-owned shops in Kosovo. In Belgrade, the 
Yugoslav parliament was scheduled to vote today on measures giving

seven Lebanese and two Israelis. The Israeli airstrikes against 
Lebanon's infrastructure also wounded 57 people since they began

Philippines' second execution since it restored capital punishment 
in 1994. The execution of Eduardo Agbayani stirred little of the 
passionate nationwide debate that accompanied the previous 
execution in February. Agbayani, 51, was initially charged with 
raping two of his daughters while his wife was working in Saudi 
Arabia. The daughters, however, withdrew from the case, leading to 
his release. Later, he was convicted of raping another daughter, 
who was then 14, and sentenced to die for that crime.

on a man. The surgery was performed at Saitama Medical College 
hospital, where Japan's first authorized sex-change operation on a 
woman took place last October, said a hospital spokesman who 
declined to be named. Sex-change operations had effectively been 
banned in Japan until 1996, when a eugenics law applied to a doctor 
who performed three sex changes in 1969 was abolished. The Japanese 
Society of Psychiatry and Neurology decided to permit the 
operations in 1997 on the condition that patients undergo

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's government debt reached a record high of  
$3.62 trillion as of the end of March, as bond issues increased to

<HEADLINE> China Internet Co. To List on Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- An Internet provider partially owned by  
mainland China's state-run news agency said Friday it wants to 
raise $68 million with an initial public offering of stock next 
week in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com Corp. is a Hong Kong-based Chinese-language Internet  
provider offering web services, e-commerce and advertising for 
mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, major American Internet companies have sought  
to capitalize on China's growing population of Internet users, 
which so far totals 2.1 million. Bosses at China.com are hoping a 
stock offering that combines exposure to China and the Internet 
will prove interesting to American investors. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com said it has registered with the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission to sell more than 4.2 million shares at $14 to 
$16 each in the IPO on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The offer will be 
expanded by 637,050 if there is sufficient demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering is being underwritten by U.S. investment banks  
Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	The big shareholders in China.com include China's official  
Xinhua News Agency, which has 13.6 percent; Hong Kong-based New 
World Infrastructure, with 22.7 percent; and U.S. Internet provider 
America Online Inc., which plans to increase its stake to 25 
percent from 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., announced its additional investment  
in China.com today. AOL plans to launch an English- and 
Chinese-language service in Hong Kong later this year and the 
China.com deal ``represents a strengthening of our commitment'' to 
that service, said Bob Pittman, president and chief operating 
officer of AOL.

<HEADLINE> AMA Recommends Yearly Mammograms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- One side recommends yearly breast cancer  
screenings for women over 40. The other side says tests can come as 
much as two years apart. In the middle are the people most 
affected: patients, and insurers who must pay for the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching sides in one of the most contentious issues in  
medicine, the American Medical Association on Thursday recommended 
all women get yearly mammograms starting at age 40. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation, supported by the American Cancer Society and  
the American College of Surgeons, could lead to pressure on 
insurers and managed care companies to pay for more mammograms. 
</P>
<P>
	It also puts the AMA at odds with the government and the  
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which say an 
interval of one to two years is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has pitted those who argue that routine mammograms are  
not cost-effective in younger women against those who say that the 
tests are needed and that the insurance industry should be paying 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Debra Judelson of Beverly Hills, Calif., a representative of  
the American Medical Women's Association, which supports annual 
screening, said managed-care companies have refused to pay for 
mammograms at less than two-year intervals for women under 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``The science does show us that cancers in this age group grow  
more rapidly,'' she said. ``We do want to identify the disease 
early. But I cannot get all of my patients getting a yearly 
mammogram if they wish it, because the companies will only cover 
every two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said insurers always translate ``every one or two years'' as  
meaning they only have to pay for mammograms every two years in 
younger women. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA had previously advocated the one-to-two-year timetable  
for women in their 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	``One in six breast cancer deaths in 1995 were attributable to  
women diagnosed with breast cancer during their 40s,'' Richard 
Reiling, a spokesman for the American College of Surgeons, told the 
AMA's 494 policymaking delegates before they voted in favor of the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the issue was Dr. Scott Karlan of the  
American Society of General Surgeons, who noted a 10-year study of 
25,000 Canadian women found no benefit to mammography for women in 
their 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the studies that have been in favor of mammography have  
pointed out that the incidence of breast cancer is so low, and the 
sensitivity of mammography is so low in women between the ages of 
40 and 50, that you would have to screen more than 250,000 women to 
find, perhaps, one curable case of breast cancer,'' Karlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's vote does not affect AMA guidelines for women over  
50, which already called for annual mammograms, nor the 
recommendation that a manual breast exam by a doctor be part of any 
physical exam in either age group. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs said the  
cost-effectiveness of screening younger women is in line with that 
of other diagnostic procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	But others argued that annual screening will drive up insurance  
and HMO costs without proven benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one in this room who would object to women having  
proper care. The issue involves the interpretation of data,'' said 
Dr. David Rosenthal of San Jose, Calif., a delegate who opposed the 
change.

<HEADLINE> GM, Gov't To Study Anti-Crash System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Smart cars'' that use radar, cameras and  
computer chips to ``see'' slower cars and other objects in the road 
ahead will be developed under a joint $35 million project announced 
by General Motors Corp. and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash-avoidance system announced Thursday is intended for  
distracted drivers who are not paying full attention to the road as 
they talk on a car phone, tune a radio or try to settle a fight 
among siblings in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech system will be designed to detect obstacles ahead  
and warn the driver if he gets too close and could crash, said Ron 
Colgin, GM's manager for the project. If the driver is also using 
cruise control, the car will start to brake for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The research project focuses on reducing rear-end collisions.  
The Transportation Department says about one-fourth of all injuries 
in motor vehicle crashes result from rear-end collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen prototype cars with these systems of the future will be  
developed in the next 2 1/2 years, GM said. Then about 100 drivers in 
southeast Michigan will be selected to drive the prototype vehicles 
for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most comprehensive field operation test under  
real-world conditions that has ever been conducted,'' Colgin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the research will be shared with other  
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Transportation is providing about 61 percent  
of the funding because federal officials are interested in learning 
about the systems and encouraging other automakers to build them. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is interested in the joint research because engineers want to  
learn how motorists react as the car ``sees'' problems and warns 
them, and they want feedback on how marketable the system will be.

<HEADLINE> Worker Arrested in Widow's Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE COMPTON, R.I. (AP) -- A construction worker who had been  
putting an addition on an elderly widow's home was charged Friday 
with raping and fatally beating her, dumping her in her bathtub and 
dropping a plugged-in hair dryer into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Motyka, 23, of Fall River, Mass., was arrested Thursday  
in the May 29 slaying of 66-year-old Angela Spence-Shaw, following 
DNA tests on semen found in the woman's body. Motyka was jailed 
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying of the British-born woman was the first murder in 34  
years in this picturesque New England town of 3,400 people, with 
its grassy town park, old homes and 150-year-old church. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the slaying, Motyka was part of a crew building  
an addition to the woman's home. He was working on another 
construction project in Little Compton when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying shattered the sense of tranquility in Little  
Compton. For nearly a month, some people worried the killer could 
strike again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of older women in their 80s who never locked  
their doors, and after this happened, people started locking their 
doors,'' said Marsha England, publisher of the local paper, 
Shorelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The community is ``a little more at ease now,'' said Police  
Chief Egbert D. Hawes Jr. ``Everyone can sleep a little better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Spence Shaw's body was found in her overflowing bathtub.  
Investigators said she died of blows to her head.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower, Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- profit-taking Friday in slim trading. Japanese  
share prices also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.52 yen by late afternoon, down 0.38 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 121.78 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 121.31 yen 
to 122.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 191.80 points,  
or 1.09 percent, to close at 17,436.52. On Thursday, the average 
closed up 41.57 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, there was no clear agreement on the  
direction for the dollar, causing most players to stay on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many Japanese exporters who want to sell the dollar  
for profit-taking near 122 yen,'' said Takayuki Togawa, manager of 
foreign exchange at Tokai Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar was being supported in the other direction by  
lingering fears of interventions by the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened four times over the past  
two-week period to halt recent gains by the yen, which will hamper 
the Japanese economy's ability to recover from its worst recession 
since World War II. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in the market can be bold enough to continue selling  
dollars below 121.50 yen,'' said Tetsu Aikawa, senior trader at 
Sanwa Bank Ltd. ``Almost everyone thinks the BOJ will again step in 
below that level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 127.09 yen, up from  
126.30 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors sold shares of banks and  
technology companies following the overnight steep fall in New 
York, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 132.03, or 1.2 
percent, to 10,534.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Exchange of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 1.72 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,409.41. The 
TOPIX closed up 1.95 points, or 0.14 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was about 468.4 million,  
down from 554.2 million the previous day. Retreating issues 
outnumbered advancers 822 to 371, while 131 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7700 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6950 
percent, driving its price down to 100.25 yen from 100.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Intel Discloses European Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM (AP) -- Intel Corp.'s chief executive, Craig Barrett,  
disclosed on Friday that Intel has invested tens of millions of 
dollars in European Internet provider World Online International. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to go into specifics, but we can say the  
investment was worth in the tens of millions of dollars,'' Barrett 
said during a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	World Online currently operates in 12 European countries with  
about 800,000 individual subscribers and 15,000 business 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has invested in hundreds of high-tech companies, including  
Web sites, as part of its strategy to create demand for its 
microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett also said he sees potential for the Netherlands -- along  
with the United Kingdom -- to become a ``major hub for e-commerce in 
western Europe.'' He noted that the country has a high cable 
network density and active government participation in developing 
Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett also said that Intel is starting a long-term  
relationship with the Netherlands' Twente University, which will 
include donations for the university's laboratory and scholarships. 
He declined to give figures.

<HEADLINE> College Enrollments Dip Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly two-thirds of U.S. students who  
graduated from high school last year attended college in the fall -- 
but the percentage was down from the record-breaking 1997 class, 
the Labor Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2.8 million students who graduated from high school in  
1998, about 1.8 million, or 65.6 percent, were attending college in 
October. In 1997, a record 67 percent of the young people flocked 
to college. 
</P>
<P>
	The enrollment rate of young women, 69.1 percent, continued to  
exceed that of young men, 62.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young women are particularly getting the message,'' said Labor  
Secretary Alexis M. Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted the rise of the unemployment rate for the students who  
dropped out, to 28 percent in 1998 from 20 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message to America's young people is clear: What you learn  
has a direct and significant impact on what you earn,'' Herman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Department numbers -- based on a survey of about 50,000  
households -- date to 1960, when 54 percent of male high school 
graduates and 38 percent of female high school graduates went 
directly to college. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, enrollments dropped, and they remained flat in the  
early 1980s. Later in the decade, the enrollments rose again. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also looked at the work status of people aged 16 to  
24 during October 1998. The unemployment rate for those who had not 
graduated from high school was 28 percent, compared with 14.2 
percent for those with a high school diploma.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton News Conference-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's news conference Friday, as  
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	And he posed those things in the alternative. I have asked our  
people to look at it, I've talked to Secretary Richardson about it. 
I think everyone recognizes that he has worked very hard to deal 
with the underlying security issues, which are the most important 
things. And I think we all just ought to try to get together and 
work out what the best organizational structure is, and I expect 
that we will be -- I expect to have a chance to talk to him about 
that and to work on it. 
</P>
<P>
	But I think the Rudman report was a service to the country and I  
think that Bill Richardson's doing a good job on trying to 
implement the security measures that are necessary. He's being 
very, very aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, on the second question, I went back, I've been interested  
in this question, and I went back and looked at exactly what I 
said. Let me -- let me go back to what the facts are. 
</P>
<P>
	First of all, there has been a 20-year problem with lax security  
at the labs. And what I said was that I didn't suspect that any 
actual breaches of security had occurred during my tenure. Since 
then, we have learned of the off-loading of the computer by Mr. Lee 
from the secured computers into his personal computers. That's 
something we know now that I didn't know then. 
</P>
<P>
	But I think my choice of wording was poor. What I should have  
said was I did not know of any specific instance of espionage 
because I think that we've been suspicious all along, and I think I 
-- I have to acknowledge I think I used a poor word there. I think 
``suspicion'' is -- we have -- we have been suspicious all along 
generally. We did not have any specific instance, as we now do, of 
the off-loading of the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	But I also want to emphasize that I took no particular comfort  
in that, because what we have here is a -- what I learned in 1997 
was that there was a general problem of very long standing with the 
security at the labs, and I issued the executive order in early '98 
to clean it up, and Secretary Richardson's been working on it since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	And I think we've made a lot of progress since then.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: I'd like to ask you about Medicare and your plans that you're  
going to be announcing next week. This is a program that tens of 
millions of Americans depend on, and yet in 15 years it will be 
effectively bankrupt. And you're about to propose a, what could be 
a very costly additional benefit in the prescription benefit. Why 
are you going to do that, sir? Isn't that going to make the problem 
worse, not better? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: No. For one thing, let me remind you that we have taken  
a lot of very tough positions to reform Medicare since 1993. When I 
took office, Medicare was supposed to go broke this year. And now 
it's out to, what is it, 2015 or something. So we have taken a lot 
of important positions already. And as a matter of fact as I'm sure 
you're all aware, a lot of the health care providers, particularly 
rural hospitals, nursing homes, home health providers, 
disproportionate share hospitals -- that's funding for the -- folks 
listening to us, that's basically inner city hospitals and teaching 
hospitals that have a whole of poor folks they take care of who 
aren't reimbursed. A lot of those people believe that our savings 
are too great. 
</P>
<P>
	But we've taken some very tough actions to try to lengthen the  
life of the Medicare trust fund. When I make my proposals on 
Tuesday, there will be more to lengthen the life further; to make 
sure that we get through the first quarter century and maybe more 
of this, of the new century with Medicare alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you look at the long run, I think it's important that we  
propose a prescription drug benefit because life expectancy is 
going up, drugs are being constantly developed which help to 
improve the quality as well as the length of life, and if they are 
properly taken, they can actually reduce long-term hospitalization 
and other medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it is absolutely true that if we design this wrong, it could  
wind up being a lot more expensive than rosy scenario suggests. But 
if you look at my record here over the last six and a half years, 
I've tried to be quite conservative in my budget projections and 
quite responsible in handling the budget of the country, and you 
will see that, I think, reflected in the way I make this proposal, 
including the prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't really think there's any alternative here. You've got 15  
million Americans, seniors out there, without any kind of coverage 
for their medicine. You've got millions and millions of others with 
inadequate or highly expensive coverage, and I just -- I really 
believe that this is the most significant health care need that 
senior citizens have today. 
</P>
<P>
	And I believe that over the long run that proper availability,  
properly priced of prescription medicine will actually not only 
lengthen lives and improve the quality of lives of our seniors and 
improve their security, their state of mind, but it will also long, 
long term save medical costs because it will keep people out of 
hospitals and out of more expensive treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What is your strategy now, Mr. President, for a comprehensive  
campaign finance reform -- to really make it pass? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I think the best strategy is to get, you know, a  
clear majority of the House of Representatives to demand that it 
come up and then try to put enough pressure on to get the Senate 
leaders to let it come up. 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, the Republican leadership in the Senate has said that  
they're just not going to permit it to come up because they don't 
want their people who vote against it to have a recorded vote on 
it. They don't want to run the risk that they've got enough of 
their folks that would vote with all of ours.

	Clinton Outlines Domestic Agenda  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning from war in the Balkans to battles in  
Congress, President Clinton today urged Republican lawmakers to 
``keep pushing forward on our challenges at home.'' In a news 
conference, his first since March 19, and a speech at Georgetown 
University, the president called for action on Medicaid, Medicare, 
Social Security, education, child care and campaign finance. ``We 
will be judged on what we do with this opportunity, whether we 
seize it or squander it,'' Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Readies Medicare Drug Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is floating a Medicare  
prescription benefit that could pay roughly half the cost of drugs 
up to a limit of perhaps $3,000 to $5,000 a year, in return for 
higher premiums paid by beneficiaries, officials said today. 
Prescription drugs are the ``greatest growing need'' of senior 
citizens, President Clinton said at a speech today at Georgetown 
University. The president said that next week he will unveil his 
long-anticipated plan to offer retirees government assistance 
paying for prescriptions.

	Ethnic Violence Remains in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Both sides of Kosovo's ethnic divide  
ignored NATO pleas for restraint today as revenge attacks prompted 
more Serbs to flee the province and ethnic Albanian refugees 
flooded home in numbers that startled aid officials. About 48,000 
ethnic Albanians returned yesterday, a spokeswoman for the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees, with 300,000 the number who have 
streamed back into the province in the past 10 days. Panicky Serbs 
are fleeing the province, accusing ethnic Albanians of forcing them 
out. There were 14 killings in Pristina yesterday, NATO spokesmen 
said. There was no immediate breakdown on victims, but most 
incidents were connected to ethnic tensions, they said.

	Israeli Strikes Black Out Beirut  
</P>
<P>
	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hopes for peace in the Middle East are  
looking dimmer after Israeli jets bombed Lebanese power stations 
and bridges late last night and early today in Israel's strongest 
attacks in three years. Outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
ordered the airstrikes and only informed his successor, Ehud Barak, 
once the planes were already en route to their targets. Barak has 
pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon within a year. The 
attacks have killed nine Lebanese and two Israelis. Israel and the 
Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas they have been battling in 
southern Lebanon have held their fire most of today since the 
bombing ended.

	House OKs Aid for Aging Foster Kids  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted today to double federal  
spending on ``independent living'' programs for aging foster 
children who now are dropped from state care at age 18. The 
legislation, which still requires Senate approval, also would 
permit states to continue Medicaid coverage for these youngsters 
through the age of 21. House lawmakers voted 380-6 in favor of the 
bill, which also has the Clinton administration's backing.

stabbed his wife 44 times and held her head under water was 
convicted today of first-degree murder. Scott Falater stared 
straight ahead and did not react as the verdict was read in a 
Maricopa County Superior Court. Prosecutors have said they will 
seek the death penalty. Falater admitted to stabbing his wife, 
dragging her body to the backyard swimming pool and holding her 
head under water, but claimed he had no memory of the events.

	BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's parliament approved the building of a  
national Holocaust memorial in Berlin today and selected a design 
by New York architect Peter Eisenman envisioning a field of 
tombstone-like pillars. After nearly a decade of indecision over 
how to remember the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis, the 
decision is a crucial step toward realizing the project. 
Construction is expected to begin in early 2000.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins, under pressure from allegations  
of academic fraud in the University of Minnesota basketball 
program, agreed today to a $1.5 million buyout, the university 
announced. Haskins will step down June 30. Haskins' contract had 
been scheduled to run through June 30, 2002. An investigation began 
after the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported in March that Jan 
Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the academic counseling 
unit, said she did more than 400 pieces of course work for at least 
20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998.

<HEADLINE> Hot Sprewell Goes Cold at End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the end, it wasn't the unbelievable string of  
shots that Latrell Sprewell made but the two he missed that the New 
York Knicks will remember all summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell went on a second-half tear, scoring 14 straight points  
at one point Friday night, trying to singlehandedly keep the Knicks 
alive in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the game hanging in the balance, the Knicks went to  
their hot shooter twice and each time Sprewell missed as San 
Antonio hung on for a 78-77 victory that clinched the Spurs' first 
NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	After Avery Johnson's 18-footer gave the Spurs a one-point lead  
with 47 seconds left, Sprewell tried to respond but missed a 
15-footer. The Knicks had one more chance with 2.1 seconds on the 
clock, but again Sprewell missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy set up the final play with Charlie Ward  
passing to Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great pass by Charlie, good catch by Latrell, just  
unfortunately a little bit under the rim or backboard and we 
couldn't go straight up with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to get a layup from the out-of-bounds,''  
Sprewell said of the final shot. ``Charlie threw an excellent pass. 
I was so far under the basket. I just tried to get the shot off but 
it was far too short. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing once you know it's finally over and you  
know the shot didn't go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell finished with 35 points in a gallant one-man show that  
simply fell a little short at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all for nothing at this point,'' he said. ``I shot the  
ball really well. I'd rather have two points and have the 
victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was ironic that Sprewell, who did not start for New York  
until the playoffs, turned out to be the player the Knicks were 
depending on to keep their season going. 
</P>
<P>
	And for a long time, he seemed perfectly capable of doing it all  
by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hitting shots from all over the floor, driving dunks,  
long-range jumpers, even a 3-pointer that gave New York the lead 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Spurs caught the Knicks at 68, Sprewell turned passer,  
setting up Marcus Camby for a clutch three-point play. Then Camby 
followed with another basket for five straight points -- the only 
ones that Sprewell didn't score for New York in the final 12 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell made big big shots, got to the free throw line and  
played outstanding,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	So it stood to reason that when New York needed one more basket  
in the final minute, Sprewell was the shooter they went to. Both 
times, he came close. Both times, the shots missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell finished 13-of-27 from the field and 8-for-10 from the  
foul line. He led New York with 10 rebounds, had a couple of steals 
and a couple of assists. 
</P>
<P>
	And at the worst time, he also had a couple of misses.

<HEADLINE> Jaguar Cars Designer Lawson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Geoff Lawson, the chief designer for Jaguar Cars  
Ltd. who had a major role in the British automaker's recent 
turnaround, died after suffering a stroke. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson died Thursday after he was admitted to a hospital north  
of London, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He played a role in the design and styling of all Jaguars  
introduced in the past 15 years, including the XJ6 and XJ8 sedans, 
the XK8 roadster and, most recently, the S-type sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson first went to work for Vauxhall, General Motors Corp.'s  
British subsidiary in 1969 as a designer. 
</P>
<P>
	He later worked for GM in the United States, becoming a chief  
designer before he was named Jaguar's styling director in 1984. He 
stayed on with Jaguar after it was bought by Ford Motor Co. in 
1989, overseeing the overhaul of its product line and an expansion 
of Jaguar's styling center. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson is survived by his wife and their two children.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Mitsubishi Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- More than 450 women who sued Mitsubishi  
Motors for sexual harassment soon will begin receiving their share 
of a $34 million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe B. McDade on Thursday approved an Equal  
Employment Opportunity Commission plan to distribute the money. 
Checks ranging from more than $10,000 to $300,000 will be mailed in 
the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC sued Mitsubishi in 1996 on behalf of hundreds of women  
who claimed they were groped and subjected to lewd jokes and 
behavior while working at the automaker's Normal plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC contended plant managers condoned the harassing  
behavior and, in some cases, caused the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement last June, the company agreed to a  
``zero tolerance'' policy toward sexual harassment at the Normal 
plant and to provide training for its 4,000 employes. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hendrickson, the government's lead attorney in the case,  
told the judge that much has changed since the lawsuit was filed. 
He praised the three monitors assigned by the court to check the 
company's adherence to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a real change in the way that people live on  
the factory floor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By allowing the government to present a pattern of sexual  
harassment by Mitsubishi employees, McDade gave employers a 
``wake-up call,'' Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can now present a case which puts the big picture of what  
was going on at the workplace,'' he said. ``Then all the women can 
come in and say I was there and found it offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, he said, women had to prove each individual incident  
of harassment, making a large-scale sexual harassment claim 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims by 17 of the 486 women involved in the suit were  
dismissed after they were deemed meritless.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston Corp. plan to  
loan $14.6 billion dollars to small borrowers and community 
development programs after their merger, The Boston Globe reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe quoted sources as saying the banks have proposed a  
five-year program involving about $7.5 million for small business 
loans, $4 billion for affordable home mortgages, $2 billion for 
community development projects and $1 billion for consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has been delivered to several prominent community  
organizations in recent days, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Community groups and state officials have expressed concern that  
the pending Fleet-BankBoston merger, which will create the nation's 
eighth-largest bank, would mean reduced lending to the poor, 
minority borrowers and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet and BankBoston are seeking regulatory approval for their  
$16 billion merger, which would create a bank with $160 billion in 
assets.

<HEADLINE> Intel Discloses European Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM (AP) -- Intel Corp.'s chief executive, Craig Barrett,  
disclosed on Friday that Intel has invested tens of millions of 
dollars in European Internet provider World Online International. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to go into specifics, but we can say the  
investment was worth in the tens of millions of dollars,'' Barrett 
said during a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	World Online currently operates in 12 European countries with  
about 800,000 individual subscribers and 15,000 business 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has invested in hundreds of high-tech companies, including  
Web sites, as part of its strategy to create demand for its 
microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett also said he sees potential for the Netherlands -- along  
with the United Kingdom -- to become a ``major hub for e-commerce in 
western Europe.'' He noted that the country has a high cable 
network density and active government participation in developing 
Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett also said that Intel is starting a long-term  
relationship with the Netherlands' Twente University, which will 
include donations for the university's laboratory and scholarships. 
He declined to give figures.

<HEADLINE> Game Blocker in Next Windows Version </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Parents will be able to restrict the kinds of  
games their children play by enabling a feature to be included in a 
new version of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system due out 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based software company is currently working  
with game manufacturers to embed code information on ratings in 
their new games, which the Windows Game Manager would check, said 
Kevin Bachus, product manager for Microsoft's multimedia group. 
Game ratings are currently printed on game packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	The feature would allow parents to keep games containing  
excessive violence, sexual content or expletives from being played 
on the computer. Microsoft's Internet Explorer has a similar 
feature that can be used to block access to certain Web sites, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's planned move comes at a time when the computer and  
video game industry is under siege because of concerns about the 
effect of such violence on children and its possible connection to 
the school shootings around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Lowenstein, president of Interactive Digital Software  
Association, the Washington, D.C.-based game publishers' lobbying 
group, said he thought the feature sounded like a useful tool and 
predicted support for it from the software industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think philosophically it's the kind of thing as an industry  
we've always been supportive of -- parental empowerment tools,'' 
Lowenstein said. ``Anything that facilitates the control of what 
kids have access to is positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Stephens, president of the Reston, Va.-based research firm  
PC Data Inc., questioned whether the program would be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any technologically savvy kid is much more  
technologically savvy than their parents. Maybe this will give some 
parents some peace of mind, but I don't think it will have any 
impact,'' Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens said a recent PC Data survey found that most people  
believe violent movies and television shows are more damaging to 
children than computer games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is this -- do we ban everything because there are  
crazy people out there and we do not know what sets them off?'' 
Stephens asked. ``I think that's overkill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bachus said Microsoft was confident the blocking feature could  
be made easy enough for a non-computer-savvy parent to use as well 
as secure via a password. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be ways to skirt around this but ... we  
think it gives parents another tool to try to be a better parent,'' 
Bachus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents also would have the option to specifically approve  
certain games or programs, such as a word-processing program, that 
might not be rated, Bachus said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Urges Europe To Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's most influential group of  
businessmen has urged Europe to counter the growing economic and 
political clout of the United States by opening its market to South 
American goods in a transatlantic free trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of such a zone between the European Union and  
Mercosur -- a customs union comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay 
and Uruguay as full members and Bolivia and Chile as associates -- 
will be the top issue of Rio de Janeiro's June 28-29 summit of EU 
leaders and their Latin American and Caribbean counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stronger (trade) ties with the European Union will open a huge  
market for us and reduce the economic and political weight of the 
United States in Latin America,'' said Luiz Fernando Furlan, an 
official with the Federation of Industries of the State of Sao 
Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	``An EU-Mercosur free trade agreement will counter the opening  
of (South America's) market to American products'' via the 
U.S.-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas, or FTAA, Furlan 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month it seemed that the EU Commission, the EU's  
executive body, would not receive a negotiating mandate for free 
trade talks because of France's refusal to include farm subsidies, 
tariff barriers and other regulations on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, EU leaders authorized the mandate, which  
stipulates that talks on regulations, such as food safety and 
hygiene standards, will begin immediately, while the more 
contentious tariff-reduction negotiations will start in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the mandate, the summit would have ``amounted to little  
more than a photo opportunity,'' said Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Luiz Felipe Lampreia. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying that an EU-Mercosur trade agreement would help avoid the  
FTAA from becoming the only trade alternative for South America, 
Lampreia added: ``We cannot go down just one path, or put all our 
eggs in one basket. We want (trade) equilibrium with the EU and the 
FTAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruy Martins Altenfender Silva, one of the directors of the  
Federation of Industries, said businesses do not expect the summit 
to result in any immediate reduction of trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will only begin happening after the Millennium Round,''  
Silva said, referring to the World Trade Organization talks, which 
start in November in Seattle. ``The most we can expect from the 
summit is a clear and concise agenda of issues to be negotiated, 
and with no taboos like farm subsidies.''

<HEADLINE> Bengals Acquire Cowboys Fullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Fullback Nicky Sualua, the man who was with  
former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Mark Tuinei when he died of 
an accidental drug overdose, was acquired on waivers Friday by the 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sualua, a 5-foot-11, 257-pound blocking back, was drafted by  
Dallas in the fourth round in 1997. He played in 26 games, but has 
no rushing statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked him very much when he played at Ohio State,'' Bengals  
president Mike Brown said. ``He is a very good blocker, and now he 
has two years of experience in the league. We're glad to have the 
opportunity to take a look at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sualua told police he found Tuinei unconscious in his car  
outside Tuinei's home in Plano, Texas, on the morning of May 6. 
Sualua revived him briefly through CPR, but Tuinei was dead when he 
arrived at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A final autopsy released this week by the Collin County Medical  
Examiner's office said Tuinei, 39, died of a lethal combination of 
heroin and a form of the drug ecstasy.

<HEADLINE>  Huffins, Moore Battle for Decathlon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Chris Huffins, heavily favored to win the  
U.S. decathlon title, didn't feel like a shoo-in during the last 
leg of his 400-meter sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things were good, others not so good,'' Huffins said  
between deep breaths Thursday at the USA Outdoor Track and Field 
Championships. ``The only bad thing was the 400. I can't believe I 
ran that slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins' time of 49.41 was eighth-fastest in the field of 15  
competitors, but he still held the lead heading into today's final 
five events. Huffins has 4,523 points, ahead of Abilene Christian's 
Stephen Moore, who has 4,278. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you go over 4,500, it's a good day,'' said Huffins,  
who fell short of his opening-day personal best of 4,687. ``It's 
not great, but not bad. A day with this weather, it's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain in the morning gave way to swirling winds and  
temperatures that dropped into the mid-50s by late afternoon. By 
that time, few at Hayward Field were sticking around for the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins, the No. 5-ranked decathlete in world, became the clear  
favorite to win the title when world record-holder Dan O'Brien was 
unable to compete with a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moore, who suffered a back injury during warmups in the long  
jump, pushed Huffins much of the day, tying him for first in the 
high jump at 6 feet, 11 1/2 inches. The duel pushed back the start of 
the 400 by more than an hour. Moore also finished second in the 
long jump to Huffins, who cleared 25-1 1/4. Huffins ran the fastest 
100, 10.45, and was second in the shot put at 50-1 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five events are the 110 hurdles, discus, pole vault,  
javelin and 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's other intriguing competition was DeDee Nathan against  
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, the world heptathlon leader, brought back memories of  
O'Brien's fate in the 1992 U.S. Olympic Trials as she failed to 
clear a height in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried,'' Nathan said after three misses at 5 feet,  
7 1/4 inches. ``I'll finish (the two-day, seven-event competition) and 
be in the top three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's far from where O'Brien finished seven years ago, when he  
went in as the favorite in the decathlon, failed to clear a height 
in the pole vault, wound up 11th and did not make the American team 
for the Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships are the qualifier for the world  
championships at Seville, Spain, in August, with the top three 
finishers in each event making the team -- provided they have met 
the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably will work in Nathan's favor, even if she doesn't  
finish in the top three after Friday's final three heptathlon 
events. That's because she is one of only of two Americans -- Shelia 
Burrell is the other -- who have met the qualifying standard of 
6,000 points, and the eventual top three aren't expected to reach 
that mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Nathan, the 1999 world indoor pentathlon champion,  
would be added to the team. She registered a career-best 6,577 
points at Gotzis, Austria, on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic,'' the smiling, confident Nathan said after her  
surprising flop in the high jump. ``I'm not discouraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she still was in last place in the field of 11 with  
2,866 points, she trailed third-place Nicole Haynes by only 634 
points. That, she figured, would not be an insurmountable total to 
overcome in today's final events, the long jump, javelin and 800 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell was the leader with 3,585 points.  
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's finals, LaMark Carter won his second consecutive  
men's triple jump title, soaring a wind-aided 56-3 1/4 inches; Alan 
Culpepper, runnerup in the 5,000 meters the past two years, won the 
10,000 in 28:22.46; Dawn Ellerbe took her fourth women's hammer 
throw title in five years, setting a meet record of 212-5 on the 
final attempt of the competition; UCLA's Seilalu Sua, three-time 
NCAA champion in the women's discus, won her second straight 
national title at 203-8; and Elizabeth Jackson took the women's 
3,000 steeplechase at 10:07.23, the second-fastest ever by an 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper's triumph put pressure on his wife, Shayne, for a  
family sweep when she runs the women's 1,500 Saturday. Brad Hauser, 
the 1998 NCAA champion, finished second, and Abdi Abdirahman, a 
native of Eritrea who became a U.S. citizen this year, finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for the other guys, I didn't take any of the  
lead duties, which was selfish of me,'' Culpepper said. ``But as 
far as speed in the whole group, I knew I'd be the better one. That 
last 100 meters was the longest 100 of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellerbe, the American record-holder in the hammer at 230-2,  
broke Windy Dean's meet record of 210-4, set last year. Runnerup 
Tamika Powell also surpassed Dean's old record, throwing 210-10. 
Dean finished third at 210-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel any pressure on the final throw,'' Ellerbe said.  
``I thought it was now or never. It was a matter of pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder in the 400, was a late  
withdrawal because of a hamstring injury. Kym Carter Begel, the 
1994 heptathlon winner and a member of four world championship 
teams, also was a late scratch after straining a calf muscle while 
warming up.

<HEADLINE>  Huffins, Moore Battle for Decathlon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Chris Huffins, heavily favored to win the  
U.S. decathlon title, didn't feel like a shoo-in during the last 
leg of his 400-meter sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things were good, others not so good,'' Huffins said  
between deep breaths Thursday at the USA Outdoor Track and Field 
Championships. ``The only bad thing was the 400. I can't believe I 
ran that slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins' time of 49.41 was eighth-fastest in the field of 15  
competitors, but he still held the lead heading into today's final 
five events. Huffins has 4,523 points, ahead of Abilene Christian's 
Stephen Moore, who has 4,278. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you go over 4,500, it's a good day,'' said Huffins,  
who fell short of his opening-day personal best of 4,687. ``It's 
not great, but not bad. A day with this weather, it's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain in the morning gave way to swirling winds and  
temperatures that dropped into the mid-50s by late afternoon. By 
that time, few at Hayward Field were sticking around for the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins, the No. 5-ranked decathlete in world, became the clear  
favorite to win the title when world record-holder Dan O'Brien was 
unable to compete with a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moore, who suffered a back injury during warmups in the long  
jump, pushed Huffins much of the day, tying him for first in the 
high jump at 6 feet, 11 1/2 inches. The duel pushed back the start of 
the 400 by more than an hour. Moore also finished second in the 
long jump to Huffins, who cleared 25-1 1/4. Huffins ran the fastest 
100, 10.45, and was second in the shot put at 50-1 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five events are the 110 hurdles, discus, pole vault,  
javelin and 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's other intriguing competition was DeDee Nathan against  
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, the world heptathlon leader, brought back memories of  
O'Brien's fate in the 1992 U.S. Olympic Trials as she failed to 
clear a height in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried,'' Nathan said after three misses at 5 feet,  
7 1/4 inches. ``I'll finish (the two-day, seven-event competition) and 
be in the top three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's far from where O'Brien finished seven years ago, when he  
went in as the favorite in the decathlon, failed to clear a height 
in the pole vault, wound up 11th and did not make the American team 
for the Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships are the qualifier for the world  
championships at Seville, Spain, in August, with the top three 
finishers in each event making the team -- provided they have met 
the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably will work in Nathan's favor, even if she doesn't  
finish in the top three after Friday's final three heptathlon 
events. That's because she is one of only of two Americans -- Shelia 
Burrell is the other -- who have met the qualifying standard of 
6,000 points, and the eventual top three aren't expected to reach 
that mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Nathan, the 1999 world indoor pentathlon champion,  
would be added to the team. She registered a career-best 6,577 
points at Gotzis, Austria, on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic,'' the smiling, confident Nathan said after her  
surprising flop in the high jump. ``I'm not discouraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she still was in last place in the field of 11 with  
2,866 points, she trailed third-place Nicole Haynes by only 634 
points. That, she figured, would not be an insurmountable total to 
overcome in today's final events, the long jump, javelin and 800 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell was the leader with 3,585 points.  
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's finals, LaMark Carter won his second consecutive  
men's triple jump title, soaring a wind-aided 56-3 1/4 inches; Alan

<HEADLINE> Authorities Confront ``Gifting Club'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOMERSET, N.J. (AP) -- The gifting has begun at the Amigos  
Associates Social Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people line up in front of their team captain, pulling out  
wads of $100 bills. They each count 20 bills into their captain's 
hands. The captain walks away with $16,000, and the donors think 
that in a month or so, they will too. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is a scam, I cannot wait to be scammed again,''  
organization leader Linda Shepard told 2,000 people Thursday night 
at the Garden State Exhibition Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's ``gifting club,'' which started six months ago with 13  
people and has grown to 3,900 members, relies on the recruitment of 
new investors to pay people at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Some state officials argue it's a simple pyramid scheme, a  
consumer fraud that eventually collapses when longtime members run 
out of new recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	But membership comes with a key caveat: recruits must read a  
statement saying they are offering $2,000 as a gift -- and expect 
nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's carefully worded,'' said Union County prosecutor Robert  
O'Leary. ``It's not a crime to operate what that group is operating 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began investigating the club this month after  
learning that six Plainfield police officers allegedly tried to 
solicit business for the club while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut officials are also looking into whether an offshoot  
of Amigos is holding similar meetings near Greenwich and Stamford, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Two assemblymen introduced a bill this week that would make it  
illegal to participate in a group where an investor needs to 
recruit many others in order to reap a windfall. The measure might 
make Amigos Associates easier to prosecute, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a 36-year-old church musician and record store owner,  
is baffled by the attention. She says she didn't know what a 
pyramid scheme was before prosecutors began their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're making me out to be much smarter than I really am,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard said the club does more than enrich its ranked members:  
``We give money to charities. We help inner-city programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Amigos does generate cash for its members, who are now so  
numerous that they meet in huge exhibition halls around the state 
three times a week to move up the ladder on the club's gifting 
``ships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each ship has a team captain, two superstars, four all-stars,  
and eight stars. The stars each pay $2,000 to the captain, who then 
retires. Everyone else moves up a rung on the ladder and tries to 
recruit new stars. 
</P>
<P>
	After collecting, the captain makes a $500 donation to cover  
expenses and pay Anova-Tau Inc., Shepard's for-profit corporation. 
Members can drop out at any time and get their money back, as long 
as they find a replacement donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of dollars in cash exchange hands on some nights.  
Guards check people at the door for weapons, and cameras are 
banned. Club members were eager to speak out in support of Amigos 
but reluctant to give their full names, saying they worried about 
their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	After two weeks, an investor who would only identify himself as  
Joe said he is one step away from being a team captain. He decided 
to join after coming to a meeting and watching 80 people collect 
$16,000 each in one night. He took his $2,000 out of a brokerage 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get a better return on my money here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Melissa, 28, has been on a team for two months and hasn't cashed  
out, but isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play the stock market. I go to Atlantic City,'' she said.  
``That's throwing money away. This is an opportunity that's going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, who said she has made about $40,000 as a team member,  
said she isn't sure how many members have multiplied on their 
investments. On average, it takes 30 to 40 days, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not get rich quick. It's just get rich,'' she said.  
``This takes time and this takes effort, and you have to work with 
your team.''

<HEADLINE> Fighter Has Seen Rock Bottom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Johnny Tapia is touched by Peter McNeeley's  
ordeal following his ridiculed loss to Mike Tyson in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year after I fought Mike Tyson I was sitting in a crack  
house looking for rocks that weren't there,'' McNeeley said. 
``Looking for ghosts that weren't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried,'' Tapia said Friday of McNeeley's description of life  
after Tyson. McNeeley lost in 89 seconds when his manager jumped 
into the ring and stopped the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapia, a fighter at the top, knows what life's like at the  
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBA bantamweight champion's father was murdered before he  
was born and his mother died violently when he was 8. Then there 
was the cocaine and alcohol that led to numerous arrests, 
apparently ruining a promising boxing career. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of 1990, Tapia's record was 21-0-1. He didn't fight  
again until 1994 after getting his life back together with the help 
of Teresa Chavez, his future wife and manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Tapia (46-0-2, of Albuquerque) won the WBO  
junior bantamweight title in 1994 and added the IBF junior bantam 
championship in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He relinquished those titles last year and won the WBA 118-pound  
championship, which he will defend against Paulie Ayala (27-1, 12 
knockouts) of Fort Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout will be the second half of an SET pay-per-view  
championship doubleheader at Mandalay Bay, with telecast starting 
at midnight EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first title fight, WBC lightweight champion Stevie  
Johnston (26-1, 14 knockouts) of Denver will box Aldo Rios (20-0, 4 
knockouts) of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Johnston's first fight since he outpointed Cesar  
Bazan on Feb. 27 and regained the 135-pound title he had lost on 
points to Bazan on June 13, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeeley, who has straightened out his life, will fight in a  
four-round bout against 311-pound Eric Resch, who fights as 
Butterbean, the King of the Four-Rounders. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterbean (42-1-1, 33 knockouts), of Jasper, Ala. will get  
$60,000. McNeeley (45-4, 34 knockouts), 212, of Medfield, Mass., 
will get $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old McNeeley thanked his parents and manager Vinnie  
Vecchione for helping him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come back from the depths,'' he said at a news  
conference. ``I'm a warrior and I'm going to prove on Saturday that 
I deserve to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For McNeeley, ``here'' is a four-round bout against an opponent  
many consider more a personality than a fighter. And the bout is a 
long, long way from main events, title fights and the $540,000 
purse he got for fighting Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	For McNeeley, outside the ring, ``here'' is simply a new day.  
</P>
<P>
	``Peter, one day at a time baby,'' Tapia told him. ``We're right  
there with you.''

<HEADLINE> Review Urged for Insurance Policy / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A guest slips on your wet patio. Outdoor  
critters damage a backyard shed. A tree crushes your garage while 
water floods the basement during a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Are all these covered by your homeowners or renters policy?  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, no, yes ... and maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	Figuring out what's protected by insurance can sometimes turn  
into a guessing game for those unfamiliar with the workings of 
their policies. In other words, many of today's busy homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
	Few bother to regularly review the fine-print exclusions set by  
insurers -- and more of them have been creeping up, especially after 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who reads all that stuff? It's so long and complicated,'' said  
Robert Hunter, director of insurance for Consumer Federation of 
America in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial advisers and consumer groups, though, recommend  
homeowners conduct regular insurance checkups, reviewing their 
policies for any holes in coverage just as they may survey their 
homes each year for cracks in the foundation or leaks in the roof. 
</P>
<P>
	A home and its contents often represent a major component of net  
worth, and any losses due to inadequate coverage could derail years 
of sound financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Now may be a good time for an insurance inspection since most  
people tend to entertain more during the summer months, thereby 
increasing potential liabilities, and the hurricane season can 
bring some potentially damaging weather. (Forecasters predict the 
'99 Atlantic hurricane season will be more active than usual, with 
14 named storms and nine hurricanes, four of them major.) 
</P>
<P>
	Standard homeowner policies, required by mortgage lenders, cover  
loss of home and personal possessions due to a number of perils, 
such as fires, vandalism, theft, and most natural disasters. They 
also provide limited liability protection. 
</P>
<P>
	If a tree falls on your garage, you'd be covered for damage to  
the structure, along with the cost of removing the tree. 
</P>
<P>
	If someone slips on your wet patio, you'd be covered for medical  
expenses arising from any injury, a limited amount of damages, and 
legal costs to defend yourself against legal claims. 
</P>
<P>
	If a court award exceeds limits of your liability coverage,  
however, your assets could be at risk. An ``umbrella'' policy may 
be necessary. It typically provides additional liability coverage 
of $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne M. Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information  
Institute Inc. in New York, notes there are numerous other limits 
and exclusions homeowners must be aware of. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be necessary for some households, for example, to  
purchase special property endorsements, or ``floaters,'' to insure 
certain valuables, like jewelry, silverware, furs or electronic 
equipment at higher amounts than what is allowed under a standard 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding is another big issue. Those who live in a flood-prone  
area should consider buying separate flood insurance provided 
through the Federal Insurance Administration, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Water seepage is not covered. It's considered a maintenance  
issue,'' said Salvatore. ``(But) if your house is damaged by an 
insurable peril (like a hurricane) and water gets in because of 
that, you're covered'' under the standard policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding caused by burst pipes and any other accidental  
discharge of water from your plumbing system also is covered under 
standard policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses caused by earth movements aren't. This covers  
earthquakes, landslides, sinkholes, mud slides or tremors related 
to a volcanic eruption. If you live in a high-risk area, separate 
earthquake insurance may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Other common exclusions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Neglect or wear and tear. It's up to individuals to use all  
reasonable means to preserve their property, and if they don't, 
coverage may be forfeited. That includes damage caused by smog, 
rust, mold, wet or dry rot, birds, vermin, rodents, insects, even 
pets. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ordinance or law. This means enforcement of any ordinance  
regulating construction, repair or demolition of a structure. If 
your house burns down and a city ordinance requires it be replaced 
with a stronger structure, your policy might not cover this. 
</P>
<P>
	--Business losses. This includes parts of your house used for  
business, data or papers taken from work and computers, software or 
other property belonging to your company. Liability falls into this 
area, too. There's no coverage if someone injures himself while 
delivering a package to your home office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people buy BOPs -- Business Owner Policies,'' said  
Salvatore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter says some policy exclusions, like the one pertaining to  
building ordinances, were a direct result of Hurricane Andrew, 
which resulted in $26.7 billion worth of property and casualty 
insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
	He says many companies also have done away with guaranteed  
replacement cost policies, which used to pay whatever it cost to 
rebuild a home to the state it was before a fire or other disaster, 
even if it exceeded the policy limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, he says, insurers are only willing to pay up to 20  
percent above the policy limits.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton News Conference-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's news conference Friday, as  
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Earlier today in a speech at Georgetown University I  
discussed the opportunities now before our nation. Before I take 
questions, let me just take a moment to recap what I believe is 
America's agenda in the coming months. Our trip to Europe advanced 
America's ideals and interests. Working with our partners, we won 
an agreement to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world, 
took new steps to strengthen the global economy, agreed to triple 
the debt relief provided for many of the poorest nations and to 
strengthen democracy and reform in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	We also worked together to put in place the building blocks of  
peace in Kosovo and to put the Balkans on a shared path to a 
prosperous, united future. I will meet with the region's leaders 
later this summer to give the process further momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	I met with Kosovar refugees who are planning to return home.  
They thanked America and our allies for giving them a chance to 
reclaim their lives on their native land. 
</P>
<P>
	I also met with and thanked some of the American airmen and  
women who achieved this success and with some of our and other NATO 
troops who are going into Kosovo now to make sure we win the peace. 
They know that they're doing the right thing and I am very proud of 
all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	While America is enjoying success abroad, it is important that  
we keep pushing forward on our challenges here at home. This is a 
time of great hope for our nation. Yesterday, we learned that the 
American economy grew at a 4.3 percent in the first three months of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	America plainly is on the right track. But we will be judged by  
what we do with this opportunity -- whether we seize it or squander 
it in petty bickering and partisan animosity. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be plenty of time for politics in the months to come.  
The summer should be a season of progress. We should start by 
acting quickly on issues where most lawmakers -- Democratic and 
Republican -- agree: legislation to let disabled Americans keep 
their Medicaid health insurance when they go to work; an increase 
in the minimum wage; campaign finance reform; a strong and 
enforceable patients' bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
	I was heartened that earlier today, the House overwhelmingly  
passed legislation making sure that foster children are not cast 
out in the cold when their time in foster care ends. This is a 
vital issue -- one that Hillary has championed for many years -- and 
I am very pleased by the House action. 
</P>
<P>
	Then we must turn to broader ways, in some ways more difficult  
challenges facing our nation. First, we have a duty to maintain the 
fiscal discipline that has produced our prosperity, and use it to 
strengthen Social Security and Medicare for the 21st century and to 
pay down our national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday I will propose the detailed plan to modernize  
Medicare, cutting cost, improving service and helping senior 
citizens with their greatest growing need: affordable prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, we must widen the circle of opportunity by investing in  
education while demanding accountability and insisting that the 
Congress keep our commitment of last year to finish hiring 100,000 
more teachers to lower class size in the early grades. 
</P>
<P>
	Third, in two weeks I will be joined by corporate, civic and  
political leaders of both parties on a four-day tour of America's 
new markets -- the places in our country which have not yet felt the 
surge of our prosperity -- to mobilize the private sector to bring 
jobs and growth to our poorest neighborhoods and to build support 
for our New Market Initiative, to give tax credits and loan 
guarantees to those who invest in America on the same terms we give 
to those who invest in developing the economies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	And fourth, in the wake of the tragedy at Littleton, we must  
continue to meet the challenge of youth violence. Hillary and I are 
developing a national campaign on youth violence, working with 
parents, educators, the entertainment industry and others. 
</P>
<P>
	But we also must make sensible steps -- take sensible steps to  
take guns out of the hands of criminals and away from children. We 
can't expect young people to stand up to violence if Congress won't 
stand up to the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	I proposed, and with a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Gore  
the Senate passed, the measure to close the gun show loophole. The 
Senate also passed legislation to require child safety locks, to 
ban large ammunition clips for assault weapons, to ban violent 
juveniles from owning handguns as adults. Two weeks ago the 
Republicans in the House blocked that measure. They would even 
weaken the current law by letting criminals store their guns at 
pawn shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there is still time for Congress to act. The Republican  
leaders could appoint legislators as negotiators to craft a bill 
that includes the tough Senate provisions. I hope they will do that 
and send me a strong bill. Plainly, the country wants that. 
</P>
<P>
	Again I say, this is sort of like the Patients' Bill of Rights.  
It's really not a partisan issue anywhere but Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	I hope they will send me a strong bill. If they send me one that  
weakens current law, I will send it back to them and keep working 
until we get the job done right. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, this is admittedly an ambitious agenda but it can all be  
done in the coming months. I will use all the powers available to 
me as president, working with Congress and with my executive 
authority. I will summon the citizens of our country to help us to 
solve these problems. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a good time for America, but we will be judged by  
whether we make the most of it. I look forward to making the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, despite the end of the war there is still a  
new wave of violence and terror in Kosovo. Only this time, it's 
Serb homes that are being burned, Serb stores that are being looted 
and Serb civilians who are being killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Are you alarmed by what's going on there? And why is NATO  
letting this happen? Can't NATO do more to stop it? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, NATO is not letting it happen.  
We're doing what we can to stop it and I am concerned about it. I'm 
not particularly surprised after what they've been through.

<HEADLINE> Hedrick Announces Hispanic Race Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SONOMA, Calif. (AP) -- Winston Cup team owner Larry Hedrick and  
HRT Motorsports will form NASCAR's first all-Hispanic team. 
</P>
<P>
	HRT (Hispanic Race Team) and Hedrick Motorsports will debut Nov.  
13, with car 41 driven by David Green in the Busch Series Miami 300 
at Homestead-Miami Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedrick also owns Green's Winston Cup ride.  
</P>
<P>
	The all-Hispanic team was the concept of HRT founders Rudy  
Rodriguez and Mike Vazquez, who became fascinated with NASCAR when 
Texas Motor Speedway was built. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to thinking, we should have a Hispanic team,''  
Rodriguez said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo approached Hedrick, who was excited about the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely pleased with the HRT concept, and I am sure that  
with the support of the Hispanic fans and corporations, we can take 
HRT to the next level,'' Hedrick said. ``The most important thing 
is that we want to win. We all feel that this is going to be a 
great relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to create an all-Hispanic team, from the driver, to  
the crew, to the sponsors, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the general plan. We want a winning team on the  
track,'' he said. ``We're doing everything possible to have a full 
Hispanic team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez didn't want to reveal too much about the team's plans.  
But he said the sport will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a win-win for everybody: NASCAR, racing, the sponsors,  
the Hispanic community. Everybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SMOKE SIGNALS:* Road racing specialist Boris Said, a veteran of  
a variety of endurance events, got a nasty lesson Friday on the 
endurance of NASCAR engines in his first Winston Cup outing for 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fifth in practice, even with a short-lived power plant.  
</P>
<P>
	``We only made 2 3/4 laps and then it blew up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The second engine went up in a puff of smoke just past the last  
turn of the Sears Point Raceway and a couple of hundred yards short 
of the start-finish line in a qualifying run that left him stranded 
36th on the provisional grid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just blew again,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Is there a spare for Sunday?  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess so. It'll probably blow, too.''  
</P>
<P>
	Said, who raced in the Trans-Am series as well as the 12-hour  
race at Sebring and the 24 hours at Daytona, also is running a 
limited campaign in the Craftsman Truck series. His team did not 
compete this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He took part in the non-points Winston Open earlier this year  
and qualified for an injured Jimmy Spencer at Watkins Glen in 
August, running the final 79 laps of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	His Winston Cup Ford is owned by Mark Simo, the brother of  
Trans-Am competitor Brian Simo, who traded paint and body parts 
with Said in that series. Brian Simo is here this weekend to root 
on his former foe. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUT OF THIS WORLD:* George Jetson and his dog Astro were on  
hand to help unveil the new design for the Cartoon Network Ford 
themed on ``The Jetsons'' television series. 
</P>
<P>
	They must have brought a little rocket fuel as well, as driver  
Jerry Nadeau cranked out a 98.213-mph lap around the 1.949-mile 
road course for third spot on Sunday's starting grid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a really good lap and I'm just looking forward to  
Sunday,'' he said. ``I think we have an even better race car than 
qualifying car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nadeau started second last year in his inaugural race here, but  
finished 43rd after an off-road excursion on the 13th lap.

<HEADLINE> Study Sheds New Light on Insomnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The brain clock that regulates sleep works as  
accurately for the old as for the young, suggesting that many 
theories about insomnia among the aged are flawed, according to a 
study published today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to rethink all of the explanations we  
have been giving for insomnia,'' said study lead author Dr. Charles 
A. Czeisler of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other major findings appearing today in the journal  
Science is that the brain clock regulating sleep is on a 24-hour 
schedule, not the 25-hour cycle that researchers have long believed 
was unique to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the textbooks indicate that humans have a 25-hour day  
instead of a 24-hour day. We now know that is wrong,'' said 
Czeisler. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew A. Monjan, chief of neurobiology at the National  
Institute of Aging, said the new study changes fundamental 
assumptions about the causes of sleeplessness among the elderly and 
will prompt researchers to find new solutions for a sleep disorder 
that affects more than 10 million elderly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know now that poor sleep is not a function of being old by  
itself,'' said Monjan. ``We also know now that you don't treat 
insomnia by just taking a sleeping pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers need to look at such things as exposure to room  
light, illness and genetics to explain why insomnia has become a 
troublesome part of the lives of millions of people, particularly 
the elderly, Monjan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard E. Kronauer of Harvard University, a senior author of  
the study, said the research emphasized how exposure to artificial 
light during nighttime hours can reset the body's sleep clock, 
making it difficult to get up on time in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been finding that people young and old are more  
sensitive to light than we suspected,'' said Kronauer. ``Light in 
the evening is a strong influence on shifting the clock toward a 
later time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tendency of many sleepless people to push bedtime later and  
later, particularly on the weekends, has been blamed on what 
researchers thought was a natural adjustment to the cumulative 
effect of a 25-hour brain clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the new study shows the clock is actually 24 hours,  
researchers now think exposure to light is a much more important 
factor than previously believed in resetting the clock and 
disrupting sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, two dozen men and women endured a month of living  
in subdued light, with no clues to the passage of time, while 
researchers monitored body chemistry and temperature that mark the 
action of the body clock. Eleven of the subjects were young men, 
with an average age of 23.7 years, and 13, nine men and four women, 
were older, with an average age of 67.4 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects were placed on a 28-hour cycle, so their wake-sleep  
cycle was four hours longer than the rest of the world's. Czeisler 
said this elongated cycle disconnected the patients' natural clocks 
from outside influences that usually control a person's day, such 
as work or school schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers measured changes in temperature and chemistry to  
detect when the body clock, or circadian pacemaker, turned on. 
Earlier studies had shown that the clock is centered in the brain's 
hypothalamus. For most people, the impulse to sleep peaks around 10 
p.m. when the body temperature starts dropping. The temperature 
rises at about 4 a.m., increasing the chances of awakening, but two 
hormones, melatonin and cortisol, help the body remain asleep for 
the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Czeisler said the measurements showed that the human sleep clock  
operates on a schedule of 24 hours, 11 minutes, not the 25 hours 
earlier studies had shown. It also showed that for people over 65, 
the clock ticked at almost exactly the pace of people in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies that concluded humans were on a 25-hour cycle may have  
been affected by light exposure, Czeisler said. Even though earlier 
researchers used elaborate precautions to avoid outside influences, 
test subjects routinely used strong artificial lights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light is the most powerful synchronizer of the biological  
clock,'' said Czeisler. When test subjects in the earlier studies 
switched on lights, it was ``giving them the equivalent of a drug 
that reset the clock. That's what resulted in the apparent 25-hour 
period that is published in textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure to light pushes forward the body's schedule for  
releasing melatonin and cortisol, said Kronauer. When these 
hormones are released at the wrong time, it can arouse a person in 
the middle of the night or cause drowsiness during the day.

<HEADLINE> Lightsabers, Dive Sticks Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kids may be trying to emulate their favorite  
Star Wars characters, but a new lightsaber toy could leave them 
with burns, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission has received 38 reports  
about the batteries in Hasbro's Star Wars Lightsabers overheating 
or rupturing. Three users suffered minor burns. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the commission has recalled more than 19 million  
pool ``dive sticks'' because they can impale children who land on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dive sticks are hard, plastic cylinder-shaped objects that stand  
upright on the bottom of pools so children can dive down and 
retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety commission said that at least six children have been  
rectally or vaginally impaled by the toys, which have been sold for 
about 20 years at various retail stores. In another case, a child 
suffered cuts just below her eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the number of reported incidents is relatively low,  
the severity of the injuries that have occurred is very 
significant,'' the commission said in a statement. In four of the 
six incidents documented, the children required surgery and 
hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends that parents throw the toys away. The  
commission's staff is also recommending that the commission itself 
ban the future production and importation of the toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The dive sticks -- measuring 4 to 8 inches -- were sold by 15  
firms at drug, pool and discount stores nationwide for about $4 to 
$7. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightsaber recall includes two models. One is the Darth Maul  
Double-Bladed Lightsaber, which has retractable red plastic ``light 
blades'' on both sides of a metallic-gray hand grip. When the 
blades are fully extended, the toy is 5 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
	The other is the Qui-Gon Jinn Lightsaber, which has a single  
retractable ``light blade'' made of green plastic that extends from 
a metallic-gray hand grip to about 3 feet. Mass merchandise and toy 
stores sold the lightsabers from May 1999 through June 1999 for $20 
to $30. Lightsabers currently being sold with ``Now with battery 
protector'' are not part of this recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using these Lightsabers immediately and  
call Hasbro at 888-690-6141 to get a free repair kit. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also announced the recall of an infant carrier --  
the Snugli Front &AMP; Back Packs with vertical ``T'' straps -- because 
children can fall through it. At least 13 children have slipped 
through the leg openings of the carrier, including one who suffered 
a fractured skull. 
</P>
<P>
	These soft infant carriers have model numbers beginning with 075  
and 080. The model number is on a tag inside the carrier which 
reads, ``SOFT CARRIER'' and the model number. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should immediately stop using these carriers. They can  
call Evenflo at 800-398-8636 anytime to receive instructions on how 
to exchange their carrier for a free, new carrier with smaller leg 
openings.

<HEADLINE> NY Pension Group Brings Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A New York-based public pension fund group,  
which lost more than $250 million when McKesson HBOC Inc.'s stock 
crashed, sued the California company Friday in federal court in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I must take this action to protect the nearly 1  
million members and retirees I represent,'' said New York State 
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, sole trustee of the more than $110 
billion New York Common Retirement Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's public pension fund is the nation's second largest.  
McCall aides said it lost $69 million through its investment with 
McKesson, the nation's largest pharmaceutical supply management and 
health care information technology company. 
</P>
<P>
	The other members of the group suing McKesson on Friday include  
the Florida State Board of Administration, the Anchorage (Alaska) 
Police &AMP; Fire Retirement System, and the Public School Teachers' 
Pension &AMP; Retirement Fund of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has asked the court to make it the lead plaintiff in  
any shareholder class-action lawsuit. More than 30 lawsuits have 
already been filed against McKesson, McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials ``issued numerous false statements about  
McKesson HBOC, its financial results and its business prospects,'' 
the lawsuit alleges. ``These false statements caused the company's 
stock to trade at artificially inflated levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McKesson have fallen more than 50 percent since it  
announced on April 28 it would have to revise some of its past 
earnings reports because it had improperly recorded software sales. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson ousted its top management on Monday over the accounting  
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The board fired McKesson chairman Charles W. McCall, who was  
chairman of HBO &AMP; Co. before McKesson bought that software company 
in January. Charles McCall is not related to the New York state 
comptroller. Mark A. Pulido, president and chief executive of the 
merged company, and chief financial officer Richard H. Hawkins were 
allowed to resign, effective July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment Friday from McKesson on the new  
lawsuit, which seeks to recover losses suffered by the pension fund 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McKesson fell $1 to $31 a share in trading on Friday  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Dole Picks Former Reagan Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole  
is turning to fellow officials from the Ronald Reagan years to 
advise her on policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole on Friday named former United Nations Ambassador Jeane  
Kirkpatrick as her principal foreign policy adviser as she seeks 
the GOP nomination and James H. Burnley IV, former transportation 
secretary, as her main domestic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnley was Mrs. Dole's deputy when she was transportation  
secretary, then succeeded her in the last few years of Reagan's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have known and worked with both Jeane and Jim for many  
years,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``We all worked closely together during 
the Reagan administration. Their sharp minds and demonstrated 
leadership will serve me well as I take my campaign of courageous 
conservatism to the voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkpatrick, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise  
Institute, endorsed Mrs. Dole in April. Burnley is an attorney at 
Winston &AMP; Strawn in Washington.

	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A smokers' rights group is criticizing Sen.  
John McCain for using his free congressional mailing privileges to 
tell voters across the country about tobacco industry lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Smokers Alliance says the Arizona Republican is  
abusing the mailing system to promote views connected with his 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has filed a complaint with the Senate ethics  
committee, whose chairman, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, is a 
rival of McCain for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator's mass mailing is a political letter and is not  
related to matters under current consideration by the Senate,'' 
alliance attorney Mark Braden wrote to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives told the Concord Monitor: ``This  
is nothing more than typical Washington baloney from a paid 
political mouthpiece for big tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's office sent 19,008 letters to people from all 50 states  
who had contacted a Senate committee about a tobacco lawsuit 
settlement bill he sponsored. The bill died on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the ethics committee, McCain's office said it was  
important to tell interested citizens how much money the tobacco 
industry spent to defeat the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He therefore decided to send out a mass mailing, which is a  
fully permissible process that allows senators to communicate their 
views to their constituents and other citizens,'' the office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith spokeswoman Lisa Harrison said committee members deal with  
``friends and foes'' alike and it's not a conflict of interest for 
Smith to handle a complaint against another presidential candidate. 
</P>

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Republican Party's will be better off  
after its crowded race for a presidential nominee, former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be better off as a country -- and we will be better off  
in our party -- if we have a contest within our party,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the party needs to find its best candidate to match the  
debating skills of presumptive Democratic nominee Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long way to go before we select our Republican  
nominee,'' Alexander told a luncheon audience at the Young 
Republicans National Federation's convention. ``We make a mistake 
in not electing our best, and we have 16 years of Clinton and 
Gore.''

	ANCHORAGE (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer  
began a four-day campaign swing through Alaska on Friday by 
promising to reduce the federal government's influence over the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Adopting a theme popular with Alaska Republicans, the  
conservative activist promised to push for oil exploration in the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, rein in the U.S. Forest Service's 
recent reductions on logging in national forests and lessen federal 
restrictions on recreational land uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alaska is a state, but it's being treated as a colony,'' said  
Bauer. ``Washington treats you as if you were serfs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with his Alaska-specific platform, Bauer also stressed the  
key points of his national agenda. He opposes abortion and gay 
marriage and supports changes in education including prayer in 
public schools and school vouchers. To achieve those goals, he said 
he would appoint more conservative judges to the U.S. Supreme Court 
and other judicial posts.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics' Baker To Be Free Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Vin Baker, whose disappointing, injury-filled  
season was a major factor in the Seattle SuperSonics missing the 
playoffs for the first time in nine seasons, has opted to become a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Walker, the team's president and general manager, made the  
announcement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says he wants to be back here,'' Walker said. ``And we want  
him back. So I think things will work out. We were expecting this. 
So it's not big news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Baker had a subpar season, averaging career lows of  
13.8 points and 6.2 rebounds, the Sonics are expected to have to 
pay a stiff price to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the league's new labor agreement, Baker can demand $87  
million for seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the original contract he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks,  
he had the right to become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The soonest the Sonics can re-sign Baker, a four-time All-Star,  
will be Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 27, has career averages of 18.1 points and 9.0 rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to play for the USA team in the (Olympic)  
qualifying rounds in Puerto Rico,'' Walker said. ``So I'm going to 
go down and see him and, in all likelihood, start recruiting him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton, Seattle's point guard who averaged 21.7 points last  
season, has said he wants the Sonics to bring back his friend. 
Payton has pressured the Sonics' ownership and front office to 
improve the team's roster for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker and Payton have the same representatives, brothers Aaron  
and Eric Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker came to the Sonics from the Bucks in September 1997 in a  
three-team, five-player trade that sent Shawn Kemp to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first season in Seattle, Baker helped the Sonics win 61  
games and reach the playoffs under coach George Karl. But he 
reported to the team overweight and out of shape this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Payton's outstanding season, the team went 25-25 and  
missed the playoffs under new coach Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker missed 16 games because of a deep bone contusion in his  
right knee and a partially torn ligament of his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked real hard on his offseason conditioning,'' Walker  
said. ``He's been here (at the Sonics' practice facility) a lot 
when he's been in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics have the 13th overall pick in the NBA draft Wednesday  
night.

<HEADLINE> Lucent To Acquire Nexabit Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARLBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies plans to acquire  
networking equipment company Nexabit Networks in a $900 million 
stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately-held Nexabit designs ``super switches'' that enable  
Internet and telecommunications providers, as well as other 
technology companies, to move information at high speeds over their 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nexabit products are in trials with service providers, and  
have performed exceptionally well, said Lucent spokesman Jeff Baum. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the fastest product of its type,'' Baum said in  
announcing the deal on Friday. ``It's unprecedented speed for 
moving information across the Internet and wide area networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, of Murray Hill, N.J., is the telecommunications  
equipment manufacturing company which was once part of AT&AMP;T Corp., 
the leader in long-distance telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	It is paying about 14 million shares of Lucent common stock,  
worth about $900 million based on Thursday's closing stock prices, 
for Nexabit which is based in Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Nexabit's 120 employees will be absorbed into Lucent without any  
job loss, Baum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction should be completed by July 31.

<HEADLINE> Audit Finds Legal Aid Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two months after the Legal Services Corp.  
admitted a few regional offices overstated their workloads, 
government auditors found that the five largest offices also 
reported 75,000 cases they couldn't document. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore and New York City offices of the federal program,  
which provides free legal help to low-income Americans, reported 
twice as many legal cases as they should have, according to a 
General Accounting Office draft report released to lawmakers 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers say they use case reports when deciding how much money  
the agency should receive. Republican critics of Legal Services 
said the GAO report shows case-reporting problems are more serious 
than the agency initially suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the GAO has confirmed our suspicions of the  
significance and pervasiveness of the problem underscores the need 
to question whether they were hiding this from Congress,'' said 
Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, a member of the House Appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials say that even with the new findings, the number  
of overstated cases is small compared with the total number of poor 
people -- more than 1.7 million -- who have been helped. They denied 
the agency was hiding anything and said that case reporting 
practices have been changed to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services affiliates in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles,  
New York and Puerto Rico overstated the number of cases they 
handled by 75,000 in 1997, according to a summary of the GAO report 
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	That represents one-third of the 221,000 cases that the groups  
said they handled. Cases were double-counted, cases that should 
have been closed were counted as open, and cases paid for from 
nonfederal sources were included with the federal count, the 
summary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also found that some programs had no records to verify  
their clients' income and citizenship eligibility. Such 
documentation is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is doing an internal review of case-reporting  
problems and is investigating whether any provided legal aid to 
ineligible clients, said John McKay, Legal Services president. 
</P>
<P>
	``LSC is completely committed to ensuring all congressional  
restrictions and laws are followed,'' said McKay in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Legal Services gave $283 million in federal money to  
about 260 local affiliates to finance legal help for low-income 
Americans with civil cases such as tenant problems or court 
protection from domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers asked the GAO to look into Legal Service's  
case reporting after The Associated Press reported in April that 
the agency overstated tens of thousands of cases handled in 1997. 
An AP review of five other offices among the agency's 269 regional 
programs found officials had overstated their caseload by at least 
90,000.

<HEADLINE> Van Gundy: Knicks Want Me To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy has been told he's wanted back as  
coach of the New York Knicks next year, and he says there is no 
other place he would rather be. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said his assurances came from club president Dave  
Checketts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave made it clear to me he wants me back,'' the coach said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's job was in jeopardy when the Knicks nearly failed to  
make the playoffs, but they went on a roll and became the first 
eighth-seeded team to advance past the second round. They trail the 
San Antonio Spurs 3-1 in the NBA Finals, with Game 5 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he and Checketts will wait until after the finals  
to discuss his situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to make sure it's the right thing for  
everybody,'' Van Gundy said. ``I'm sure it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made it clear New York is where he wants to be.  
</P>
<P>
	``New York is always going to be a place where they play to  
win,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's the attitude of the city that helps 
develop the franchise's mentality. They won't tolerate 
mediocrity.''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels attacked a federal prison  
in southern Colombia early Friday with explosives and automatic 
weapons, blasting open holes in the walls and freeing at least 15 
comrades, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	One inmate was killed and one guard injured in the pre-dawn  
attack, said national prisons spokeswoman Rocio Devia. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 150 guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  
Colombia, or FARC, stormed the penitentiary just outside the 
provincial capital of Neiva at about 1 a.m., said Devia, 
overwhelming the jail's 20 guards. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the jail holds 700 prisoners, many of them insurgents.  
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's 175 federal prisons are badly overcrowded and plagued  
by frequent bloody mutinies and escapes. In May 1998, rebels sprang 
320 inmates in an attack on a prison in the nearby provincial 
capital of Popayan.

	SAN ISIDRO BASE, Dominican Republic (AP) -- A U.S.-built

<P>
	A witness told authorities that the plane's engine cut out and  
it hit the ground nose first. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine Beechcraft T34-B, a turbo-prop the Dominicans  
use to train pilots, crashed through a fence dividing the airfield 
at San Isidro base from the village of Ciudad Satelite II, just 
east of Santo Domingo.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez is defying an  
electoral council order not to campaign for candidates running for 
a constitutional assembly, saying Friday the council ``will not 
succeed in muzzling me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the National Electoral Council and the Supreme Court have  
declared that Venezuelan law prohibits the president from promoting 
specific candidates in July 25 elections for an assembly that will 
rewrite the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the council is expected to issue a formal  
communique admonishing Chavez for violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the National Electoral council keep scolding me. No one  
can ban me from saying who my candidates are,'' Chavez said during 
a speech Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The constituent assembly is the centerpiece of Chavez's  
governing agenda. He says it's needed to overhaul a corrupt 
political culture, but his critics think he'll use it to usurp 
power for himself.

Panama by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Two Former WSU Players Face Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- Two former starters on the Weber State  
basketball team pleaded innocent Friday to charges of sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Damien Baskerville, 21, is charged with aggravated sexual abuse,  
a second-degree felony, and aggravated sexual assault, a 
first-degree felony. Noel Jackson, 23, was charged with rape, a 
first-degree felony, and forcible sexual abuse, a second-degree 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of the first-degree felony they could face life in  
prison. A second-degree conviction could result in 15 years in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Robert V. Phillips convinced 2nd District Judge  
W. Brent West to reduce bail from $20,000 to $10,000, arguing that 
the men had known about the possibility of charges being filed for 
two months and had not fled. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary hearing was set for Tuesday before Judge Pamela  
Heffernan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Roy woman who had previously dated both men, told police that  
on April 11 she met Baskerville and Jackson at a night club. The 
woman drove to an apartment of one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Danielle Croyle said sometime between 4 a.m. and 5  
a.m., Jackson held the woman down as Baskerville raped her. The 
woman's leg was bruised as Jackson held her down, according to 
Croyle's probable cause statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement says that Jackson admitted to restraining the  
woman, who went to police April 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Baskerville, a three-year starter, was a first team All-Big Sky  
selection in his sophomore and junior seasons. He was the 
conference's leading scorer, averaging 18.5 points his sophomore 
year, then a knee injury forced him to miss the final eight games 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season was Jackson's first as a starter for WSU. He  
averaged 11 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.5 assists.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Hard To Find in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- One day soon, Belgians will each get a  
free ``ice-cold Coca-Cola'' to help overcome fears caused by the 
recent health scare, Coke chairman M. Douglas Ivester promised 
Friday. But just try buying one with cold cash this hot summer 
weekend -- it won't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola may have won the go-ahead to resume production, two  
weeks after people began reporting they had fallen ill after 
drinking Coke products. But starting production from scratch is 
proving no easy matter. 
</P>
<P>
	That wiped the smile off Bouchra Bouaissa's face. Instead of  
finally finding deliverance, the 19-year-old was staring at empty 
shelves again at the GB supermarket Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They promised to bring it back,'' she sighed, her hopes dashed  
that she could go back to her Coke bottle-a-day regimen. ``I really 
miss it. It's been too long,'' she said, 16 days after Coca-Cola 
was forced to pull its products from store shelves nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants in Ghent and Antwerp were gearing up to resume production  
but had to meet new government-imposed requirements, including a 
thorough cleaning, a total change of all the raw materials and the 
introduction of stricter security measures at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has acknowledged that its plant in Antwerp used substandard  
carbon dioxide to put bubbles into bottled drinks and that a 
fungicide on wooden pallets at the Dunkirk, France, plant may have 
caused a foul smell on some cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Since June 9, the government reported 249 cases of illnesses in  
Belgium by people who drank Coca-Cola products. Ivester has said 
Coca-Cola would pay the medical bills of anyone who had fallen ill 
after drinking Coke products, although he denied the drinks posed 
any health risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium lifted the ban on Coke, Fanta and Sprite sales on  
Wednesday, maintaining it only in vending machines that might still 
contain old cans. France and Luxembourg followed suit since. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Coca-Cola's Dutch affiliate gave the green light for  
canned and bottled imports from Belgium to resume, as the 
Europe-wide crisis for the world's biggest soft drink producer 
continued to ease. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean that Coke is available. ``We are doing our  
utmost to produce,'' Coca-Cola Enterprises Belgium said in a 
statement, but warned shops that further information on the first 
deliveries might only come ``as of next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a contrite apology in all the major papers early in the  
week, Ivester again took out full page ads again Friday, promising 
Coke will soon start reappearing on the shelves. And he made a 
promise: 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to invite you to enjoy an ice-cold Coca-Cola  
again,'' said Ivester in ads printed in Dutch and French. ``We'd 
like to offer you a Coca-Cola ... at our expense. We'll let you 
know how this will work very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The headline read ``Thank you for your patience,'' though  
Belgian's 10 million consumers might have to remain patient for 
several more days if they want a Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't mean they have gone thirsty, however.  
</P>
<P>
	At GB, assistant Frederique Kempeneer was lugging pallets of  
cola and other soda around, but instead of Coke, the brands of 
Fiesta, Virgin, Kinder and Dr Pepper stood out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot put the other stuff fast enough on the shelves,'' a  
sweaty Kempeneer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for some, ``only Coca-Cola'' will do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for Coke, I want Coke,'' said Jose Elorrieta, 14,  
going through the racks with three of his friends. ``The day it 
comes back, we will all be relieved.''

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Surge Back into Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Both sides of Kosovo's ethnic divide  
ignored NATO pleas for restraint today as revenge attacks prompted 
more Serbs to flee the province and ethnic Albanian refugees 
flooded home in numbers that startled aid officials. 
</P>
<P>
	About 48,000 ethnic Albanians returned on Thursday alone, said

Refugees. That brought to more than 300,000 the number who have

	``This is one of the largest spontaneous returns that we have  
ever seen in the last 25 years of any operation,'' she said at a 
briefing in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs that today's wave of arrivals could be even  
larger, she said. Thursday's group was the largest to return on any 
day since NATO troops started arriving and Serbian troops began 
pulling out two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	About 860,000 ethnic Albanians were reported to have fled or  
been expelled from Kosovo since NATO launched a bombing campaign 
March 24. The bombing was intended to force Yugoslavia to accept a 
peace plan for the province and halt its expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials have tried in vain to persuade refugees to delay  
their returns until mines can be cleared and better arrangements 
for food and shelter organized. Many are coming home to little more 
than burned-out shells of houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The flood also is likely to complicate NATO's struggle to cope  
with outbreaks of lawlessness, especially where returning refugees 
come into contact with Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, government and religious officials complained that  
Albanian citizens are entering the province along with returning 
refugees, media reported 
</P>
<P>
	The daily Danas quoted Bishop Amfilohije, from the Serbian  
Orthodox Church, accusing peacekeepers of allowing Kosovo rebels to 
take control of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO's appeals, ethnic Albanians torched Serb houses in  
western Kosovo on Thursday and looted Serb-owned shops in Pristina. 
NATO issued a new plea for calm today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation in Kosovo will remain tense in the near future.  
You have to expect that,'' said Maj. Jan Joosten, a NATO spokesman. 
``The citizens of Kosovo must exercise restraint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panicky Serbs continued to flee Pec today, accusing ethnic  
Albanians of chasing them out of town. Italian NATO troops 
patrolled the city, looking for Serb stragglers who might need 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of about 300 Serbs who took shelter at the Serbian Orthodox  
monastery also were trying to leave, despite efforts of church 
leaders to persuade them to stay. The exodus left Pec, an important 
center of Serbian Orthodoxy, almost empty of Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 14 killings in Pristina on Thursday, NATO spokesmen  
said. There was no immediate breakdown on victims, but most 
incidents were connected to ethnic tensions, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russia's parliament gave final approval today for  
3,600 peacekeepers to join the NATO-led force in Kosovo. It was 
unclear when the Russian troops would arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	There currently are 200-300 at Pristina's airport, where they  
surprised NATO by driving in in a convoy and taking control hours 
before the alliance started moving its troops in June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Joosten said that as of early today, 21,000 of a planned 55,000  
NATO troops had deployed in Kosovo. Washington is sending 7,000 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, the State Department offered a $5 million reward  
for help in convicting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
others wanted for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Milosevic and four aides indicted for alleged  
crimes in Kosovo, the tribunal also has indicted former Bosnian 
Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. They were charged 
in connection with the 1995 massacre of 6,000 Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, for his part, was trying to retain government power.  
The Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade lifted a state of war imposed 
after NATO began bombing but was to take up new measures today to 
retain some wartime controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's autocratic rule has been shaken by the 78-day NATO  
bombing campaign and was forced to agree to withdraw his 40,000 or 
so troops from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	During the NATO aerial bombardment, refugees fleeing the  
province accused Serbs looting ethnic Albanian-owned homes and 
businesses. Now, ethnic Albanians are seeking revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, British soldiers swarmed around the commercial  
center late Thursday to curb looting. In the western Kosovo city of 
Pec, fires believed set by ethnic Albanians leveled Serb homes and 
much of the Gypsy quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavrilo Gojkovic, a Serb from Pec, said Kosovo Liberation Army  
rebels pushed him from his home with guns and a knife at his back. 
He said the KLA fighters told him, ``This is Kosovo. You have no 
place here now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reprisals persist despite appeals by NATO and Western  
governments to let peacekeepers and international investigators 
bring to justice those responsible for the earlier Serb crackdown. 
An estimated 50,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo since the end of the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to call on all Kosovo Albanians, and indeed on  
all the other people of Kosovo, not to allow ethnic hatred or the 
desire for revenge to cut their hearts,'' NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said during a visit to Pristina.

<P>
	He spoke Thursday after attending a meeting that included both  
Serb and ethnic Albanian representatives, including Hashim Thaci, 
political leader of the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana praised Thaci for signing an agreement with NATO calling  
for the KLA to demilitarize. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that Thaci and two of his  
lieutenants directed a campaign to thwart rivals within the KLA, 
ordering purges, arrests and the killing of as many as a half-dozen 
rebel commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the charges were made in interviews with  
about a dozen former and current KLA officials, two former Albanian 
officials and several Western diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the rebel officials interviewed said they saw Thaci or  
his aides execute anyone. However, they described incidents in 
which rivals were killed shortly after Thaci or an aide threatened 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a spokesman, Thaci denied responsibility for any  
killings.

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Surge Back into Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Both sides of Kosovo's ethnic divide  
ignored NATO pleas for restraint today as revenge attacks prompted 
more Serbs to flee the province and ethnic Albanian refugees 
flooded home in numbers that startled aid officials.

<HEADLINE>  Haskins To Leave Minn. Coaching Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins agreed Friday to a $1.5 million  
buyout of his contract with Minnesota, even though university 
investigators have found no evidence implicating the basketball 
coach in an academic fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof said it is ``extremely likely''  
that fraud did occur and said a change was necessary to restore 
confidence in the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that on his watch, substantial, numerous  
violations of our academic conduct code have occurred,'' Yudof said 
during a news conference. ``We thought it's time for a management 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins will step down June 30, three years before his contract  
was to expire. He compiled a 240-165 record in 13 seasons, 
including a trip to the NCAA tournament Final Four in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has been under pressure since March, when former tutor  
Jan Gangelhoff said she did more than 400 pieces of course work for 
at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March, the investigation has widened to include  
accusations of improper payments, travel irregularities and 
improper relationships between the team and university police 
investigating possible crimes involving players. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins asserted his innocence when the scandal broke on the eve  
of the Gophers' first-round NCAA game against Gonzaga. Four players 
were made ineligible for that game, which Minnesota lost. 
</P>
<P>
	He has maintained since then that he had no knowledge of  
wrongdoing. Phone calls to his suburban Minneapolis house Friday 
afternoon went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins issued a brief statement saying he had been honored to  
coach the Gophers and would continue to support them. The statement 
made no mention of the allegations or investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim reports from investigators make it ``extremely likely  
there will be numerous findings of academic fraud, primarily and 
entirely connected to the writing of papers for students,'' Yudof 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no evidence links Haskins to fraud, ``it is clear that  
public confidence in the academic integrity of the university has 
been eroded by the allegations. In order to restore that public 
confidence, a change in leadership is warranted,'' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university is expected to report on its investigation to the  
NCAA in September. Yudof said earlier this week that the university 
was likely to sanction itself if its investigation showed ``slam 
dunk'' wrongdoing. Enforcement records show the NCAA generally is 
less harsh on universities that deal decisively with rule-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof acknowledged that people, including Gangelhoff, say  
Haskins knew about academic cheating by players. But he said ``when 
it comes to direct, provable evidence today -- maybe not for all 
time, but for today -- that evidence does not exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a matter of decency and fairness, Yudof said, he felt the  
university should honor Haskins' contract. The buyout will be paid 
for with money from the men's athletics department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Haskins established an ``enviable record'' as coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has communicated to his players the goals of playing hard,  
working hard to achieve career goals, respecting others -- including 
opponents -- and becoming honorable men,'' Yudof said. ``The 
university is grateful for the 13 years of service coach Haskins 
has provided, and we wish him a future of success and good 
health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' fate apparently was decided this week after two  
critical meetings within 24 hours at his home. He met Tuesday for 
three hours with independent investigators Michael Glazier and 
Donald Lewis. On Wednesday, Haskins and his lawyer, Ron Zamansky, 
met with Yudof and university counsel Mark Rotenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction from Haskins' peers was sorrow.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today I feel that the Big Ten has lost a very good coach and a  
friend,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ``I wish him nothing 
but the best in his future plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Dutcher, who resigned as Minnesota coach in 1986 after three  
of his players were arrested on suspicion of rape, said he knows 
how hard it is to leave a program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never take joy in anyone else's misery and I know Clem is  
a very proud guy and I know he took pride in his program so I know 
this hurts him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Lord, a lawyer for several people who have alleged  
wrongdoing in Minnesota athletics, called the buyout ``bad public 
policy'' without considering a challenge to Haskins' contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He orchestrated the scandal and in return they stuffed his  
pocket so full of money he has to waddle out of Williams Arena,'' 
Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. John Marty also said he was disappointed at the  
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's innocent of wrongdoing don't get rid of them,  
period,'' Marty said. ``But if they did something wrong, paying a 
million and a half bucks to push him out of the way is really 
unfortunate. It sends a bad signal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins had three years left on a 10-year contract he signed in  
1994, retroactive to the 1992-93 season, that contained provisions 
that several legal experts have described as rare for college 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract ensured Haskins about $423,000 even if the  
university could prove a just-cause firing, and the terms would 
have made that process difficult and slow. If Haskins were 
terminated without cause, the contract entitled him to about $1.3 
million plus several hundred thousand dollars in benefits.

<HEADLINE> Biography Debunks Molly Brown Myth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Molly Brown survived more than the sinking of the  
Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Hollywood got its hands on her legend, writers began  
embellishing her story. 
</P>
<P>
	One account stated she was born during a tornado that destroyed  
much of Hannibal, Mo. Another claimed Ms. Brown headed West after 
waiting on Mark Twain in a diner. A third contended she pulled a 
gun to make men row a lifeboat away from the sinking Titanic in 
1912. 
</P>
<P>
	None was true.  
</P>
<P>
	But ``her real story is even better,'' said Kristen Iversen,  
author of a new biography of the legendary Leadville, Colo. woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Iversen's book, ``Molly Brown: Unraveling the Myth,''  
contends Ms. Brown should be credited with helping launch feminism 
and getting women the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brown ``was once treated as a comic opera character who  
epitomized the nouveau riche uppity Irish Catholics,'' said Tom 
Noel, a Colorado historian. ``Now we are looking at her as a role 
model for immigrant women today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born July 18, 1867, in Hannibal, Ms. Brown was fluent in French,  
German and Russian, and won the French Legion of Honor for her work 
with blind veterans of World War I. The Academy of France gave her 
an award for her performances of the works of Sarah Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	She ran for the U.S. Senate eight years before women won the  
right to vote, and joined striking miners while her husband, J.J., 
hobnobbed with mine bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	With Judge Benjamin Barr Lindsay, Ms. Brown helped reform  
Colorado courts to protect juveniles, creating a system that became 
a model for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than an upstart rejected by Denver society, as legend  
describes her, Ms. Brown ``was Denver society,'' Ms. Iversen said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said writers of Brown's time didn't know how to depict such  
a maverick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women were shuffled into categories,'' she said. ``They were  
sun-bonneted help-mates, prairie angels, or they were Calamity 
Jane, the gun-toting gal with a heart of gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Iversen's book was compiled with cooperation from Ms.  
Brown's descendants, who had become upset over phony stories 50 
years ago and declined to talk with writers. 
</P>
<P>
	They cooperated with her after learning of a documentary on Ms.  
Brown that Ms. Iversen helped produce -- work she started more than 
six years before the hit movie ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Ms. Brown flourished after the blockbuster. Visits  
to the Molly Brown House in Denver were up last year from an 
average of 40,000 to 76,000, and her childhood home in Hannibal is 
now a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Ms. Iversen said Hollywood is showing an interest in  
telling Ms. Brown's true story. 
</P>
<P>
	That's ``Margaret Tobin Brown,'' she said. ``Nobody ever called  
her Molly while she was alive.''

<HEADLINE> Priest Found Dead Near Church Altar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- A priest was found slain under a pile of a  
robes near the altar Friday as parishioners waited for morning Mass 
to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	A man found a short time later in the rectory of St. Matthew  
Church was charged with murder in the death of Rev. Robert J. Lysz, 
50. Michael Ouellette, 32, was carrying Lysz's credit cards, said 
Police Chief John DiVenere. 
</P>
<P>
	He was being held on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to be  
arraigned on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lysz had called police Thursday to report a suspicious person on  
the church property. Police said the incident was related to the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was found shortly after the 7:30 a.m. Mass was  
scheduled to begin at the Roman Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchgoers said they didn't pay much attention to the heap at  
first because construction materials had recently been left around 
the church because of renovation work. Then they noticed blood 
spatters on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom McNamara, a parishioner, said he pulled the robes away to  
find Lysz. He said the discovery felt like ``getting a punch in the 
stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of parishioners, bleary-eyed and crying, flocked to the  
church all day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always remembered you as an individual and what you spoke  
to him about, as if you were the only person in his life,'' said 
Jesse Corciullo, a parishioner. ``His love for this community was 
unsurpassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lysz, a native of New Castle, Pa., was ordained in May 1975. He  
came to St. Matthew -- a large, modern brick church in a quiet, 
residential neighborhood -- in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Vets: The Pets Next Door </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Oblivious to the television cameras, Dr. Robert  
Taylor slices into Alger's bulging yellow belly, attempting to 
excise a bloodied mass entangled in her organs. 
</P>
<P>
	With an anesthesiologist and technicians in medical scrubs  
filling the cramped operating room, Taylor leans over the length of 
her body, probing the growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, he concludes it is entwined too deeply to remove and  
decides to euthanize Alger, a 24-year-old exotic zoo bull snake. 
Out of respect for ``one of God's creatures,'' Taylor sews her 
lifeless body shut. 
</P>
<P>
	The real life drama of Alger's final medical battle appeared on  
``Emergency Vets,'' a half-hour series on the cable channel Animal 
Planet. It airs Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT, and Monday through Friday at 
10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmed at the 24-hour Alameda East Veterinary Hospital, the show  
chronicles veterinarians dealing with medical traumas suffered by 
all sorts of animals -- dogs with bee stings, reptiles that cannot 
lay eggs, snakes with sniffles, cats hit by cars; surgeries for 
gunshot wounds, multiple-birth deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Without scripts or staging, the vets treat three animals in each  
segment, beginning with an explanation of the problem, then the 
treatment and ending with the outcome -- whether it is sad or happy. 
Often, the owners are on hand to watch, answer questions or share 
their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see whatever the streets of Denver can spit up at us,''  
said Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, a board-certified general practitioner 
who is one of the show's fan-certified celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not stars. After the cameras are gone, we're still going  
to be here,'' he said. ``The story is the animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Producers believe the stories make for good television, and say  
they have the ratings and fan mail to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Schaeffer Weiser, an executive producer, said ``Emergency  
Vets'' is the second highest-rated show on the channel Animal 
Planet behind ``The Crocodile Hunter.'' It is available in more 
than 42 million homes nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The program also has earned critical acclaim with several awards  
and honors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell wonderful stories of compelling human drama, and in  
the course of that we teach about veterinary medicine,'' Weiser 
said. ``What you see is real. That's what makes it different from 
`ER' on NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But like the actors on ``ER,'' these real-life veterinarians  
have star-struck fans who stop them on the street and in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Holly Knor, another of the hospital's vets, said the show  
has helped some of her clients identify illness or injury with 
their pets and respond accordingly. It also offers viewers a 
glimpse of the wide array of specialty services available at large 
vet hospitals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's done a great service for veterinary medicine as far as  
educating the public,'' Knor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though public response to the show has been heartening, Knor  
said it is particularly satisfying when other professionals in 
veterinary medicine tell her that they are fans of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Opened in 1971 by Taylor and Dr. Nolan Rucker, the hospital is  
tucked into a busy street in east Denver. It has a staff of about 
35 veterinary specialists, including surgeons, a radiologist, a 
neurologist and a physical therapist. It is designed like a human 
hospital with a room for triage room, a lab, an X-ray room and 
operating rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Since ``Animal Vets'' began airing in May 1996, Taylor said they  
have received requests for vet care from pet owners all over the 
world. The staff usually tries to make referrals to those clients, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Taylor and most of his colleagues enjoy the show, few  
of them watch it on a regular basis. ``Generally, by the time I get 
home at night, I eat my dinner and go to bed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	Elsewhere in television ...

	`THORN BIRDS': Richard Chamberlain reprises his starring role as  
the charismatic priest Ralph de Bricassart, and Amanda Donohoe 
stars as Meggie O'Neill in the four-hour miniseries, ``The Thorn 
Birds: The Missing Years,'' to be rebroadcast Sunday and next 
Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS. The film fills in a critical period 
in the tempestuous chronology dramatized in ``The Thorn Birds,'' 
the saga of forbidden love that originally aired in 1983. That 
miniseries followed the fortunes of the Cleary family between 1920 
and 1962, but omitted a critical middle period, which is chronicled 
in the second miniseries. Olivia Burnette, Simon Westaway, Julia 
Blake, Zach English and Maximilian Schell also star.

<HEADLINE> Top VMI Cadet Said Sacked for Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Military Institute's top cadet  
was dismissed last month for allegedly demanding sex from three 
freshmen women, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	VMI officials told the newspaper that Jerry Webb II, recently  
chosen as the regimental commander of the Corps of Cadets for the 
coming year, was expelled for conduct unbecoming a cadet. Sources 
the newspaper did not identify said the misconduct involved demands 
for sex from the three women. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acted as we normally do, as quickly as we could under  
normal disciplinary procedures,'' VMI spokesman Mike Strickler said 
Friday. ``We handled everything properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickler said the women involved are expected to return to the  
state-support military school in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper was unable to reach Webb for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The formerly all-male school was forced to admit women when the  
U.S. Supreme Court found its admission policy unconstitutional 
three years ago. The school remains under the supervision of a 
federal judge to ensure that female cadets are treated fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the sake of all cadets, male and female, it deserves an  
investigation and some close attention,'' said Anita Blair, a 
member of the school's board of visitors. ``I don't think we can 
sit back and say, 'He's gone, and that's the end of the problem.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The regimental commander is expected to exemplify VMI's  
military, physical and academic standards. The regimental commander 
and staff oversee the military training and discipline with the 
cadet corps.

<HEADLINE> GOP Captures 25th Win Vs. Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOWIE, Md. (AP) -- The GOP scored eight unearned runs in the top  
of the first inning and went on to cruise to a 17-1 blowout over 
Democrats in the annual baseball game among members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican pitcher Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma struck out  
eight batters Thursday night for his fourth win and the 25th GOP 
victory in the 38 years of partisan play. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first inning shows how important defense is,'' said Rep.  
Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	With bases loaded and two outs, Hulshof and Largent crossed home  
plate to start the scoring on an error by Minnesota Democratic Rep. 
Martin Olav Sabo, who says he was blinded by the setting sun at 
Prince George's Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The only home run of the night was a solo by Tennessee  
Republican Rep. Zach Wamp that netted $25,000 for prostate cancer 
research. Wamp also hit a double and drove in three runs for the 
GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight win for the Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' star was New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, who scored  
the team's only run, twice slid headfirst into base and stole a 
base. Pitcher Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., struck out only one 
Republican. His team lost to Largent's last year, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored annually by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, the  
charity game netted an estimated $100,000 for the Washington 
Literacy Council, the Metropolitan Police Boys and Girls Club and 
the Bowie Health Center Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made an appearance, the first  
time in 10 years the sport's top official has come to the game.

<HEADLINE> Agendas: Clinton vs. GOP Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A comparison of the legislative agendas of President Clinton and  
congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	--Increase spending for schools.  
</P>
<P>
	--Overhaul Social Security, though he has unveiled no specific  
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Revamp Medicare and create a new prescription drug benefit,  
which he is expected to unveil next week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut taxes focused on specific needs, such as helping people  
afford child care and long-term health care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enact modest gun control measures.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the minimum wage.  
</P>
<P>
	--Expand rights for patients of managed care organizations,  
including allowing people to sue insurers who deny certain care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Retool campaign finance laws.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increase some defense spending.  
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans:  
</P>
<P>
	--Give local education officials more discretion in how to use  
federal aid; provide tax breaks on special savings accounts that 
people can use for education expenses, including private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Revamp Social Security. They have produced no definitive plan,  
but many Republicans favor letting Americans invest some of their 
benefits privately. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut taxes, deeper and broader than Clinton would. Legislation  
expected next month may put more people in the lowest 15 percent 
income-tax bracket; reduce taxes for the many married couples who 
would owe less if they were single; and reduce or eliminate the tax 
paid on large inheritances. 
</P>
<P>
	--Support a minimum wage increase if only to prevent Democrats  
from using it as a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enact a package of patients' rights expanding access and  
affordability, but covering fewer people than Democrats, excluding 
the right to sue and letting insurers retain power to decide what 
care is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	--Oppose campaign finance law overhaul.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increase defense spending more than Clinton would, press for  
deployment of an anti-missile defense system.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Serbs To Dump Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a marathon news conference, President  
Clinton said Friday the people of Serbia ``have to get out of 
denial'' about the atrocities blamed on Slobodan Milosevic and 
decide if he's fit to remain president of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	About his own critics at home -- ``particularly the right wing''  
-- the president said he cannot allow them to distract him from the 
nation's business. He said he tells his staff: ``We have no right 
to harbor anger'' that would interfere with the obligation to serve 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days before unveiling a Medicare prescription drug benefit,  
Clinton said he is open to the controversial idea of a 
means-testing requirement that links premium costs to 
beneficiaries' incomes for doctor visits and services. 
</P>
<P>
	As for concerns about the billions of dollars his prescription  
benefit will cost, Clinton said, ``It won't -- and can't -- break the 
bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, confronting rising Republican clamor for a tax  
cut, also declared, ``I'm not against tax cuts.'' But he said that 
Washington should first fix the financial stability of the Medicare 
and Social Security systems. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Clinton answered 27 questions over 75 minutes in a  
theater-style auditorium of the Old Executive Office Building, 
across from the White House. He cracked jokes and laughed at times, 
but thumped the podium and wagged his finger at other moments. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ``shattering effect'' of the high school shooting at  
Littleton, Colo., troubled Americans more than the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal and impeachment ordeal ever did. ``I think people are 
worried when they see ... the fabric of life still under great 
strain, in spite of the fact that we have quite a lot amount of 
prosperity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When a questioner asked about the $5 million U.S. reward offered  
for the arrest of Milosevic and colleagues for alleged war crimes, 
Clinton locked his gaze and said, ``We have not put a price on Mr. 
Milosevic's head for someone to kill him. ... So let's get that 
clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he has rigorously adhered to a policy adopted  
during Gerald Ford's presidency banning the assassination of 
political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The president vowed that Belgrade would get no U.S. money -- ``I  
wouldn't give them one red cent for reconstruction'' -- if Serbs 
endorse Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo to expel hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians. After 78 days of NATO bombing, 
Milosevic abandoned that effort, and refugees who fled or were 
expelled are returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as if to foment a political uprising against Milosevic,  
Clinton said the people of Serbia are ``going to have to come to 
grips with what Mr. Milosevic ordered in Kosovo. They're just going 
to have to come to grips with it. And ... they're going to have to 
get out of denial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And then, they're going to have to decide whether they support  
his leadership or not, whether they think it's OK that all those 
tens of thousands of people were killed. And all those hundreds of 
thousands of people were run out of their homes and all those 
little girls were raped and all those little boys were murdered,'' 
Clinton said icily. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have to decide if they think that is OK,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton deplored attacks on Serbs in Kosovo by  
returning refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is not letting it happen,'' he declared. ``We're doing  
what we can to stop it and I'm concerned about it. I'm not 
particularly surprised, after what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the problem would ease as NATO forces disperse  
throughout Kosovo and are able to provide protection to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton opened his news conference by challenging what he  
characterized as a do-nothing Congress to approve his proposals for 
Medicare, Social Security, gun control, education, child care and 
campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, cut taxes and safeguard the Social 
Security surplus for improving that program. ``I ask the president, 
please include tax relief in your agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., joined by dozens of rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, turning to politics, said he intends to assert his  
voice into the nation's political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to be working right up to the end,'' he said. Yet, he  
acknowledged the reality that he is a lame-duck president. ``The 
closer you get to the election,'' he said, ``the more difficult it 
will be to pass anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He twice praised Hillary Rodham Clinton for her efforts on  
domestic policy, a nod to her all-but-official campaign for the 
Senate. And he defended her against criticism for using 
taxpayer-provided planes for political trips to New York, saying 
the first lady takes the issue ``seriously'' but the Secret Service 
dictates much of her travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Lewinsky scandal will not hurt his wife's political  
ambitions or the presidential campaign of his vice president, Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``All elections are about the future and all candidates are  
judged on their own merits,'' he said. ``I think that the American 
people know the country is in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other matters, the president:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said Washington will have to approve emergency aid again this  
year to help farmers cope with drought and plunging prices. ``It's 
a crisis. We have to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Belittled critics, ``particularly the right wing. You know I've  
been accused of murder and all kinds of things,'' he said. Despite 
the bitter impeachment fight, Clinton said he would work with any 
member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said it's uncertain whether the Kosovo conflict would boost his  
standing in the polls; so far, it hasn't. ``I did what I thought 
was right. I still believe it was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he was surprised ``we lost only two planes and no pilots''  
in the bombing campaign. The biggest surprise was the accidental 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. ``I had no earthly idea 
that our system would permit that kind of mistake,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Returns to Domestic Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Content with the peace in Kosovo, President  
Clinton turned his focus homeward today ``with a renewed energy for 
the domestic agenda.'' He challenged what he cast as a do-nothing 
Republican Congress to approve his ideas on Medicaid, Medicare, 
Social Security, education, child care and campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should pass it and I will sign it,'' was the  
president's refrain as he ticked down the same list of initiatives 
he outlined five months ago in his State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebutting those who would call him a lame-duck president in the  
final 18 months of his term, Clinton laid that label on his 
Republican opponents in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``really believe that because the presidential election  
season has already started, the battle for Congress has already 
started ... that the best politics is to just run out the clock and 
wait for the next election and hope that the country is doing so 
well and we enjoy the lazy days of summer so much nobody will 
notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't agree with that,'' Clinton told a student audience at  
his alma mater, Georgetown University. This summer, he added, 
should be a ``season of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, safeguard the Social Security surplus 
for improving that program and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. at an appearance 
where he was joined by dozens of rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let Washington spend the surplus. We need fairness in  
our tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to craft a tax  
cut next month, and likely will include provisions to repeal to 
so-called ``marriage penalty,'' eliminate the estate tax and 
possibly cut the capital-gains tax. In addition, there has been 
talk of making more income taxable at the rate of 15 percent, 
rather than 28 percent, a step that would cut taxes for millions of 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of all of his proposals that have languished on Capitol Hill  
because of what he called ``small-time wrangling,'' the president 
singled out guaranteed Medicaid coverage for disabled people who 
find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's start with that one, an easy one,'' Clinton said.  
``Congress should pass it and I will sign it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also renewed calls for an increase in the minimum wage,  
tighter gun controls, Medicare reforms including prescription drug 
coverage, tax credits for families in need of long-term care and 
child care, and the ``patients bill of rights'' for HMO members. 
</P>
<P>

hold his first news conference since March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back to Washington after my trip to Europe with a  
renewed energy for the domestic agenda,'' Clinton said. ``With our 
present prosperity, we actually have a rare opportunity to meet the 
remaining large challenges facing our country on the brink of a new 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who struggled for more than a year to be heard above  
the din of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, is trying to reassert his 
voice in America's political debate after the 11-week Kosovo 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	With the approach of the 2000 presidential race and lingering  
bitterness from the impeachment battle, the Republican-led Congress 
has received the president's proposals coolly. Even so, White House 
officials believe Clinton's poll-tested agenda could give Democrats 
political ammunition for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said it was Clinton who ``set the tone and path to 
partisanship'' on entitlement reform when he rejected earlier this 
year the recommendations of a bipartisan commission on Medicare's 
problems. ``The president rejected that report and chose to pursue 
a partisan course. That was one opportunity dashed,'' the GOP 
spokesman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Clinton next week would unveil an  
alternative Medicare proposal that would include prescription drug 
benefits for the elderly -- a proposal that could cost billions of 
dollars. Most recipients would have to pay a monthly premium to 
help cover the costs, although the White House said the poorest 
people would not have to pay the full premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats repeatedly have turned in election years to Medicare  
as an issue with which to flog Republicans. Eager to avoid more 
harm, the GOP is looking for its own plan, likely to be less costly 
than Clinton's. Lott has asked the Senate Finance Committee to 
consider a bipartisan proposal rejected by Clinton that would 
provide subsidized drug benefits only for those living near the 
poverty level.

travel to raise his profile. He will appear in New York and

America, stopping in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota,

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Returns to Domestic Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Content with the peace in Kosovo, President  
Clinton turned his focus homeward today ``with a renewed energy for 
the domestic agenda.'' He challenged what he cast as a do-nothing 
Republican Congress to approve his ideas on Medicaid, Medicare, 
Social Security, education, child care and campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should pass it and I will sign it,'' was the  
president's refrain as he ticked down the same list of initiatives 
he outlined five months ago in his State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebutting those who would call him a lame-duck president in the  
final 18 months of his term, Clinton laid that label on his 
Republican opponents in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``really believe that because the presidential election  
season has already started, the battle for Congress has already 
started ... that the best politics is to just run out the clock and 
wait for the next election and hope that the country is doing so 
well and we enjoy the lazy days of summer so much nobody will 
notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't agree with that,'' Clinton told a student audience at  
his alma mater, Georgetown University. This summer, he added, 
should be a ``season of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, safeguard the Social Security surplus 
for improving that program and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. at an appearance 
where he was joined by dozens of rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let Washington spend the surplus. We need fairness in  
our tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to craft a tax  
cut next month, and likely will include provisions to repeal to 
so-called ``marriage penalty,'' eliminate the estate tax and 
possibly cut the capital-gains tax. In addition, there has been 
talk of making more income taxable at the rate of 15 percent, 
rather than 28 percent, a step that would cut taxes for millions of 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of all of his proposals that have languished on Capitol Hill  
because of what he called ``small-time wrangling,'' the president 
singled out guaranteed Medicaid coverage for disabled people who 
find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's start with that one, an easy one,'' Clinton said.  
``Congress should pass it and I will sign it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also renewed calls for an increase in the minimum wage,  
tighter gun controls, Medicare reforms including prescription drug 
coverage, tax credits for families in need of long-term care and 
child care, and the ``patients bill of rights'' for HMO members. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who returned this week from a trip to Europe that  
included a victory tour of the Balkans, also planned later today to 
hold his first news conference since March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back to Washington after my trip to Europe with a

<HEADLINE> Authorities Had Suspected Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The man wanted in connection with eight slayings  
committed near railroad tracks was in the custody of immigration 
officials earlier this month but was let go, federal authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez in the El Paso area during the week of June 1 for 
being in this country illegally and deported him to Mexico later 
that day, the FBI said. INS officials said they were unaware he was 
wanted for questioning in four killings at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to discuss whether it was a mechanical error or  
an error at all,'' said Don K. Clark, special agent in charge of 
the Houston FBI office and head of a task force pursuing him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a blow to our investigation. Clearly we  
would like to have him right this minute. We would have liked to 
have him some time ago, but what it does do is give us the most 
current photograph we can get out to the public in hopes somebody 
may have seen this person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The INS took a photo of Resendez-Ramirez, a master of disguise,  
on June 2 that shows him with a mustache and without glasses, said 
agency spokesman Russ Bergeron. In earlier photos he has had 
glasses and other facial hair. He's also been photographed clean 
shaven. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the eight slayings linked to Resendez-Ramirez have  
occurred since he was taken into custody and released soon 
thereafter. Two were in Texas and two were in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force of more than 200 investigators has been  
fielding hundreds of tips since Resendez-Ramirez, believed to be 
38, went on the agency's 10 Most Wanted list Monday. A $125,000 
reward is posted for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been charged with the two slayings in Illinois and is  
suspected of a 1997 Kentucky killing and five since last fall in 
Texas. A common thread is that the crimes occurred in homes near 
railroad tracks; authorities believe he traverses the country 
aboard freight trains. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a history of slipping into the United States illegally  
since 1976, has served state prison time in New Mexico and Florida 
and had been deported at least four times. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark refused to blame the INS for releasing Resendez-Ramirez  
but acknowledged some frustration when learning the man had been 
picked up and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ramirez has not slipped through our fingers. This is  
another piece of lead information for us. We're acting on it as 
soon as we got it, and we've just gotten the photograph 
yesterday.''

<HEADLINE> Webb's LPGA Streak Is Halted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Karrie Webb knew her record streak of 16  
consecutive finishes in the top 10 would not last forever. She just 
never imagined it ending like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, a five-time winner this year who hasn't finished worse  
than eighth all year, had another 1-over 72 on Friday in the LPGA 
Championship and missed the cut for the first time in 33 events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make the cut today and give myself a chance  
to have a decent weekend,'' Webb said. ``To go 16 straight in the 
top 10 and then miss the cut is a little more disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Webb missed the cut since the Standard  
Register Ping in March 1998, and only the third time she has failed 
to make it beyond the first two rounds in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more impressive was her streak of top 10s. Since the LPGA  
Tour began keeping such records in 1970, the longest streak had 
been 14 in a row by Pat Bradley in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb always seemed to find a way to keep it going. She opened  
with a 72 in the 54-hole Sara Lee Classic, but closed with rounds 
of 66 and 65 to tie for sixth. Two weeks ago, she was in danger of 
missing the cut after an opening 75, but wound up winning for the 
14th time in a career of not yet four years. 
</P>
<P>
	That the streak would end in a major -- winning a major is about  
the only thing the 24-year-old Australian has yet to accomplish -- 
was not terribly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb has never felt comfortable on the DuPont Country Club  
course. She has twice finished in the top 10 in the LPGA 
Championship, but only because of a sterling weekend -- 67 and 66 
last year to tie for fourth, even though she never seriously 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really played well here before,'' she said. ``With  
better conditions, with it not being as wet, this was going to be a 
true test to see if I liked the course. But it's really not the 
course's fault. I just don't feel comfortable on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb took a double bogey on No. 7 in the first round, and made  
another double bogey on the par-3 17th when she hit into the bunker 
and then three-putted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hitting it pretty good on the range, but my alignment  
hasn't been that good,'' she said. ``I get on the course, and I 
don't know where I'm aiming. That threw off my timing. On the front 
nine, I just hit it everywhere. Then I get scared that I'm going to 
miss the cut and grind even harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb actually thought she was in at 2-over 144. She made a  
birdie on No. 8 -- her 17th hole Friday -- and decided to play the 
par-5 ninth conservatively in order to avoid a big number waiting 
in the creek running down the right side of the dogleg. 
</P>
<P>
	She still had a 10-foot birdie putt, but missed it. And also  
missed the cut.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Unfazed by Kosovo Revenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he's not  
surprised that ethnic Albanians are engaging in revenge attacks on 
Serbs ``after what they've been through,'' but he said NATO is 
doing its best to stop the violence as refugees return home. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference that lasted more than an hour, Clinton  
brushed off questions about what history will say about him. ``I'll 
be remembered when I'm gone. Right now I'm not gone,'' said the 
second U.S. president to be impeached. ``I've got lots to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He fielded questions ranging from agriculture policy to race  
relations in the United States and violence in Northern Ireland in 
his first full-blown meeting with reporters since March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his attempts to turn from the war in Kosovo to battles  
in Congress, he couldn't avoid questions about the struggle to 
bring peace between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is not letting it happen,'' the president said of  
retribution against Serbs. ``We're doing what we can to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO's appeals, ethnic Albanians torched Serb houses in  
western Kosovo Thursday and looted Serb-owned shops in the capital 
of Pristina. Tens of thousands of returning refugees are pouring 
into Kosovo, overwhelming aid workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lawlessness, Clinton said, ``I'm concerned about  
it. I'm not particularly surprised after what they've been 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it will not be easy for ethnic Albanians and Serbs to  
get along. ``I don't think they can do it without a lot of help in 
the short run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the news conference and a speech at Georgetown University in  
Washington, Clinton challenged what he cast as a do-nothing 
Republican Congress to approve his proposals for Medicare, 
Medicaid, gun control, Social Security, education, child care and 
campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 2000 presidential campaign well under way, Clinton  
wants to stave off suggestions that he is a lame-duck president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to be working right up to the very end,'' he said.  
Yet he acknowledged: ``The closer you get to the election the more 
difficult it will be to pass anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He twice praised Hillary Rodham Clinton for her efforts on  
domestic policy, a nod to her all-but-official campaign for the 
Senate. And he defended her against criticism for using 
taxpayer-provided planes for political trips to New York, saying 
the first lady takes the issue ``seriously'' but the Secret Service 
dictates much of her travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Monica Lewinsky scandal will not hurt his wife's  
political ambitions or the presidential campaign of his vice 
president, Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``All elections are about the future and all candidates are  
judged on their own merits,'' he said. ``I think that the American 
people know the country is in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, safeguard the Social Security surplus 
for improving that program and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., joined by dozens of 
rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to craft a tax  
cut next month, and likely will include provisions to repeal to 
so-called marriage penalty, eliminate the estate tax and possibly 
cut the capital-gains tax. In addition, there has been talk of 
making more income taxable at the rate of 15 percent, rather than 
28 percent, a step that would cut taxes for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Responded Clinton: ``I'm not against tax cuts.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, what kind of tax cuts? Who benefits from it?  
How should it be designed? And how should it be handled to make 
sure we take care of'' Social Security and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	His toughest comments were reserved for Republicans on gun  
control. ``We can't expect young people to stand up to violence 
when Congress won't stand up to the gun lobby.'' Calling it a moral 
issues, Clinton promised to veto any weak gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said opposition to closing loopholes on gun show sales  
because background checks would be inconvenient is wrongheaded. 
``When people see inconvenience elevated over the lives of the 
child, I think that causes them problems,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised that his long-delayed report on race would be  
published soon, saying it was delayed because he has been 
preoccupied by Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do this right,'' Clinton said. ``It's got to be,  
first of all, mine. It's got to reflect what I believe and where I 
think we need to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed his case for extending prescription drug coverage to  
elderly Americans, even though expanding Medicare would be ``a lot 
more expensive than rosy scenarios suggest.'' He promised a 
specific proposal next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any alternative here,'' he said, calling  
prescription drug coverage ``the most significant health care need 
that senior citizens have today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would press for campaign finance changes, raising the  
``discomfort level'' on critics blocking reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered a strong vote of confidence to Energy Secretary  
Bill Richardson, despite a congressional finding that security has 
been lax at the nation's nuclear labs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged that his ``choice of wording was poor''  
when he addressed questions of Chinese espionage in the past and 
denied suspicion of security breaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been suspicious all along, generally,'' he said today.  
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, Clinton said he was surprised and heartbroken that  
NATO forces bombed the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had not early idea that our system would permit that kind of  
mistake,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Serbs To Dump Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a marathon news conference, President  
Clinton said Friday the people of Serbia ``have to get out of 
denial'' about the atrocities blamed on Slobodan Milosevic and 
decide if he's fit to remain president of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	About his own critics at home -- ``particularly the right wing''  
-- the president said he cannot allow them to distract him from the 
nation's business. He said he tells his staff: ``We have no right 
to harbor anger'' that would interfere with the obligation to serve 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days before unveiling a Medicare prescription drug benefit,  
Clinton said he is open to the controversial idea of a 
means-testing requirement that links premium costs to 
beneficiaries' incomes for doctor visits and services. 
</P>
<P>
	As for concerns about the billions of dollars his prescription  
benefit will cost, Clinton said, ``It won't -- and can't -- break the 
bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, confronting rising Republican clamor for a tax  
cut, also declared, ``I'm not against tax cuts.'' But he said that 
Washington should first fix the financial stability of the Medicare 
and Social Security systems. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Clinton answered 27 questions over 75 minutes in a  
theater-style auditorium of the Old Executive Office Building, 
across from the White House. He cracked jokes and laughed at times, 
but thumped the podium and wagged his finger at other moments. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ``shattering effect'' of the high school shooting at  
Littleton, Colo., troubled Americans more than the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal and impeachment ordeal ever did. ``I think people are 
worried when they see ... the fabric of life still under great 
strain, in spite of the fact that we have quite a lot amount of 
prosperity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When a questioner asked about the $5 million U.S. reward offered  
for the arrest of Milosevic and colleagues for alleged war crimes, 
Clinton locked his gaze and said, ``We have not put a price on Mr. 
Milosevic's head for someone to kill him. ... So let's get that 
clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he has rigorously adhered to a policy adopted  
during Gerald Ford's presidency banning the assassination of 
political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The president vowed that Belgrade would get no U.S. money -- ``I  
wouldn't give them one red cent for reconstruction'' -- if Serbs 
endorse Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo to expel hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians. After 78 days of NATO bombing, 
Milosevic abandoned that effort, and refugees who fled or were 
expelled are returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as if to foment a political uprising against Milosevic,  
Clinton said the people of Serbia are ``going to have to come to 
grips with what Mr. Milosevic ordered in Kosovo. They're just going 
to have to come to grips with it. And ... they're going to have to 
get out of denial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And then, they're going to have to decide whether they support  
his leadership or not, whether they think it's OK that all those 
tens of thousands of people were killed. And all those hundreds of 
thousands of people were run out of their homes and all those 
little girls were raped and all those little boys were murdered,'' 
Clinton said icily. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have to decide if they think that is OK,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton deplored attacks on Serbs in Kosovo by  
returning refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is not letting it happen,'' he declared. ``We're doing  
what we can to stop it and I'm concerned about it. I'm not 
particularly surprised, after what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the problem would ease as NATO forces disperse  
throughout Kosovo and are able to provide protection to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton opened his news conference by challenging what he  
characterized as a do-nothing Congress to approve his proposals for 
Medicare, Social Security, gun control, education, child care and 
campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, cut taxes and safeguard the Social 
Security surplus for improving that program. ``I ask the president, 
please include tax relief in your agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., joined by dozens of rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, turning to politics, said he intends to assert his  
voice into the nation's political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to be working right up to the end,'' he said. Yet, he  
acknowledged the reality that he is a lame-duck president. ``The 
closer you get to the election,'' he said, ``the more difficult it 
will be to pass anything.'' 
</P>
<P>

	On other matters, the president:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said Washington will have to approve emergency aid again this  
year to help farmers cope with drought and plunging prices. ``It's 
a crisis. We have to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Belittled critics, ``particularly the right wing. You know I've  
been accused of murder and all kinds of things,'' he said. Despite 
the bitter impeachment fight, Clinton said he would work with any 
member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said it's uncertain whether the Kosovo conflict would boost his  
standing in the polls; so far, it hasn't. ``I did what I thought 
was right. I still believe it was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he was surprised ``we lost only two planes and no pilots''  
in the bombing campaign. The biggest surprise was the accidental 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. ``I had no earthly idea 
that our system would permit that kind of mistake,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Airline Union Complains About Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A union complaint that pilots filed with  
American Airlines seeking better enforcement of crew rest rules 
contains an eye-opening statement: On one American flight, both 
pilots fell asleep for a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I woke up, I looked over at the captain. He was sound  
asleep,'' a pilot wrote anonymously in a report attached to the 
June 8 union grievance. No specifics about the alleged incident 
were stated, except that the pilot said it occurred over Mexico 
during an overnight flight to Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines scoffed at the anonymous allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to remember that this is the same union that only four  
months ago tried to convince the public that 2,500 of its members 
were sick,'' said airline spokesman Chris Chiames, alluding to a 
sickout by American pilots in February that left thousands of 
travelers stranded. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge this week ordered the union, the 9,500-member  
Allied Pilots Association, to pay a $45 million fine for violating 
his back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	American said it has more restrictive duty and rest policies  
than the federal government requires, but it is the responsibility 
of pilots to ensure they are ready for duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it cannot  
investigate the alleged incident or others like it included with 
the grievance because the details are too sketchy. However, its 
general concern about the alertness of flight crews prompted the 
agency to announce earlier this month that it will strictly enforce 
rest rules at all airlines starting Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been simply enough reports over time and enough  
attention has been called to it that we want to make sure the rules 
are being followed,'' said FAA spokesman Paul Turk. 
</P>
<P>
	While the union grievance involves American Airlines, the issue  
of crew fatigue has been a lingering concern throughout the airline 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal regulations, airline pilots cannot fly more than  
eight hours a day. They must also be allowed to rest eight hours 
each day. Crews complain that the flight and rest limits don't 
address the toll extracted by the extra time they spend on duty, 
such as checking in for a flight or sitting in an airport during a 
layover. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots say backup crews are the hardest-hit, because they can be  
ordered to start their workday at any time, regardless of whether 
they just woke up or are ready to go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has floated two ideas for addressing the concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, it suggested pilots be allowed to take  
``controlled rest'' -- individual naps of up to 40 minutes while a 
plan was in cruise flight. The proposal died from a lack of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the agency also proposed revamping crew rest rules by  
allowing up to 10 hours of flight time within a 14-hour duty day, 
leaving 10 hours for rest. Various factions balked at the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue languished until the crash in Little Rock, Ark., on  
June 1 that killed 10 passengers and the plane's captain. He and 
the co-pilot had been on duty 13 1/2 hours, a half-hour short of 
American's maximum duty time. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 4, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said the agency would  
begin strict enforcement of its existing crew rest regulations. On 
June 8, the Allied Pilots Association filed its grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	Union spokesman Greg Overman said the Mexico sleeping report was  
one of several fatigue-related incidents culled from an anonymous 
reporting system set up by the FAA and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the problem of tired pilots is not limited to American  
Airlines, since the system contains similar reports from other 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Engelke, a veteran American co-pilot, said he does not  
think pilots fall asleep very often, but ``any incident is a 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``The individual pilot is responsible for keeping  
himself rested. But fatigue is an insidious thing ... and it can 
affect your judgment as to whether you are ready for flight duty.''

<HEADLINE> Two Jurors Support Louima Case Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two jurors who found a patrolman guilty in the  
torture of a Haitian immigrant in a police station bathroom have 
given sworn statements saying they regret the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavits were filed this week in Brooklyn federal court to  
support a motion for a new trial for former officer Charles 
Schwarz. After a four-week trial, Schwarz, 33, was convicted June 8 
in the assault on Abner Louima and is in federal custody awaiting a 
possible life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz's attorney, Stephen Worth, said the two anonymous jurors  
came forward after learning in press accounts that the lead 
defendant in the bathroom attack, Justin Volpe, had told 
prosecutors before his mid-trial guilty plea that his accomplice 
was not Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
	``They felt terrible about what had happened and were wondering  
if there was anything they could do,'' Worth said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a May 25 plea with the jury absent, Volpe claimed that  
another officer was present while he sodomized a handcuffed Louima 
with a stick, but did not name him. Volpe mistakenly believed that 
Louima had punched him outside a nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day Judge Eugene Nickerson informed the 12 jurors only  
that Volpe had chosen to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to one of the two jurors, word that Volpe had  
mentioned a second officer filtered into the jury room before they 
convicted Schwarz of holding down Louima in the assault. The jury 
later acquitted officers Thomas Wiese, Thomas Bruder and Michael 
Bellomo on other brutality charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Both jurors -- whose identities were not revealed -- gave  
statements saying that if they had known that Volpe had tried to 
exonerate Schwarz, ``it would have created a reasonable doubt in my 
mind to the guilt of the defendant, Charles Schwarz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Peterson a Hit at JVC Jazz Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pianist Oscar Peterson continues to get stronger  
after a stroke he suffered in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, 73, one of the last giants of jazz, played at Carnegie  
Hall Thursday night as part of the JVC Jazz Festival. The 
performance came 50 years after his first appearance there at a 
1949 Jazz at the Philharmonic concert. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thursday's concert, he and his quartet stayed away from  
standard tunes. He played compositions of his own and tunes he 
didn't name. The audience, which gave several standing ovations, 
loved everything, though there was much cheering when he began 
``Satin Doll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson walked on stage without a cane. He used his left hand  
only occasionally but when he did, his playing was stronger than it 
was the last time he appeared at Carnegie. The hall swung even when 
he used only his powerful right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	He played ``Tranquil,'' which he composed after a trip to  
Brazil; the cooking, intricate, melodic ``Backyard Blues,'' which 
he wrote for his quartet; ``City Lights,'' which he composed for a 
Montreal ballet company; and ``When Summer Comes'' and ``Evening 
Song,'' which sounded sadly nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson is Canadian. His electric guitarist is Swedish, bassist  
Danish and drummer English. They tour the world and, as Peterson 
has always preferred, they play the entire concert, without an 
opening act. When people come to hear you, he used to tell Ella 
Fitzgerald, they should hear you, not somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson's was the third of three exhilarating nights in the  
last week of the JVC Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Anita O'Day, 79, exhibited her well-remembered  
feisty zest singing ``There Will Never Be Another You,'' ``Is You 
Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?'' and one of her signature songs, 
``Honeysuckle Rose.'' She gave the lie to her pronouncement that 
she isn't a great ballad singer with an exquisite ``Street of 
Dreams.'' However, her uptempo ``Lover Come Back to Me,'' which 
followed, in which she traded licks with drummer Jack Le Compte, 
was more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan Transfer concluded that show at Avery Fisher Hall,  
proving that they are tops in vocal harmonizing. They're engagingly 
polished without sounding slick. Tunes went from ``Moten's Swing,'' 
from the days after Count Basie joined the Bennie Moten Band in 
1929, to a definitive ``Route 66.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Hauser, founder of the quartet in 1969, relating bits of  
jazz history, said the Benny Goodman Band was trying to play 
popular music, which wasn't going over very well, at the Palomar 
Ballroom in Los Angeles in July 1935. Drummer Gene Krupa suggested, 
``If we're going down, let's go down doing our own music.'' They 
played ``King Porter Stomp,'' which Manhattan Transfer sang. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Krall and Joshua Redman were both thrilling Wednesday  
night at Carnegie Hall. Redman's quartet, which played first, 
varied dynamics, often in the same song. 
</P>
<P>
	They started with Redman's composition ``Chill.'' They  
transformed ``Eleanor Rigby'' into jazz with improvisations and 
much drumming. 
</P>
<P>
	Krall alternated playing piano and singing from the piano bench,  
in a style appreciated by all ages. She's young but knows jazz 
history, slipping occasional lines like one from Peggy Lee's ``Do 
Right'' into another song. Her demeanor is almost disdainful and 
her words are clipped so short they aren't all understood, but her 
overall effect charms.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Resistance Members Start Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Five former Iraqi military officers were  
freed and reunited with their families after being held for 2 1/2 
years in detention centers in California while under suspicion of 
being double agents working for Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of an agreement earlier this month with the  
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the men may stay in Lincoln 
-- where their families settled after the Persian Gulf war -- until 
another country agrees to accept them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big day -- we are very happy that we can ultimately  
resume our lives,'' 30-year-old Adil Awadh said after he was 
released Thursday along with the others. ``We cannot describe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men were among 6,500 Iraqi dissidents brought to the United  
States after the CIA's unsuccessful effort to overthrow President 
Saddam Hussein following the war. 
</P>
<P>
	But after arriving in California, the five men and a colleague  
were jailed in detention centers run by the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	The men claim testimony from members of opposing factions within  
the splintered Iraqi resistance led U.S. authorities to seek their 
deportation. They fear torture and execution if returned to 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	Awadh is a medical doctor. The other men are: Mohammed  
Al-Ammary, 37, a jet pilot; Ali Saleh, 34, an auto mechanic; 
Mohammed Tuma, 33, a former career army officer; and Safa Al-Batat, 
34, a former army commando. 
</P>
<P>
	A sixth man, Ali Mohammed Karim, 37, a medical doctor, refused  
to accept the resettlement agreement and remains in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence used against the men was kept secret during court  
hearings, as was the judge's written ruling that initially ordered 
them deported, said Niels Frenzen, their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made educated guesses as to what we thought some of the  
evidence might be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former CIA Director James Woolsey, now a private lawyer, helped  
Frenzen on the case and has called the episode a ``stain on 
America's honor.''. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the men were jailed based on a 49-year-old U.S. Supreme  
Court decision which gives federal officials almost unlimited power 
in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a bizarre provision of American law,'' he said. ``It  
needs to be changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2,500 Iraqi refugees live in Lincoln, a city of  
200,000 people, said Kay Wenzl, resettlement director for Catholic 
Social Services.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Readies Medicare Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is floating a Medicare  
prescription benefit that could pay roughly half the cost of drugs 
up to a limit of perhaps $3,000 to $5,000 a year, in return for 
higher premiums paid by beneficiaries, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal still is being written, White House press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said, and final details will not be disclosed until 
Clinton presents it Tuesday. The drug benefit would be optional, 
according to congressional aides and lobbyists who have been 
briefed by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how much the new benefit would cost taxpayers --  
sure to be many billions of dollars -- or how it would be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week I will propose a detailed plan to strengthen  
Medicare, to cut its costs, to modernize its operation, to use 
competition and innovation, to strengthen the core guarantee of 
quality care for all Americans who are elderly and eligible,'' the 
president said in a Georgetown University speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will also for the first time propose a way to help senior  
citizens with their greatest growing need: affordable prescription 
drugs,'' he said. ``It is a huge issue out their for seniors. 
Finding agreement on Social Security and Medicare will be hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate  
Finance Committee, said his panel would put together a prescription 
drug benefit for consideration in the fall. ``One of the key issues 
that we must address in any reform proposal,'' he said, ``is 
insuring that the poor and sick elderly have access to prescription 
drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats are nervous about raising Medicare  
premium charges heading into the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are concerned about another possible feature: a  
means-testing requirement that links premium costs to 
beneficiaries' incomes. Some lawmakers are concerned the higher 
costs and income tests will blow up in their faces, much like the 
1988 surtax that Congress approved -- and later was forced to repeal 
at the demand of outraged senior citizens -- to provide catastrophic 
health insurance under Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing Tuesday's deadline for the unveiling of Clinton's  
proposal, White House officials are consulting with Democrats to 
test their reaction. One official said the administration is open 
to the idea of means-testing but might not include that aspect in 
Clinton's plan, leaving it to Congress to decide what to do. 
Republicans likely would attack any income-linked benefit as a tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the White House plans floated on Capitol Hill would have  
the government pay half of prescription costs for Medicare 
beneficiaries up to an annual limit of several thousand dollars, 
roughly between $3,000 and $5,000 a year, an official said, 
</P>
<P>
	To obtain that benefit, recipients would have to pay an  
additional monthly premium -- something higher than $20 a month but 
less than the average $90 charged for drug coverage under a Medigap 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's goal is to offer a prescription benefit that ``meets  
or exceeds what's available in the private sector but is 
significantly more affordable,'' an official said. The official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, cautioned that proposed 
benefits and costs have not been locked in. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they put the final package together,'' the official said,  
``they're going to move a lot of numbers around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Chief of Staff John Podesta met with House Democrats  
earlier in the week, and heard a variety of complaints about a 
proposal to means-test Part B of Medicare, which covers visits to 
doctors and medical services. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed  
the White House would drop the idea altogether, or else make it 
apply only to beneficiaries with very high incomes. That would 
blunt any GOP attempt to charge them with raising taxes on middle 
or lower income seniors.

<HEADLINE> Source of Uncommon Parasite Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Federal health officials are trying  
to determine how guests at a May convention were stricken by an 
intestinal parasite uncommon in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
will survey 250 attendees of a mid-May event at The Breakers hotel 
to trace the source of the parasite cyclospora cayentansis. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials say eight cases of the parasite have been  
confirmed. In all, 24 people say they fell ill after the meeting, 
but health officials have not confirmed if all contracted the 
parasite. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 11, the Los Angeles County Health Department received  
its first report of a problem from a man who had developed severe 
diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was among a 40-member party from California, about half  
of which became sick, said Dr. Jean Malecki, director of the Palm 
Beach County Health Department. Health officials in Wisconsin also 
reported four convention attendees from the state developed similar 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-eight states were represented at the convention, which  
Malecki declined to name. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are focusing their probe on fresh produce imported  
from foreign farms because cyclospora is not typically found in the 
United States, Malecki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parasite latches on to the intestine and -- after lying  
dormant for up to two weeks -- can cause diarrhea, nausea, cramping, 
fatigue, appetite loss and weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The ill are being treated with antibiotics, Malecki said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Leads Fund-Raising Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, out front in  
opinion polls, now is leading Vice President Al Gore and every 
other presidential candidate in the race to raise money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only Democratic opponent, former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley, is closing in on the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will have raised $15 million to $18 million by the end of  
June, a campaign aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former professional basketball player, is expected to  
have raised more than $10 million, according to a source close to 
the Bradley campaign, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, son of the former president, expects to report at least  
$20 million in fund raising on the next round of federal campaign 
finance reports, campaign spokesman David Beckwith said. Republican 
officials, including some close to Bush, said the governor's 
fund-raising figure could be closer to $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't do this without a very broad base of support,''  
Beckwith said. ``We have a network of volunteers who are helping us 
all over the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's top Republican competitors each raised about $2.5 million  
over the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain should lead the rest of the GOP pack.  
McCain has said he would raise $4.3 million, including $2.5 million 
during the most recent quarter. In addition, he has transferred $2 
million from his Senate campaign treasury to his presidential 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes also is expected to raise $2.5 million in  
the second quarter, aides said. During the first quarter of 1999, 
Forbes contributed $694,000 of his own money but raised only 
$18,538. 
</P>
<P>
	Former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole has taken in  
more than $3 million so far, including the $686,253 she raised 
during the first three months of the year, a campaign aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer has raised $3.4 million, about  
$2 million in the second quarter, campaign manager Frank Cannon 
said. Bauer is relying heavily on expensive direct mail to raise 
money, driving up the costs of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is expected to report  
raising about $2.5 million through June 30, aides said, after 
taking in just $748,773 during the first three months of the year. 
At the start of the month, Alexander ordered drastic cutbacks in 
his campaign staff and travel budgets because of fund-raising 
problems. Alexander wound up in debt during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who also was in debt as of  
March 31, expects to raise $1 million during the second quarter 
after taking in $2.1 million during the first three months of the 
year, spokesman Jonathan Baron said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally  
lower Friday, with share prices slumping in Tokyo and Taipei on the 
back of an overnight fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost  
191.80 points, or 1.09 percent, to close at 17,436.52. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 41.57 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold shares of banks and technology companies  
following the overnight steep fall in New York, where the Dow Jones 
industrial average fell 132.03, or 1.2 percent, to 10,534.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Exchange of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 1.72 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,409.41. The 
TOPIX closed up 1.95 points, or 0.14 percent, the day before. 
</P>

	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.52 yen by late  
afternoon, down 0.38 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below 
its late New York level of 121.78 yen overnight.

tumbling almost four percent following losses on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index fell 323.35  
points or 3.8 percent, to 8,265.96. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stock markets are regarded as a market barometer for the  
Taipei bourse due to the close manufacturing ties between Taiwan 
companies and industry giants in the United States.

	Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly higher after two  
straight sessions of declines.

percent, closing at 13,784.51. On Thursday, the index had slumped 
195.92 points, or 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers attributed the upturn to selective bargain-hunting  
following losses in share prices in the past two days.

	Many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of next week's  
meeting of the U.S. rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee may go through with

<HEADLINE> Brazil Urges Europe To Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- To counter the economic and political  
clout of the United States, Brazil's top businessmen are urging 
Europe to open its market to South American goods in a 
transatlantic free trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of such a zone between the European Union and  
Mercosur -- with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay as full 
members and Bolivia and Chile as associates -- will be the most 
important issue of Rio de Janeiro's June 28-29 summit of EU leaders 
and their Latin American and Caribbean counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stronger (trade) ties with the European Union will open a huge  
market for us and reduce the economic and political weight of the 
United States in Latin America,'' said Luiz Fernando Furlan, an 
official with the Federation of Industries of the State of Sao 
Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercosur hopes to benefit by playing Europe off the United  
States, which has its own proposal for a Free Trade Area of the 
Americas to start up by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``An EU-Mercosur free trade agreement will counter'' the  
expected influx to South America of U.S. goods that the FTAA 
envisions, Furlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, EU leaders gave their authorization for talks to  
begin immediately on nontariff barriers like as food safety and 
hygiene regulations, while the more contentious tariff-reduction 
negotiations will start in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the mandate, the summit would have ``amounted to little  
more than a photo opportunity,'' said Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Luiz Felipe Lampreia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that an EU-Mercosur trade agreement would help prevent  
the FTAA from becoming the only trade alternative for South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot go down just one path, or put all our eggs in one  
basket. We want (trade) equilibrium with the EU and the FTAA,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruy Martins Altenfender Silva, one of the directors of the  
Federation of Industries, said businesses do not expect the summit 
to result in any immediate reduction of trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will only begin happening after the Millennium Round,''  
Silva said, referring to the World Trade Organization talks, which 
start in November in Seattle. ``The most we can expect from the 
summit is a clear and concise agenda of issues to be negotiated.''

<HEADLINE> Game Blocker in Next Windows Version </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Parents will be able to restrict the kinds of  
games their children play by enabling a feature to be included in a 
new version of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system due out 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based software company is currently working  
with game manufacturers to embed code information on ratings in 
their new games, which the Windows Game Manager would check, said 
Kevin Bachus, product manager for Microsoft's multimedia group. 
Game ratings are currently printed on game packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	The feature would allow parents to keep games containing  
excessive violence, sexual content or expletives from being played 
on the computer. Microsoft's Internet Explorer has a similar 
feature that can be used to block access to certain Web sites, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's planned move comes at a time when the computer and  
video game industry is under siege because of concerns about the 
effect of such violence on children and its possible connection to 
the school shootings around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Lowenstein, president of Interactive Digital Software  
Association, the Washington, D.C.-based game publishers' lobbying 
group, said he thought the feature sounded like a useful tool and 
predicted support for it from the software industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think philosophically it's the kind of thing as an industry  
we've always been supportive of -- parental empowerment tools,'' 
Lowenstein said. ``Anything that facilitates the control of what 
kids have access to is positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Stephens, president of the Reston, Va.-based research firm  
PC Data Inc., questioned whether the program would be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any technologically savvy kid is much more  
technologically savvy than their parents. Maybe this will give some 
parents some peace of mind, but I don't think it will have any 
impact,'' Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens said a recent PC Data survey found that most people  
believe violent movies and television shows are more damaging to 
children than computer games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is this -- do we ban everything because there are  
crazy people out there and we do not know what sets them off?'' 
Stephens asked. ``I think that's overkill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bachus said Microsoft was confident the blocking feature could  
be made easy enough for a non-computer-savvy parent to use as well 
as secure via a password. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be ways to skirt around this but ... we  
think it gives parents another tool to try to be a better parent,'' 
Bachus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents also would have the option to specifically approve  
certain games or programs, such as a word-processing program, that 
might not be rated, Bachus said.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Drug Benefit Support Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is testing  
political support for a new Medicare drug benefit that would pay 
roughly half the cost of prescriptions -- up to perhaps $3,000 to 
$5,000 a year -- in return for higher premiums from beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should offer a drug benefit but we should do it in a way  
that it's quite clear that it won't break the bank,'' President 
Clinton said at a news conference Friday, announcing that next week 
he will unveil his long-anticipated plan to offer retirees 
government assistance paying for prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most significant health care need that senior  
citizens have today,'' Clinton said. In addition to helping 
retirees, he said, a new Medicare drug benefit ``will, in the 
long-term, save medical costs because it will help keep people out 
of the hospitals and out of the nursing homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug proposal still is being written, White House press  
secretary Joe Lockhart said, and final details will not be 
disclosed until Clinton presents it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have said the drug benefit would be  
made available as an option for all 39 million elderly and disabled 
Medicare beneficiaries, offering less expensive coverage than many 
seniors currently have access to in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it is unclear how Clinton plans to answer politically  
sensitive questions such as how much the new benefit would cost 
taxpayers -- sure to be many billions of dollars -- or how it would 
be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials have been bouncing ideas off wary  
congressional Democrats this week. Among the proposals to find 
money in the already cash-strapped program: Tying Medicare premiums 
to retirees' incomes so that wealthier retirees pay more for 
coverage of doctors' office visits and other outpatient medical 
care. Currently, those premiums -- $45.50 a month in 1999 -- are the 
same for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	At one meeting, Clinton's Chief of Staff John Podesta heard  
complaints about that proposal from House Democrats who are worried 
about proposing any sort of premium hikes as they head into the 
2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they  
believe the White House would drop the idea altogether or make it 
apply only to beneficiaries with very high incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said at his news conference that he has been open to the  
idea of means testing since 1992, but The Washington Post reported 
in its Saturday editions that he decided Friday to drop the idea in 
the face of opposition from lawmakers in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly, people are just real nervous about it. It causes  
more political and administrative problems than it's worth,'' said 
Patricia Smith, a senior health lobbyist for the AARP, the nation's 
largest organization of older adults. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the influential AARP supports the concept of adding  
prescription benefits to Medicare -- which currently pays only for a 
few drugs administered in hospitals -- and the idea also has proved 
exceedingly popular in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing that strong popular sentiment, Republicans are  
approaching the issue cautiously, preparing alternatives in 
addition to lining up an attack on Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, issued a statement Friday saying his panel will design 
it's own prescription drug benefit for consideration in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have praised one plan proposed in March by an  
advisory commission. It would provide government-subsidized drug 
benefits only for those living near the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., an author of the commission  
proposal, wrote to Republican colleagues on Thursday pointing out 
that about two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries already have some 
type of drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes retirement benefits from former employers,  
supplemental insurance policies retirees buy on their own, 
government poverty programs and extra benefits offered by managed 
care health plans that participate in Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Among questions Thomas said Republicans should raise about  
Clinton's plan: ``Would the benefit be available to retired 
millionaires who do not need assistance from another government 
entitlement?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One White House proposal floated on Capitol Hill this week would  
have the government pay half of prescription costs for Medicare 
beneficiaries up to an annual limit of several thousand dollars, 
roughly between $3,000 and $5,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	To obtain that benefit, recipients would have to pay an  
additional monthly premium. It would be higher than $20 a month but 
less than the average $90 charged for drug coverage under a Medigap 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Medigap policies cap drug benefits at $3,000 a year and also  
require senior citizens to pay a $250 deductible before drug 
coverage kicks in.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Had Breaking News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Befitting the fast-paced technology industry,  
some evidence in the Microsoft antitrust trial was only days or 
even hours old when the judge agreed to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final moments of testimony this week, a Microsoft lawyer  
showed the judge a late-breaking news story about America Online 
Inc. that had been published hours earlier on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The story quoted the head of a small computer company whose  
machines don't use Microsoft software confirming early discussions 
Thursday with AOL about a business venture, weeks after an AOL 
executive testified in court that plans to build an ``AOL PC'' were 
``largely dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson arched an eyebrow as  
Microsoft's lawyer handed him a printout of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say you haven't brought me current,'' Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in a typical case with a jury, the Microsoft trial judge  
-- who will decide the verdict himself -- showed little compunction 
about admitting last-minute evidence or asking witnesses about 
statements he read in newspapers or magazines during the courtroom 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts agreed the practice was unusual but appropriate,  
considering that important changes in the high-tech industry occur 
so quickly it's said to operate on ``Internet time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really cutting-edge stuff, not something you can go to  
some textbook about,'' said lawyer Rich Gray, an antitrust expert 
in San Jose, Calif. ``You have to read the paper, you have to read 
the Web articles. This is the one case in the world out of a 
thousand where it makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors typically are instructed not to read newspapers or watch  
television news during deliberations, but Jackson interrupted a 
line of questioning one day in January to ask a government witness 
about an op-ed article from that morning's Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson even made the article Court Exhibit No. 1, and handed  
copies to lawyers for Microsoft and the government to follow along 
as he took over questioning the Justice Department's chief 
economics expert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judges don't live in glass bubbles,'' said Robert Litan, a  
former senior Justice official. ``If Microsoft is found guilty of 
something, it's like you're performing surgery on a $14 billion 
company in open court. You want someone plugged into the real 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had $14 billion in revenues last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses cited late-breaking news, too. Earlier this month,  
Microsoft lawyers, in questioning the government's economics 
expert, Franklin Fisher, contended that computers running Windows 
will face unprecedented competition from new devices and emerging 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher cited an essay by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates  
published earlier that week in a national news magazine in which 
Gates said computers will continue to be dominant for years. It 
appeared to flatly contradict what the company's lawyers were 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that's very likely to happen,'' Fisher said,  
``and according to a recent Newsweek article, neither does Mr. 
Gates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With those relatively loose rules about evidence, one legal  
expert wondered about attempts on both sides to influence reporters 
and affect what happened inside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have something that is so important, and both sides have  
the ability to create news that could possibly wind up as 
evidence,'' said Tyler Baker, a Dallas antitrust lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge didn't allow everything in as evidence.  
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers raised questions about an e-mail Gates sent  
to his top executives during the case, which was leaked to The 
Associated Press and later to other reporters. Jackson said it 
``may very well be an interesting document'' but he refused last 
week to allow Microsoft to use it as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Other times, late-breaking evidence appeared to astonish the  
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	After an explanation earlier this week about a new generation of  
software that runs across high-speed Internet connections rather 
than relying on Windows, the judge appeared fascinated and wondered 
why software companies ``aren't developing (these) applications in 
droves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Microsoft's lawyer introduced a story published on  
the Internet just hours before the judge made his remark. The 
headline: ``Web-based applications debut in droves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, Your Honor,'' said Microsoft lawyer Michael  
Lacovara, ``we get lucky.''

<HEADLINE> Germany 6, Mexico 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Inka Grings scored three times on eight  
shots as Germany dominated the smaller and less-experienced Mexico 
team 6-0 Thursday night in the second round of Women's World Cup 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which tied Italy 1-1 in the opening round, will play  
undefeated Brazil on Sunday in Washington, D.C. A win or a tie 
would put the Germans in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany outshot Mexico, a 7-1 loser to Brazil in its opener,  
43-2. Germany had 20 shots on goal compared to only one for Mexico. 
Germany led 2-0 at halftime, scored twice early in the second half 
and then twice more late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played very well, and that will surely give us confidence  
against Brazil,'' defender Steffi Jones said. ``We'll play to win 
at all costs and then we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Mexico, it was a learning experience, especially for keeper  
Lenny Quinones, who came up with 14 saves and was battered by 
game's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are here to learn,'' coach Leo Cuellar said. ``But  
it's tough to take defeats in a positive way. The players are 
disappointed, but we have to be realistic; we came here for 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuellar said he was pleased with his team's effort, if not the  
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturday's game (against Brazil) was disappointing,'' Cuellar  
said. ``Germany has great physical strength, a high level of 
fitness and good teamwork. We were short on effort against Brazil. 
We offered more today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grings, who had 10 shots, scored first, 10 minutes into the  
game. Sandra Smisek made it 2-0 just before halftime. Mexico had no 
shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more of the same in the second half. Ariane Hingst scored  
in the 49th minute and Grings drilled a shot deep into the goal 
eight minutes later. Renate Lingor made it 5-0 89 minutes into the 
match, and Grings got her hat trick with an unassisted goal at the 
92nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	German coach Tina Theune-Meyer said the win and the large margin  
could help push his team into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very happy about the win and by this margin, confident  
about qualification,'' Theune-Meyer said. ``We wanted to score 
goals to prove our seed in this group. The pitch made for sloppier 
play, but we proved we are contenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Theune-Meyer said Germany wants to play well against Brazil to  
avoid playing the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously want to avoid play the U.S. in the quarterfinals,  
so that is the objective for the next match,'' he said. ``We need 
to improve on our ratio of chances to goals so that we advance 
favorably.''

<HEADLINE> $1.16B Awarded to BCCI Liquidators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered a retired Saudi  
government official to pay $1.16 billion in damages to the 
court-appointed liquidators of BCCI, a now-defunct foreign bank 
that was at the center of an international scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green ruled that Abdul Raouf  
Hasan Khalil, a Saudi businessman who was believed to be the 
biggest depositor in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, 
conspired with bank officials in a fraudulent scheme that resulted 
in big losses to the Third World bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Green found that Khalil allowed BCCI to use his name and  
reputation as a shareholder in exchange for a payment of millions 
of dollars. The scheme allegedly included siphoning off more than 
$250 million from BCCI to Capcom Financial Services Ltd., a 
brokerage company partly owned by Khalil. 
</P>
<P>
	Khalil's attorneys, James Linn and Stephen Johnson, didn't  
immediately return telephone calls Thursday seeking comment. Khalil 
is retired and living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, according to the 
liquidators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that the court has recognized the significant  
loss to BCCI caused by the activities of Mr. Khalil,'' said Stephen 
Akers, a partner in accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, who is one 
of the liquidators. ``We intend to enforce this judgment 
aggressively so that additional funds can be repaid to the innocent 
victims of BCCI as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The liquidators have said the victims include depositors and  
other creditors of the bank who were owed some $10.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling family of the Persian Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi owned  
77 percent of BCCI before it collapsed amid allegations of arms 
smuggling, drug money laundering and financing of terrorists. At 
its peak, the bank had 1.3 million depositors and operations in 70 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	BCCI pleaded guilty in December 1991 to federal fraud charges  
and forfeited a record $550 million in assets. In a plea bargain, 
BCCI acknowledged its secret, illegal ownership of four U.S. banks, 
including First American Bankshares, the biggest bank holding 
company in Washington at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Clark Clifford, a defense secretary under President  
Lyndon Johnson and adviser to several Democratic presidents, had 
been one of BCCI's principal lawyers in this country and the 
chairman of First American. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford and his former law partner, Robert Altman, agreed in  
February 1998 to pay a total of $5 million to settle civil fraud 
charges in the BCCI case. In agreeing to the settlement, Clifford 
and Altman neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Reject Primary Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writerr    	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Democratic Party on Friday rejected  
challenges to first-in-the-nation primary bragging rights for Iowa 
and New Hampshire but said big changes are inevitable in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules committee of the Democratic National Committee turned  
aside spirited efforts by Michigan and Washington state to 
challenge the supremacy of the two make-or-break states. 
</P>
<P>
	Party rules say no delegation selection can begin until March 7,  
with an exception carved out for Iowa, traditionally the first 
caucus state, and New Hampshire, the time-honored first primary 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan wants to hold caucuses on Feb. 12 or the Saturday  
before New Hampshire's primary, whichever comes first. Washington 
state wants to take part in a presidential primary on Feb. 29, the 
tentative date for the New Hampshire primary. Iowa's caucus is 
tentatively set for Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, South Carolina, Delaware and Oregon also have waiver  
requests pending to hold earlier primaries, but the rules panel 
took no action on those Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	During lengthy debate, Iowa and New Hampshire officials conceded  
that the days of their special status may be numbered but the rules 
of the game should not be changed for the 2000 campaign for the 
White House nomination because it's in full swing in both states. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, the first Democratic governor in his  
state in 32 years, said his defense of the special treatment is 
``without reservation or apology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about privilege, but about permission the party has  
long given us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa and New Hampshire may not be microcosms of the nation, but  
they effectively air the important issues and give candidates an 
equal opportunity to strut their stuff, Vilsack and other officials 
from the two states said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the challengers said many of the other states are weary of  
taking a backseat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a deep resentment in our party and among many of the  
voters,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``The two states think they 
have a God-given right to go first and they don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan has 156 national delegates and Washington state 94,  
compared with 29 for New Hampshire and 56 for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Democratic Chairman Mark Brewer said his party needs  
the early caucuses to compete with the attention homestate 
Republicans will get by moving the state primary up to Feb. 22 -- an 
election he described as a calculated move to help Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush in his bid for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state Democrats said they have little choice but to  
seek the date change. A bipartisan commission created by the 
Legislature picked the Feb. 29 date, state Chairman Paul Berendt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the committee members agreed that change seems  
inevitable. Several mentioned a system of regional primaries, with 
each region taking its turn as the first in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is broke and getting broker,'' said Alice Travis  
Germond of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel said it's too late to overhaul the system for the  
2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Fowler of South Carolina, former Democratic national  
chairman, said he foresees ``nothing but mischief if we start 
granting waivers.'' States would play leapfrog and the whole 
nominating process would be over by this Christmas Eve, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq To List Chinese Internet Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- An Internet provider partially owned by  
mainland China's state-run news agency hopes to raise $68 million 
by going public in the United States next week. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com Corp. said Friday it has registered with the  
Securities and Exchange Commission to list 4.25 million shares on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market at $14 to $16 each during its initial 
public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com is a Hong Kong-based Chinese-language Internet  
provider offering Web services, e-commerce and advertising focusing 
on mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, major U.S. Internet companies have sought to  
capitalize on China's growing population of Internet users, which 
so far totals 2.1 million. Bosses at China.com are hoping an 
investment that combines exposure to China and the Internet will 
prove enticing to U.S. traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The big shareholders in China.com include China's official  
Xinhua News Agency, which has 13.6 percent; and Hong Kong-based New 
World Infrastructure, with 22.7 percent. U.S. Internet provider 
America Online Inc., is to acquire a 10 percent equity stake along 
with warrants to purchase an additional 15 percent interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government tightly monitors the use of the Internet  
in China, saying state security and anti-pornography laws apply 
online as well as off. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ellen O'Gorman, a spokeswoman for China.com, refused to  
comment when asked if China's official Xinhua News Agency would 
exercise a heavy hand over information passing through China.com.

<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Peter Emil Herbert Abeles, a transport  
magnate and one of Australia's most influential businessmen, died 
Friday of cancer. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Abeles teamed with George Rockey to launch the Alltrans  
transport company. In 1967, Alltrans merged with another trucking 
firm, Thomas Nationwide Transport, to become TNT Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Abeles rapidly expanded TNT, moving into the airline industry  
and taking on projects in Europe and the United States. By the 
1980s, TNT had businesses in 180 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He was knighted in 1972 for his services to transport, charities

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dr. Louis K. Diamond, who pioneered the study  
of blood diseases in children and helped organize the American Red 
Cross blood donation system, died June 14. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	In his six decades of work, Diamond is perhaps best known for  
developing, with Dr. Fred Allen, a method of blood transfusion 
through the umbilical vein to help newborns suffering from Rh 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1946 transfusion method was credited with saving as many as  
20,000 babies per year. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1948 to 1950 he was technical director for the newly  
established Red Cross National Blood Program. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from Harvard in 1927 with a medical degree,  
Diamond spent most of the next four decades at the Harvard Medical 
School as professor of pediatrics, head of hematology and associate 
physician-in-chief at the Children's Hospital Medical Center in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	At Children's, he started one of the nation's first pediatric  
hematology research laboratories.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Tomin Harada, a Japanese surgeon who led a group of  
disfigured atomic bomb survivors known as the ``Hiroshima Maidens'' 
to the United States for plastic surgery in the 1950s, died Friday. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, he led the ``Hiroshima Maidens'' to the United States,  
where they received plastic surgery, which was unavailable in Japan 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Harada also pressed the government to enact a law to provide  
medical treatment to atomic bomb survivors, succeeding in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also known for his joint tour with U.S. peace activist  
Barbara Reynolds across Europe and the United States in the 1960s.

87. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, Keck joined United Airlines as an industrial engineer  
and rose through the ranks to head what was then the nation's 
largest air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was an associate in Kuhn, Loeb &AMP; Co., a Chicago

</P>
<P>
	He wrote four books about naval aviation and the development of  
the aircraft carrier, and wrote numerous articles for journals on 
the same subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy editor at the San Francisco Chronicle for 29 years, he  
retired in 1990 to become editor of the journal of the League of

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Geoff Lawson, the chief designer for Jaguar Cars  
Ltd. who had a major role in the British automaker's recent 
turnaround, died Thursday of a stroke. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	He played a role in the design and styling of all Jaguars  
introduced in the past 15 years, including the XJ6 and XJ8 sedans, 
the XK8 roadster and, most recently, the S-type sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson first went to work for Vauxhall, General Motors Corp.'s  
British subsidiary in 1969 as a designer. 
</P>
<P>
	He later worked for GM in the United States, becoming a chief  
designer before he was named Jaguar's styling director in 1984. He 
stayed on with Jaguar after it was bought by Ford Motor Co. in 
1989, overseeing the overhaul of its product line and an expansion

</P>
<P>
	Ocasek was a state senator for 28 years, serving as majority

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julius Tobias, a painter and sculptor known for  
abstract minimalist environments he created in the 1970s, died June 
16. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobias explored abstract expressionist and constructivist  
styles, and produced wall-size all-white paintings in the 1960s. 
These evolved into cubicle structures which often held geometric 
sculptural forms, beams and curb-like bars. Over time, the weight 
and size of the forms increased and came to incorporate crosses and 
church pews. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Tobias returned to figurative painting reflecting  
memories of war, the Holocaust and his perception of escalating 
violence. In the 1990s, he began a series of abstract geometric 
black paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobias received two Guggenheim fellowships, two Pollock-Krasner  
awards and National Endowment for the Arts grants.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frederick Trump, who amassed an unglamorous  
fortune constructing outer-borough apartments and then watched his 
ambitious son Donald build the family business into a glitzy 
real-estate empire, died Friday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump began building and selling one-family homes in Queens when  
he was 19, and eventually made millions on luxury houses and 
high-rises in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years following the Great Depression, Trump's wealth  
grew. He built apartment towers in Brooklyn, cottages in Queens and 
Staten Island, and military housing in Virginia. He was 
investigated but never charged in a scandal that involved 
developers bilking the Federal Housing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Trump credited much of his success to his father's  
example. Many also saw in the younger Trump a lifelong desire to 
outdo his father. By the 1980s, Donald was worth about $400 
million, to his father's $200 million.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- George E. Turner, a special effects  
illustrator, author and former editor of American Cinematographer 
magazine, died Sunday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner joined American Cinematographer in 1983 and two years  
later was named editor, a position he held until his retirement in 
1991. Turner continued working with the magazine as consultant, 
writer and book reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner began his career as a cartoonist and illustrator for  
magazines and books. He created special effects for the TV series 
``Zorro'' and films including ``The Shape of Things to Come,'' 
``One From the Heart'' and ``Creature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote, co-wrote, edited or illustrated more than 15 books,  
including ``Wildlife in the American West,'' ``Hoofbeats to 
Vengeance'' and ``The Cinema of Adventure, Romance &AMP; Terror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner is survived by four sons, a stepson and stepdaughter.

</P>
<P>

Nelson, the McGuire Sisters and Pat Boone.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Relents, Rides Cart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Bear finally bit the bullet. Jack  
Nicklaus rode a golf cart in competition for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who had hip-replacement surgery in January, rode for  
about half the holes while shooting 74 during the second round of 
the Senior Players Championship. His 145 left him nine shots behind 
leader Graham Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hip is fine, but everything around it is a little sore,''  
said Nicklaus, who argued against the use of carts in the Casey 
Martin case. ``I'll probably ride a little bit Saturday and Sunday, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus was one of several golfers who spoke out against the  
court ruling that allowed Martin to use a cart on the PGA Tour and 
in the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never taken a cart on the senior tour,'' Nicklaus said.  
``If I had to use it ... that's the rules of that game. Do I want 
to take a cart? No. I much prefer to walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carts have always been part of the scene on the Senior PGA Tour,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senior tour is the senior tour -- it's not the walking  
tour,'' Nicklaus said. ``It's the walking wounded, that's what it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, returned to competition in May, four months after  
surgery at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, and played three 
rounds on a hilly course, the 6,961-yard Hartefeld National Golf 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, he played in his Memorial tournament at Dublin,  
Ohio and made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	He now feels he may have rushed his recovery. He said he has  
developed bursitis and tendinitis in the muscles around his new 
hip, and said walking is more of a problem for him now. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will go away,'' Nicklaus said. ``It's just the muscles.  
It's not the hip. I have to learn how to play golf with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus has won 18 majors, plus two U.S. Amateurs and 70 times  
he's finished in the top 10 in a major. He was granted an exemption 
into the Senior Players Championship on a course he designed, the 
TPC of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game's coming around a little bit,'' Nicklaus said. ``I  
just want to try to play a decent round of golf and try to do the 
best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, during a March interview, found the situation ironic.  
</P>
<P>
	``However, I hope he uses one,'' Martin told CBS Sportsline. ``I  
would feel really bad if the best player of all time didn't play 
because he testified against me. Swallow your pride and ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has a rare circulatory disease in his right leg, making  
it nearly impossible for him to walk 18 holes. Martin said a cart 
would not give Nicklaus an unfair advantage. What it might give 
him, he said, is a new perspective.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Harbor Oysters Make Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Oysters, which flourished for centuries in New  
York Harbor before pollution and dredging wiped them out, have a 
place to grow anew -- an underwater mound of shells near the Statue 
of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't look for them on any menus just yet.  
</P>
<P>
	A police fireboat sluiced 260 tons of fossilized shells off a  
barge into 16 feet of water Thursday in the latest project to 
restore the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes according to plan, the shells -- dredged from a  
1,000-year-old oyster bed in Chesapeake Bay -- will form a 
hard-surface reef that will attract new oyster larvae and the 
plankton and algae on which they thrive, project managers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks, the larvae should have settled and started to  
grow, said Benjamin Longstreth, director of the $35,000 program for 
Baykeeper, a private ecological group based in Sandy Hook, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of doing this is the great ecological benefits,''  
Longstreth said during a tour of the harbor to observe the spraying 
of the 10,000 bushels of shells. ``We don't aim to eat the oysters 
off these oyster beds. New York Harbor water has gotten a lot 
cleaner, but it isn't that clean yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oysters filter silt and other impurities to clean the water  
naturally, said Francis X. O'Beirne, a marine ecologist at the 
Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hudson-Raritan Estuary that forms New York Harbor once  
supported 35 square miles of natural oyster beds. Oysters were once 
so plentiful, in fact, that Liberty and Ellis islands were called 
Oyster Islands by New York's original Dutch settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Overharvesting, pollution and dredging ended oyster fishing here  
early in the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say water quality has already been improved  
considerably by the cleaning up of industrial pollutants from the 
upper Hudson River and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although our work is not yet done, these achievements give us  
confidence that oyster-restoration projects like this one have a 
real chance of success,'' said Jean Fox, regional director of the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique of building underwater beds of oyster shells has  
been used previously in Long Island Sound and Chesapeake Bay.

<HEADLINE>  Clapton Auctions Guitars for Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Slowhand was a fast mover on the auction block.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Clapton, parting with some of his favorite possessions in  
the name of drug rehabilitation, raised more than $5 million for 
charity Thursday in an auction of 100 guitars. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz at Christie's was that only 99 of the instruments  
actually wound up in the hands of strangers. Clapton himself was 
believed interested in getting one guitar back, a 1930 Gibson L-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's declined to confirm whether Clapton did in fact bid  
on the guitar, which he had been quoted as saying is a ``very 
personal'' instrument he used at home rather than in the studio or 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	It went to an unidentified buyer for $57,500 -- a sum that didn't  
even make Thursday's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1956 sunburst Fender Stratocaster brought $497,500, far  
surpassing the $320,000 auction record for a guitar that belonged 
to Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brownie,'' as Clapton called it, was said to be one of his  
favorite guitars and was used to record his renowned love song 
``Layla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clapton sold a 1954 Fender Strat for $211,500 and a  
1974 Martin 000-28 for $173,000. Both were used for recording and 
stage work during the 1970s. A rare, solid-body 1958 Gibson 
Explorer went for $134,500.

	Actor Michael J. Fox, bidding by telephone, bought a 1949  
Gibson-125 for $36,800 and a 1930s National Duolian for $42,500.

<HEADLINE> Mays Custody Case Progresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Kimberly Mays, once at the center of a  
custody battle after learning she was switched at birth, is making 
progress toward regaining custody of her 1-year-old son, a child 
welfare official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yvonne Vassel, a spokeswoman for the Florida Children &AMP; Families  
Department, said Ms. Mays ``is making excellent progress on her 
case plan,'' which involves either parenting classes, counseling or 
a psychological evaluation. Citing privacy concerns, she would not 
say which options Ms. Mays chose. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mays' son, Deven, was taken from the care of Ms. Mays and  
her estranged husband, Jeremy Weeks, and placed in a foster home in 
April for reasons that the agency hasn't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Weeks received a temporary restraining order  
against his wife, claiming Ms. Mays had slapped and hit him, 
brandished knives and been verbally abusive during the course of 
their two-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks has yet to agree to a case plan to meet the requirements  
for regaining custody of his son, Ms. Vassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a family court hearing Friday, the judge set another hearing  
for the week of July 26 in which Ms. Mays and Weeks will explain to 
the judge what progress they have made. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mays was switched at birth in 1978 at a hospital with  
another baby. The mixup was discovered in 1988 and resulted in a 
lengthy custody battle between her biological parents, and Robert 
Mays, who raised her.

<HEADLINE> Haskins To Leave Minn. Coaching Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins agreed Friday to a $1.5 million  
buyout of his contract with Minnesota, even though university 
investigators have found no evidence implicating the basketball 
coach in an academic fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof said it is ``extremely likely''  
that fraud did occur and said a change was necessary to restore 
confidence in the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that on his watch, substantial, numerous  
violations of our academic conduct code have occurred,'' Yudof said 
during a news conference. ``We thought it's time for a management 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins will step down June 30, three years before his contract  
was to expire. He compiled a 240-165 record in 13 seasons, 
including a trip to the NCAA tournament Final Four in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has been under pressure since March, when former tutor  
Jan Gangelhoff said she did more than 400 pieces of course work for 
at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March, the investigation has widened to include  
accusations of improper payments, travel irregularities and 
improper relationships between the team and university police 
investigating possible crimes involving players. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins asserted his innocence when the scandal broke on the eve  
of the Gophers' first-round NCAA game against Gonzaga. Four players 
were made ineligible for that game, which Minnesota lost. 
</P>
<P>
	He has maintained since then that he had no knowledge of  
wrongdoing. Phone calls to his suburban Minneapolis house Friday 
afternoon went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins issued a brief statement saying he had been honored to  
coach the Gophers and would continue to support them. The statement 
made no mention of the allegations or investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim reports from investigators make it ``extremely likely  
there will be numerous findings of academic fraud, primarily and 
entirely connected to the writing of papers for students,'' Yudof 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no evidence links Haskins to fraud, ``it is clear that  
public confidence in the academic integrity of the university has 
been eroded by the allegations. In order to restore that public 
confidence, a change in leadership is warranted,'' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university is expected to report on its investigation to the  
NCAA in September. Yudof said earlier this week that the university 
was likely to sanction itself if its investigation showed ``slam 
dunk'' wrongdoing. Enforcement records show the NCAA generally is 
less harsh on universities that deal decisively with rule-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof acknowledged that people, including Gangelhoff, say  
Haskins knew about academic cheating by players. But he said ``when 
it comes to direct, provable evidence today -- maybe not for all 
time, but for today -- that evidence does not exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a matter of decency and fairness, Yudof said, he felt the  
university should honor Haskins' contract. The buyout will be paid 
for with money from the men's athletics department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Haskins established an ``enviable record'' as coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has communicated to his players the goals of playing hard,  
working hard to achieve career goals, respecting others -- including 
opponents -- and becoming honorable men,'' Yudof said. ``The 
university is grateful for the 13 years of service coach Haskins 
has provided, and we wish him a future of success and good 
health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' fate apparently was decided this week after two  
critical meetings within 24 hours at his home. He met Tuesday for 
three hours with independent investigators Michael Glazier and 
Donald Lewis. On Wednesday, Haskins and his lawyer, Ron Zamansky, 
met with Yudof and university counsel Mark Rotenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction from Haskins' peers was sorrow.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today I feel that the Big Ten has lost a very good coach and a  
friend,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ``I wish him nothing 
but the best in his future plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Dutcher, who resigned as Minnesota coach in 1986 after three  
of his players were arrested on suspicion of rape, said he knows 
how hard it is to leave a program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never take joy in anyone else's misery and I know Clem is  
a very proud guy and I know he took pride in his program so I know 
this hurts him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Lord, a lawyer for several people who have alleged  
wrongdoing in Minnesota athletics, called the buyout ``bad public 
policy'' without considering a challenge to Haskins' contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He orchestrated the scandal and in return they stuffed his  
pocket so full of money he has to waddle out of Williams Arena,'' 
Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. John Marty also said he was disappointed at the  
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's innocent of wrongdoing don't get rid of them,  
period,'' Marty said. ``But if they did something wrong, paying a 
million and a half bucks to push him out of the way is really 
unfortunate. It sends a bad signal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins had three years left on a 10-year contract he signed in  
1994, retroactive to the 1992-93 season, that contained provisions 
that several legal experts have described as rare for college 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract ensured Haskins about $423,000 even if the  
university could prove a just-cause firing, and the terms would 
have made that process difficult and slow. If Haskins were 
terminated without cause, the contract entitled him to about $1.3 
million plus several hundred thousand dollars in benefits.

<HEADLINE>  Clapton Auctions Guitars for Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Slowhand was a fast mover on the auction block.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Clapton, parting with some of his favorite possessions in  
the name of drug rehabilitation, raised more than $5 million for 
charity Thursday in an auction of 100 guitars. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz at Christie's was that only 99 of the instruments  
actually wound up in the hands of strangers. Clapton himself was 
believed interested in getting one guitar back, a 1930 Gibson L-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's declined to confirm whether Clapton did in fact bid  
on the guitar, which he had been quoted as saying is a ``very 
personal'' instrument he used at home rather than in the studio or 
on the road.

<P>
	It went to an unidentified buyer for $57,500 -- a sum that didn't

<HEADLINE> Boeing Notes Cause of Failed Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A breach in an engine combustion  
chamber likely was responsible for the failure of Boeing's new 
Delta III rocket in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's investigation into the accident, which left a  
communication satellite in a useless orbit, is still ongoing. But 
the chairman of the investigation team, Russell Reck, said Friday 
that a breach in the combustion chamber most likely caused the 
second-stage engine to prematurely shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight data indicates a shock occurred just after the engine  
ignited for the first time. A much bigger shock occurred right 
after the engine reignited; engineers believe the turbo machinery 
briefly rotated, then stopped because of the shock. The rocket then 
began tumbling, Reck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 4 failure was the second in a row for Boeing's Delta III  
rocket. In its August 1998 debut, the rocket blew up 71 seconds 
after liftoff because of a faulty computer program.

<HEADLINE> Red Bow Tie Wins Haughton Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Red Bow Tie ran away from the field  
down the stretch to win the $600,000 William Haughton Memorial Pace 
by 4 1/4 lengths Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old son of Raging Glory, trained by Monte Gelrod and  
driven by Luc Ouellette, took the lead early in the backstretch, 
held off a challenge by Tune Town just after the three-quarter pole 
and then pulled away from B.J.'s Whirlwind and Bad Bert to win in 
1:48 2-5 at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The time was Red Bow Tie's best ever for a mile but was shy of  
the stakes record of 1:47 3-5 set by Jenna's Beach Boy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning the richest race of the season for older pacers, Red  
Bow Tie increased his career earnings for owner Cliff Siegel of TLP 
Stables to $1,883,163. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Bow Tie, the 1998 Pacer of the Year, has won six of 10 races  
this year. He went off at 4-5 odds and paid $3.60, $3 and $2.10. 
B.J.'s Whirlwind paid $6.20 and $3.20, while Bad Bert paid $2.60 to 
show.

<HEADLINE> Hot Sprewell Goes Cold at End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the end, it wasn't the unbelievable string of  
shots that Latrell Sprewell made but the two he missed that the New 
York Knicks will remember all summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell went on a second-half tear, scoring 14 straight points  
at one point Friday night, trying to singlehandedly keep the Knicks 
alive in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the game hanging in the balance, the Knicks went to  
their hot shooter twice and each time Sprewell missed as San 
Antonio hung on for a 78-77 victory that clinched the Spurs' first 
NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell finished with 35 points in a gallant one-man show that  
simply fell a little short at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ironic that Sprewell, who did not start for New York  
until the playoffs, turned out to be the player the Knicks were 
depending on to keep their season going. 
</P>
<P>
	And for a long time, he seemed perfectly capable of doing it all  
by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hitting shots from all over the floor, driving dunks,  
long-range jumpers, even a 3-pointer that gave New York the lead 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Spurs caught the Knicks at 68, Sprewell turned passer,  
setting up Marcus Camby for a clutch three-point play. Then Camby 
followed with another basket for five straight points -- the only 
ones that Sprewell didn't score for New York in the final 12 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	So it stood to reason that when New York needed one more basket  
in the final minute, Sprewell was the shooter they went to. Both 
times, he came close. Both times, the shots missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell finished 13-of-27 from the field and 8-for-10 from the  
foul line. He led New York with 10 rebounds, had a couple of steals 
and a couple of assists. 
</P>
<P>
	And at the worst time, he also had a couple of misses.

<HEADLINE> Some Pilots Said To Doze on Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some pilots for American Airlines have dozed  
off while flying their passenger jets, according to a report 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	Union documents obtained by USA Today say the company's policy  
on rest forces some pilots to fly without adequate sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the alleged incidents, an unidentified pilot was  
unexpectedly called to work last year to fly to Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot says he ``faded fast'' while cruising over Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I woke up, I looked over at the captain. He was sound  
asleep. I estimate we were both asleep for 30 minutes,'' the pilot 
says in the report prepared by the Allied Pilots Association and 
sent to American. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the airlines, Chris Chiames, told the newspaper  
the union claims are ``complete nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incidents like those included in the union documents will be  
investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration in a review of 
American's flight operations. The probe was prompted by the 
airline's June 1 crash in Little Rock, Ark., FAA spokesman Paul 
Turk said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board is also looking at  
possible pilot fatigue. The flight crew of the jet had worked more 
than 13 hours before the fatal crash.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Unfazed by Kosovo Revenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he's not  
surprised that ethnic Albanians are engaging in revenge attacks on 
Serbs ``after what they've been through,'' but he said NATO is 
doing its best to stop the violence as refugees return home. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference that lasted more than an hour, Clinton  
brushed off questions about what history will say about him. ``I'll 
be remembered when I'm gone. Right now I'm not gone,'' said the 
second U.S. president to be impeached. ``I've got lots to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to turn attention from the war in Kosovo to battles in  
Congress, Clinton challenged what he cast as a do-nothing 
Republican Congress to approve his proposals for Medicare, 
Medicaid, gun control, Social Security, education, child care and 
campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	He fielded questions ranging from agriculture policy to race  
relations in the United States to violence in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Relaxed and chatty throughout his first news conference since  
March 19, Clinton saved his most emotional outburst for a question 
about reconstruction aid to Serbia. He warned that the Serbian 
people must ``come to grips'' with the leadership of President 
Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have to decide whether they think it's OK that all  
those tens of thousands of people were killed and all those 
hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes and all 
those little girls were raped and all those little boys were 
murdered,'' Clinton said, thumping the lectern. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if they think it's OK, they can make that decision. But I  
won't give them one red cent for reconstruction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton said ethnic Albanians must stop acts  
of retribution against Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is not letting it happen,'' the president said. ``We're  
doing what we can to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO's appeals, ethnic Albanians torched Serb houses in  
western Kosovo Thursday and looted Serb-owned shops in the capital 
of Pristina. Tens of thousands of returning refugees are pouring 
into Kosovo, overwhelming aid workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lawlessness, Clinton said, ``I'm concerned about  
it. I'm not particularly surprised after what they've been 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the 2000 presidential campaign well under way, Clinton  
wants to stave off suggestions that he is a lame-duck president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to be working right up to the very end,'' he said.  
Yet he acknowledged: ``The closer you get to the election the more 
difficult it will be to pass anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He twice praised Hillary Rodham Clinton for her efforts on  
domestic policy, a nod to her all-but-official campaign for the 
Senate. And he defended her against criticism for using 
taxpayer-provided planes for political trips to New York, saying 
the first lady takes the issue ``seriously'' but the Secret Service 
dictates much of her travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Monica Lewinsky scandal will not hurt his wife's  
political ambitions or the presidential campaign of his vice 
president, Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``All elections are about the future and all candidates are  
judged on their own merits,'' he said. ``I think that the American 
people know the country is in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, safeguard the Social Security surplus 
for improving that program and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., joined by dozens of 
rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to craft a tax  
cut next month, and likely will include provisions to repeal to 
so-called marriage penalty, eliminate the estate tax and possibly 
cut the capital-gains tax. In addition, there has been talk of 
making more income taxable at the rate of 15 percent, rather than 
28 percent, a step that would cut taxes for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Responded Clinton: ``I'm not against tax cuts.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, what kind of tax cuts? Who benefits from it?  
How should it be designed? And how should it be handled to make 
sure we take care of'' Social Security and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	His toughest comments were reserved for Republicans on gun  
control. ``We can't expect young people to stand up to violence 
when Congress won't stand up to the gun lobby.'' Calling it a moral 
issues, Clinton promised to veto any weak gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said opposition to closing loopholes on gun show sales  
because background checks would be inconvenient is wrongheaded. 
``When people see inconvenience elevated over the lives of the 
child, I think that causes them problems,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised that his long-delayed report on race would be  
published soon, saying it was delayed because he has been

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Unfazed by Kosovo Revenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he's not  
surprised that ethnic Albanians are engaging in revenge attacks on 
Serbs ``after what they've been through,'' but he said NATO is 
doing its best to stop the violence as refugees return home. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference that lasted more than an hour, Clinton  
brushed off questions about what history will say about him. ``I'll 
be remembered when I'm gone. Right now I'm not gone,'' said the 
second U.S. president to be impeached. ``I've got lots to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to turn attention from the war in Kosovo to battles in  
Congress, Clinton challenged what he cast as a do-nothing 
Republican Congress to approve his proposals for Medicare, 
Medicaid, gun control, Social Security, education, child care and 
campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	He fielded questions ranging from agriculture policy to race  
relations in the United States to violence in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Relaxed and chatty throughout his first news conference since  
March 19, Clinton saved his most emotional outburst for a question 
about reconstruction aid to Serbia. He warned that the Serbian 
people must ``come to grips'' with the leadership of President 
Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have to decide whether they think it's OK that all  
those tens of thousands of people were killed and all those 
hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes and all 
those little girls were raped and all those little boys were 
murdered,'' Clinton said, thumping the lectern. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if they think it's OK, they can make that decision. But I  
won't give them one red cent for reconstruction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton said ethnic Albanians must stop acts  
of retribution against Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is not letting it happen,'' the president said. ``We're  
doing what we can to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO's appeals, ethnic Albanians torched Serb houses in  
western Kosovo Thursday and looted Serb-owned shops in the capital 
of Pristina. Tens of thousands of returning refugees are pouring 
into Kosovo, overwhelming aid workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lawlessness, Clinton said, ``I'm concerned about  
it. I'm not particularly surprised after what they've been 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the 2000 presidential campaign well under way, Clinton  
wants to stave off suggestions that he is a lame-duck president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to be working right up to the very end,'' he said.  
Yet he acknowledged: ``The closer you get to the election the more 
difficult it will be to pass anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He twice praised Hillary Rodham Clinton for her efforts on  
domestic policy, a nod to her all-but-official campaign for the 
Senate. And he defended her against criticism for using 
taxpayer-provided planes for political trips to New York, saying 
the first lady takes the issue ``seriously'' but the Secret Service 
dictates much of her travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Monica Lewinsky scandal will not hurt his wife's  
political ambitions or the presidential campaign of his vice 
president, Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``All elections are about the future and all candidates are  
judged on their own merits,'' he said. ``I think that the American 
people know the country is in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, safeguard the Social Security surplus 
for improving that program and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., joined by dozens of 
rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to craft a tax  
cut next month, and likely will include provisions to repeal to 
so-called marriage penalty, eliminate the estate tax and possibly 
cut the capital-gains tax. In addition, there has been talk of 
making more income taxable at the rate of 15 percent, rather than 
28 percent, a step that would cut taxes for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Responded Clinton: ``I'm not against tax cuts.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, what kind of tax cuts? Who benefits from it?  
How should it be designed? And how should it be handled to make 
sure we take care of'' Social Security and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	His toughest comments were reserved for Republicans on gun  
control. ``We can't expect young people to stand up to violence 
when Congress won't stand up to the gun lobby.'' Calling it a moral 
issues, Clinton promised to veto any weak gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said opposition to closing loopholes on gun show sales  
because background checks would be inconvenient is wrongheaded. 
``When people see inconvenience elevated over the lives of the 
child, I think that causes them problems,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised that his long-delayed report on race would be  
published soon, saying it was delayed because he has been 
preoccupied by Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do this right,'' Clinton said. ``It's got to be,  
first of all, mine. It's got to reflect what I believe and where I 
think we need to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed his case for extending prescription drug coverage to  
elderly Americans, even though expanding Medicare would be ``a lot 
more expensive than rosy scenarios suggest.'' He promised a 
specific proposal next week.

	``I don't think there's any alternative here,'' he said, calling  
prescription drug coverage ``the most significant health care need 
that senior citizens have today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would press for campaign finance changes, raising the  
``discomfort level'' on critics blocking reforms.

<HEADLINE> Fiberglass Workers Reject Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- For the third time in four years, more  
than 1,100 fiberglass plant workers turned down the opportunity to 
become members of the Teamsters union, according to election 
returns today. 
</P>
<P>
	A huge labor victory at Fieldcrest Cannon plants in nearby  
Kannapolis and Salisbury earlier in the week apparently failed to 
sway workers at PPG Industries, who voted against joining Teamsters 
Local 391 by a vote of 594-553, or 52 percent to 48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There were only 17 challenged votes, so the outcome wouldn't be  
altered if the unofficial results stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty disappointed. I knew it would be close,'' said  
Terry Temple, who wore a black Local 391 T-shirt as he gathered 
with other pro-union workers outside the sprawling plant's front 
gate to await the results Friday morning. ``We really had our hopes 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Balloting began Thursday at the plant and ended Friday. Local  
391 organizer Steve Jones said no decision has been made on whether 
objections will be filed with the National Labor Relations Board, 
which will certify the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Cameron, manager of human resources for PPG Industries,  
said, ``After carefully considering all the facts, our associates 
were convinced for the second consecutive year that being 
represented by the Teamsters union was not in their best 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, the hourly workers rejected representation by the  
Greensboro-based local by a vote of 601-576. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NLRB ordered a new election after the panel said PPG  
management used security cameras to monitor union supporters 
distributing pro-union handbills and threatened that a vote for the 
union would result in the sale of the plant. PPG denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters also lost a 1995 election at the plant.  
</P>
<P>
	Heath and safety issues and pension benefits remain the top  
issues with employees, rather than wages, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said this week's historic union victory at six Fieldcrest  
Cannon plants in nearby Cabarrus and Rowan counties gave union 
supporters a feeling that perhaps history could be repeated in 
Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	By a razor-thin margin, Fieldcrest Cannon workers voted for  
union representation in the fifth attempt in 25 years to be 
organized by the Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile 
Employees, or UNITE.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower, Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- profit-taking Friday in slim trading. Japanese  
share prices also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.52 yen by late afternoon, down 0.38 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 121.78 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 121.31 yen 
to 122.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 191.80 points,  
or 1.09 percent, to close at 17,436.52. On Thursday, the average 
closed up 41.57 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, there was no clear agreement on the  
direction for the dollar, causing most players to stay on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many Japanese exporters who want to sell the dollar  
for profit-taking near 122 yen,'' said Takayuki Togawa, manager of 
foreign exchange at Tokai Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar was being supported in the other direction by  
lingering fears of interventions by the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened four times over the past  
two-week period to halt recent gains by the yen, which will hamper 
the Japanese economy's ability to recover from its worst recession 
since World War II. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in the market can be bold enough to continue selling  
dollars below 121.50 yen,'' said Tetsu Aikawa, senior trader at 
Sanwa Bank Ltd. ``Almost everyone thinks the BOJ will again step in 
below that level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 127.09 yen, up from  
126.30 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors sold shares of banks and  
technology companies following the overnight steep fall in New 
York, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 132.03, or 1.2 
percent, to 10,534.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Exchange of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 1.72 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,409.41. The 
TOPIX closed up 1.95 points, or 0.14 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was about 468.4 million,  
down from 554.2 million the previous day. Retreating issues 
outnumbered advancers 822 to 371, while 131 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7700 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6950 
percent, driving its price down to 100.25 yen from 100.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> China Internet Co. To List on Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- An Internet provider partially owned by  
mainland China's state-run news agency said Friday it wants to 
raise $68 million with an initial public offering of stock next 
week in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com Corp. is a Hong Kong-based Chinese-language Internet  
provider offering web services, e-commerce and advertising for 
mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, major American Internet companies have sought  
to capitalize on China's growing population of Internet users, 
which so far totals 2.1 million. Bosses at China.com are hoping a 
stock offering that combines exposure to China and the Internet 
will prove interesting to American investors. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com said it has registered with the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission to sell more than 4.2 million shares at $14 to 
$16 each in the IPO on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The offer will be 
expanded by 637,050 if there is sufficient demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering is being underwritten by U.S. investment banks  
Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	The big shareholders in China.com include China's official  
Xinhua News Agency, which has 13.6 percent; Hong Kong-based New 
World Infrastructure, with 22.7 percent; and U.S. Internet provider 
America Online Inc., which plans to increase its stake to 25 
percent from 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., announced its additional investment  
in China.com today. AOL plans to launch an English- and 
Chinese-language service in Hong Kong later this year and the 
China.com deal ``represents a strengthening of our commitment'' to 
that service, said Bob Pittman, president and chief operating 
officer of AOL.

<HEADLINE> Reno Readies New Prosecutor Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the independent counsel law about to  
expire, Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department is 
ready to take over the job of appointing special prosecutors to 
investigate misconduct by high government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the department is putting finishing touches on new  
rules it will follow in naming special investigators. ``Our 
regulations will be ready by July 1,'' she said Thursday at her 
weekly news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The law that spawned Kenneth Starr's investigation of President  
Clinton and 20 other probes of high-level officials will expire 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	A few lawmakers are drafting legislation to revive the law, but  
most believe the statute will be allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
	One key Senate Republican has urged Congress to seize some  
authority over the naming of special prosecutors by making Justice 
Department rules for their appointment, conduct and removal subject 
to the approval of Congress and the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The department does not now need congressional approval to  
change its regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental  
Affairs Committee, said Tuesday that he plans to introduce the 
legislation in the next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to comment on the proposal, Reno said she wanted to  
work with Thompson and other lawmakers ``to address the concerns 
that have been raised,'' but asserted that appointing and removing 
special prosecutors should be left to the attorney general alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general gets held responsible for it one way or  
another,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the expiring law, independent counsels are appointed by a  
judicial panel after the attorney general determines that the law 
has been triggered. 
</P>
<P>
	New rules crafted by the Justice Department say the attorney  
general would appoint a special prosecutor when he or she 
determines that the investigation of a top government official 
presents a conflict of interest for the department. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an outline of the new regulations submitted to a  
House subcommittee, the prosecutor would be subject to budgetary 
and investigative limitations that do not exist under the 
independent counsel law, including the following: 
</P>
<P>
	--An annual budget would be submitted for the attorney general's  
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	--A progress report would be required at the end of the first  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some indictments might need the approval of the attorney  
general. 
</P>
<P>
	--The investigation would be limited to the issue that led to the  
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the expiring independent counsel law, prosecutors had  
broad powers and no limits on how much they could spend.

<HEADLINE> Peterson a Hit at JVC Jazz Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pianist Oscar Peterson continues to get stronger  
after a stroke he suffered in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, 73, one of the last giants of jazz, played at Carnegie  
Hall Thursday night as part of the JVC Jazz Festival. The 
performance came 50 years after his first appearance there at a 
1949 Jazz at the Philharmonic concert. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thursday's concert, he and his quartet stayed away from  
standard tunes. He played compositions of his own and tunes he 
didn't name. The audience, which gave several standing ovations, 
loved everything, though there was much cheering when he began 
``Satin Doll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson walked on stage without a cane. He used his left hand  
only occasionally but when he did, his playing was stronger than it 
was the last time he appeared at Carnegie. The hall swung even when 
he used only his powerful right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	He played ``Tranquil,'' which he composed after a trip to  
Brazil; the cooking, intricate, melodic ``Backyard Blues,'' which 
he wrote for his quartet; ``City Lights,'' which he composed for a 
Montreal ballet company; and ``When Summer Comes'' and ``Evening 
Song,'' which sounded sadly nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson is Canadian. His electric guitarist is Swedish, bassist  
Danish and drummer English. They tour the world and, as Peterson 
has always preferred, they play the entire concert, without an 
opening act. When people come to hear you, he used to tell Ella 
Fitzgerald, they should hear you, not somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson's was the third of three exhilarating nights in the  
last week of the JVC Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Anita O'Day, 79, exhibited her well-remembered  
feisty zest singing ``There Will Never Be Another You,'' ``Is You 
Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?'' and one of her signature songs, 
``Honeysuckle Rose.'' She gave the lie to her pronouncement that 
she isn't a great ballad singer with an exquisite ``Street of 
Dreams.'' However, her uptempo ``Lover Come Back to Me,'' which 
followed, in which she traded licks with drummer Jack Le Compte, 
was more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan Transfer concluded that show at Avery Fisher Hall,  
proving that they are tops in vocal harmonizing. They're engagingly 
polished without sounding slick. Tunes went from ``Moten's Swing,'' 
from the days after Count Basie joined the Bennie Moten Band in 
1929, to a definitive ``Route 66.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Hauser, founder of the quartet in 1969, relating bits of  
jazz history, said the Benny Goodman Band was trying to play 
popular music, which wasn't going over very well, at the Palomar 
Ballroom in Los Angeles in July 1935. Drummer Gene Krupa suggested, 
``If we're going down, let's go down doing our own music.'' They 
played ``King Porter Stomp,'' which Manhattan Transfer sang. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Krall and Joshua Redman were both thrilling Wednesday  
night at Carnegie Hall. Redman's quartet, which played first, 
varied dynamics, often in the same song. 
</P>
<P>
	They started with Redman's composition ``Chill.'' They  
transformed ``Eleanor Rigby'' into jazz with improvisations and 
much drumming. 
</P>
<P>
	Krall alternated playing piano and singing from the piano bench,  
in a style appreciated by all ages. She's young but knows jazz 
history, slipping occasional lines like one from Peggy Lee's ``Do 
Right'' into another song. Her demeanor is almost disdainful and 
her words are clipped so short they aren't all understood, but her 
overall effect charms.

<HEADLINE> Senate Doubtful on Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed constitutional amendment to protect  
the flag was only one or two Senate votes away from clearing 
Congress after a strong House vote of approval. But prospects for 
picking up those votes appeared slim. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third time in four years Thursday a flag desecration  
amendment sailed through the House on a 305-124 vote -- 19 more than 
the two-thirds needed. 
</P>
<P>
	But that two-thirds majority has proved elusive in the Senate:  
The amendment fell three votes short in 1995 and Senate leaders, 
facing another close defeat, didn't take it to the floor in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Senate supporters thought they had the votes, but were  
disappointed by the recent announcement by two undecided North 
Dakota Democrats, Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, that they 
preferred legislation to protect the flag rather than a 
constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the  
votes needed to defeat the amendment remained solid. 
</P>
<P>
	If the measure cleared Congress, it would probably quickly win  
ratification by three-fourths of the states, the last step before 
it became the 28th amendment to the Constitution. Forty-nine state 
legislatures have endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-word amendment states, ``The Congress shall have power to  
prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say it is needed to overcome two Supreme Court  
rulings: one in 1989 to strike down 48 state anti-desecration laws 
and one in 1990 to negate a law passed by Congress. The court 
argued that the laws violated First Amendment rights to free 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., the chief sponsor,  
said the amendment only addressed physical acts against the 
nation's unique symbol, and in no way infringed on the rights of 
Americans to express their opinions. ``Nothing in this prevents 
anyone from expressing themselves in writing, speech or any other 
way except for the desecration of the flag,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents argued that, with flag desecration a rarity, it  
was unwise to take a step that could chip away at free speech 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above Old Glory, above the symbol of our liberty, is our  
sacred Constitution,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ``The 
Constitution guarantees that we have the freedom to have political 
beliefs, and to express those beliefs openly.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Testimony Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Testimony in the landmark Microsoft Corp.  
antitrust trial ended after more than 20 weeks in the courtroom, a 
legal drama that afforded an unprecedented look at the nation's 
booming high-tech industry and the controversial company that 
dominates it. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial started, the sides have met several times in  
unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement, including a secret 
meeting about three weeks ago, one person close to the case said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Future talks are anticipated this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	The final witness, economist Richard Schmalensee of the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued forcefully that 
Microsoft isn't the entrenched monopolist that illegally wields 
extraordinary influence. The government portrayed it exactly that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft was clearly engaged in a broad pattern of illegal  
behavior,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel Klein told 
reporters Thursday. ``They used every trick in the monopolist's 
book. ... You name it, they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Houck of the New York attorney general's office, the  
lead lawyer for the 19 states suing with the Justice Department, 
described the company outside the courthouse as a ``malignant 
despot'' and said its behavior ``will justify a very significant 
remedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his testimony this week, Schmalensee buttressed his  
arguments by describing a raft of competitors on the company's 
horizon -- the $10 billion alliance between rivals America Online 
Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp., handheld computers and a 
new generation of software running across high-speed Internet 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	But in what became routine during the trial, the company's  
witness was challenged again in cross-examination by David Boies, 
the Justice lawyer whose tough questioning has sometimes inflicted 
upon Microsoft the courtroom equivalent of a computer system 
meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies produced handwritten notes from Microsoft's files quoting  
its billionaire chairman, Bill Gates -- ``BillG'' -- in December 
about the prospective threat from the new AOL-Netscape alliance, 
announced just weeks earlier along with an important agreement with 
Sun Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL doesn't have it in their genes to attack us in the  
platform space,'' said Gates, his comments once again appearing to 
undermine his company's legal arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schmalensee said he assessed the AOL threat from secret  
documents produced by AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	And Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara cited a late-breaking news  
report Thursday -- published just hours earlier -- that AOL was 
negotiating with a small company that makes computers that don't 
use Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system software. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say you haven't brought me current'' on industry  
developments, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although testimony ended this week, the judge may not issue a  
final verdict until after January. And the case could wind through 
appeals courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Using tens of thousands of pages of e-mails and other documents,  
the government sought to portray Microsoft as a cunning industry 
titan that illegally used its heft to undermine competing 
technologies and to discourage other companies from supporting its 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft responded that it competes roughly, but fairly, in a  
bare-knuckles industry with billions of dollars at stake. And it 
returned again and again to its argument that the government has 
failed to prove its actions hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence bore out both views, and also provided an intriguing  
glimpse beneath the veneer of the flashy high-tech industry. 
E-mails, handwritten notes from meetings and other paperwork 
revealed a take-no-prisoners business world where alliances are 
proposed, sealed and dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-founder of Netscape, Marc Andreessen, proposed combining  
forces with AOL in 1995 to ``kick the (expletive) out of the beast 
from Redmond,'' Microsoft's headquarters near Seattle. Sun's top 
executive, Scott McNealy, told employees to use his company's Java 
technology to ``charge, kill HP (Hewlett-Packard), IBM, Msft and 
Apple all at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates complained in e-mail that IBM executives were ``rabid Java  
backers,'' and in another message asked an employee bluntly: ``Do 
we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine 
Sun?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when AOL's chairman, Steve Case, wrote to Netscape's James  
Barksdale about a proposed relationship in 1995, the two portrayed 
themselves as the Allies of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, of course, was an Axis power.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we fight them together we can win, and what a victory it  
would be -- the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' Barksdale wrote to 
Case, calling him ``Franklin D.'' Barksdale was ``Josef Stalin,'' 
but he complained, ``I don't like playing this part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although more than two dozen experts and executives took the  
stand, the witness most likely to be remembered never set foot in 
the courthouse: Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, shown by government lawyers in a videotape of a pretrial  
deposition last summer, appeared so forgetful and evasive in that 
tape that even the judge told lawyers in a private meeting, ``I 
think it's evident to every spectator that, for whatever reasons, 
in many respects Mr. Gates has not been particularly responsive.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denominations and Gays' Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Most U.S. religious denominations bar sexually active gays and  
lesbians from the clergy but often accept homosexuals who are 
committed to celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
	These denominations include Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox,  
Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Evangelical Protestants and Orthodox 
and Conservative Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups are seriously divided:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In 1997, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) required  
heterosexual fidelity or ``chastity in singleness'' among members 
of the clergy. On Friday, church leaders rejected a measure that 
could have opened the door to the ordination of non-celibate gays 
and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The United Methodist Church's similar 1984 law may be  
challenged at next year's General Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	These denominations have open policies:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Episcopal Church: The 1991 General Convention said sex is  
``appropriate'' only within heterosexual marriage, but acknowledged 
some members disagree. Since a tribunal in 1996 acquitted a bishop 
who ordained an openly gay priest, each diocese in effect does what 
it wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reform Judaism: Openly homosexual rabbis have been ordained  
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Unitarian Universalist Association: Its 1980 convention called  
for ``full assistance'' in job placement for ``openly gay, lesbian 
and bisexual religious leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- United Church of Christ: The 1991 General Synod urged subunits  
to ``facilitate the ordination and placement of qualified lesbian, 
gay and bisexual candidates,'' without restrictions on same-sex 
activity.

<HEADLINE> Marino Jones Upset in Long Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Marion Jones' invincibility in the long jump  
is over. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning upset at the USA Outdoor Track and Field  
Championships on Friday night, Jones' two-year reign as national 
champion was ended by Dawn Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, the younger sister of Leroy Burrell, the former world  
record-holder at 100 meters, soared a career-best 22 feet, 10 
inches, in handing Jones her first defeat by an American since 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, competing in her first meet since spraining her right  
knee in a meet at Raleigh, N.C. on June 12, had a best of 22-3 on 
her first attempt and finished second. After fouling on her second 
try, Jones, who was leading, tried to protect the knee and not risk 
further injury by passing her next two jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Burrell burst into the lead in round five, Jones,  
ranked No. 1 in the world last year, rejoined the competition, but 
she couldn't match the leading jump. On her final two attempts, she 
leaped only 21-4 1/4 and 21-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, while running the 100, 200 and 400 meters and  
competing in the long jump, Jones lost only once in 37 meets, 
beaten by Germany's Heike Drechsler in the long jump in her final 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to put anything off on the knee,'' Jones said.  
``I felt very good today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be faced with that the rest of my career. I'm  
going to have to be able to pull it out in the end, and I didn't do 
that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Inger Miller, a member of the gold medal-winning 400  
relay team at the 1996 Olympics, won the women's 100 in a 
wind-aided 10.96 seconds, beating two-time Olympic gold medalist 
Gail Devers by .01 seconds, and Dennis Mitchell, who was banned 
last year after testing positive for a high level of testosterone, 
took the men's 100 in a wind-aided 9.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller used a late rush in the final 10 meters to overtake  
Devers, who was competing in the 100 for the first time in two 
years, following a series of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling to come back like this and run the way I  
did,'' Devers said. ``It helps to get my confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, the bronze medalist at the 1992 Olympics and fourth in  
1988 and 1996, normally would be sitting out a two-year ban after 
his positive test. But a USA Track &AMP; Field drug panel cleared him 
of the charges in December. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the sport's world governing body, the International  
Amateur Athletic Federation, has not yet exonerated him. His case 
will be heard by the IAAF on July 24. 
</P>
<P>
	If the federation votes against Mitchell, he could be barred  
from the World Championships at Seville, Spain, in August. Mitchell 
claims his high testosterone level was caused by beer and sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even begin to explain the emotional trauma I went  
through this year,'' the excitable Mitchell said. ``It hurt me to 
go out to the track knowing this could be all gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's other women's winners were Connie Price-Smith in the  
shot put at 61-10 1/2, her eighth consecutive title; Stacey Bowers in 
the triple jump at 44-9 3/4; and Shelia Burrell in the decathlon with 
6,101 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's champions were Adam Goucher in the 5,000 in 13:25.59,  
as he outkicked American record-holder Bob Kennedy down the 
stretch; Olympic gold medalist Charles Austin in the high jump at 
7-5 3/4; Lance Deal in the hammer throw at 263-7, the longest throw by 
an American this year; and Chris Huffins in the decathlon with 
8,350 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Price-Smith, winner of every national women's shot put title  
since 1992 and 10 overall, almost had her string ended. Going into 
the final throw of the competition, she was in second place, behind 
Teri Tunks' 61-8 1/4. She then beat Tunks by 2 1/4 inches, keeping alive 
the longest active streak at the outdoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowers, jumping into a strong headwind, produced her winning  
jump in the second round, as she added the national title to the 
NCAA championship she won for Baylor earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelia Burrell was in second place going into the final event of  
the seven-event, two-day competition, 37 points behind 1997-98 NCAA 
champion Tiffany Lott-Hogan. But Burrell overcame the deficit by 
winning the 800 meters in 2:11.82 for her first national heptathlon 
title. Lott-Hogan was fourth at 2:22.50 and wound up second with 
6,026 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Goucher and Kennedy waged a rousing two-man duel in the 5,000,  
before Goucher broke away over the final 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, winning his fifth consecutive high jump title, tried to  
break his Hayward Field record of 7-8, but missed three times at 
7-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal's victory gave him his second straight hammer throw title  
and seventh overall. A resident of Eugene, he was one of the most 
popular winners, receiving huge applause from the crowd. In return, 
Deal stopped and bowed to the stands during his victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins, capitalizing on the absence of world record-holder and  
Olympic champion Dan O'Brien for the second straight year, won his 
second consecutive title. He led all the way in the two-day, 
10-event competition.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Clinton Media Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from President Clinton's news conference Friday:  
</P>
<P>
        *ON SERBS AND ETHNIC ALBANIANS LIVING PEACEFULLY IN KOSOVO   	
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get the building blocks of security and the building  
blocks of reconstruction in place and the building blocks of civil 
society in place, then I think we need to be quite imaginative 
about the human, spiritual dimension of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Can it be done? I believe it can be done. It's going to take a  
lot of courage and it's going to take some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
           *ON SERBIAN PEOPLE AND PRESIDENT SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC   	
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have to decide whether they think it's OK that all  
those tens of thousands of people were killed and all those 
hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes and all 
those little girls were raped and all those little boys were 
murdered,'' Clinton said. ``And if they think it's OK, they can 
make that decision. But I won't give them one red cent for 
reconstruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *ON GUN CONTROL   	
</P>
<P>
	Clinton promised to veto any weak gun legislation. ``We can't  
expect young people to stand up to violence when Congress won't 
stand up to the gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *ON MEDICARE   	
</P>
<P>
	He pressed his case for extending prescription drug coverage to  
elderly Americans, even though expanding Medicare would be ``a lot 
more expensive than rosy scenarios suggest.'' He promised a 
specific proposal next week. ``I don't think there's any 
alternative here,'' he said, calling prescription drug coverage 
``the most significant health care need that senior citizens have 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
                         *ON HIS RACE REPORT   	
</P>
<P>
	Clinton promised that his long-delayed report on race would be  
published soon. ``I want to make sure that when we put this 
document out it is in the form of a book which can be useful and 
have something to say, and move the conversation and the efforts 
beyond where we were in the presidential initiative on race.'' 
</P>
<P>
                     *ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM   	
</P>
<P>
	``What I think we have to do is to keep it on the front burner  
enough so that the discomfort level rises high enough that an 
actual vote is allowed. All I've really asked for here is a vote. 
If we'd just get a vote on the bill, I will be very well-satisfied 
and I think it'll come out just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *ON TAX CUTS   	
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do is to make sure that before we go off and  
start cutting taxes by some arbitrary large amount, we take care of 
first things first. We need to know that we're going to modernize 
and strengthen Social Security for the 21st century, that we're 
going to modernize and strengthen Medicare for the 21st century, 
and that we're going to do it in a way that will enable us to 
continue to pay the debt down. There will still be money for a tax 
cut, and a sizable one.'' 
</P>
<P>
                        *ON THE REST OF HIS TERM   	
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to be working right up to the very end,'' Clinton  
said. Yet he acknowledged: ``The closer you get to the election the 
more difficult it will be to pass anything.''

<HEADLINE> NRC: Overtime Not a Safety Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has  
determined that overtime at nuclear power plants isn't jeopardizing 
safety. But Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who requested an agency 
review of plant staffing practices, accused the agency of sticking 
``its head in the sand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Markey and Democratic Reps. John Dingell of  
Michigan and Ron Klink of Pennsylvania, wrote to NRC Chairwoman 
Shirley Ann Jackson to request an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are writing in concern that low staffing levels and  
excessive staff overtime may present a serious safety hazard at 
some commercial nuclear plants in the United States,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers worried that fatigue caused by too few workers  
putting in too many hours could lead to operating errors. They did 
not identify plants where they thought safety could be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	They heard of possible overtime and staffing problems from  
whistleblowers. The issue of staffing and safety at the Byron 
nuclear plant in Illinois was also raised in a February article in 
Inside N.R.C., a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, in a letter dated May 18, but released Thursday, said  
the agency was addressing specific concerns raised about Byron. 
Otherwise, the few incidents at nuclear plants attributed to 
personnel fatigue ``were typically of limited safety 
significance,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all instances automated safety systems or other barriers  
were available to prevent any safety consequences,'' Jackson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, NRC inspectors identified ``several instances each year''  
in which a plant's use of overtime deviated from agency guidelines, 
Jackson said. But there again, in cases involving fatigue, ``the 
inspectors found that safety significance was limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC sets guidelines for controlling overtime at plants and  
allows deviations if plants can show that the changes won't 
compromise safety. There is no agency regulation limiting the use 
of overtime, and Jackson said the agency has no plans to routinely 
review plants' overtime use. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers said a congressional staff review of NRC data  
found showed 67 instances of personnel working in excess of 
working-hour guidelines without agency approval in the past two 
years, and an additional 42 instances in which approval was 
obtained after the overtime had been worked. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Johnson Withdraws From 200 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- The 200-meter showdown between Michael  
Johnson and Maurice Greene at the USA Outdoor Track and Field 
Championships was short circuited Friday night when Johnson 
withdrew because of an injury to his right quadriceps. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very disappointed,'' his agent, Brad Hunt, said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hunt and coach Clyde Hart said Johnson injured the leg Thursday  
doing the final sprint of his workout. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Johnson got a massage from his therapist, warmed up,  
then told Hart he could not compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it's major ... we don't think it's a long-term  
situation,'' Hart said. ``He was ready to run fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said that during the warmup Johnson ``tried running and he  
didn't feel comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't feel comfortable, I don't feel comfortable,''  
Hunt said. ``I said, `If you don't feel right, don't run.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wasn't running 100 percent. He said if he ran any  
faster, he might blow it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's injury destroyed what had been the most hyped race of  
the championships. The 200 heats and semifinals are Saturday, and 
the nationally televised final is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Johnson-Greene matchup had been eagerly anticipated, because  
Johnson is the world record-holder and Olympic champion at 200 
meters and Greene is coming off a sensational world record 
performance in the 100 last week at Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Johnson had met with the media, but never  
mentioned the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	That was because he wanted to test the leg again, before  
deciding whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
	This meet is the U.S. qualifier for the World Championships at  
Seville, Spain, in August, and Johnson had said that he was 
undecided whether to run the 200 or the 400. He has a bye in the 
400 because he is the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	By withdrawing from the national championships, the matter is  
now moot: He will run the 400, if healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said the injury could clear up in a few days or take  
several weeks, also jeopardizing Johnson's scheduled European meets 
next month. He had planned to run 400s at Lausanne, Switzerland; 
Linz, Austria; and Stockholm, Sweden, and a 200 at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Those meets, plus the USA Championships, he said, would help him  
decide which event to choose for the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has not run many 200s since his memorable world record  
of 19.32 seconds at the 1996 Olympics. A hip injury last year 
limited him to two 200s. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was eager to face Greene in a meaningful 200.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's special because I'm getting into a high-level 200,''  
Johnson said earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get back in there (in the 200). I'm excited.  
It's definitely more exciting when you have guys in there who are 
running well. 
</P>
<P>
	``So this race is very important to me. It's the first big 200  
for me since '96. I've been focusing on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown was being touted as similar to the heavyweight  
title fights between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier -- speed vs. 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid of anyone or anything,'' said Johnson, the  
Olympic gold medalist at 200 and 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 31, said the emergence of the 24-year-old Greene, who  
was clocked in 9.79 for the 100 last week at Athens, was ``great 
for the sport. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not surprised at the 100 record,'' he added. ``The  
record was soft. Now, it's great that he has taken such a big chunk 
(.05 seconds) off the record. When they've broken the 100-meter 
record, it's usually been by one-hundredth or two-hundredths of a 
second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Johnson's remaining goals is breaking Butch Reynolds' 400  
world record of 43.29, which has stood for 11 years. Johnson has 
come close, with times of 43.39, 43.44 and 43.49. 
</P>
<P>
	His dominance of the 400 has worked against him in his attempts  
at the record. The way he has overpowered the opposition so easily 
leaves him little competition, forcing him to go for the record on 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been that way for a while,'' he said. ``I'll probably  
have to break it when I'm not pushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 400 record is something I want badly.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- San Antonio's romp through the playoffs ended  
with a missed shot at the buzzer, a celebration on the floor of 
Madison Square Garden and the first NBA title for the Spurs. San 
Antonio became the first of the old ABA teams to win the

at least 20 people may have been killed in one house alone. The 
American group, including 56 FBI agents and support staff, has 
begun working at two locations along a street to gather evidence 
that could be used to prosecute Milosevic and Yugoslav leaders 
before the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Safety is an 
issue. Although American troops are guarding the sites themselves, 
some of the team wore bulletproof vests as they worked.

abandoned homes Friday afternoon. About a score more -- belonging to 
Serbs and Gypsies -- had gone up in flames in the previous 24 hours. 
The Serb exodus came as ethnic Albanian refugees streamed back into

Serbs during the war, several to discover the burned corpses of

New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, is closing in on the vice president. 
Bush expects to report at least $20 million in fund raising on the 
next round of federal campaign finance reports, campaign spokesman 
David Beckwith said. Gore will have raised $15 million to $18 
million by the end of June, a campaign aide said. Bradley is 
expected to have raised more than $10 million, according to a

Holocaust memorial in Berlin remembering the 6 million Jews killed 
under the Nazis. On Friday, after more than four hours of debate, 
parliament authorized a monument and approved a design by New York 
architect Peter Eisenman, a defining moment in a decade of national 
soul-searching. The parliament's vote opens the way for 
groundbreaking next year on Eisenman's design, a vast field of 
2,700 concrete pillars on a plot about the size of two football 
fields in the heart of Berlin. An exhibition and multimedia

<HEADLINE> Longtime Soap `Another World' Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For two-thirds of her life, Fran Beauregard  
turned on the tube just about every day at 2 p.m. sharp to watch 
``Another World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old mother raised her three kids through thousands  
of episodes of the soap opera. On Friday, she was seeing her TV 
family for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	After 35 years, ``Another World'' is going off the air.  
</P>
<P>
	While most of New York City was working, a crowd of diehards  
gathered at a restaurant to watch the 8,891st -- and last -- 
installment on a giant-screen television and a handful of smaller 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
	A box of tissues graced each table, and they were well used.  
</P>
<P>
	Tears streamed as a massive gorilla broke up the long-awaited  
wedding between Cass and Lila, who eventually married later in the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to see them happy, finally!'' said a sniffling  
Mrs. Beauregard, a homemaker from Seymour, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	She sat transfixed, her hands locked anxiously as she awaited  
each moment that followed ads for diapers, toothpaste and shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd mobbed and cheered a half dozen stars from the soap as  
they entered the eatery, called Blondie's. Mrs. Beauregard caught 
sight of Jonathan Sharp -- who played Sergei -- and rushed up for a 
delicate kiss on the lips from the blond hunk in a silver shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp plans to audition for other TV gigs and record a pop music  
CD, but he and others from the cast will surely miss the regular 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also back to harder times for Taylor Stanley, who played  
Remy, a young woman who was saved from the streets. Ms. Stanley is 
bartending again while preparing to appear in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other ``Another World'' actors are luckier, moving on to  
other daytime shows, including ``As the World Turns'' and ``Guiding 
Light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for AW's fans, there's just no substitute.  
</P>
<P>
	Bob O'Konis, a machinist for a jet engine company, said he began  
watching ``Another World'' as a kid and thinks it stinks that the 
network is bagging it for ``Passions,'' appealing to a younger 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation is so repulsive to attorney Rosalie Friedberg  
that she said she ``will never watch an NBC show again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	For at least one person at Blondie's, life itself won't be the  
same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acting on 'Another World' has meant everything to me. I made a  
lot of friends,'' said Spencer Treat Clark, 11, who played Steven. 
He thumped his hand over his heart and said the show will ``always 
be right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Beauregard, television will never be the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``C'mon, 'Passions' isn't going to have it,'' she said. ``What  
they're going for now is fighting and sex -- ladies taking off their 
bras and getting into bed.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Sign Kerney in 5-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons moved quickly to sign their  
top draft pick, agreeing today to a five-year contract with 
defensive end Patrick Kerney of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerney, the 30th overall selection, received a contract  
averaging about $1 million a year in base salary plus incentive 
clauses, as well as a signing bonus of more than $1 million, 
according to his agent, Tony Agnone. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Agnone nor the NFC champion Falcons would reveal the  
specific value of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerney, expected to be a backup for Chuck Smith and Lester  
Archambeau, was eager to work out a contract. He already has been 
participating in the Falcons' offseason program in preparation for 
training camp, which opens July 28 in Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to play games with this,'' Kerney said. ``I  
wanted a contract that was fair for both sides so I could get on 
with football.''

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jesse Orosco, the Baltimore Orioles'  
left-handed relief specialist, pitched in his 1,051st game Friday 
night, breaking Kent Tekulve's record for career appearances by a 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco, 42, a 20-year veteran, was summoned by Orioles manager  
Ray Miller with one out in the eighth inning to protect an 8-7 
Baltimore lead over the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco surrendered a game-tying single to Bernie Williams and  
got Paul O'Neill on a grounder to shortstop. He then issued an 
intentional walk to Chili Davis before being lifted in favor of 
right-hander Mike Timlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco has pitched in 1,055 games, 16 short of the record held  
by Dennis Eckersley. Orosco's 30 appearances this season lead the 
Orioles.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Benefit Concert Criticized </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- No one told Michael Jackson to beat  
it, though there was scattered criticism about his concert here 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 54,000 fans from South Korea, Japan and neighboring  
Asian countries flocked to Olympic Stadium for the four-hour 
extravaganza, a benefit show for needy children. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people said ticket prices -- up to $250 a seat -- were too  
high in the face of the nation's economic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Other groups, including a Korean War veterans association, noted  
that the concert fell on the 49th anniversary of the breakout of 
the Korean War, a day they said should be observed quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no protests around the stadium, though 1,500 police  
officers were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other guest entertainers included Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men,  
violinist Vanessa Mae and actor Steven Seagal.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 17.73  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today as investor  
optimism about second-quarter earnings gave way to nagging concerns 
about interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 
17.73 at 10,552.56 after having risen more than 115 points earlier 
in the session. The blue-chip index shed 303 points during the 
week, as investors worried about interest rates and corporate 
profits. Broader market indicators were mostly lower today. The 
Nasdaq composite index fell 8.32 to 2,545.67. While most sectors 
were mixed in the absence of major corporate news, some individual 
stocks flourished. One was a big new initial public offering: 
Juniper Networks Inc., a provider of Internet infrastructure, 
tripled in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

	GDP Grows at 4.3 Percent Annual Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strong consumer spending helped the U.S.  
economy grow at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first three 
months of the year despite a trade deficit swollen by overseas 
financial troubles. The Commerce Department said today the increase 
in the gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and 
services -- from January through March was slightly better than the 
4.1 percent rate estimated a month ago. The 0.2 percentage point 
improvement reflected a slight revision in the trade deficit, 
which, while still at record levels, was $6.5 billion lower than 
the government estimated previously.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes dropped 4 percent in  
May -- the second consecutive monthly decline after hitting an 
all-time high in March. The drop occurred as mortgage rates were on 
the rise. The National Association of Realtors said today that 
sales of existing single-family homes fell in May to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million units -- the lowest level in 
six months but a sizable improvement over the figure for May of 
last year. This year's May dip affected all regions.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- IBM stock was up today, a day after it

10 percent of its Northern California workforce. The jobs are being 
eliminated in preparation for moving most of its server disk drive 
business to Japan and Mexico. The company's Storage Systems 
Division will remain headquartered in San Jose, with a focus on 
research and development of new storage technologies and high-end 
disk drive design. ``Wherever possible, we'll try to match folks

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com today named Joseph Galli its new  
president and chief operating officer. Galli, 41, quit his job as 
president of Black &AMP; Decker's power tools business in April. During 
his 19 years there, Galli's department had grown to $3.1 billion 
and represented nearly 70 percent of the company's sales. The job 
at Amazon, the world's top Internet bookseller, is a new one. 
Amazon.com stock was down 2 7/8 at 110 3/4. Amazon.com stock was at 110

	Fiberglass Workers Reject Union  
</P>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- For the third time in four years, more  
than 1,100 fiberglass plant workers turned down the opportunity to 
become members of the Teamsters union, according to election 
returns today. A huge labor victory at Fieldcrest Cannon plants in 
nearby Kannapolis and Salisbury earlier in the week apparently 
failed to sway workers at PPG Industries, who voted against joining 
Teamsters Local 391 by a vote of 594-553, or 52 percent to 48 
percent. There were only 17 challenged votes, so the outcome 
wouldn't be altered if the unofficial results stand.

	Damages Denied to Ex-BCCI Employees

	LONDON (AP) -- A judge ruled today that former employees of the  
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were not 
entitled to damages for the stigma of having worked for a dishonest 
employer. High Court Justice Gavin Lightman ruled that BCCI, closed 
down by the Bank of England in 1991 owing its creditors nearly $6 
billion, breached an implied term in employees' contracts that they 
could have ``trust and confidence'' in their employer. But he said 
the former employees had not established that the breach had cost 
them money by blighting their career prospects.

	Serbs Flee Violence in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Frightened Serbs across Kosovo fled  
today as their houses blazed after being ransacked by ethnic 
Albanians. In a sign of continuing unrest, U.S. Marines on patrol 
came under fire in Gnjilane and killed one person while returning 
fire, a NATO spokesman said. Only half of the NATO peacekeepers 
have arrived, and those who have are struggling to restore order in 
the troubled province after more than a year of clashes. NATO 
forces reported unrest throughout most of Kosovo's major cities and 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees described the situation in 
one northern city as a ``ticking time bomb.''

Resendez-Ramirez for being in this country illegally and deported 
him to Mexico, but said they were unaware he was wanted for 
questioning in any killings. Four of the eight slayings linked to 
Resendez-Ramirez have happened since he was taken into custody in

the Labor Department reported today. Of the 2.8 million students 
who graduated from high school in 1998, about 1.8 million, or 65.6 
percent, were attending college in October. In 1997, a record 67 
percent of the young people flocked to college. The enrollment rate

rebuild the demolished installations, damage to newly revived hopes 
for Middle East peace may prove far more difficult to repair. The 
Israeli raids late yesterday and early today killed nine Lebanese 
and wounded 57, according to hospital, police and newspaper 
casualty figures. The attacks were in response to a rocket attack 
by Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas early yesterday which injured 
five people.

other place he would rather be. Van Gundy said his assurances came 
from club president Dave Checketts. Van Gundy's job was in jeopardy 
when the Knicks nearly failed to make the playoffs, but they went 
on a roll and became the first eighth-seeded team to advance past 
the second round. They trail the San Antonio Spurs 3-1 in the NBA 
Finals, with Game 5 tonight.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise a Bit; Dow Up 53.19 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today as a report on the U.S.  
economy lifted investor optimism about second-quarter earnings, but 
concerns over higher interest rates kept major market indexes from 
taking flight. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 53.19 at 10,588.02. The Dow was more than 100 points higher 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were also higher, although the Nasdaq  
composite index was struggling to stay in positive territory. The 
Nasdaq was up 2.59 to 2,556.58 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
was up 3.34 at 1,319.12. 
</P>
<P>
	With investors nervous about interest rates and corporate  
profits, the Dow fell 132.03 on Thursday, and had lost 320 points 
for the week going into today's session. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices moved higher today after a Commerce Department report  
that the U.S. economy grew at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter, slightly better than the 4.1 percent estimated in 
May. The brisker than expected economy could stir inflation fears, 
or it could be seen propelling second-quarter corporate earnings. 
The market seemed to choose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve next week is expected to raise interest  
rates in an effort to slow the economy and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	An improvement in the bond market also lifted stocks today. The  
Treasury's 30-year bond carried a yield of 6.14 percent, down from 
late Thursday's 6.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech and drug stocks that had been depressed by the recent  
selloff were among the big gainers. IBM rose 1 3/4 to 124 5/16 and 
Microsoft rose 13/16 to 85 7/16. Pfizer rose 9/16 to 101 15/16 and 
Merck picked up 13/16, rising to 69 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin, which announced plans to sell $1 billion in  
assets, rose 1 1/8 to 36 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a light 413.22 
million shares, down from Thursday's pace. Many traders have 
refrained all week from making big commitments one way or another 
before the Fed's Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.02 at 624.99, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.06 at 770.21.

<HEADLINE> Fred Trump, Donald Trump's Dad, Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frederick Trump, who amassed an unglamorous  
fortune constructing apartments and then watched his ambitious son 
Donald build the family business into a glitzy real-estate empire, 
died Friday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Trump had been hospitalized at Long Island Jewish  
Medical Center in New Hyde Park for pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, the son of a Swedish immigrant restaurant owner and a  
seamstress, began building and selling one-family homes in Queens 
when he was 19, and eventually made millions on luxury houses and 
high-rises in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald, the fourth of Fred and Mary Trump's five children,  
joined the family real estate firm after earning his undergraduate 
degree at the Wharton School in 1968 and learned the art of the 
deal from his hard-driving dad. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in his early 20s, Donald pushed his father to borrow money  
to expand their already impressive holdings -- about 24,000 homes 
and apartments in New York by the early 1970s, and buildings in New 
Jersey and Florida. He also set his sights on Manhattan, which Fred 
Trump had avoided as too risky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave Donald free rein,'' Fred Trump explained later. ``He  
has great vision and everything he touches seems to turn to gold. 
... Donald is the smartest person I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald credited much of his success to his father's example.  
</P>
<P>
	Fred Trump is survived by his wife, Mary MacLeod Trump; two  
sons, Donald and Robert; two daughters, Maryanne, a federal judge, 
and Elizabeth, a banker; seven grandchildren, and three 
great-grandchildren. A third son, Fred Trump Jr., died in 1981 at 
age 42.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Promise: No Ewing in Game 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- For New York Knicks fans, there will be no  
Willis Reedlike appearance for Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy dismissed that possibility today, saying  
his star center will remain sidelined for Game 5 of the NBA Finals 
tonight against the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willis Reed has a better chance of playing that Patrick  
does,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing has been sidelined since Game 2 of the Eastern Conference  
finals with a partially torn Achilles' tendon. The Knicks have 
repeatedly said Ewing is out for the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But that hasn't stopped people in New York from speculating that  
Ewing might pull off a surprise to rival Reed's unexpected return 
during the 1973 finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks trailed the San Antonio Spurs 3-1 entering Game 5.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy became irritated this morning after the team's  
shootaround when the Ewing question was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't believe me, you're just going to have to wait and  
see anyway. That's what I don't understand. You ask me the 
question, I say `no,' and you ask me again the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``So obviously you don't believe me, so you might as well wait.  
I'm not trustworthy enough to believe anyway,'' he said, 
sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, who missed several games during the regular season and  
was hampered during the Knicks' first 11 playoff games by Achilles' 
tendinitis, would be risking a career-ending torn Achilles' tendon 
if he tried to play. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been wearing a brace on the leg since doctors discovered  
the torn tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	During last year's playoffs, Ewing made a surprise return in  
Game 2 of the second round against Indiana after the Knicks said he 
was through for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said then it was a possibility, this is a different,'' Van  
Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wins Endorsement of Iowa Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore on Friday  
accepted the endorsement of the largest union representing Iowa 
state workers, a nod that could mobilize an army of organizers on 
his behalf for the important Iowa caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will always remember this,'' Gore told about 300 cheering  
labor leaders after collecting the formal endorsement of Council 61 
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies of former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley had pushed hard  
for union leaders to put off a decision. Instead, the union swung 
in early behind the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The union bargains for 23,000 state workers, has 12,000 active  
members and is perhaps the biggest single force in Iowa Democratic 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, after addressing 300 people at a $1,000-a-plate  
fund-raiser in Detroit, Gore dealt briefly with a Republican effort 
to widen a rift between him and another union, the United Auto 
Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned his work with Partnership for a New Generation of  
Vehicles, a joint venture between the government and major 
automakers to develop alternatives to the gasoline-powered engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican critics have tried to portray Gore as an  
environmental extremist who would discourage the availability of 
large vehicles that Americans are buying in large numbers. In 
March, the vice president was badgered by Iowa UAW members over his 
positions on trade and global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Iowa AFSCME endorsement, Gore picks up the clout of  
hundreds of experienced operatives adept at the mundane but 
essential details of putting together campaign organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	An elated Gore, casual in a polo shirt and slacks, plunged into  
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored and I am eager to get out there and win this race  
for the presidency,'' he said. ``You will take me all the way to 
the White House. I will always, always be there for working men and 
women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national AFSCME leadership had already backed Gore but left  
the Iowa decision to the state council. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also used the union event to introduce a new campaign video  
that stresses his rural roots but concedes ``he led two lives.'' 
Gore was criticized earlier for playing up his youthful summers in 
the country even while most of his childhood was spent in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Gore recently has been seeking some distance from  
President Clinton, the video features Clinton talking about why he 
picked Gore as his running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Council 61 president Jan Corderman said members were polled  
before the endorsement and 69 percent were favorably inclined 
toward Gore. In a matchup survey with Bradley, Gore's only rival 
for the Democratic nomination, 59 percent favored Gore and 22 
percent Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the vice president has been good for working  
families,'' said Corderman. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement gives Gore a cadre of experienced workers who  
understand how to run phone banks, door-knocking sweeps and car 
pools. Those tasks are at the heart of scoring well in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses open the presidential nominating season  
and those events demand a high degree of organization. Candidates 
must deliver backers to thousands of neighborhood meetings around 
the state, where people spend an evening talking politics and 
declaring their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a caucus state where it is absolutely imperative that  
people turn out,'' said Gore aide Chris Lehane. ``Labor plays a 
very important role in that.''

<HEADLINE> Last Houston Octuplet Goes Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The last of the surviving Texas octuplets has  
finally gone home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikem was discharged Thursday from Texas Children's Hospital,  
seven months after he and his seven siblings were born to Nkem 
Chukwu and her husband, Ikye Louis Udobi. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest of two boys, Ikem had been in serious condition for  
months. He had trouble breathing on his own until abdominal surgery 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said he weighs 7 pounds, 12 ounces -- up from a birth  
weight of 1 pound and 1 ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies were the world's only living octuplets when born in  
December. Six girls were born in addition to the two boys, but one 
died a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Pediatricians have not indicated that the children have shown  
any signs of the long-term problems that can face babies born 
prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the babies went home in March and three more left the  
hospital in April.

<HEADLINE> Teen Star Makes Wimbledon Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Mirjana Lucic is a senior citizen  
compared to this year's latest wave of Wimbledon teen-age stars. 
</P>
<P>
	She's 17. But she's already lived a lifetime after being a  
prodigy at 15 and a washout at 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm back,'' Lucic said after ousting No. 4 Monia  
Seles in Friday's third round 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic fled to Florida from Croatia 10 months ago to escape an  
abusive father, Marinko, whom she accused of beating her when she 
lost a match or didn't hustle in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	She once described her father as a ``tyrant.'' On Friday, she  
said he's ``nowhere'' in her life as she detailed three months 
following the 1998 U.S. Open when she ``didn't see a tennis ball or 
a racket'' as she battled shoulder and elbow injuries and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some tough times, but I think those are the times  
that make you an even better player, a tougher person ... and I 
consider that I'm tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic's life has settled down in the United States with her  
mother, sister and two brothers. ``I'm a lucky girl, you know. I 
have amazing support from my family. Without them, I wouldn't be 
able to do any of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucic isn't the only one with a father looming large in her  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the cases of Jelena Dokic, 16, who shocked top-ranked  
Martina Hingis in the first round. And, two months younger, Kim 
Clijsters, 16, who dispatched No. 12 Amanda Coetzer 6-2, 6-4 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic's father, Damir, has been on perfect behavior at Wimbledon  
after being warned by the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago he was ejected from a tournament in Birmingham,  
England, for shouting abuse at match officials. Later he was 
arrested outside the grounds for lying down in front of traffic and 
jumping on the hood of a car. He was later released when police 
said ``he had sobered up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clijsters' father is the flip side.  
</P>
<P>
	Leo Clijsters was a famous Belgian soccer player, best known for  
his laid-back style and leading the Belgian soccer team Mechelen to 
a 1990 European Cup Winners Cup soccer title. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian newspapers say he's never pushed his daughter's tennis  
career and is almost indifferent about it. 
</P>
<P>
	His daugher was just as laid-back as her father after shocking  
Coetzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I expected to beat her (Coetzer), but I'm not in  
awe about it,''she said. ``From the time I was a child, it was my 
dream to play Steffi Graf on Centre Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, she was born four months before Steffi Graf  
turned professional in late 1982.

<HEADLINE> Existing Home Sales Drop 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes dropped 4 percent in  
May -- the second consecutive monthly decline after hitting an 
all-time high in March. The drop occurred as mortgage were on the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Realtors said today that sales of  
existing single-family homes fell in May to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 5.04 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	While that was the lowest level in six months, it was still much  
better than the 4.82 million units reported sold in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected sales to slide a bit, but the pace is still very  
high and we anticipate another strong year as we continue to enjoy 
a healthy economy,'' said the association's president, Sharon 
Millett. 
</P>
<P>
	The association revised April's sales figures, showing the drop  
wasn't as bad as initially estimated. Under the revised figures, 
April sales declined 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 5.25 million units. The association originally estimated a 
3.3 percent drop in April to 5.24 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, existing-home sales posted a seasonally adjusted  
annual rate of 5.42 million units, a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	May's home-sales figure was below the expectations of analysts,  
who predicted that sales would either hold steady or decline 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, the average  
interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 7.15 percent in 
May, up from 6.92 percent in April. The rate was 7.14 percent in 
May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``All regions experienced a dip in resales, which is consistent  
with the recent increase in mortgage rates,'' said James Smith, the 
association's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
	The West reported the biggest drop in existing-homes sales, down  
7 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 
million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the Northeast were down 4.6 in May to an annual rate of  
630,000 units. Midwest sales were down 4.4 percent in May to an 
annual rate of 1.1 million units and the South reported a 1.5 
percent drop to an annual rate of 2 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	The national median existing-homes sales price rose 3.3 percent  
to $133,000 in May compared to May 1998. The median is the midpoint 
where half the homes sell for less while half sell for more. But 
the median existing-homes sale price in May was only 1.8 percent 
higher than the median price reported in April.

<HEADLINE> Nets Reach Agreement With Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Veteran assistant coach Don Casey, who took  
over as interim coach during the season when the New Jersey Nets 
fired John Calipari, will become the team's head coach, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, who has worked as an assistant coach in Chicago, Los  
Angeles and Boston, posted a 13-17 record with the injury-plagued 
Nets after he was appointed interim coach on March 15. 
</P>
<P>
	His future was up in the air as Nets owners pursued former Bulls  
coach Phil Jackson before he took a job coaching the Los Angeles 
Lakers. The team also reportedly considered former Georgetown coach 
John Thompson to take over the team. And the announcement comes 
just after New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said he was staying 
with the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, 61, ``is a veteran coach with a great deal of NBA  
experience who did an outstanding job last year, especially when 
you consider the rash of injuries that decimated the team's front 
line,'' Nets president Michael Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team reached an agreement with Casey for a multiyear  
contract, but did not disclose the terms. The team was expected to 
introduce Casey at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing 17 of 20 games under the emotional Calipari, the  
Nets turned to Casey to calm the team down. The Nets had a 
four-game winning streak, their longest of the season, to open the 
month of April and beat Seattle by 30 points on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Faced with the reality of not making the playoffs last year,  
Coach Casey was able to rally his squad and keep them focused on 
winning,'' Nets general manager John Nash said. ``The players 
responded very positively to Coach Casey and his staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, a playoff team a year ago, struggled in a season  
marked by Calipari's firing, a three-team trade in which the Nets 
acquired point guard Stephon Marbury and six season-ending 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star Jayson Williams broke his leg, leading scorer Keith Van  
Horn broke his thumb and shooting guard Kerry Kittles needs knee 
surgery. The team also lost point guard Sam Cassell and centers Jim 
McIlvaine and Rony Seikaly to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1989, Casey replaced Gene Shue as head coach of the  
Los Angeles Clippers for the remainder of the season. He then spent 
six seasons as an assistant with the Boston Celtics before joining 
the Nets in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey coached at Temple for eight years starting in 1973,  
posting a 151-94 record and leading the Owls to one NCAA tournament 
and three appearances in the NIT.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Girl Beaten to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GILBERT, Ariz. (AP) -- A note written in blood praying for  
``compassion, love and kindness'' was found near the body of an 
8-year-old girl beaten to death with a belt, according to a police 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Tuong was found dead May 15 on the floor of a prayer  
room in her family's home in suburban Phoenix, according to the 
report police released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A piece of paper on the altar was inscribed in blood. A Buddhist  
priest told detectives the inscription was the beginning of a 
2,500-year-old mantra usually recited as a chant. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives believe Christine's parents hit her more than 17  
times, leaving injuries that match belt buckles seized from the 
family's home, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents then instructed Christine's sisters, ages 7 and 9,  
to lie to authorities about the death, the report says. A medical 
exam found evidence that the two sisters were molested, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether to charge the parents will be made in  
about a week, after an outside expert helps the medical examiner's 
office review evidence gathered from the autopsy, County Attorney 
Rick Romley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents told police they do not beat their children with a  
belt and rely only on verbal discipline, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's father, Tung Tuong, and mother, Minh Tuong, have  
refused to comment about their daughter's death. They are 
Vietnamese refugees who came to the United States in 1980.

<HEADLINE> CMGI May Buy Compaq's AltaVista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With a name like CMGI, it's no wonder that a  
budding online empire would try so hard to parade under a flashier 
banner like Lycos or AltaVista. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI is already a minority owner of Lycos, but apparently can't  
strike a deal to take control of the popular Web site and Internet 
search engine. 
</P>
<P>
	That's probably why CMGI has switched its focus to Lycos rival  
AltaVista, which is owned by Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Compaq and CMGI confirmed reports they have been  
discussing a deal in which CMGI would buy a majority stake in 
AltaVista. 
</P>
<P>
	While weak sales and profits have prompted speculation that  
Compaq might be looking to focus on its personal computer business, 
Thursday's announcement suggested Compaq intends to retain a stake 
in AltaVista through a strategic alliance with CMGI. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI, based in Andover, Mass., declined to provide more details  
or to comment on a report Thursday in The Wall Street Journal 
saying talks to buy the remainder of Lycos had unraveled due to a 
personality clash among top management. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of that friction, of course, might be that CMGI, with  
an 18 percent interest in Lycos, recently scuttled Lycos' merger 
agreement with USA Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite its considerable muscle, which includes the wallop  
of minority backers Microsoft and Intel, CMGI finds itself lacking 
an established lightning rod to draw visitors and direct them to 
other corners of its far-flung online empire. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI's holdings include stakes in Ancestry.com, CarParts.com,  
Furniture.com and Raging Bull, a financial investment forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of what these deals are about is acquiring technology and  
money and ad revenues and Internet channels,'' said Jack Staff, 
chief economist for Zona Research. ``But the deals are also about 
acquiring highly specialized technical people in one fell swoop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But although Compaq may provide a friendlier partner for CMGI  
than Lycos, AltaVista might not provide an Internet hub quite as 
effective as Lycos would. 
</P>
<P>
	While considered by many a superior search tool with which to  
navigate the Web, AltaVista hasn't enjoyed the huge popularity of 
fellow Web portals Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three made their names by helping people sift through an  
ever-exploding number of Web sites for specific information or 
topics of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, however, those companies realized that the hordes  
of people passing through every day on the way to other Internet 
destinations might be valuable to advertisers if their visitors 
stuck around longer. 
</P>
<P>
	So to persuade people to stay, Yahoo! and the others have juiced  
up their Web sites with news, shopping, entertainment, free e-mail 
and chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The results speak for themselves. According to the latest  
rankings from Media Metrix, Yahoo! was the most popular Web site in 
May with 31.1 million visitors. Including affiliated sites, Yahoo! 
placed third after America Online Inc. and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast the Excite.com Web site placed eighth with 15.1  
million visitors in May, followed by Lycos.com with 14.9 million. 
AltaVista's Web site placed only 15th with 9.5 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	For Compaq, which issued a terse statement confirming the talks,  
a deal with CMGI would mark a sharp change of course for the 
computer maker, whose fortunes have spiraled downward since last 
year's acquisition of Digital Equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston-based company is now trying to chart a new direction  
after a rocky few months dominated by weak profits, layoff 
announcements and the ouster of top management. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the past five months alone, Compaq has announced plans to  
spin off AltaVista through a public stock sale and spent more than 
$500 million to buy online retailer Shopping.com and Zip2, an 
online guide to different cities. Both purchases were folded into 
AltaVista and would likely be included in any deal with CMGI.

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam, Longtime Caddie Split  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Caddiegate has spread to the LPGA Tour.  
</P>
<P>
	Annika Sorenstam, a three-time player of the year, confirmed  
today that she has split with longtime caddie Colin Cann. 
Sorenstam's husband, David Esch, caddied for her in the second 
round of the LPGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes to a point where it's like old hat,'' Sorenstam said.  
``You do the same thing over and over again, and you need to do 
something different. Over the last month, we've both been trying 
really hard. I think we both needed a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While player-caddie relationships do not last forever, this only  
added to the list of several notable splits this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods dumped Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan after the Nissan Open in  
Los Angeles in March. Two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els parted 
ways with Ricci Roberts. Mark O'Meara, who won two major 
championships in 1998, fired Jerry Higginbotham after the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam and Cann, an Englishman and one of the most respected  
caddies on the LPGA Tour, have been together the past six years, 
during which Sorenstam has been the most successful player in 
women's golf. She has won 16 times, including back-to-back U.S. 
Opens, and last year became the first woman to have a scoring 
average under 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam said the split Thursday evening was mutual -- she asked  
Cann to take a break, and he agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great caddie and I want him to work,'' she said. ``He's  
definitely one of the best out here. We've been through a lot 
together, and a lot of my success is thanks to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Cann, Sorenstam had to mark off her own yardage for the  
first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``David had to help me find the sprinklers,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Esch, who turned professional last year to play with his wife in  
the JC Penney Mixed Team Classic, said his stint as Sorenstam's 
caddie would only last through the weekend. Sorenstam had a 3-under 
68 and was at 141, seven strokes out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my cup of tea. She knows that, and I know that,'' he  
said. ``I've caddied three or four times, but only for things like 
the Skins Game -- not major championships.''

<HEADLINE> GM, Gov't To Study Anti-Crash System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Smart cars'' that use radar, cameras and  
computer chips to ``see'' slower cars and other objects in the road 
ahead will be developed under a joint $35 million project announced 
by General Motors Corp. and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash-avoidance system announced Thursday is intended for  
distracted drivers who are not paying full attention to the road as 
they talk on a car phone, tune a radio or try to settle a fight 
among siblings in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech system will be designed to detect obstacles ahead  
and warn the driver if he gets too close and could crash, said Ron 
Colgin, GM's manager for the project. If the driver is also using 
cruise control, the car will start to brake for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The research project focuses on reducing rear-end collisions.  
The Transportation Department says about one-fourth of all injuries 
in motor vehicle crashes result from rear-end collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen prototype cars with these systems of the future will be  
developed in the next 2 1/2 years, GM said. Then about 100 drivers in 
southeast Michigan will be selected to drive the prototype vehicles 
for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most comprehensive field operation test under  
real-world conditions that has ever been conducted,'' Colgin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the research will be shared with other  
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Transportation is providing about 61 percent  
of the funding because federal officials are interested in learning 
about the systems and encouraging other automakers to build them. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is interested in the joint research because engineers want to  
learn how motorists react as the car ``sees'' problems and warns 
them, and they want feedback on how marketable the system will be.

<HEADLINE> Juice Eyed in Salmonella Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- At least 13 people in Washington and four in  
Oregon have been sickened by a salmonella infection that health 
officials linked to an unpasteurized orange juice from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Patient interviews revealed the orange juice, distributed by Sun  
Orchard Co. from its Tempe, Ariz., plant, was used at most of the 
locations where the Oregon and Washington individuals are thought 
to have been infected, state and federal health officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 13 Washington cases, at least eight people drank fruit  
drinks that contained the juice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Genetic fingerprinting tests indicate that people in  
Washington and Oregon got the illness from the same source,'' said 
Dr. John Kobayashi, Washington's chief communicable disease 
epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella is a bacteria that causes diarrhea, cramps, headache,  
fever, vomiting and dehydration. Treatment consists of rest and 
drinking plenty of fluids. While salmonella infection is highly 
unpleasant, it is usually not life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Orchard is voluntarily recalling a product labeled ``Fresh  
Squeezed Orange Juice'' from Arizona, California, Washington and 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA and the company have found no salmonella in tests of the  
juice but the company is recalling it in the interests of safety, 
said Betty Weiss, Sun Orchard accounting manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The juice, shipped in gallon, half-gallon or quart clear plastic  
containers, had a ``use by'' date between June 23 and July 8, Weiss 
said.

<HEADLINE> Venus vs. Anna at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Venus 2, Anna 0.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the score as Venus Williams and Anna Kournikova -- tennis'  
most photographed and watched teen-age stars -- head into their 
fourth-round match at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams won a year ago in three sets in a hard-court final in  
Key Biscayne, Fla., and again this spring 6-2, 6-2 on clay in the 
Italian Open. She's been keeping track of Kournikova on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always put her matches on. It seems like the British  
really love Anna, which is great,'' Williams said after beating 
Sarah Pitkowski 6-1, 6-1 on Friday. ``I've played when the crowd 
liked my opponent more. She's a big favorite here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams reached the quarterfinals a year ago. Kournikova missed  
last year with an injury but was a semifinalist in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a tough match,'' said Kournikova, who  
defeated Ines Gorrochategui on Friday when the Argentine retired in 
the second set with a sore right shoulder after Kournikova won the 
first 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (Venus) has a big serve, she's a big girl, so I have to  
just outthink her,'' said the 18-year-old Russian. ``Grass is 
obviously not her surface, so we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OVERMATCHED:* Top-ranked Pete Sampras easily handled English  
qualifier Danny Sapsford -- ranked No. 595 -- 6-3, 6-4, 7-5. Here's 
how their records look after the match: Titles: Sampras 57, 
Sapsford 0; Grand Slams: Sampras 11, Sapsford 0; Career Record: 
Sampras 637-174, Sapsford 18-32. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I felt slight nerves was the second I stepped  
foot on the court,'' Sapsford said. ``There was a big roar and the 
... stadium seemed to spin a little bit. And I was just telling 
myself to put one foot in front of the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANOTHER 16-YEAR-OLD:* Belgian 16-year-old Kim Clijsters ousted  
No. 12 Amanda Coetzer 6-2, 6-4, setting up a fourth-round match 
with Steffi Graf. She's the youngest woman playing singles this

Dokic, who shocked top-seeded Martina Hingis in the first round.

<P>
	 *GIRLCOTT:* Billie Jean King has reminded Wimbledon executives  
that female players may stay away if the tournament doesn't pay men 
and women equally. For now, WTA Tour officials have ruled out a 
so-called ``girlcott.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Make a sensible business decision,'' King said Friday in a  
Times of London story. ``Treating women as less valuable than men 
generates ill-will that is disproportionate to the amount of money 
you are saving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said the men's purse this year was $890,000 more than  
women's -- a fraction of the reported $52.8 million in net profit 
Wimbledon generated last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *NO. 2:* Two-time defending U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter has  
reached Wimbledon's fourth round the last three years. Now he's in 
the third round against Sweden's Thomas Enqvist. But his eye is 
always on grabbing the ATP Tour's No. 1 ranking after being No. 2 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Wimbledon champion John Newcombe said this week he'd  
make No. 1 before the year ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``My God,'' Rafter said when told that. ``I'd like to be No. 1,  
no doubt about it. But I think there are 10 guys who can be No. 
1.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUN, SUN, SUN:* Nearly perfect weather has graced Wimbledon for  
the first five days with temperatures in the low 70s and no rain. 
The last rain-free Wimbledon was 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But showers are in the forecast for the weekend and early next  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like a washout or anything, but there could be  
a good bit of rain,'' said Matt McColm, forecaster at Britain's 
national weather office. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BRING ON BORIS:* Australian 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt faces  
Boris Becker in the third round and can't wait. ``It'll be a big 
thrill for me to be out there against Boris Becker. He's been there 
and won three times. I've got nothing to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGNAL MOMENT:* Pam Shriver said during her BBC commentary that  
16-year-old Jelena Dokic seemed to be getting signals from her 
father during her second-round match Thursday. Tennis rules don't 
allow coaching during play. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic insists there was no coaching.  
</P>
<P>
	``No signs, I mean he didn't tell me how to play.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone, anywhere is forbidden to give advice, instructions or  
make gestures on court,'' WTA Tour executive Georgiana Clark said. 
Rules call for a warning followed by disqualification.

<HEADLINE> Woman Charged in Casino Exec's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A former casino boss was killed in a plot  
cooked up by his girlfriend and a contractor to steal his buried 
treasure of $4 million in silver bars and coins, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects, Sandra Murphy and Rick Tabish, were being held  
without bail Friday, Lt. Wayne Petersen said. They were arrested 
Thursday and charged with murder conspiracy, robbery, grand larceny 
and burglary in the death of 55-year-old Ted Binion in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the wheels of justice turn slowly, but they do turn,''  
Binion's brother Jack told the Las Vegas Review-Journal after the 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Roger said Tabish needed $500,000 to buy into a  
sand pit business whose owners had been strong-armed into selling. 
The Montana contractor allegedly schemed with the 27-year-old 
Murphy to kill her boyfriend and steal his money. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabish, 34, knew where to go because he built Binion an  
underground vault in Pahrump, 60 miles west of Las Vegas, where 
Binion buried the silver. Binion had allegedly refused to pay 
Tabish the $13,000 promised for his work, according to an 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabish's father told the Review-Journal that his son was  
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel that he's being railroaded,'' said Frank Tabish of  
Missoula, Mont. ``He's not capable of that. It's just unbelievable 
that that could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Binion was a former casino executive at Binion's Horseshoe Club  
casino in downtown Las Vegas. Gambling regulators ousted him in 
1997 and 1998 because of repeated drug use and his ties to a slain 
mob figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, Murphy told police she found Binion's body next  
to an empty bottle of Xanax. He had lethal doses of the 
prescription sedative and heroin in his body and his death was 
ruled a homicide in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Binion's death, Tabish and two other men were  
caught trying to dig up 46,000 pounds of Binion's buried silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators looking into Binion's death became suspicious when  
Murphy and Tabish seemed to turn up together a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Binion estate attorney Bruce Judd claimed the two were  
romantically involved and they had plotted to steal Binion's assets 
before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tabish's attorney said Judd had painted the wrong picture.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the conspiratorial romantic relationship that they  
think it is,'' Steve Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Murphy had no comment on the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Binion's estate believes Murphy and Tabish also may have taken  
more than $300,000 in valuables, including a collection of rare 
coins and currency, from Binion's safe at his home after his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was awarded Binion's $900,000 home, its contents and  
$300,000 in cash. But her inheritance has been threatened because 
of her refusal to help the estate find the missing assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabish also faces theft charges in connection with the buried  
treasure and extortion and assault with a deadly weapon for 
allegedly kidnapping and beating one of the owners of the sand pit 
operation. Two other arrests are expected in that case, Roger said.

<HEADLINE> Drilling Venture off Calif. Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Just days before federal officials were  
expected to allow oil companies to begin new drilling off 
California's coast, a federal agency temporarily suspended the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Minerals Management Service decided Friday to allow  
more time to study revised drilling proposals submitted by the 
companies last month, leaving in place a six-year prohibition of 
new oil exploration along the state's central coast until Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies were expected to begin preliminary work for  
production after Wednesday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents include Gov. Gray Davis, environmentalists and local  
organizations who fear new drilling will make the coast vulnerable 
to oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate many of the political candidates and  
environmental groups are blowing this way out of proportion to what 
it is,'' said Frank Holmes, spokesman for the Western States 
Petroleum Association. ``The leases can be developed in an 
environmentally safe and sound manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Jordan of the League for Coastal Protection said the  
decision buys time, but merely postpones an inevitable showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see this as a victory at all because what we want is  
the expiration of these leases,'' Jordan said.

<HEADLINE> FTC: Media Probe To Avoid Censorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A White House-ordered investigation into  
whether and how the entertainment industry markets violence to 
children will not produce a bureaucracy of government censors, the 
chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, we will not judge the content of these  
products,'' FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said in a speech at a 
national convention of District Attorneys General. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not the modern embodiment of the thought police, and we  
don't want to be,'' Pitofsky said. ``Our goal is to work with -- not 
against -- the entertainment industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ordered the FTC and Justice Department earlier  
this month to investigate the effectiveness of the current ratings 
systems in place for films, music and video games. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million review is due in 18 months, but Pitofsky said he  
anticipates a report will be ready within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also will look at marketing plans and consider whether the  
marketing and advertising of these products is either inconsistent 
with the ratings or designed to undermine them,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Better self-regulation by the entertainment industry is the  
goal, not government intervention, he said. Critics who call that a 
``cop out'' are wrong, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen industry self-regulation work in industries as  
divergent in economic terms as the advertising industry and the 
funeral directors,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it requires full compliance by the entertainment  
industry, and ``some device within a self-regulatory scheme to 
ensure that firms abide by their commitments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for the study in the wake of a deadly spate of  
school shootings. He said children ``are being fed a dependable 
daily dose of violence'' that amounts to witnessing 40,000 play 
murders by their 18th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a barrage blurs the line between fantasy and reality  
violence for too many children, the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan District Attorney General Jennifer Granholm said she  
expects the study to find ``explicit marketing to children of 
extremely violent video games, movies, etc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She offered Pitofsky her state as a testing ground if a lawsuit  
is deemed necessary to stop such marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what my cause of action is. But I hope that you  
find one for me, and I'm telling you I'm willing to push the 
envelope on this,'' she told Pitofsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may well be getting back to you,'' he replied.

<HEADLINE> Gore Endorsed by Big Iowa Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today won the  
endorsement of the largest union representing Iowa state workers, a 
major force in the nation's leadoff precinct caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement had been hard-fought, with allies of former New  
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley urging union leaders to put off a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was headed to Des Moines to collect the endorsement of  
Council 61 of the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, which represents more than 20,000 state 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is perhaps the biggest single political force in Iowa  
Democratic politics and Gore aides were trumpeting the endorsement. 
Just over 100,000 activists are likely to attend those caucuses, so 
the union's backing can make a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
	While AFSCME's national leaders have backed Gore, they left the  
decision in Iowa up to union leaders in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the vice president has been good for working  
families,'' said Council 61 president Jan Corderman. Corderman said 
leaders polled members and found 69 percent were favorable toward 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement is a boost for Gore on several fronts. President  
Clinton has had tense relations with labor leaders because of his 
trade policies, and Gore has faced tough questions from unions 
worried about foreign competition for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the union's decision was one indication labor leaders aren't  
ready to abandon the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement will give Gore a cadre of experienced political  
workers who understand how to run phone banks, door-knocking sweeps 
and car pools. Those mundane tasks are at the heart of scoring well 
in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses open the presidential nominating season  
and those events demand a high degree of organizational skill. 
Candidates must find a way to deliver backers to thousands of 
neighborhood meetings around the state, where people spend an 
evening talking politics and declaring their choice in front of 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	That requires more organizational skill than a primary election,  
where a voter drops by a polling place for a few minutes.

<HEADLINE>  Mistrial Called in Reggie Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A jury was unable to decide if the diagnosis of a  
renowned cardiologist contributed to the death of Boston Celtics 
star Reggie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith declared a mistrial  
Thursday after the jury deliberated about 35 hours over six days in 
the malpractice case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is a loser here,'' said the judge. ``We've all lost  
Mr. Lewis. Everybody's reputation has been attacked on both sides 
of the case. It's a sad situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury cleared two consulting physicians, Drs. Mark Creager  
and Peter Friedman, of wrongdoing, but could not agree on whether 
Dr. Gilbert Mudge was negligent in Lewis' death. The Celtics 
captain died of a heart condition while shooting baskets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In her suit, widow Donna Harris-Lewis claimed Mudge and the two  
consultants misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's heart 
condition. A third consultant settled for an undisclosed sum before 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorneys sought at least $75 million, saying that was what  
Lewis would have earned if he hadn't died. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Harley, a lawyer for Ms. Harris-Lewis, said he would  
press on against Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a deadlock, it's as if it never happened,'' he  
said. ``So we'll try it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's lawyer, William Dailey Jr., called the mistrial  
unfortunate. ``We're hoping this will be a final resolution on the 
matter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993 and was  
diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially career-ending 
cardiac condition by doctors from New England Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who announced at a news conference that the player 
instead had a neurological ailment that caused fainting spells. He 
said Lewis would likely play professional basketball again. Two 
months later, Lewis died at 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Ms. Harris-Lewis had suggested Mudge's judgment was  
clouded by a search for glory as the doctor who could prove the 
original diagnosis wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's attorneys called convicted felons to testify to alleged  
cocaine and marijuana use by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, Mudge testified that Lewis admitted shortly before his  
death that he had used cocaine, making an accurate diagnosis 
impossible. Ms. Harris-Lewis denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the drug allegations were a key part of Mudge's defense,  
Ms. Harris-Lewis said she felt her husband's legacy remained 
untarnished. 
</P>
<P>
	``No lies, no rumors and no gossip about my Reggie can ever  
change the good and kind and caring person he was and the good he 
did on this earth,'' she said. ``And there's no telling how much 
good he could have done if he had been treated properly and 
lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's lawyer had only praise for the Lewises.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Mudge and I want to remind everyone that Reggie Lewis was  
a husband, father and a patient,'' Dailey said. ``Dr. Mudge now, as 
always, wishes only the best and peace to Mrs. Lewis, her children 
and all the members of Reggie's family.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against other major currencies  
Friday, but its losses were stemmed by a slight rebound in U.S. 
stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0428, up  
from $1.0397 late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 121.43 
Japanese yen, down from 121.78. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had been dragged lower this week by faltering stocks  
and bonds, which have been hit by concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a slight rebound on Wall Street and in the U.S. Treasury  
market Friday helped lend some support to the dollar and slow its 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro and yen were also aided by growing optimism about the  
economic outlook in Europe after the end of hostilities in Kosovo 
and in Japan if the government comes up with another fiscal 
stimulus package. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5324 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5336, and 1.4662 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4722. The British 
pound slipped to $1.5873 from $1.5888. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8756 German 
marks, down from 1.8811; 6.2903 French francs, down from 6.3091; 
and 1,856.80 Italian lire, down from 1,862.20.

<HEADLINE> Checkout Scanner Turns 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Ohio (AP) -- It was only a pack of chewing gum. But its  
sale 25 years ago marked the debut of the checkout scanner and a 
fadeout of the days when cashiers' fingers had to fly over register 
keys to keep store lines moving. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 26, 1974, that 10-pack of Wrigley's gum was moved across  
an NCR Corp. scanner in the Marsh Supermarket in this city of about 
20,000. Linda Rozell, general merchandise manager, was there that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard to believe our little, small store here  
started the whole thing nationwide,'' Rozell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``thing'' it started was a revolution, first in retailing  
and then across other industries. The same technology that allows a 
computer to read a series of bars and numbers and add up a grocery 
bill quickly and accurately also enables a store to track its 
inventory and the buying habits of customers. It provides a 
retailer and its suppliers with instant marketing information. 
</P>
<P>
	Scanners and bar codes have also allowed companies such as  
Wal-Mart Stores and Federal Express to create distribution systems 
that have set standards for efficiency and cost-savings within 
their industries. 
</P>
<P>
	They've made it possible for government agencies, institutions  
and companies to easily access databanks for information about 
people. Many states put bar codes on drivers' licenses to help 
police obtain information about motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bar codes show up on luggage tags, helping airlines getting a  
suitcase to the right destination. They've been used in the 
Iditarod race in Alaska to keep track of the dogs on each team. 
Scanners and bar codes show up on ranches, replacing the brands 
once used to identify cattle. Laboratories use them to make sure 
patients' results aren't mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was still a grocery store novelty 25 years ago, Marsh's  
cashiers found using the scanner awkward, Rozell recalled. 
Customers weren't quite sure what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were skeptical,'' she said. ``But no one ever really  
threw a fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Shoup, a Marsh shopper, has embraced the technology.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be faster,'' she said. ``And it seems to be pretty  
accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton-based NCR said it picked the store in Troy for the first  
retail use of the scanner because it was nearby and Marsh was a 
cooperative customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Hotka, vice president of information technology for the  
National Retail Federation, said the scanner has transformed the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' Hotka said. ``Having the ability to scan a  
product means a retailer can track when that product is sold and 
where it's sold. Retailers have a way to make sure they don't run 
out of the product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scanner has also enabled retailers to tailor their  
merchandise to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some locations, people won't eat chocolate ice cream,''  
Hotka said. ``In some locations people have wider feet because they 
are different nationalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trends are spotted more quickly because of the scanner.  
</P>
<P>
	``Colors, for instance, go in and out of style,'' said Hotka.  
``A retailer can now track not only what kind of T-shirt is 
selling, but what color. It's one reason fads can take off faster 
than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy Flynn, vice president of food industry marketing for NCR,  
said about 90 percent of U.S. retail chains have scanners. He 
estimated 1 million scanners are in operation worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, President Bush created a stir during a visit to a  
grocers' convention in Orlando, Fla., when he remarked that he was 
amazed by the scanner technology he saw there. 
</P>
<P>
	It was widely reported that Bush was surprised to see an  
ordinary supermarket scanner, prompting columnists and cartoonists 
to suggest the president was out of touch with everyday life. 
Officials later said Bush was commenting on a new type of scanner 
that could even read a torn-up bar-code label. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn said scanners have gotten both smaller and better at  
reading bar codes. The latest trend is toward self-service checkout 
scanners as a way for stores to cut costs and deal with labor 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone likes the scanner, even after 25 years.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the old way better,'' said Marsh shopper Georgia Dix.  
``I was used to that.''

</P>
<P>
	The jury cleared two consulting physicians, Drs. Mark Creager  
and Peter Friedman, of wrongdoing, but could not agree on whether 
Dr. Gilbert Mudge was negligent in Lewis' death. The Celtics 
captain died of a heart condition while shooting baskets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In her suit, widow Donna Harris-Lewis claimed Mudge and the two  
consultants misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's heart 
condition. A third consultant settled for an undisclosed sum before 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorneys sought at least $75 million, saying that was what  
Lewis would have earned if he hadn't died. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Harley, a lawyer for Ms. Harris-Lewis, said he would  
press on against Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a deadlock, it's as if it never happened,'' he  
said. ``So we'll try it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's lawyer, William Dailey Jr., called the mistrial  
unfortunate. ``We're hoping this will be a final resolution on the 
matter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993 and was  
diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially career-ending 
cardiac condition by doctors from New England Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who announced at a news conference that the player 
instead had a neurological ailment that caused fainting spells. He 
said Lewis would likely play professional basketball again. Two 
months later, Lewis died at 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Ms. Harris-Lewis had suggested Mudge's judgment was  
clouded by a search for glory as the doctor who could prove the 
original diagnosis wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's attorneys called convicted felons to testify to alleged  
cocaine and marijuana use by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, Mudge testified that Lewis admitted shortly before his  
death that he had used cocaine, making an accurate diagnosis 
impossible. Ms. Harris-Lewis denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the drug allegations were a key part of Mudge's defense,  
Ms. Harris-Lewis said she felt her husband's legacy remained 
untarnished. 
</P>
<P>
	``No lies, no rumors and no gossip about my Reggie can ever  
change the good and kind and caring person he was and the good he 
did on this earth,'' she said. ``And there's no telling how much 
good he could have done if he had been treated properly and 
lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's lawyer had only praise for the Lewises.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Mudge and I want to remind everyone that Reggie Lewis was  
a husband, father and a patient,'' Dailey said. ``Dr. Mudge now, as 
always, wishes only the best and peace to Mrs. Lewis, her children 
and all the members of Reggie's family.''

<HEADLINE> McCord All Wet, Still Makes Birdie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Gary McCord wrote about dozens of  
recovery shots in his how-to guide, ``Golf For Dummies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet on Friday, he found himself in a situation that even his  
famed imagination hadn't conceived. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing the second round of the Senior Players Championship,  
McCord put his second shot on the par-5 17th right next to a water 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball was still on the fairway, but there was no room for  
McCord to take his stance. 
</P>
<P>
	At least not on dry land.  
</P>
<P>
	``My buddies at home never play shots like that,'' he joked.  
``If they had that situation, they would have just yelled `Look! 
It's the Goodyear Blimp!' then toss the ball back into the middle 
of the fairway while everyone was distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCord, best known as a CBS commentator and author, didn't have  
that luxury. So he pulled off his socks and shoes, rolled up his 
trousers and gingerly stepped into shin-deep water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I did was check for rattlesnakes,'' he said.  
``Then I took my pitching wedge, reminded myself not to hit the 
ball too hard, and aimed about 40 yards to the right of the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unorthodox shot worked beautifully, hooking onto the green's  
back fringe. McCord dried off, got dressed, and made the 20-foot 
putt for a birdie en route to a 5-under 67 and a 141 total. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I hit it, I knew it was pretty good,'' he said. ``I  
could just tell from the way it felt in my hands. Once I got it 
that close, I didn't want to miss the opportunity and not make the 
putt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCord's 67 came on a day where the rest of the field was  
struggling, and moved him within five shots of Graham Marsh's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give myself a 10 out of 10 for patience today,'' he said.  
``Nothing went right for me on the first 27 holes, but I hung in 
there and got myself back into the tournament on the back nine. It 
would have been easy to give up a little out there, but I had a 
couple talks with myself and did a good of keeping it together.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Rebels Feeling Defenseless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTOK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The rebel police chief in Istok hears  
the stories from people coming down from mountain villages: Serb 
paramilitaries are terrorizing ethnic Albanian villages. 
</P>
<P>
	But Naser Shatri, local head of the self-appointed rebel police,  
doesn't know what to tell the villagers. Peacekeepers are disarming 
his men but won't send their own troops to root out the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he has stored his heavy weapons under an agreement  
signed Monday by his Kosovo Liberation Army and the NATO-led 
peacekeeping force, known as KFOR. But his frustration is growing, 
and his stash of weapons is quite a temptation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If KFOR doesn't protect this whole area, it's our duty to  
defend our population,'' he said Friday in Istok, 35 miles west of 
the provincial capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout this northwestern corner of Kosovo, gunfire and the  
crackle of burning Serb houses can be heard across the dramatic 
forested mountains. Even as they loot and burn houses on the main 
road, ethnic Albanians tell of Serb paramilitary holdouts in the 
hills, firing at refugees trying to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	KLA fighter Arsim Qorri, 20, and his men have held onto their  
weapons and are clashing daily with Serb paramilitary groups in the 
village of Baj, five miles of dirt road above Istok. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs are still armed, so we cannot be disarmed,'' he  
said. ``If KFOR comes, I will give up my arms -- but only if they 
take the Serbs' weapons as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the villagers depend on fighters like him to take on the  
Serb paramilitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are shooting everyday and burning homes,'' he said. Asked  
who could protect the people there, he said: ``Only the KLA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian and Spanish peacekeepers patrol the main road in battle  
tanks. They have also been checking passers-by for weapons and 
escorting a convoy of hundreds of fleeing Serbs into the 
neighboring republic of Montenegro, but have done little more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have roadblocks and checkpoints. We cannot go house to  
house,'' said Fabrizio Centofanti, spokesman for the Italian troops 
at their base in Pec. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are doing our best to defend both ethnic communities. And  
we cannot allow anyone to make his own law -- not the KLA and not 
the Serbs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the villages down dirt roads in the mountainous northwest  
are out of reach of the Italians, currently 2,300 soldiers covering 
roughly a fifth of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in areas with a strong NATO presence, attempts to bring  
security to the province have had limited success, with Albanians 
openly and unapologetically taking revenge on Serbs for the ethnic 
killings this spring and for years of oppression beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Serbs continue to flow out of the Yugoslav  
province, seeking refuge in Serbia or Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	A half a mile down the road from Istok toward Suhogerlla, where  
Shatri said there was fighting this week, a lone Serb stood beside 
a French tank, stationed as far in as the peacekeepers have gone. 
The man said ethnic Albanians were doing the fighting, and that the 
Serbs there were afraid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our soldiers and police have gone, and now it's not safe  
here,'' said Voran Simic, 35. ``KFOR should come here and see who's 
doing the shooting -- Serb civilians or Albanian terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrations on both sides of the ethnic divide have the  
potential to become a major problem for KFOR. Only half of the 
expected force has arrived in Kosovo and institutions like police 
and a Kosovo army only exist as plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the rebels are under increasing pressure to  
take the job even if it means breaking their agreement to dissolve 
as a military force. 
</P>
<P>
	Halit Ademi, 62, returned to Kosovo from a refugee camp in  
Albania on Wednesday, but still hasn't seen his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are shooting from the hills. My house is there but I  
can't go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about the peace deal, I thought I would be safe  
here. I thought there would be more protection. Nobody is 
protecting me. Who will help us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatri, the police chief, hears the reports from Suhogerlla and  
the nearby village of Corkolez. But he hasn't let his men take up 
their with guns -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very bad,'' he said. ``We signed the agreement to end  
the war, so we can do nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his anger is building, and he said he has sat by long  
enough. ``If the Serbs will be there again, the KLA will go there 
to fight,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Comeback Bid: Emerging-Markets Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual funds that invest in emerging-markets  
stocks have staged a lively revival in recent months. But their 
show is still playing to a skeptical audience. 
</P>
<P>
	These funds, which specialize in stocks traded in developing  
economies around the world from Indonesia to Israel, racked up a 
return of better than 28 percent from Jan. 1 through mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	That was good enough to put them on the list of year-to-date  
leaders among all fund groups tracked by the research firm of 
Lipper Inc. They handily beat Lipper's index of all world equity 
funds, which gained about 11.5 percent over the same period, and 
the firm's index of all types of U.S. stock funds, which rose about 
6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel better about the outlook than I have in years,''  
declares Mark Madden, manager of the Pioneer Emerging Markets Fund 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	As so often happens when a long-depressed market rallies,  
though, not many investors have been aboard to enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	By a recent Lipper tally, all the nearly 200 emerging markets  
stock funds now in operation add up to only $16.37 billion in 
assets -- or less than 5 percent of the $380 billion or so invested 
in world stock funds of all types. 
</P>
<P>
	The emerging-markets category of funds barely existed until the  
early 1990s. It no sooner picked up some momentum than the world's 
frontier stock markets ran into severe trouble, with a series of 
misadventures including the Mexican peso crisis in 1994 and the 
woes that hit Asia starting in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the recent comeback, the average emerging markets fund  
still shows a loss of 2.8 percent a year for the five years from 
early June 1994 to early June 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Templeton Developing Markets Trust, run by the famed Mark  
Mobius, is the giant of the field, with assets of more than $2 
billion. Still, the amount of investors' money in its class A 
shares has shrunk by about a third since the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At other big fund families, as tracked by Morningstar Mutual  
Funds, the Merrill Lynch Developing Capital Markets Fund Class A 
dwindled from $406 million at the end of 1994 to about $75 million 
this spring, and the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund contracted from 
a 1993 high of $1.9 billion to $330 million recently. 
</P>
<P>
	By last fall, it looked as though almost everybody, not just  
fund investors, had given up on the idea of emerging-markets 
investing. Then things started to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commodity and other cyclical stocks have led the surge in  
developing markets so far in 1999,'' writes analyst Bill Rocco in 
Morningstar's latest report on the group. ``Such issues are key 
components of most emerging stock markets, and they have benefited 
as sentiment about worldwide economic growth has improved markedly 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many Asian countries have done especially well this year,  
because they have implemented the most financial reforms and enjoy 
the rosiest economic outlooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton Biggs, the influential investment strategist at Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., recently told his firm's clients, ``I 
think emerging-market equities have completed their bear market and 
have either begun or are on the verge of beginning a new bull 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question remains, however, whether investors will show much  
renewed enthusiasm for emerging-markets funds any time soon. Their 
ultrahigh risk and volatility has impressed itself on everybody's 
mind, and as long as U.S. stock funds keep doing well, many people 
seem reluctant to venture back out that far on the limb. 
</P>
<P>
	As Rocco concludes, ``in the challenging world of  
emerging-markets investing, there continue to be no easy answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to a committed bull like Madden at Pioneer Emerging Markets,  
the wary mood leaves plenty of room for the rally to continue. 
``Judging by the low valuations and price levels, and if the 
traditional pattern persists, the opportunities for the next three 
to five years look compelling,'' Madden maintains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most retail and institutional investors are still  
underweighted in emerging markets, but over the coming year we 
expect them to be drawn back in. Substantial flows from investors 
could have a profound positive impact in these markets.''

<HEADLINE> Philly To Honor Stooge Larry Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. Larry Fine, the  
frizzy-haired member of the Three Stooges who suffered never-ending 
abuse from Moe and Curly, is getting gentler treatment in his 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	A wiseguy Philadelphia weekly is leading an effort to raise  
$25,000 to paint a mural of Fine on South Street, a funky stretch 
of restaurants and tattoo and tongue-piercing parlors. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the money coming in? Why, soitenly.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, the weekly has raised about $2,900 without once  
resorting to eye-poking or hair-pulling (or head-bopping, 
pie-throwing or administering a smack across three faces in a row). 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative design is a 20-by-20-foot painting of the put-upon  
Stooge's face, his eyes wide in anticipation, on the bull's eye of 
a target. 
</P>
<P>
	The artist who will paint the mural, David McShane, is a Three  
Stooge fan who spent his childhood re-enacting the boys' antics 
with his five brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although Larry was the local guy, he's probably the most  
overlooked. Most of the stuff we did was more Curly-isms,'' said 
McShane, launching into a recitation of Stooge lines (``Niagara 
Falls. Slowly I turn ...'') ``He was always getting his hair pulled 
and Moe would be left with a big hunk of his hair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fine was born in a rowhouse on South Philadelphia's South Street  
in 1902. The mural will be painted next door on the side of Jon's 
Bar &AMP; Grill. Fine died in 1975. Moe Howard and his brother Curly 
are long gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Weekly decided Fine would make good wall art  
after the Philadelphia Daily News raised money for a mural of Frank 
Sinatra in heavily Italian South Philly. The Weekly complained that 
Sinatra was from New Jersey, and it suggested honoring instead a 
real Philadelphian, namely one Larry Fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We basically did it as a lark, and we just started hearing  
from people -- police officers, lawyers, Stooge fan club members,'' 
said Tim Whitaker, the weekly's editor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry Fine just seemed perfect because the Stooges were always  
upsetting the applecart and going against the establishment and it 
seemed to fit in good with our paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city has agreed to pay 25 percent of the expected $25,000  
cost. A Stooge marks a departure for the city, which has painted 
murals of Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The city 
has more than 1,800 murals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of what we do is very serious, but occasionally  
you have to do something fun,'' said Jane Golden, director of the 
city's Mural Arts Program.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Returns to Domestic Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Content with the peace in Kosovo, President  
Clinton turned his focus homeward today ``with a renewed energy for 
the domestic agenda.'' He challenged what he cast as a do-nothing 
Republican Congress to approve his ideas on Medicaid, Medicare, 
Social Security, education, child care and campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should pass it and I will sign it,'' was the  
president's refrain as he ticked down the same list of initiatives 
he outlined five months ago in his State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebutting those who would call him a lame-duck president in the  
final 18 months of his term, Clinton laid that label on his 
Republican opponents in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``really believe that because the presidential election  
season has already started, the battle for Congress has already 
started ... that the best politics is to just run out the clock and 
wait for the next election and hope that the country is doing so 
well and we enjoy the lazy days of summer so much nobody will 
notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't agree with that,'' Clinton told a student audience at  
his alma mater, Georgetown University. This summer, he added, 
should be a ``season of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, safeguard the Social Security surplus 
for improving that program and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. at an appearance 
where he was joined by dozens of rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let Washington spend the surplus. We need fairness in  
our tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to craft a tax  
cut next month, and likely will include provisions to repeal to 
so-called ``marriage penalty,'' eliminate the estate tax and 
possibly cut the capital-gains tax. In addition, there has been 
talk of making more income taxable at the rate of 15 percent, 
rather than 28 percent, a step that would cut taxes for millions of 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of all of his proposals that have languished on Capitol Hill  
because of what he called ``small-time wrangling,'' the president 
singled out guaranteed Medicaid coverage for disabled people who 
find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's start with that one, an easy one,'' Clinton said.  
``Congress should pass it and I will sign it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also renewed calls for an increase in the minimum wage,  
tighter gun controls, Medicare reforms including prescription drug 
coverage, tax credits for families in need of long-term care and 
child care, and the ``patients bill of rights'' for HMO members. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who returned this week from a trip to Europe that  
included a victory tour of the Balkans, also planned later today to 
hold his first news conference since March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back to Washington after my trip to Europe with a  
renewed energy for the domestic agenda,'' Clinton said. ``With our 
present prosperity, we actually have a rare opportunity to meet the 
remaining large challenges facing our country on the brink of a new 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who struggled for more than a year to be heard above  
the din of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, is trying to reassert his 
voice in America's political debate after the 11-week Kosovo 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	With the approach of the 2000 presidential race and lingering  
bitterness from the impeachment battle, the Republican-led Congress 
has received the president's proposals coolly. Even so, White House 
officials believe Clinton's poll-tested agenda could give Democrats 
political ammunition for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said it was Clinton who ``set the tone and path to 
partisanship'' on entitlement reform when he rejected earlier this 
year the recommendations of a bipartisan commission on Medicare's 
problems. ``The president rejected that report and chose to pursue 
a partisan course. That was one opportunity dashed,'' the GOP 
spokesman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Clinton next week would unveil an  
alternative Medicare proposal that would include prescription drug 
benefits for the elderly -- a proposal that could cost billions of 
dollars. Most recipients would have to pay a monthly premium to 
help cover the costs, although the White House said the poorest 
people would not have to pay the full premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats repeatedly have turned in election years to Medicare  
as an issue with which to flog Republicans. Eager to avoid more 
harm, the GOP is looking for its own plan, likely to be less costly 
than Clinton's. Lott has asked the Senate Finance Committee to 
consider a bipartisan proposal rejected by Clinton that would 
provide subsidized drug benefits only for those living near the 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides also are planning a whirlwind of presidential  
travel to raise his profile. He will appear in New York and 
Connecticut on Monday for political fund-raisers and then travel to 
Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning July 5, he will begin a tour of poverty pockets across  
America, stopping in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota, 
Arizona and California.

<HEADLINE> IBM Cuts 1,100 Silicon Valley Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- IBM plans to cut 1,100 jobs as the  
company moves some of its disk drive manufacturing operations to 
foreign countries to cut costs and streamline production. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM spokesman Dave Berman said Friday that the nation's leading  
information technology company -- with about 290,000 employees 
worldwide -- will manufacture the computer storage devices in 
Mexico, Hungary and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts represent 10 percent of IBM's Northern California work  
force. IBM's Storage Systems Division will remain headquartered in 
San Jose, with a focus on research and development. More customer 
and technical support jobs will be added, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts were first announced to employees last month on  
in-house bulletin boards, although at that time, IBM was not 
specific about how many jobs would be cut, nor who would be 
affected. Managers began telling staff members Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We let the people who were affected know that their positions  
were going to be eliminated,'' said Berman. ``Some percentage of 
them, I can't tell you how many, will find other jobs at IBM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the market is demanding more powerful and less  
expensive disk drives. Manufacturers are scrambling to cut costs 
and keep ahead as prices for computers steadily fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically there's been a lot of pressure in the hard disk  
drive business for the last year, and it has forced companies to 
rethink their strategy,'' said analyst David Bunzel at the Santa 
Clara Consulting Group. ``Obviously IBM thinks they can make these 
for less money overseas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Headquartered in Armonk, N.Y., IBM underwent a major  
restructuring in 1993 after laying off 100,000-plus employees over 
seven years. Since then, IBM's market worth has increased by more 
than $73 billion and layoffs have been rare. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is moving its tape drive assembly operations from San Jose  
to Guadalajara, Mexico. Other manufacturing operations are going to 
other sites in Mexico and Hungary. Only a few employees will be 
transferred to Fujisawa, Japan, where the server disk drive 
business is being moved. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers have two months to try for other jobs within IBM -- a  
difficult proposition for factory workers without advanced degrees. 
All are all regular, full-time workers in the storage division. The 
cuts should take a year to complete, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disk drives remain a $32.4 billion business in Silicon Valley,  
said Jim Porter, founder of the market research firm Disk/Trend 
Inc. in Mountain View. IBM's 27 percent share of the market brought 
$8.2 billion in revenues last year, most of it from sales of server 
drives.

<HEADLINE>  Penguins To Stay in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Many athletes frustrated by management or  
ownership have wanted to buy their team. Mario Lemieux is the first 
to actually do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux bought the Penguins out of bankruptcy on Thursday,  
keeping the two-time Stanley Cup champions in Pittsburgh and 
becoming the first big-name pro athlete to have a controlling 
interest in his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a different life, but one I'm looking forward  
to,'' Lemieux said after a federal judge approved his 
reorganization plan. ``I want to do this for 10, 15, 20 years. I'm 
not in this for the short term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan was approved in a 6 1/2-hour hearing in which U.S.  
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz barely mentioned an alternative 
plan offered by the NHL. That plan would have relocated the 
Penguins, possibly to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL general counsel William Daly expects swift approval from the  
league of Lemieux's takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux likely will gain control by July 15, although the judge  
strongly urged Lemieux and Civic Arena manager SMG to negotiate a 
new arena lease by then. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG, fearful it would be evicted from the arena it has managed  
for years after investing millions into the Penguins, argued 
against the Lemieux plan for hours, at times testing Markovitz's 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it your client really wants? Do you want this  
franchise terminated?'' Markovitz asked SMG lawyer Saul Burian. 
``Does your client want this team to leave this city?'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMG opposed the Lemieux plan after the two sides failed to  
negotiate a new lease despite lengthy negotiations that ended only 
hours before the hearing began. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz refused SMG's overtures to delay his ruling, saying  
the NHL needed to know the Penguins' future by Thursday so it could 
finalize plans for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan converts into equity $20 million of the $32.5  
million the team owed him in deferred compensation. He will get a 
$5 million payment from former co-owner Roger Marino, who has 
joined his group, and forgive the other $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also has raised $50 million in cash to operate the team  
and satisfy some debts. All but $12 million already is in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh also will pay $9 million a year for TV  
rights, with annual increases of 5 percent, and will post the 
Penguins' $10 million line of credit with the NHL. Fox Sports and 
SMG formerly were partners in an alternative reorganization plan, 
but Fox dropped out after reaching agreement with Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will be the Penguins' managing director, overseeing the  
franchise and sitting on the NHL Board of Governors, but leaving 
day-to-day operations to management. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to retain highly regarded general manager Craig  
Patrick and coach Kevin Constantine and will hire a chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also will push for a new arena to replace the  
38-year-old Civic Arena, the NHL's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to model ourselves after the best franchises in  
the NHL, like the Canadiens,'' Lemieux said. ``I think we're only 
3-4 players away from contending for the Stanley Cup again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux suggested he won't be the last player to become an  
owner, even if he was the first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot more players are going to get involved,'' he  
said. ``John Elway maybe with the Los Angeles (expansion) group; 
Michael Jordan had a chance to buy into a team. I'm sure Wayne 
Gretzky will get involved with a franchise. The way players are 
making a lot of money, I'm sure more of them will be buying into 
franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will now begin to implement the changes he has  
envisioned since deciding months ago to pursue the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	He will increase the payroll from about $24 million to more than  
$30 million next season, partly because star Jaromir Jagr's 
contract jumps to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, attending the NHL's awards banquet in Toronto, was excited  
that his former linemate now is his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey wouldn't be in Pittsburgh without Mario,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also plans to cut ticket prices that have jumped into  
the upper tier of a league that relies heavily on ticket revenue to 
offset relatively low TV network income. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lemieux does not plan to lose substantial sums of money,  
partly because he has a large sum of his own money invested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in it to make money, but I'm not in it to lose  
money,'' Lemieux said. ``We want to make sure the Penguins stay 
here. They've been a big part of my life and my success ... I 
wanted to do it to repay the Penguins.''

<HEADLINE> First Heisman Winner Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Jay Berwanger won the first Heisman Trophy in  
1935 without a glitzy public relations campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have his University of Chicago highlights shown on  
television. Nor did he have gaudy statistics by modern standards: 
577 rushing yards, 406 passing yards, 359 yards on kickoff returns, 
six touchdowns and five PATs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was enough to inaugurate an exclusive club.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, his 85th birthday, Berwanger was honored by other Heisman  
winners at the start of the second Husker-Heisman Weekend, a 
charity event organized by 1972 winner Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger sat with Rodgers, 1978 Heisman winner Billy Sims of  
Oklahoma, 1980 runner-up Hugh Green of Pittsburgh and former 
Nebraska players Willie Harper and Ahman Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one regret I had, I wish some of you boys with your size  
would have been playing with me,'' Berwanger said, standing with 
stooped shoulders. ``It would have made it easier to get around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger played nearly every position in the days before  
platoon football. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know any better,'' he said. ``I loved playing  
defense as much as offense. Today's platoon system lets more 
players play, so it's good for the game and good for colleges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Berwanger was more excited about winning the Silver  
Football, a trophy that had been given in the Chicago area about 10 
years. The Downtown Athletic Club award, as the Heisman was then 
called, was an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Chicago Tribune, there was an article that big,''  
Berwanger said, holding his thumb and finger two inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Word arrived via telegram at Berwanger's fraternity house,  
congratulating him for being named the nation's top player and 
advising that two tickets to New York were coming in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thrill was that it was going to be my first  
airplane trip,'' Berwanger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger, who grew up in Dubuque, Iowa, never played  
professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't paying enough money,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He tried newspaper work and officiating football but worked most  
of his life for a rubber company. 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger now lives in Oakbrook, Ill., where he enthusiastically  
follows college football and, like other Heisman winners, casts a 
ballot every fall in the Heisman Trophy voting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been lucky,'' he said with a smile. ``I've picked the  
right one the last four or five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berwanger also tries to attend the Heisman ceremony that now is  
broadcast live on television. He said he has met many winners, and 
this weekend he plans to catch up with others at autograph 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some standouts expected in Omaha this weekend include 1980  
Heisman winner George Rogers of South Carolina, 1997 winner Charles 
Woodson of Michigan and last year's winner, Ricky Williams of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Rozier, who won the 1983 Heisman at Nebraska, is holding a  
charity golf event, former Nebraska tackle Eric Anderson has a 
youth football camp and a dinner is planned with Husker coach Frank 
Solich and former coach Tom Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers said the event raised $5,000 for Omaha youth charities  
last year.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed May Shed $1B in Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Reports that Lockheed Martin Corp. may sell off businesses worth  
at least $1 billion drew praise Friday from analysts who said the 
huge defense contractor needs to move aggressively to improve 
profits and restore investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is pleasant news to see that the company is taking  
aggressive action to get the business back into fighting shape,'' 
said Peter Jacobs, analyst for Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs and Christopher MecCray of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown in  
Baltimore said it was clear from a telephone conference call with 
Lockheed Martin executives June 9 that the company was considering 
shedding some of its units after two consecutive quarters of 
losses. The company also has had four failed satellite launches in 
the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important, from a perception standpoint at least, to  
reassure investors they are doing everything they can to turn the 
company around and achieve the returns they have targeted,'' 
MecCray said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed  
sources close to the company, reported Friday that Lockheed 
executives want to sell units worth at least $1 billion. The 
Bethesda, Md.-based company employs more than 161,000 people 
worldwide and had sales of more than $26 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	James Fetig, a company spokesman, confirmed that the board of  
directors was meeting Friday, but would not say what was on the 
agenda. He also would not comment on reports that assets would be 
sold and that the target is $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetig said Lockheed is undergoing a comprehensive review of its  
operations and organization that is expected to take several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal said the defense company may consider  
selling its military-aircraft electronics business as well as parts 
of an information services unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post said prime targets for divestiture include  
the company's business managing federal laboratories and a unit 
that makes automation equipment for the U.S. Postal Service. The 
Post said Lockheed is not likely to touch its military aircraft 
manufacturing unit or the divisions that build and launch 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	MecCray and Jacobs said they have been expecting Lockheed to  
unload some of its operations but were surprised at the $1 billion 
cited by the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's higher than I would have thought, and I view that as a  
positive,'' Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the businesses being reviewed -- information  
services, energy and environmental subsidiaries -- those are natural 
candidates to be divested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	MecCray said after several years of rapid growth through  
large-scale acquisitions and mergers, it was time for Lockheed 
Martin to consolidate its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, you can criticize management for not doing it  
sooner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's stock is down 31 percent in the last year . It  
dropped 16.5 percent after the June 9 announcement that the company 
would post an unexpected loss this quarter and anticipated 
disappointing profits over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed rose 68 3/4 cents a share to $35.87 1/2 in trading Friday on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally  
lower Friday, with share prices slumping in Tokyo and Taipei on the 
back of an overnight fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost  
191.80 points, or 1.09 percent, to close at 17,436.52. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 41.57 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold shares of banks and technology companies  
following the overnight steep fall in New York, where the Dow Jones 
industrial average fell 132.03, or 1.2 percent, to 10,534.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Exchange of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 1.72 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,409.41. The 
TOPIX closed up 1.95 points, or 0.14 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.52 yen by late  
afternoon, down 0.38 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below 
its late New York level of 121.78 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Taiwan closed sharply lower, with the key index  
tumbling almost four percent following losses on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index fell 323.35  
points or 3.8 percent, to 8,265.96. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stock markets are regarded as a market barometer for the  
Taipei bourse due to the close manufacturing ties between Taiwan 
companies and industry giants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly higher after two  
straight sessions of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index edged up 4.39 points, or 0.03  
percent, closing at 13,784.51. On Thursday, the index had slumped 
195.92 points, or 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers attributed the upturn to selective bargain-hunting  
following losses in share prices in the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of next week's  
meeting of the U.S. rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still very much worried about interest rates,''  
said Vincent Cheung, sales manager at Sassoon Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The NZSE-40  
Capital Index rose 17.99 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,147.67. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on renewed concerns that  
the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee may go through with 
a larger-than-expected interest rate increase next week. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) fell 34.55 
points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,463.98. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed marginally lower. The  
benchmark All Ordinaries Index closed at 2,960.0, down a meager 0.3 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock  
Price Index rose 4.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 882.08. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Singapore shares closed mostly lower on  
profit-taking. The Straits Times Index fell 13.09 points, or 0.5 
percent, to 2,178.64. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices closed higher, keeping the index  
firmly above the 800-point level. The Composite Index, which tracks 
100 blue-chip stocks, rose 4.51 points, or 0.5 percent, to 806.23. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower on profit-taking. The  
Composite Index fell 1.3 percent, or 8.964 points, to 673.155. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed marginally lower. The Stock  
Exchange of Thailand (SET) index slipped 0.12 points to 543.85.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton News Conference-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's news conference Friday, as  
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	All of our people are for it. We've got 100 percent of the  
Democrats in the Senate for it. And so, what I think we have to do 
is to keep it on the front burner enough so that the discomfort 
level rises high enough that an actual vote is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	All I've really asked for here is a vote. If we'd just get a  
vote on the bill, I will be very well satisfied and I think it'll 
come out just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Can I ask a political question? When Vice President Gore  
announced officially for president he chose a date when you were 
going to be out of the country. And according to Mrs. Clinton's 
supporters, if she announces her exploratory committee in the next 
couple of weeks it would be at a time when you've got a commitment 
to go out to South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Do you think your personal behavior has made you something of a  
liability to those who are running? And did you take any -- take it 
personally when Vice President Gore made his announcement and 
seemed to set himself so clearly separate from you when it came to 
issues of family? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, I thought, as I have said  
repeatedly, I thought the vice president had a great announcement. 
And what he really said in his announcement -- I actually heard it, 
so I don't have to have it characterized for me -- what he said in 
his announcement was that he had had more experience than anybody 
running, which is true; that he would put forward more specific 
ideas about what he will do if he were elected president than 
anyone has to date, by far, which is true; and that the choice 
before the American people was whether we would build on the 
progress that we've made for the last six years or turn around and 
go backwards, which is what I think the real choice will be before 
the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	So I approve of that. And as far his doing when I was out of the  
country, I thought that was a good thing. Very often, you'd be 
amazed how many times over the last six and a half years we have 
planned for certain announcements to be made by the vice president 
when I was out of the country because that way it gets -- I mean, 
far be it from us to try to maneuver the press -- but he gets more 
... (LAUGHTER) ... he gets ... he gets better coverage and I get 
better coverage when I'm out of the country, and he gets better 
coverage. So I thought that was a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	And I think on the general point, what I have noticed over now  
more than 30 years since I first began to volunteer as a young man 
in politics, all politics, all elections are about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	And all candidates are judged on their own merits. And I believe  
that is the case here. But I think that the American people know 
that the country's in good shape and that not only our economic 
policies, our crime policies and our welfare policies, but our 
family policies are good for their efforts to raise their children. 
</P>
<P>
	And the best thing that I can do it seems to me is to do the  
right thing by country, to just keep working at being a good 
president, and they'll do fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Not be with Mrs. Clinton when she campaigns?  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, she hasn't made a decision to  
announce to run for the Senate. This is not what's going on here. 
And as a practical matter logistically and legally, as a practical 
matter, she has to have an exploratory committee to continue to 
talk to people in New York about this. That's all this is. She has 
not made a final decision to run yet. So I think that's a whole 
different issue, and I think that you should look at it in that 
context. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, considering what's going on in Kosovo now, and  
now that you've had a chance to meet with the refugees in Macedonia 
on Tuesday and you've heard the depth of the hatred that they feel 
for the Serbs, and you've heard of the brutality to which they were 
subjected, is it not asking the impossible for the Serbs and the 
ethic Albanians to live in peace in Kosovo? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I don't think they could do it without a lot of  
help in the short run. And I think that -- you know, I was asked 
this question earlier, slightly different question. 
</P>
<P>
	I think that the first and most important thing is for us to get  
the whole KFOR force in there, all 50,000, as quickly as possible, 
properly deployed to maximize security. Then I think we've got to 
get people busy doing positive things, rebuilding their homes, 
re-establishing their property records, re-establishing their 
schools. You know, we've got to give them something to think about 
on a daily basis that is positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Then I strongly believe we need to give them the help they need  
to try to work through this emotionally and psychologically, 
spiritually, morally. I think a lot of these children are going to 
need the mental health services, and I hope that we can get them. 
</P>
<P>
	I think that we need to bring people in who have been through  
similar things. I had a long talk with Elie Wiesel about this after 
he came back. You know, he went over and toured the camps for me 
and talked to the people. 
</P>
<P>
	I think that there are people who went through the Holocaust who  
can help a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	I think there are people who have been through South Africa and  
the Peace and Reconciliation Commission and 300 years of what those 
people went through there who can help a lot. I think we need to be 
quite imaginative about, once we get the building blocks of 
security and the building blocks of reconstruction in place and the 
building blocks of civil society in place, then I think we need to 
be quite imaginative about the human, spiritual dimension of this. 
</P>
<P>
	And I will do my best to be supportive. I've talked to Rev.  
Jackson about this, about the importance of bringing in religious 
leaders from all the -- not only from the Muslim and the Orthodox 
states to come and work together and work people through this, but 
perhaps others as well. So, there are lots of things that we need 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Can it be done? I believe it can be done. It's going to take a  
lot of courage and it's going to take some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, while we're talking about this subject and  
planning a future for the country, it seems to me that one of our 
big issues is parenting. 
</P>
<P>
	It causes divorces and it causes unhappy children and the  
break-up of families. Is there any way that we can design a 
national program to correct or to educate people to be better 
parents?

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton News Conference-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's news conference Friday, as  
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	But we signed an agreement with the KLA in which they agreed to  
demilitarize. The leader even asked the Serbs to come home. And we 
are deploying our people as quickly as can. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, the more we -- if we could get all of our people in  
completely and then get them properly dispersed around the country, 
we'll be able to provide a far higher level of protection. And I 
think it's very important. And for those people who lose their 
homes, they're entitled to have them rebuilt along with everybody 
else, and I intend to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, you covered the waterfront on domestic issues  
you think are very important, but there is the question of racism. 
And I understand there's a report in the White House, already in 
second draft, and it's supposed to be a political hot potato and 
therefore you're hesitant to make it public. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Oh, no, that's not what's going on. There is a -- there  
is a draft of a book that I wanted to produce and asked for help on 
from Chris Edley and from others on our staff and not on our staff, 
several months ago. And Chris gave me his draft, then the staff 
looked at it and talked about where it was or wasn't consistent 
with present policies we are pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
	They gave it all to me. I was involved for the last three months  
with the conflict in Kosovo. And what really happened is that I 
want to do this right. I think all of you know how important this 
whole race issue is to me. And it's been amplified in its potential 
future import because of the problems we see involving race and 
ethnic and religious problems around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	So I want to make sure that when we put this document out it is  
in the form of a book which can be useful and have something to 
say, and move the conversation and the efforts beyond where we were 
in the presidential initiative on race. 
</P>
<P>
	So you shouldn't draw any conclusions other than that I want to  
be personally involved in it, and I simply haven't had the time to 
give it the effort that it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: (off microphone).  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Oh yes, to some extent it's based on the panel's  
hearings. It's based on very long conversations I had with the 
people that worked on the draft for me, with Mr. Edley and Terry 
Edmonds and others. 
</P>
<P>
	And we had some long, long sessions. I went through everything I  
wanted in the book. I went through some things I wanted to 
emphasize more than were emphasized in the year that the panel was 
publicly meeting and we were having the race dialogues. 
</P>
<P>
	But I think it's very important, but it's got to be first of all  
mine. It's got to reflect what I believe and where I think we need 
to go. And secondly, it needs to move the ball forward a little 
bit. There's still a great deal of interest in this. Those of you 
who covered the speech this morning at Georgetown will remember 
that the young woman from Alabama who introduced me talked about 
how the initiative on race got her involved in something in her 
local community. Another one of the presidential scholars, when she 
walked by me this morning said, I want to know how I can get 
involved, and I'm still interested in this. 
</P>
<P>
	So I think there's still a great deal of interest in this in the  
country, and maybe especially among our younger people. And I just 
want this book to be very good. So, you shouldn't -- yes, there's 
some differences of opinion among the people who had input in it. 
But that's not what's caused us not to put it out. What's caused us 
not to put it out is that I have not had the time to give to it and 
to be very careful and relaxed and thoughtful about how I say what 
it is I want to say to the country about this. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, this morning -- and again just now -- you made  
references to a summer of progress and you were calling for 
bipartisanship to try to accomplish things in the next few months. 
I'm just wondering with the 2000 campaign obviously heating up and 
growing in intensity, do you feel there's more of an urgency to act 
right away, within the coming months? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I think -- for one thing -- I think it would be to  
everyone's advantage to continue to make progress. As I always tell 
Republicans and Democrats, no matter how much we do, there will 
still be plenty of things on which there is honest disagreement 
over which the next election can be fought. That is just in the 
nature of things. 
</P>
<P>
	That's healthy. That's good. That's the two-party system in  
America. 
</P>
<P>
	But we are all hired by the American people to work here day in  
and day out, week in and week out, and we make a grave mistake -- 
and it's almost never good politics to do the wrong thing, that is, 
to take a pass on making progress when you can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	And this is a very unusual moment where we have sustained  
prosperity -- the longest peacetime expansion in our history. We've 
gone from having the biggest deficits in history to having the 
biggest surpluses in history. And yet, we have these looming 
demographic challenges of Social Security and Medicare and we have 
these big issues that are right before us now -- the ones that I 
mentioned on which there was basically broad agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	So I think that it would be good for America and therefore good  
for everyone involved if we go ahead and do this. And I think that, 
obviously, the closer you get to the election, perhaps the more 
difficult it will be. But I expect -- I'll make a prediction here -- 
I expect that we'll get some good things done in the year 2000 
before the Congress recesses finally for the election then. 
</P>
<P>
	I expect to keep working right up to the very end, and I think  
that we will continue to make progress. But the most important 
thing is the attitude of the main players in Congress, insofar as 
Congress has to play a role in this. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, in the wake of Rep. Christopher Cox's study of  
spying in the U.S., and specifically Chinese attempts to spy, you 
asked your Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board to look into this 
and it came back with a central recommendation to separate the 
nation's nuclear labs from the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Your energy secretary seems to be resisting that. Ask me, sir, --  
tell me, sir, how you feel about it. And let me ask you once again, 
do you still maintain that you were not told anything about these 
Chinese efforts to spy at the nation's nuclear labs during your 
administration, sir? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Let me ask -- let's go back to the first question. There  
are two separate questions. I read Senator Rudman's report, I 
thought it was quite interesting and had a lot of very helpful 
analysis of how this problem developed. And there were actually two 
separate organizational recommendations that they made, in the 
alternative -- either that the labs could be put under an 
independent board or that the labs should be taken out of the 
present hierarchy of organization because of the culture within the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rudman group talked a lot about the culture of the labs and  
its resistance to oversight. He said another alternative might be 
to take it out from under the present organizational structure and 
make it directly answerable, the labs directly answerable to the 
secretary's office.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Commodity Futures Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has nominated financier  
William J. Rainer to be the new chairman of the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission, an independent federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer has been a campaign fund-raiser for Clinton. He also  
served as chairman of U.S. Enrichment Corp., established by 
Congress to sell the government's uranium stockpile, from 1994 to 
1998, when it was privatized. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer was a bond dealer in New York and London for former Wall  
Street firm Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co. during the 1970s. He later 
co-founded Greenwich Capital Markets Inc., where he was managing 
director from 1981 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is confirmed by the Senate, Rainer's term at the CFTC  
would run through April 2004. He would take the helm at a time when 
Congress is considering changing, or possibly reducing, the 
agency's areas of jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House announced the nomination Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The previous chairwoman, Brooksley Born, recently left the  
agency and returned to private law practice after deciding not to 
seek a second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Born got caught up in a flap over the near-collapse of a  
huge private investment fund, Long-Term Capital Management. In 
November, a news report indicated she had knowledge that the hedge 
fund was dangerously leveraged in March 1998, months before it 
nearly collapsed and threatened to disrupt world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue surfaced, Ms. Born insisted she was given  
outdated annual information about Long-Term Capital in March that 
offered no hint of the potential for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer, who lives in Santa Fe, N.M., has a bachelor of arts  
degree and a master's in business administration from Southern 
Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC, established in 1974, regulates U.S. commodity futures  
and related options markets.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 17.73 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended the quietest session of 1999  
with mixed results Friday as optimism about second-quarter earnings 
gave way to nagging concerns about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended just 17.73 higher at  
10,552.56, paring most of its 115-point gain earlier in the 
session. The blue-chip index shed 303 points, or 2.8 percent, 
during the week, as investors worried about interest rates and 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also turned lower late in the day. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 0.47 to 1,315.31, and the Nasdaq 
composite index fell 1.34 to 2,552.65. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fairly frustrating market,'' said Barry Hyman,  
senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices initially rose Friday after the Commerce Department  
reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 4.3 percent annual rate in 
the first quarter, slightly better than the 4.1 percent estimated 
in May. The report of a stronger than expected economy could have 
stirred fears of inflation, but investors seemed to interpret the 
report as portending healthy second-quarter corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started out well based on the economic news, but there was  
simply no strong follow-through,'' said Tony Cecin, director of 
institutional trading at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks faltered after Merrill Lynch Internet analyst  
Henry Blodget issued a report saying America Online may not beat 
analysts' earnings estimates by the huge margins it has in past 
quarters. AOL fell 3 15/16 to 102 13/16, pulling down most of the 
Internet sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the slumping market made room for a big new initial public  
offering. Juniper Networks Inc., a provider of Internet 
infrastructure, was priced at 34 and closed at 98 7/8, a gain of 191 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was paltry throughout the session. Traders said the  
sluggishness was typical of a summer Friday, but was especially low 
as investors awaited the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open 
Market Committee next Tuesday and Wednesday. The Fed is widely 
expected to raise rates next week in an effort to slow the economy 
and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to go into this weekend with a major new  
position,'' Cecin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got some support from a modest improvement in the bond  
market. The Treasury's 30-year bond carried a yield of 6.15 
percent, down from late Thursday's 6.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While most sectors were mixed, some individual stocks  
flourished. Alcoa was the strongest component of the Dow, rising 2 1/4 
to 62 5/8 after a Merrill Lynch analyst raised his price target on the 
stock, citing better-than-expected aluminum prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain high-tech and financial stocks that had been depressed  
by the recent selloff recovered a bit. IBM rose 9/16 to 123 1/8. J.P. 
Morgan gained 1 1/16 to close at 128 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin, which announced plans to sell $1 billion in  
assets, rose 11/16 to 35 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts said most stocks are stalled as investors await  
the Fed's meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, the market should start to focus on earnings  
rather than interest rates,'' Hyman said. ``Strong earnings should 
start a fairly good rally, and if we don't get one, the market will 
have something to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, with 1,491 up, 1,456 down and 592 unchanged. 
Consolidated NYSE volume totaled 750.45 million shares, compared 
with 834.31 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.63 to 623.34, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.87 to 772.02. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.05 to 443.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.09 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.2 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 0.3 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 closed down 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Penguins To Stay in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Many athletes frustrated by management or  
ownership have wanted to buy their team. Mario Lemieux is the first 
to actually do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux bought the Penguins out of bankruptcy on Thursday,  
keeping the two-time Stanley Cup champions in Pittsburgh and 
becoming the first big-name pro athlete to have a controlling 
interest in his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a different life, but one I'm looking forward  
to,'' Lemieux said after a federal judge approved his 
reorganization plan. ``I want to do this for 10, 15, 20 years. I'm 
not in this for the short term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan was approved in a 6 1/2-hour hearing in which U.S.  
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz barely mentioned an alternative 
plan offered by the NHL. That plan would have relocated the 
Penguins, possibly to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL general counsel William Daly expects swift approval from the  
league of Lemieux's takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux likely will gain control by July 15, although the judge  
strongly urged Lemieux and Civic Arena manager SMG to negotiate a 
new arena lease by then. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG, fearful it would be evicted from the arena it has managed  
for years after investing millions into the Penguins, argued 
against the Lemieux plan for hours, at times testing Markovitz's 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it your client really wants? Do you want this  
franchise terminated?'' Markovitz asked SMG lawyer Saul Burian. 
``Does your client want this team to leave this city?'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMG opposed the Lemieux plan after the two sides failed to  
negotiate a new lease despite lengthy negotiations that ended only 
hours before the hearing began. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz refused SMG's overtures to delay his ruling, saying  
the NHL needed to know the Penguins' future by Thursday so it could 
finalize plans for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan converts into equity $20 million of the $32.5  
million the team owed him in deferred compensation. He will get a 
$5 million payment from former co-owner Roger Marino, who has 
joined his group, and forgive the other $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also has raised $50 million in cash to operate the team  
and satisfy some debts. All but $12 million already is in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh also will pay $9 million a year for TV  
rights, with annual increases of 5 percent, and will post the 
Penguins' $10 million line of credit with the NHL. Fox Sports and 
SMG formerly were partners in an alternative reorganization plan, 
but Fox dropped out after reaching agreement with Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will be the Penguins' managing director, overseeing the  
franchise and sitting on the NHL Board of Governors, but leaving 
day-to-day operations to management. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to retain highly regarded general manager Craig  
Patrick and coach Kevin Constantine and will hire a chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also will push for a new arena to replace the  
38-year-old Civic Arena, the NHL's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to model ourselves after the best franchises in  
the NHL, like the Canadiens,'' Lemieux said. ``I think we're only 
3-4 players away from contending for the Stanley Cup again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux suggested he won't be the last player to become an  
owner, even if he was the first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot more players are going to get involved,'' he  
said. ``John Elway maybe with the Los Angeles (expansion) group; 
Michael Jordan had a chance to buy into a team. I'm sure Wayne 
Gretzky will get involved with a franchise. The way players are 
making a lot of money, I'm sure more of them will be buying into 
franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will now begin to implement the changes he has  
envisioned since deciding months ago to pursue the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	He will increase the payroll from about $24 million to more than  
$30 million next season, partly because star Jaromir Jagr's 
contract jumps to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, attending the NHL's awards banquet in Toronto, was excited  
that his former linemate now is his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey wouldn't be in Pittsburgh without Mario,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also plans to cut ticket prices that have jumped into  
the upper tier of a league that relies heavily on ticket revenue to 
offset relatively low TV network income. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lemieux does not plan to lose substantial sums of money,  
partly because he has a large sum of his own money invested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in it to make money, but I'm not in it to lose  
money,'' Lemieux said. ``We want to make sure the Penguins stay 
here. They've been a big part of my life and my success ... I 
wanted to do it to repay the Penguins.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis Juror Doesn't Regret Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A juror in the Reggie Lewis malpractice trial said  
Friday that the deadlocked panel voted 9-6 on their final ballot to 
clear Dr. Gilbert Mudge of charges he was negligent in the care of 
the NBA All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Marian Regan told The Boston Globe that alleged cocaine use was  
not an issue in the jury's deliberations. Instead, she said, jurors 
focused on the medical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	And Regan, who voted in favor of Mudge, said the evidence  
convinced her that the doctor treated Lewis appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't Dr. Mudge's fault,'' Regan said of Lewis' death.  
``It wasn't Reggie Lewis' fault. I just don't feel he was 
negligent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly two-month-long trial against the renowned  
cardiologist ended in a mistrial Thursday after jurors said twice 
they could not reach a verdict. Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, 
had accused Mudge of mistreating and misdiagnosing the former 
Boston Celtics captain before he died after shooting baskets in 
July 1993 at age 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan said evidence introduced by Mudge's attorneys of alleged  
cocaine use by Lewis was not credible. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no substantiated proof so I didn't even use it in my  
deliberations,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge had testified that Lewis admitted shortly before his death  
that he had used cocaine, making an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
Harris-Lewis denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan said the jury needed only one vote to decide that  
consultant Dr. Mark Creager was not negligent. Jurors voted twice 
before concluding that the second consultant in the trial, Dr. 
Peter Friedman, was not negligent. A majority on the first vote 
sided with Friedman with just one or two of the 15 considering 
themselves undecided, she said. By the second vote, it was 
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, jurors concluded the doctors were ``just  
consultants'' who had no direct responsibility for Lewis' medical 
care, Regan said. That, she said, was Mudge's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	For a verdict to have been reached, 13 of the 15 jurors would  
have had to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mudge, the jurors voted four times, Regan said. The first  
vote showed the jury split evenly, with several members saying they 
were undecided. As discussion continued over the following days, 
the panel, which deliberated for 35 hours over six days, finally 
split into an irrevocable 9-6 division, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, juror Iris Mederos said the panel did the right  
thing in not reaching a verdict on whether Mudge was negligent in 
caring for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any regrets about the decision because I think  
that we did the best job we could,'' Mederos told WFXT-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Mederos, who did not say which way she voted, did not discuss  
specifics of the jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Harley, an attorney for Harris-Lewis, said Friday they  
were considering appealing the jury's decision to clear Creager and 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	Harley's comments came during a news conference at which he said  
Harris-Lewis is still determined to bring the case against Mudge to 
trial again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donna wants justice. Donna wants closure, and this is not  
closure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993 and was  
diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially career-ending 
cardiac condition by a ``Dream Team'' of top doctors from New 
England Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who announced at a news conference the player instead had 
a neurological ailment that causes fainting spells, and said Lewis 
would likely play professional basketball again.

<HEADLINE> Presbyterians Reject Gay Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Presbyterian leaders Friday rejected a  
measure that could have opened the door to the ordination of 
non-celibate gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual meeting of the 2.6-million-member Presbyterian  
Church (U.S.A), delegates decided 389 to 198 not to allow the 
church's regional governing bodies to vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the vote ends an attempt to strike the constitutional  
clause that requires clergy to maintain ``fidelity within the 
covenant of marriage between a man and a woman, or chastity in 
singleness.'' That prohibits single, non-celibate heterosexuals or 
homosexuals from being ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gays must remain celibate if they wish to be ministers because  
the church does not recognize homosexual marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether sexually active homosexuals should lead within the  
church has been debated for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a church committee voted 24-14 to strike the clause.  
To go into effect, the decision needed the approval of the majority 
of the nation's 173 presbyteries, or regional governing bodies, 
which are made up of ministers and elders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the church's General Assembly voted against allowing  
the constitutional question to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the General Assembly decided not to revisit the  
issue, but a number of disciplinary cases in the church courts gave 
the matter more prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Stephen Moss of Salisbury, N.C., opposed a change in  
the constitution and stressed that the clause does not deal only 
with homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is also about not ordaining heterosexual sex outside the  
bounds of marriage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	David White, a youth advisory delegate from St. Augustine, Fla.,  
broke down in tears as he urged church members to try to amend the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to deal with it. We can't keep pushing it off,  
pushing it off. We can't discriminate no matter what,'' White said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Face Lie Detector Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Amid the uproar over Chinese espionage,  
scientists at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory are being 
told their loyalty is not in question, but still many of them will 
soon be subject to lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Energy Secretary Bill Richardson came to the laboratory  
where a half century ago the atomic bomb was born, he was 
confronted with the question: Shouldn't he be tested too? 
</P>
<P>
	``Will you lead by example and take a polygraph yourself?'' one  
of the scientists asked as Richardson invited questions Thursday in 
an auditorium packed with more than 600 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might,'' replied the energy secretary, former U.N.  
ambassador and seven-term congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	There was laughter, but no satisfaction.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not until the last question, when a woman stood and made  
clear the matter wasn't going to be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	She wanted to know if an employee of 25 years were asked to  
subject herself to a lie detector test under threat of being 
removed from her job and replied ``I might,'' would that be greeted 
with laughter? 
</P>
<P>
	She repeated the question.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm prepared to take it,'' Richardson finally answered,  
somewhat taken aback by the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson tried to assure the laboratory workers that the tests  
would be ``focused'' to specific questions to root out potential 
espionage and avoid questions into people's ``lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we do it we're going to do it properly,'' he insisted.  
Only two other agencies use polygraphs on workers -- the CIA and the 
National Security Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, on a short flight from Los Alamos to the Sandia National  
Laboratory outside Albuquerque, Richardson said he had no problem 
with taking a polygraph test, but thought saying so would take 
attention away from the issue he had come to talk about: concern 
that the Asian Americans are being subjected to unfair 
guilt-by-association and facing possible discrimination because of 
all the Chinese espionage talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asian Americans feel their patriotism is being questioned ...  
and that their careers will suffer as a result,'' he said. In 
remarks to workers at both Los Alamos and Sandia, Richardson vowed 
to aggressively combat any discrimination against the Asian 
American scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	While the issue confronting Asian American scientists -- about 3  
percent of the Los Alamos work force -- prompted a number of 
questions, clearly the issue uppermost on many of the scientists 
minds was the call for polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you willing to lose your job if you fail your polygraph?''  
a Los Alamos worker asked. Another wanted to know why political 
appointees are exempt, but as many as 5,000 scientists and other 
Energy Department employees with top secret clearance will have to 
take the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will your boss take a polygraph,'' came a voice from the  
audience, prompting an outburst of laughter. ``I knew there was one 
Republican in here,'' Richardson replied. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to criticism of lax security at weapons labs, the  
Energy Department has said it will begin widespread polygraph 
testing as early as August with as many as 2,500 people possibly 
tested over the first year, although critics suggest that is overly 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Curran, the DOE's top counterintelligence officer, said  
the tests would be earmarked for people with top secret ``Q'' 
clearance, including most of the weapons scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Much like the Los Alamos workers, those at Sandia were also  
distressed about the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is concerned about security more than I am,'' Alan  
Zelicoff, a scientist at Sandia, told Richardson. But he said 
widespread polygraph testing was ``a divisive tool (that) will 
undoubtedly harm individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will be errors in the testing and ``it means dozens or  
perhaps hundreds of people will suffer,'' he feared.

<HEADLINE> Duncan: A Boring, But Dominant MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He didn't wag his tongue or seal it with a  
memorable jumper while holding his shooting hand aloft for history 
to remember. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan did it his way: matter-of-factly, showing more  
substance than flash, with no need for nicknames, jewelry or 
anything but his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, the most valuable of San Antonio's Twin Towers, scored  
31 points in another dominant performance Friday night to lead the 
San Antonio Spurs to their first NBA title in his second season in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be extremely difficult for me to put into words  
how this feels,'' said Duncan, whose game is playing, not talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan topped 30 points for the second time in the series,  
making all the important shots as the Spurs beat the New York 
Knicks 78-77. He averaged 24 points and 17 rebounds in the series, 
lifting himself and the Spurs to the level that not even George 
``Iceman'' Gervin and his high-scoring cohorts did for San Antonio 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing even remotely '80s, or even '90s, about Duncan,  
a native of the quiet Virgin Islands. He describes himself as a 
``boring guy,'' admits disliking the big, sprawling, noisy city 
that is New York. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no more clamorous, distracting place to have to win a  
championship, and even the low-key Duncan seemed to warm to the 
place. When Latrell Sprewell -- Duncan's controversial, notorious 
rival in this game -- missed his last two shots, Duncan jumped 
around and hugged as many teammates as he could find. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's about as much emotion as you're going to see out of  
him,'' Spurs forward Sean Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' Duncan said when asked how he would  
celebrate the championship. ``I'll just celebrate as much as 
possible until I have to be in training camp in a couple of 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a year after Michael Jordan sealed his career with that  
memorable shot in Game 6 in Utah, a new star is born -- with a much 
different style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duncan won the MVP? Really?'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said  
facetiously. ``That's a shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a serious note, Van Gundy said, ``Sometimes you can watch a  
guy play and know if he's really into winning or not. That guy's 
truly into winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now they are talking about Duncan and saying he is the best  
player in the game. There was no one left at the end of this 
inexplicable season who was better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incredible honor,'' Duncan said. ``But all it means is  
that they're going to come at you harder next time. All you do is 
get a high off it all summer and come back at it next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This tells you all you need to know about Duncan and his style.  
He filmed the postgame celebration with a mini-camcorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just making records for myself,'' the low-key Duncan said.  
``It's a blessing to do what we did here, and there's no guarantee 
we'll ever get back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, Duncan might want to hang on to that camcorder.

<HEADLINE> Pincay Wins Jockey Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) -- Hall of Famer Laffit Pincay Jr.'s  
third-place finish in the last race aboard Brave Pancho was enough 
to earn him the NTRA All-Star Jockey Championship at Lone Star Park 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay, who earned $18,000, won the first race and also had a  
fourth-place finish as he compiled 19 points, claiming the bronze 
statue of a jockey riding a horse which is given to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was riding for my life down the stretch,'' Pincay said. ``I  
knew I finished third but I was hoping I had enough points to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay, the only rider to win five Eclipse Awards, had plenty.  
Corey Lanerie was second with 13 points, while Kent Desormeaux, Pat 
Day and Shane Sellers each had 12. Desormeaux claimed the 
tie-breaker by winning aboard Caro's Royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition got off to a rough start when Alex Solis Jr. was  
unseated by Daggett Peak in a collision with a horse ridden by 
Jerry Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay dodged the collision and scored the first 12 points of  
the night with a victory aboard Gold Nugget. Solis shook off his 
bone-jarring fall and rode again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I beat everybody but the riderless horse,'' Pincay laughed,  
referring to second betting favorite Daggett Peak which finished 
ahead of the pack without Solis in the turf race over 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky I landed on my head,'' Solis joked. ``It was a  
rough landing but I'm OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers, the defending champion, struck quickly by guiding  
Lightening Ball to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw him on paper I knew he would be good,'' Sellers  
said. ``If you draw the right horse they are going to get you home. 
He was the best horse in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Day booted home Bayou Brass in the sixth race to make it a wide  
open championship going into the fourth and final race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayou Brass came from behind in the five-furlong race to beat  
Bailey aboard Super Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was running for second money but my horse got the  
job done,'' Day said. 
</P>
<P>
	The riding assignments were drawn at random and they received  
points for finishing first (12 points), second (6), third (4) and 
fourth (3) in four different races. 
</P>
<P>
	One percent of the total handle from the four races benefited  
the National Jockeys' Guild which helps disabled and injured 
jockeys. Over $200,000 was raised the first two years as Hall of 
Famer Gary Stevens won in 1997 and Sellers dominated last year by 
winning three of four races. 
</P>
<P>
	Lone Star Park hosted the event in conjunction with the National  
Thoroughbred Racing Association and the Jockeys' Guild. It was 
televised on ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockeys were selected by a panel of experts headed by Bill  
Shoemaker, racing's career leader, who was an honored guest at the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of glad I'm not riding anymore,'' Shoemaker said.  
``These guys are too good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay is 82 wins shy of Shoemaker's record of 8,750 wins.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was very special for me to win with Shoemaker here,''  
Pincay said. ``The record is my next goal.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Broadcaster Faces Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs radio broadcaster Ron Santo will  
undergo heart bypass surgery Monday at Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cubs third baseman suffered a mild heart attack on  
Monday and admitted himself into a hospital in Denver, where he was 
broadcasting Chicago's three-game series with Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to Chicago on Thursday, Santos has been  
receiving treatment at Northwestern Memorial. It was unclear 
whether Santo would remain in the hospital over the weekend, a Cubs 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman referred all questions about Santo to the  
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, a nine-time All-Star and five-time Gold Glove winner,  
became the team's radio announcer 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, 59, has a history of diabetes and recently underwent an  
angiogram that revealed a minor blockage of one artery. 
</P>
<P>
	While Santo recovers, his commentator's job in the radio booth  
is being handled by Randy Hundley, Santo's former teammate on the 
Cubs.

<HEADLINE> Nets Reach Agreement With Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Veteran assistant Don Casey, who led the  
Nets after John Calipari was fired and then waited in limbo while 
the team wooed Phil Jackson, was officially made New Jersey's head 
coach on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, who has worked as an assistant coach in Chicago, Los  
Angeles and Boston, posted a 13-17 record with the injury-plagued 
Nets after he was appointed interim coach on March 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, 61, ``is a veteran coach with a great deal of NBA  
experience who did an outstanding job last year, especially when 
you consider the rash of injuries that decimated the team's front 
line,'' Nets president Michael Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Nets would not discuss Casey's contract other than to  
say it was multiyear, a source close to the NBA told The Associated 
Press late Friday that Casey would receive at least $1 million 
annually in salary. There are also incentives in the deal that 
could increase the salary two to three times, said the source, who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is guaranteed for two years and it includes opt-outs  
for both sides, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coaches Eddie Jordan, Jim Lynam and Mike O'Koren are  
all expected to reach new contracts in the next few weeks, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey's future had been uncertain since the Nets' dismal season  
ended. Players asked management to give him the job but the team's 
new owners pursued Jackson, the architect of the Bulls' great 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	About a month ago, Jackson told the Nets he was not interested  
in returning to coaching and then he took a job coaching the Los 
Angeles Lakers, said the source, adding that Jackson was the only 
coach the team's management seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
	The team reportedly considered former Georgetown coach John  
Thompson to take over the team. And the announcement comes just 
after New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said he was staying with 
the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey plans to meet with the media at a news conference Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the telephone at his home in San Diego on  
Friday night said he was in New Jersey and was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing 17 of 20 games under the emotional Calipari, the  
Nets turned to Casey to calm the team down. The Nets had a 
four-game winning streak, their longest of the season, to open the 
month of April and beat Seattle by 30 points on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Faced with the reality of not making the playoffs last year,  
Coach Casey was able to rally his squad and keep them focused on 
winning,'' Nets general manager John Nash said. ``The players 
responded very positively to Coach Casey and his staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, a playoff team a year ago, struggled in a season  
marked by Calipari's firing, a three-team trade in which the Nets 
acquired point guard Stephon Marbury, and six season-ending 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star Jayson Williams broke his leg, leading scorer Keith Van  
Horn broke his thumb and shooting guard Kerry Kittles battled a bad 
knee, which has since required surgery. The team also lost point 
guard Sam Cassell and centers Jim McIlvaine and Rony Seikaly to 
injuries for extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell eventually was traded in the deal that brought Marbury  
to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1989, Casey replaced Gene Shue as head coach of the  
Los Angeles Clippers for the remainder of the season. He then spent 
six seasons as an assistant with the Boston Celtics before joining 
the Nets in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey coached at Temple for eight years starting in 1973,  
posting a 151-94 record and leading the Owls to one NCAA tournament 
and three appearances in the NIT.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Urges Europe To Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Even before it starts, the summit  
of European, Latin American and Caribbean leaders has challenged 
the United States and its special relationship with Western 
Hemisphere nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a free trade zone linking the European Union  
and the Mercosur trade bloc is a new option for South America, a 
region sometimes seen as North America's back yard. And though free 
trade is years away at best, there clearly is a new player at the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot go down just one path, or put all our eggs in one  
basket. We want equilibrium,'' Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz 
Felipe Lampreia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day summit that starts Monday will bring together at  
least 40 leaders -- organizers aren't sure yet who is coming. The 
free trade talks are the centerpiece, but they will also discuss a 
``strategic partnership'' that includes respect for democracy and 
human rights, sustainable development and a commitment to stamp out 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, senior officials meet at the refurbished Museum of  
Modern Art to work out the final draft of the Declaration of Rio de 
Janeiro and a project for joint action that the leaders will sign. 
Then it's the turn of foreign ministers, who meet on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	An obstacle to the free trade talks was removed this week when  
the 15 European Union nations agreed to authorize negotiations at 
the summit with Mercosur -- which includes Brazil, Argentina, 
Paraguay, Uruguay and associate members Chile and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, talks on reducing tariffs wouldn't start before 2001, and  
a final agreement would not be concluded until the end of the next 
round of World Trade Organization talks, which could last many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans are worried about a massive inflow of cheap produce  
from South America. France and Spain insist on excluding cereals, 
beef and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mercosur benefits by playing Europe against the United  
States, which has its own proposal for a Free Trade Area of the 
Americas to start up by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Brazil's strategy to raise the competition and force the  
United States to offer a better deal,'' said Jose Luciano Dias, an 
analyst with Goes e Consultores. ``Brazil is looking for another 
card, but there's no game without the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The summit is Rio's biggest international event since the 1992  
Earth Summit, and the city has spent more than $12 million on a 
facelift. Tunnels were scrubbed, streets paved, lampposts painted, 
and even the beggars and street kids that hung out near the museum 
moved out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 8,000 police and army soldiers on Friday checked the museum  
for bombs and moved into the often-violent shantytowns that rise 
above the hotel district and the route motorcades will follow from 
the airport.

	Starting Thursday, large ships entering waters off Cape Cod and  
the Florida-Georgia state line will have to transmit their vessels' 
position. A Virginia computer center will then transmit to the 
ships the latest information on right whale sightings. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 300 North Atlantic right whales remain. Collisions  
with ships account for nearly half of all known right whale deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Baker, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration, said he is optimistic the requirements can curb 
collisions and save the whales from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can sensitize everyone that they have to watch out for  
the whales, then I think we'll have a fighting chance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Cox, president of the Chamber of Shipping of America, which  
represents companies that own, operate and charter large commercial 
vessels, said the requirements are worthwhile but might cause minor 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only sure option not to harm these creatures would be to  
not have any traffic,'' he said. ``We can't do that, so we have to 
go to plan B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system will run year-round in a 6,700-square-mile feeding  
area off Cape Cod. It will also cover 2,500 square miles off 
Florida and Georgia between Nov. 15 and April 15, the whale's 
nursing season. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, unanimously approved by the International Maritime  
Organization in December, will be mandatory for all vessels 300 
tons or more, excluding the Navy, which Baker said has volunteered 
to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Whale sighting information is gathered by spotters from the air  
and sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Nova Scotia's Peter Lawrence, captain of the 500-foot Gypsum  
King, said he has no problem with the new rules because his crew 
already watches out for whales on its trip between the Bay of Fundy 
and Boston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can live with it,'' he said. ``We keep a watch out  
anyway, so it's not that big a deal.''

<HEADLINE> Presbyterians Reject Gay Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The nation's largest Presbyterian  
church today rejected an effort that could have led to the 
ordination of non-celibate gays and lesbians, ending a movement 
that had been gaining momentum in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly's commissioners of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A)  
voted 389 to 198, or 61 percent to 31 percent, against allowing a 
regional vote on whether to amend its constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote ends for now an attempt to strike a constitutional  
clause that requires clergy to live within standards that include 
``fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a 
woman, or chastity in singleness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That clause prohibits single non-celibate heterosexuals, gays  
and lesbians from being ministers. But because the church does not 
recognize homosexual marriages, gays and must remain celibate if 
they wish to be ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has been a focus of controversy for months among the  
2.6-million member church. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Church Orders and Ministry committee voted 24-14  
to recommend striking the clause. To go into effect, the measure 
needed approval of the majority of 173 presbyteries, or regional 
governing bodies, that comprise the church's ordained ministers and 
elders nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But the assembly today voted against allowing the constitutional  
question to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	David White, a youth advisory delegate from St. Augustine, Fla.,  
broke down in tears as he urged fellow church members to vote for 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to deal with it. ``We can't keep pushing it off,  
pushing it off. We can't discriminate no matter what,'' said White.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Discusses Domestic Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning from war in the Balkans to battles in  
Congress, President Clinton today urged Republican lawmakers to 
``keep pushing forward on our challenges at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference, his first since March 19, and a speech at  
Georgetown University, the president called for action on Medicaid, 
Medicare, Social Security, education, child care and campaign 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be judged on what we do with this opportunity, whether  
we seize it or squander it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebutting those who would call him a lame-duck president in the  
final 18 months of his term, Clinton laid that label on his 
Republican opponents in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be plenty of time for politics in the months to  
come,'' he said in the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He twice praised Hillary Rodham Clinton for her efforts on  
domestic policy, a nod to her all-but-official campaign for the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	His toughest comments were reserved for Republicans on gun  
control. ``We can't expect young people to stand up to violence 
when Congress won't stand up to the gun lobby.'' He promised to 
veto any weak gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans showcased their own agenda in an appearance on  
the Capitol steps, calling for measures to bolster the national 
security, improve education, safeguard the Social Security surplus 
for improving that program and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. at an appearance 
where he was joined by dozens of rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let Washington spend the surplus. We need fairness in  
our tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to craft a tax  
cut next month, and likely will include provisions to repeal to 
so-called marriage penalty, eliminate the estate tax and possibly 
cut the capital-gains tax. In addition, there has been talk of 
making more income taxable at the rate of 15 percent, rather than 
28 percent, a step that would cut taxes for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all of his proposals that have languished on Capitol Hill  
because of what he called ``small-time wrangling,'' the president 
singled out guaranteed Medicaid coverage for disabled people who 
find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's start with that one, an easy one,'' Clinton said.  
``Congress should pass it and I will sign it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also renewed calls for an increase in the minimum wage,  
tighter gun controls, Medicare reforms including prescription drug 
coverage, tax credits for families in need of long-term care and 
child care, and the ``patients bill of rights'' for HMO members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back to Washington after my trip to Europe with a  
renewed energy for the domestic agenda,'' Clinton said. ``With our 
present prosperity, we actually have a rare opportunity to meet the 
remaining large challenges facing our country on the brink of a new 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who struggled for more than a year to be heard above  
the din of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, is trying to reassert his 
voice in America's political debate after the 11-week Kosovo 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	With the approach of the 2000 presidential race and lingering  
bitterness from the impeachment battle, the Republican-led Congress 
has received the president's proposals coolly. Even so, White House 
officials believe Clinton's poll-tested agenda could give Democrats 
political ammunition for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said it was Clinton who ``set the tone and path to 
partisanship'' on entitlement reform when he rejected earlier this 
year the recommendations of a bipartisan commission on Medicare's 
problems. ``The president rejected that report and chose to pursue 
a partisan course. That was one opportunity dashed,'' the GOP 
spokesman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Clinton next week would unveil an  
alternative Medicare proposal that would include prescription drug 
benefits for the elderly -- a proposal that could cost billions of 
dollars. Most recipients would have to pay a monthly premium to 
help cover the costs, although the White House said the poorest 
people would not have to pay the full premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats repeatedly have turned in election years to Medicare  
as an issue with which to flog Republicans. Eager to avoid more 
harm, the GOP is looking for its own plan, likely to be less costly 
than Clinton's. Lott has asked the Senate Finance Committee to 
consider a bipartisan proposal rejected by Clinton that would 
provide subsidized drug benefits only for those living near the 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides also are planning a whirlwind of presidential  
travel to raise his profile. He will appear in New York and 
Connecticut on Monday for political fund-raisers and then travel to 
Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning July 5, he will begin a tour of poverty pockets across  
America, stopping in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota, 
Arizona and California.

<HEADLINE>  Low-Key Approach on Soccer Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Women's World Cup touches all the hot  
buttons that make American marketers salivate. 
</P>
<P>
	The host U.S. team is favored to win. Thirty-two matches are  
being played over three weeks at sites from New England to 
California. Every game is being shown nationally on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening match last Saturday between the United States and  
Denmark just outside New York drew the biggest crowd ever to attend 
a women's-only sporting event -- a Giants Stadium sellout of 78,792 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is expected to attract more than 500,000 fans,  
the most ever for an all-women's team sports event. 
</P>
<P>
	But the buzz the Women's World Cup has generated on Madison  
Avenue seems quieter than the one the men's World Cup created five 
years ago when it was in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider McDonald's, one of 11 official sponsors of the women's  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last two men's World Cups, the fast-food chain put  
the tournament logo on its food sacks and drink containers to 
remind customers of its role as an official sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Not this year. Company spokesman Brad Trask said the chain had a  
long-standing commitment to promote Walt Disney Co.'s animated 
``Tarzan'' movie opening just as the Women's World Cup kicked off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two restaurant-level promotions would have been impossible,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trask said McDonald's is relying mainly on the field-level  
billboards that each official sponsor gets at all the matches to 
promote its involvement. It hasn't bought any commercial time on 
the telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola, another official sponsor, is also relying on the  
exposure from the sideline signs and plans no additional 
advertising on the match telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a change from 1994 when it advertised on the men's World  
Cup telecasts and produced a two-hour special shown on the eve of 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotionally, I want to tell you this is a great opportunity,''  
said Lesa Ukman, editor of the IEG Sponsorship Report, which tracks 
sports sponsorships. ``But the truth is it's soccer. ... You're 
just not going to make a splash here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While soccer is enormously popular among youngsters, it is a  
long way from the mass U.S. appeal enjoyed by football, baseball 
and basketball. And organized women's soccer is not nearly as 
popular worldwide as men's soccer, which has been holding World Cup 
competition for more than 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the third Women's World Cup and we are still  
selling it to sponsors and fans,'' said Marla Messing, president of 
the event's organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	For ticket sales, the organizers initially went after the  
estimated 7.5 million girls who play soccer in the United States 
and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	In courting potential sponsors, Messing emphasized the type of  
people who would probably be watching from the stands or on 
television -- ``suburban families, well-educated and affluent for 
the most part and parents that care a lot about kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 official tournament sponsors paid $1 million to $4  
million for the designation -- a fraction of the $20 million to $40 
million for the men's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcast rights went to three networks owned by the Walt  
Disney Co. ABC carried the opening match last Saturday and will 
broadcast the championship July 10 from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, 
Calif. The other 30 matches are being carried by ESPN and ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	Some advertisers are using soccer themes and active players.  
</P>
<P>
	Gatorade, for example, has an ad showing U.S. team superstar Mia  
Hamm outlasting Michael Jordan in a competition that includes 
fencing, running and martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has also featured Hamm in an ad for a Barbie doll dressed  
in a soccer uniform under license from the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas shows some of the world's top players, like Kristine  
Lilly of the United States and Sun Wen of China, in ads that 
humorously suggest they showed a flair for the sport at a very 
early age. ``There from the start,'' is the theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch has an ad with U.S. player Julie Foudy  
unintentionally kicking a doctor against the wall when he checks 
her leg reflexes. Allstate Insurance has an ad with two teams of 
girls ages 5 to 8 playing soccer. ``Here's to the women who play. 
This generation and the next,'' the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN is trying to drum up interest in its telecasts of the  
tournament with an ad campaign featuring an odd blend of 
celebrities urging President Clinton to attend the final match. The 
luminaries include Olympic gold medal winners Mark Spitz and Tara 
Lipinski, Watergate figure G. Gordon Liddy and Clinton political 
adviser James Carville. 
</P>
<P>
	The matches have not drawn ratings as high as the men's matches  
did in 1994, and ESPN programming executive Steve Risser doesn't 
expect them to be as high as five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are in a growth phase,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and now a sports  
television consultant, said the advertisers may not get big 
audiences for their ads but might get people who will ``probably 
appreciate the sponsors that put on the broadcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's something you rarely get with the more established  
sports, he said.

has received the president's proposals coolly. Even so, White House 
officials believe Clinton's poll-tested agenda could give Democrats 
political ammunition for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said it was Clinton who ``set the tone and path to 
partisanship'' on entitlement reform when he rejected earlier this 
year the recommendations of a bipartisan commission on Medicare's 
problems. ``The president rejected that report and chose to pursue 
a partisan course. That was one opportunity dashed,'' the GOP 
spokesman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Clinton next week would unveil an  
alternative Medicare proposal that would include prescription drug 
benefits for the elderly -- a proposal that could cost billions of 
dollars. Most recipients would have to pay a monthly premium to 
help cover the costs, although the White House said the poorest 
people would not have to pay the full premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats repeatedly have turned in election years to Medicare  
as an issue with which to flog Republicans. Eager to avoid more 
harm, the GOP is looking for its own plan, likely to be less costly 
than Clinton's. Lott has asked the Senate Finance Committee to 
consider a bipartisan proposal rejected by Clinton that would 
provide subsidized drug benefits only for those living near the 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides also are planning a whirlwind of presidential  
travel to raise his profile. He will appear in New York and 
Connecticut on Monday for political fund-raisers and then travel to 
Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning July 5, he will begin a tour of poverty pockets across  
America, stopping in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota, 
Arizona and California.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Sign No. 1 Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ben Christensen, Chicago's first-round draft pick  
whose college career ended when he hit an opposing player in the 
head with a pitch while he was in the on-deck circle, agreed to 
terms with the Cubs on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander was 9-1 in 11 starts for Wichita  
State this year before he was suspended by the Missouri Valley 
Conference for the rest of the season on April 23 after he hit 
Evansville's Anthony Molina in the eye during warmups. Molina 
sustained fractures to three bones around his left eye when he was 
struck in the face by the pitch as he waited about 30 feet from 
home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen, who has said he never meant to hit Molina and has  
sent a letter of apology. will meet with the Chicago media 
Saturday, the Cubs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be up to Ben how he deals with issues that are separate  
from us signing him,'' Cubs scouting director Jim Hendry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen, the 26th pick in this month's draft, was 21-1 with  
a 3.59 ERA in 32 starts over three seasons with Wichita State.

<HEADLINE> Planet Hollywood Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The president of Planet Hollywood  
International Inc. resigned Friday, just three months after the 
restaurant chain's co-founder resigned his board position. 
</P>
<P>
	William Baumhauer, also Planet Hollywood's chief operating  
officer, is leaving to pursue other interests, according to a 
statement released by the company. He had served one year in the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes on the heels of Keith Barish's surprising  
departure in March. Barish, a California film producer, resigned as 
a board member after selling nearly half of his stock in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Barish started the venture with Robert Earl and actors Sylvester  
Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to turn the sagging chain around, Baumhauer  
announced in January a major overhaul to include revamped menus, 
lower prices and new fashion-oriented merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also planned to cut operating costs by reducing  
corporate overhead, putting in cost-control systems, streamlining 
store-level operations and disposing of nonessential corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those moves, analysts said aggressive expansion and  
increased competition have hurt the company. Last month, the 
company reported a first-quarter loss of $34.7 million, or 32 cents 
per share, on sales of $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock closed Friday at its 52-week low of 62 1/2  
cents on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Still Tense 49 Years Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As officials from the United States, South  
Korea and Japan were convening to assess the latest developments 
concerning North Korea, they had a lot to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
	Just within the past few days, there had been a maritime  
confrontation between North and South Korean vessels, a U.S. 
decision to dispatch a carrier group to the Pacific, signs of North 
Korean plans to test a long-range ballistic missile and a U.S. 
warning of serious consequences if it did so. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting at the State Department was being held,  
coincidentally, on the 49th anniversary of the North Korean 
invasion of South Korea. Not much has happened in the interim to 
enhance mutual trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the meeting was to ensure the three countries act  
in concert on the Korea question. 
</P>
<P>
	The one positive development in an otherwise grim picture was  
the agreement by the two Koreas to resume on Saturday the highest 
level talks they have had in 14 months. The talks were suspended on 
Tuesday with the North Korean officials demanding an apology for 
South Korea's sinking of a gunboat last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has been doing its best to create a  
positive atmosphere with North Korea. As one example, the State 
Department vetoed a proposed Voice of America editorial two months 
ago calling attention to what it described as the deplorable 
conditions at North Korean prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial was to have been aired two weeks before a U.S.  
team was due to inspect an underground site thought by some 
officials to be a nuclear weapons construction headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	It had taken long months of arduous negotiations to persuade  
North Korea to agree to the inspection, and the State Department 
wanted nothing to jeopardize it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timing is not good,'' said the State Department notation in  
rejecting the editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration felt it had to follow up on its  
concerns because North Korea had promised in 1994 to forgo a 
nuclear weapons capability. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection was held as scheduled, and only an empty tunnel  
complex was found. Nonetheless, the State Department said it still 
harbored suspicions about the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the short term, the biggest U.S. concern is North Korea's  
missile program. According to a number of published reports, U.S. 
intelligence analysts have concluded that North Korea is making 
preparations for a new ballistic missile test as a follow-up to a 
test a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary Stanley Roth, who heads the State  
Department's East Asia bureau, said Thursday that ``very serious 
consequences'' would result for North Korea if it conducted a new 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	In diplomatic parlance, such phrasing suggests a potentially  
grave situation could be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that former Defense Secretary  
William Perry warned the North Koreans last week during a visit to 
the capital, Pyongyang, that the United States would not tolerate 
another missile launch. Perry made the visit as part of a 
comprehensive review of U.S. policy toward North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea, meanwhile, voiced concerns about U.S. behavior,  
including a decision to dispatch the carrier Kitty Hawk from the 
Persian Gulf to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current situation in the Korean peninsula is very  
worrying,'' Ambassador Ri Tcheul told the 61-nation Conference on 
Disarmament in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Two Special Olympic Athletes Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Authorities were searching today for two  
Special Olympics athletes who left their nation's delegation and 
took a trip to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The mentally retarded men from the Dominican Republic were  
thought to have arrived in New York early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina authorities asked New York police to find the men  
to make sure they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't committed a crime. There's nothing law  
enforcement can do to hold them or bring them back here,'' said 
Greensboro police Capt. Jim Sciefres. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the basketball players hid passports they were  
asked to surrender and paid a cab driver Wednesday to take them to 
Charlotte's bus station, where they hopped a bus to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes, Jose Gallardo, 20, and Maximo Martinez, 21, are  
not severely retarded, said Joe Freddoso, chief executive officer 
of the Special Olympics World Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're at the upper end of the scale as far as function, and  
they can definitely go out on their own,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were in Greensboro for the Special Olympics Summer  
Games, which begin Saturday and conclude July 4.

<HEADLINE> Spree, Van Gundy Returning To Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that Jeff Van Gundy's job appears safe,  
Latrell Sprewell said today he would have no problem playing for 
him again. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy has divulged that New York Knicks president Dave  
Checketts assured him he can coach the team again next season. Van 
Gundy said he still wants to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mentioned it sort of in passing because people were asking  
me questions about my future as if I thought it was up in the air 
still, and it really hasn't been up in the air,'' Van Gundy said 
Friday after the team shootaround before Game 5 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since Dave took over, he's told me the same thing -- that  
he wants me back. Now, were the results going to be good enough to 
be brought back? That wasn't sure until probably a few weeks ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was not happy earlier this season when Van Gundy  
insisted on bringing him off the bench in a sixth man role. But 
Sprewell said he would even play for Van Gundy in that role next 
season if that's what the coach wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't have a choice,'' Sprewell said. ``I feel like I  
can give something to the team either way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Camby, whose acquisition in the trade for Charles Oakley  
was initially opposed by Van Gundy, was used sparingly early in the 
season after reporting to training camp out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby decided to sign a six-year extension for $31 million in  
March rather than wait to test the free agent market this summer. 
Many believe he could have gotten a better deal worth tens of 
millions of dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he held any lingering resentment toward Van Gundy,  
Camby said: ``When the time is right, then I'll speak. But right 
now I'm focusing on the Spurs. No hostilities to Jeff, though. 
We're cool, we're close. I'm trying to nip that in the bud. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's good that he has his money and he has his job, but we  
still have to win. We can't worry about who's going to be here and 
who's not going to be here. We have a nice solid team with a young 
nucleus, and I just hope everyone can come back and we can do it 
again next year,'' Camby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, who is owed $5.5 million over the remaining two years  
of his contract, allowed that he did feel some resentment over the 
way his uncertain status was the focus of constant concern, 
including when Checketts admitted lying to him about his secret 
meeting with former Bulls coach Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of those things are difficult on your family. It's  
difficult,'' Van Gundy said. ``But I love coaching and I love a 
chance to win, and I think New York will always try to create an 
opportunity to win. I like that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does he consider himself a Knicks lifer?  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't allow anybody to be anything for life,'' said Van  
Gundy, who has been with the team for 10 years -- six as an 
assistant coach and four as a head coach. ``I've only been here, so 
I like it very much, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TAKE YOUR PLACES:* Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy was seen  
watching the NBA's rehearsal for the championship ceremony before 
Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought it was interesting,'' Van Gundy said. ``I just  
did. I've never seen anything like that. They were yelling at the 
ushers, `You got to get down here with one minute to go!' It was 
funny. I was watching them coach the ushers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said the Knicks had better things to worry about than  
the potential for a Spurs celebration, but in the next breath he 
said, ``And the ushers have to sit on one knee facing the audience 
with the rope!'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TAKE THAT:* Tim Duncan relayed this source of agitation to  
Spurs teammate Will Perdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim says that if one more person asks him if he understands  
the importance of winning the finals in his second year, if he 
takes that for granted, he's going to smack them,'' Perdue said. 
``Just because it's his second year, doesn't mean he doesn't 
understand the importance of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GAME FACE:* Looking around the Spurs' locker room before the  
game, it was evident that many players handle the potential 
clinching game differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie was as serious as a boxer before a big fight,  
slipping his customary rubber bands around his wrists and saying 
quietly to a reporter that he doesn't talk before games. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson was quiet, as he is before every game. Younger  
players, such as Malik Rose and Jaren Jackson, listened to head 
phones and filled out ticket envelopes for family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the date?'' Rose asked Will Perdue.  
</P>
<P>
	``June 25,'' Perdue said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You look at A.J., he's had the same approach ever since the  
playoffs started,'' said Perdue, who won three championship with 
the Bulls. ``Before the game, you don't talk to him, you don't say 
anything. He's very focused, and he's been like that since day one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Younger guys, like Malik and Antonio (Daniels), you can kind  
of see the excitement in their eyes with what's about to happen.''

<HEADLINE> GDP Grows at 4.3 Percent Annual Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Torrid consumer spending helped the nation's  
economy grow at a brisk annual rate of 4.3 percent at the beginning 
of the year. Economists believe growth has slowed in the current 
quarter but probably not enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve 
from raising interest rates as a precaution against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.3 percent increase from January through March in the gross  
domestic product -- the nation's output of goods and services -- was 
slightly better than the 4.1 percent rate estimated a month ago, 
the Commerce Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement reflected a slight revision in the trade  
deficit, which, while still at a record high, was $6.5 billion 
lower than the government earlier estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy's robust first-quarter pace was far above  
expectations. That has raised concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will push up short-term interest rates at its meeting next week to 
keep the expansion from triggering inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though many analysts believe that growth has slowed in the  
April-June quarter to around 3.5 percent, they feel the drop has 
not been sufficient to keep the central bank from raising interest 
rates next week. Some analysts said solid second-quarter growth 
could spur the Fed to enact another rate increase at its August 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hunch is that they would raise the interest rates again on  
Aug. 24,'' said First Union economist David Orr, who estimates 
second-quarter growth to slow only to 4 percent to reflect a 
slowdown in consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit of refinancing is running out. The benefit of  
lower gasoline is running out, and higher tax refunds are going 
away,'' Orr said, explaining his second-quarter assessment. ``The 
superchargers for consumer spending have faded a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates also  
expects a pullback in consumer spending to lower the second-quarter 
growth rate. He believes the Fed will maintain its existing policy 
bias toward increasing interest rates ``until there is a clear, 
sustained slowing in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter, robust consumer spending, which continued  
to power economic growth, rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, 
the best showing in more than a decade, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have grown increasingly nervous in recent  
weeks that the Fed will raise interest rates, a pre-emptive move to 
keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report indicated that inflation remains low. An  
inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose at an annual rate of just 1.2 
percent in the first quarter, compared with the 1.1 percent 
previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The record trade deficit, meanwhile, shaved 2.2 percentage  
points from economic growth in the first three months of the year. 
While at record levels, the drag from trade was slightly lower than 
an estimated loss in growth of 2.5 percentage points in last 
month's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global  
financial crises, which has cut sharply into American export sales 
while increasing competition on American manufacturers from a flood 
of cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for new homes and apartments increased at a 15.4  
percent rate in the first quarter, the best showing in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a separate report, the National Association of  
Realtors said Friday that sales of existing single-family homes 
plunged 4 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
5.04 million units. That was the lowest level in six months. The 
drop coincided with rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report showed that business investment, spending on new  
equipment and plants, rose at an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the 
first quarter, even better than last month's estimate of 7.9 
percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate profits, meanwhile, rose in the first three months of  
this year to an annual rate of $47.1 billion, a turnaround from a 
drop of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter performance, revised upward by $15.3 billion  
from the initial estimate last month, reflected that tobacco 
companies paid less in court settlements during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the recent weakness in the stock market has reflected  
worries that company earnings in the second quarter will be below 
expectations.

<HEADLINE> Community Banks To Get Fleet Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Community banks will likely see a slice of the New  
England banking business following a decision by the Department of 
Justice to let them buy branches being sold off by Fleet and 
BankBoston, congressmen said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators had previously leaned towards letting one large  
out-of-state bank buy all the branches, in the belief that such a 
bank would provide strong competition to the proposed 
Fleet-BankBoston megabank. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bay State congressmen said the federal government now plans  
to let smaller banks have a chance to bid on the branches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delegation was united in its belief that the community  
banks should at least have the opportunity to bid,'' said U.S. Rep. 
Martin Meehan, D-Mass. ``And that's what we're going to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet is in the midst of a $16 billion acquisition of  
BankBoston; the company that emerges from the takeover will be the 
nation's eighth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to maintain competition in the New England banking  
industry, regulators want the combined bank, to be known as 
FleetBoston, to sell 292 branches with $12.49 billion in deposits 
and up to $5 billion in commercial loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the exact portion of the divestiture to be sold to  
community banks will be determined by the marketplace, the 
congressmen estimated the total would be about 10 or 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Department of Justice and BankBoston refused  
to comment directly on the matter. A Fleet spokesman did not return 
calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Community bankers said they were excited about the prospect of  
bidding on the divested assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there is a great opportunity for community banks to  
take advantage of this divestiture, and Century Bank 
specifically,'' said Jonathan Sloane, president and chief operating 
officer of the 16-branch Medford-based bank. 
</P>
<P>
	And Jack Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Brookline-based Bay State Bank, said his company had joined a 
consortium of banks mounting a $1.3 billion bid for 10 percent of 
the divestiture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the process is going to be who puts in the best bid,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> New Civil War Tombstones Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- After a fruitless trip to Alabama 10 years  
ago, Floyd Findlay had lost hope of ever locating his 
great-grandfather's Civil War grave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that was a lost cause,'' he said. ``We didn't know  
where else to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, new tombstones were unveiled marking the graves of  
Findlay's ancestor, Pvt. James Harris, 24, of Missouri, and fellow 
Union soldiers William Britt, 38, of Tennessee, and David Sage, 20, 
of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the 5th Iowa Calvary were killed nearly 135 years  
ago. Their graves were identified at the Marietta National Cemetery 
in Georgia after two decades of research by Civil War author David 
Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three restless souls can be at peace now,'' said Evans, whose  
1996 book ``Sherman's Horsemen'' recounts Union cavalry raids 
around Atlanta in 1864. ``These three men who were so hopelessly 
lost for so long, now have been found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men were shot in a battle July 18, 1864, with young  
Confederate conscripts and University of Alabama cadets at 
Beasley's Tank, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	They were behind enemy lines to tear up railroad tracks and were  
among thousands of soldiers exhumed after the war from their 
shallow graves and moved to Marietta, where they were buried under 
numbered, six-inch-high marble ``unknown'' markers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Col. Robert King of the Iowa Army National Guard  
performed a service for Harris and Sage, both Protestants, while 
the Rev. Stephen Lyness, an Irish Catholic priest, sprinkled holy 
water over the grave of Britt, an Irish immigrant. Evans added soil 
flown here from Britt's family grave site in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite modern research techniques and increased interest in  
genealogy, such new identifications remain rare because many 
soldiers were hastily buried where they fell, with little time for 
markers. 
</P>
<P>
	Findlay and his wife came from Poplar Bluff, Mo., for the  
ceremony, which was included in weekend events commemorating the 
1864 battle at nearby Kennesaw Mountain in which Confederate troops 
blocked Union Gen. William T. Sherman's forces in their effort to 
break through to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	While researching his book, Evans found battlefield reports,  
army documents and cemetery register notes that enabled him to make 
the case for the unknown soldiers' identity. Only two Union 
soldiers had died at the Beasley's Tank battle, records showed, and 
only one had died after the conflict in a Confederate hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Because both Sage and Harris died the same day and at the same  
place, cemetery officials aren't sure which is which. So their new 
three-foot-high marble tombstones identify them not by name, but as 
members of the 5th Iowa. Britt's new tombstone has his name. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ceremonies, blue-clad re-enactors fired 21 shots in  
tribute, a bugler played ``Taps'' and three women in period dress, 
one in widow's black, also took part in the services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing; very gratifying,'' Findlay said.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Reform Takes Hold in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare reform's new work-first message has  
transformed even big city bureaucracies that historically are 
resistant to change, according to the first report from a 
large-scale study. 
</P>
<P>
	But big cities, in their push to move people off public aid, may  
be failing to tell recipients about child care, health insurance 
and other benefits available to them when they go to work, said the 
report being released Friday by New York-based Manpower 
Demonstration Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, welfare reform is likely to succeed or fail in the  
nation's big cities, with their concentrations of poverty and 
dependence. They also have entrenched bureaucracies that have seen 
numerous ``welfare reforms'' come and go. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit like steering a ship -- these big cities are  
hard to turn,'' said Gordon Berlin, the project's director. ``They 
have in fact begun to turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also found positive attitudes among welfare  
recipients, who seemed to welcome the new focus on work, saying the 
changes were fair and overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of them saw this as an opportunity where they were  
finally going to get some help,'' Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year study involves four counties -- Cuyahoga County,  
Ohio, including Cleveland; Los Angeles; Miami-Dade, Fla., and 
Philadelphia. They were selected to represent a geographic, ethnic 
and economic mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare rolls are dropping across the country, but they are  
falling much more slowly in big cities compared with suburban and 
rural areas. While cities have the vast majority of welfare 
recipients, most of the new jobs are in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	This first report is based on in-depth interviews with welfare  
workers and recipients. Future reports will examine the effect on 
neighborhoods and individuals, including crime rates, marriage and 
childbearing trends, homelessness and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the report confirms that welfare's new focus on work has  
worked its way into these communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff members are telling recipients welfare is temporary and  
the rules apply to virtually everyone. Participants are pushed to 
take a job as soon as possible and steered away from the remedial 
education that used to be routine. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is work to be done. Many caseworkers still are  
spending much of their time calculating who is eligible for 
benefits, leaving less time to help them find jobs. Caseloads 
remain high. 
</P>
<P>
	While caseworkers tell recipients about time limits, there has  
been a mixed message in Miami and Philadelphia, where the rules 
call for cutting people off after certain deadlines hit. In fact, 
many extensions have been granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also suggested that cities need to do a better job  
explaining tradeoffs to people. 
</P>
<P>
	Recipients are encouraged to stay on welfare for a while even  
after they get a job, because they continue to collect some cash 
welfare along with their new paychecks. But that means eating away 
at their five-year lifetime limit of benefits. For some people, it 
might be a better idea to ``bank'' their time in case they need it 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is funded by 11 of the nation's largest charitable  
organizations, including the Charles Stewart Mott, W.K. Kellogg, 
Ford and Robert Wood Johnson foundations.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 53 points  
in today's early going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange 
hold a 2-1 lead over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 25 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index

<P>
	Just because stocks are edging higher in early trades, analysts  
say that doesn't mean the market's jitters will easily fade.

<P>
	Bond prices are solidly higher, and that's taking some pressure  
off the market today. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Federal Reserve due to hold a policy meeting next  
Tuesday and Wednesday there doesn't appear to be much room for a 
recovery. 
</P>

	And earnings concerns, which hurt the market yesterday, are back  
again today. 
</P>

	This time it's Campbell's, which said its quarterly results will  
fall about eight to ten cents short of analysts' expectations.

<HEADLINE> Jury Convicts 'Sleepwalking' Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A man who claimed he was sleepwalking when he  
stabbed his wife 44 times and held her head under water was 
convicted Friday of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Falater stared straight ahead and did not react as the  
verdict was read in a Maricopa County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also had the option of convicting Falater of  
second-degree murder. Prosecutors have said they would seek the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	What Falater did on the night of Jan. 16, 1997, has never been  
in question. He admitted to stabbing his wife, dragging her body to 
the backyard swimming pool and holding her head under water. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not disputed removing his bloodstained clothes and hiding  
them and the knife in his Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	But Falater testified he has no memory of any of it.  
</P>
<P>
	Two sleep experts cited Falater's family history of  
sleepwalking, job stress and lack of sleep as reasons for his 
violent sleepwalking episode. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, the defense painted Falater, a former Motorola  
engineer, and his wife, Yarmila, as a happily married, religious 
couple. Defense attorney Mike Kimerer said Falater had no reason to 
kill his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors had their own expert witness who testified that  
the 43-year-old's actions were too deliberate to constitute 
sleepwalking. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Juan Martinez said the Falaters' marriage wasn't the  
happy union that Falater described. He noted during his closing 
arguments Wednesday that the couple had disputes over Scott 
Falater's desire to have more children and his wife's waning 
dedication to the Mormon faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Falater was not wearing her wedding ring when her body was  
found, Martinez noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimerer has dismissed the disputes over children and religion,  
saying they were minor, and there was no good reason for Falater to 
kill his wife of 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The women on the U.S. soccer team have hair to dye for.  
</P>
<P>
	When the team took the field for warmups before its 7-1 victory  
over Nigeria, backup goalkeeper Saskia Webber had a red, white and 
blue hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
	Defender Sara Whalen went for a red and blue combination.  
Forwards Shannon McMillam and Danielle Fotopoulos chose monochrome 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically paint,'' Webber said. ``I'm going to wash it  
out in the shower. At least I hope I am. If that doesn't work you 
might see it again on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the team opted for a more subdued paint job. The  
players also had their nails done in red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all do our nails and stuff and try to have fun,'' said  
Whalen, who made her World Cup debut when entered as a second-half 
substitute. ``We're just trying to get into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whalen admits she set off the hair dye craze.  
</P>
<P>
	``I dyed my hair a little bit red just for fun, it had nothing  
to do with the World Cup,'' she said. ``And then (backup 
goalkeeper) Tracy Ducar bleached her hair white. So we were like, 
`someone needs to dye their hair blue so we can be red, white and 
blue.' And it was all downhill from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THEATER IN GOAL:* When Nigeria's goalkeeper Ann Chiejine makes  
a save, watch out. Chiejine exaggerates saves, diving at balls she 
could easily stop. Each stop becomes a theatrical event. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiejine says she does this to make sure her husband understands  
she has an important job that justifies her being away from him and 
her children. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry isn't impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty much like ice out there. When I make a save, I want  
it to look like my grandmother can do it,'' Scurry said. ``When she 
makes a save, she wants to make it look like no one else can make 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT SO GREAT DANES:* Denmark seems the most injury prone of the  
tournament. In a loss to North Korea on Thursday, forward Marlene 
Kristensen slipped on the wet grass and broke her shin in the fifth 
minute. She will have surgery in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Karina Christensen broke her nose during practice  
Wednesday and had to go back to Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had problems,'' coach Jorgen Hvidemose said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite two losses -- 3-0 to the United States and 3-1 to North  
Korea -- Denmark can still make the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Danes beat Nigeria in Washington on Sunday and the United  
States beats North Korea, they could advance on goal differential. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PROUD BRANDI:* Brandi Chastain says those who don't like the  
revealing photograph of her in ``Gear'' magazine should take a long 
hard look at themselves. The picture showed the 30-year-old 
midfielder wearing nothing more than a soccer ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have asked if this is the kind of publicity we  
want,'' Chastain said. ``Basically, I have spent 10 years of my 
life working on my body as an athlete and it's a picture of a 
confident, strong woman. If someone can't see it that way, then 
maybe they should look in the mirror and say, `What am I not 
doing?' and concentrate on themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Rules Protect Whales From Collisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Federal officials unveiled a program they hope  
will help avoid collisions that annually kill a handful of North 
Atlantic right whales, threatening their threadbare population. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Thursday, large ships entering waters off Cape Cod and  
the Florida-Georgia state line will have to transmit their vessels' 
position. A Virginia computer center will then transmit to the 
ships the latest information on right whale sightings. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 300 North Atlantic right whales remain. Collisions  
with ships account for nearly half of all known right whale deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The endangered whale has a sad reputation among captains of  
cargo ships and tankers that cruise the eastern seaboard. Mariners 
say the lumpy-headed mammal is too slow or simply doesn't know any 
better to get out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Baker, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration, said he is optimistic the requirements can curb 
collisions and save the whales from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can sensitize everyone that they have to watch out for  
the whales, then I think we'll have a fighting chance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Cox, president of the Chamber of Shipping of America, which  
represents companies that operate commercial vessels, said the 
requirements are worthwhile but might cause minor delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only sure option not to harm these creatures would be to  
not have any traffic,'' he said. ``We can't do that, so we have to 
go to plan B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system will run year-round in a 6,700-square-mile feeding  
area off Massachusetts and the Cape Cod peninsula. It will also 
cover 2,500 square miles off Florida and Georgia between Nov. 15 
and April 15, the whale's nursing season. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, unanimously approved by the International Maritime  
Organization in December, will be mandatory for all vessels 300 
tons or more, excluding the Navy, which Baker said has volunteered 
to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Whale sighting information is gathered by spotters from the air  
and sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Nova Scotia's Peter Lawrence, captain of the 500-foot Gypsum  
King, said he has no problem with the new rules because his crew 
already watches out for whales on its trip between the Bay of Fundy 
and Boston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can live with it,'' he said. ``We keep a watch out  
anyway, so it's not that big a deal.''

<HEADLINE> Textile Union Claims Southern Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANNAPOLIS, N.C. (AP) -- Labor leaders say the vote in favor of  
union representation by North Carolina mill workers marks a 
milestone in the effort to organize the Southern textile industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at six Fieldcrest Cannon mills apparently voted to  
accept representation by the Union of Needletrades Industrial and 
Textile Employees, or UNITE. Four previous attempts since 1974 to 
unionize the workers had failed, but the union finally declared 
victory on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney called it the greatest union  
victory in a Southern textile mill. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina has nearly 167,000 textile workers -- the nation's  
biggest such workforce -- in a state where the overall level of 
union membership is just 4.2 percent. The national level is 13.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unions, when it came to North Carolina, used to say, `Why  
bother?''' said University of South Carolina history professor Tom 
Terrill. 
</P>
<P>
	The past six decades has seen the number of workers decline  
steadily due to modernization, increased imports and the shifting 
of jobs overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been talking to a lot of clothing manufacturers, and one  
of the problems they bring up all the time is the shortage of 
skilled labor,'' said Ian Taplin, a Wake Forest University 
professor who studies labor-management issues. ``This could make 
management more tolerant about considering a union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Labor Relations Board still must validate the  
2,270-2,102 outcome. The union and the board have challenged a 
total of 285 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be massive discussion about these contested  
votes,'' said Chuck Hansen, chairman of Fieldcrest Cannon's parent 
company, Pillowtex Corp. ``I think when it's all resolved, the vote 
will come back for the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top election issues concerned job changes that have  
accompanied $50 million in added automation since 1997, when 
Dallas-based Pillowtex bought Fieldcrest for $700 million. Union 
organizers said change was displacing workers. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, UNITE did a good job of sizing up what it needed to  
do to win, including the enlisting of young, college-educated 
organizers, Taplin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is ``good at alerting the public about what is  
happening,'' he said. ``And they let the government know when there 
are violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union organizing has a storied history here. Twenty-five years  
ago, a North Carolina woman's organizing efforts at a textile mill 
200 miles away inspired the movie ``Norma Rae.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it eventually would happen, but I didn't think it would  
happen in my lifetime,'' said Tracy Moody, a Fieldcrest employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieldcrest Cannon makes towels, sheets and comforters under the  
names Royal Velvet, Cannon, Touch of Class and Charisma. Pillowtex 
makes bed pillows, mattress pads, blankets and down comforters for 
the Ralph Lauren, Disney and Martha Stewart lines.

<HEADLINE> NFL Sues Coors, Players Inc. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL sued the Coors Brewing Co. on Friday,  
saying the company's effort to promote Coors Light as the 
``Official Beer of NFL players'' falls flat legally. 
</P>
<P>
	``That claim is both literally false and a violation of the  
NFL's exclusive trademark rights,'' the NFL said in a lawsuit filed 
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that also named Players Inc., a 
marketing company for players, as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen Gaskill, a spokeswoman for the brewing company  
headquartered in Golden, Colo., said the nation's third largest 
beer manufacturer was not ready to comment because its officials 
had not yet seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said long-standing NFL rules prevent players from  
endorsing alcoholic beverages, including products such as Coors 
Light. But, the lawsuit said, it is fine for the league's 31 clubs 
to endorse the lucrative market of alcoholic beverages through its 
marketing arm, NFL Properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Coors claimed to have obtained authorization  
for the promotion from Players Inc., a Washington-based marketing 
company representing many -- but not all -- players. A message left 
with Players Inc. was not immediately returned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That marketing agreement does not include many of the most  
popular quarterbacks, including Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe, Randall 
Cunningham, Brett Favre, Doug Flutie, Dan Marino, Steve Young and 
Vinny Testaverde, who belong to a separate player-owned marketing 
program known as the NFL Quarterback Club, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said players such as running backs Terrell Davis and  
Barry Sanders and stars like Jerry Rice and Junior Seau are not 
among the players the promotion could represent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nor does the Coors promotion disclose that some players, for  
religious or other personal reasons, do not even drink beer,'' the 
lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought unspecified damages as well as a recall of  
any products infringing on the NFL's trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Coors' primary competitors, the Miller Brewing  
Co. and Anheuser-Busch Cos. have sponsorship agreements with the 
NFL through NFL Properties, permitting them to affiliate their 
products with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Coors' ``blatantly unauthorized commercial use  
irreparably and irretrievably damages its exclusive economic 
value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused Coors of planning to promote Coors Light as  
the ``Official Beer of NFL Players'' by putting the slogan on 
signs, posters and inflatable footballs passed out at the end of 
NFL games this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Coors has violated the NFL trademark,  
the lawsuit claimed. It said the company has also tread on the 
league's Super Bowl trademarks in the past.

<HEADLINE> Priest Found Dead Near Church Altar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- When the Rev. Robert Lysz failed to show  
for 7:30 a.m. Mass at St. Matthew Church, parishioners began the 
prayer service without him. 
</P>
<P>
	They hadn't paid much attention to a heap of vestments near the  
altar. But then they noticed blood spatters on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	When parishioner Tom McNamara pulled back the robes, he found  
Lysz's body. It was, he said, like ``getting a punch in the 
stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities charged Michael Ouellette, 32, with murder after  
finding him in the church rectory with Lysz's credit cards, said 
Police Chief John DiVenere. He was held on $1 million bond and 
scheduled for arraignment on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lysz, 50, a native of New Castle, Pa., was ordained in May 1975.  
He came to St. Matthew -- a large, modern brick church in a quiet, 
residential neighborhood -- in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of stunned parishioners held a vigil outside the Roman  
Catholic church on Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Lysz ``was a good priest and a good man,'' said Arthur Audet,  
St. Matthew's associate pastor. ``His nature was to want to help 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parishioner Jesse Corciullo said Lysz ``always remembered you as  
an individual and what you spoke to him about, as if you were the 
only person in his life. His love for this community was 
unsurpassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lysz's death is the second slaying of a priest in Connecticut in  
the past two decades. The Rev. Robert McBride, 48, was fatally shot 
in 1982 in Bridgeport near an apartment complex on the city's west 
side. A Bridgeport man was convicted of the crime a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death of a brother priest always touches the lives of all  
priests'' said Archbishop Daniel Cronin of the Hartford Diocese. 
``But the circumstances surrounding Father Lysz's death will 
profoundly impact all who knew him, and who served with him in his 
priestly ministry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audet said the church must be reconsecrated before hosting Mass.  
The parish school will be used in the meantime, he said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Hopes for NBA, NHL Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- One state has never been home to NBA and NHL  
champions in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, that could change.  
</P>
<P>
	If the San Antonio Spurs beat the New York Knicks in Game 5 of  
the NBA Finals, they'll join the NHL's Dallas Stars as kings of 
their sport, giving Texas a unique first in pro sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would keep alive quite a hot streak for the Lone Star  
State. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Stars and the Spurs, the two-time WNBA  
champion Houston Comets are from Texas. So are two of baseball's 
reigning division winners, both of which are in first place again 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's best college football player played for Texas'  
biggest school, and the state's NFL team is coming off its sixth 
division title in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes with Texas ties also are on a roll, from golfers to the  
world's best women's soccer player to one of the world's fastest 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
	Even WWF superstar ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin is a Texan.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're heading back in the right direction,'' said Tom Hicks,  
owner of the Stars and first-place Texas Rangers, and a member of 
the University of Texas board of regents. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Randy Galloway said the Texas  
sports scene is as strong as he's seen in 33 years of covering it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely the best of times to be a sports fan in this  
part of the world,'' Galloway said. ``I don't think there's ever 
been a bad time, this just happens to be the very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this roll so special is that many of the winners are  
tasting success for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	After 26 seasons in the Alamo City, the Spurs -- who lead the  
Knicks 3-1 in their best-of-7 series -- could win their first 
championship with a victory in Game 5 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	With three chances to win the title, the Spurs appear likely to  
become the first franchise from the defunct ABA to stand atop the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of Texas is rooting for the Spurs,'' Gov. George W. Bush  
said Thursday during a campaign stop in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars moved south in 1993 after 26 championship-less  
seasons in Minnesota. Six years later, they're atop the hockey 
world, having beaten the Buffalo Sabres for the NHL title early 
Sunday. (Interestingly, the Stars weren't even the first Texas team 
to win a hockey championship this month. On June 5, the Houston 
Aeros became champs of the International Hockey League, one of the 
highest minor leagues.) 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' 32-year wait for the franchise's first title was the  
longest in NHL history by eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	A Spurs-Stars double would be extra satisfying for many Texans  
because both losers would be from the state of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes the point even better,'' Hicks said. ``I've got a  
ton of friends in New York and an office in New York, but the 
reality is that it's fun to be on the outside and disappoint them 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Spurs victory would give Texans another interesting claim:  
three straight NBA titles not won by Michael Jordan. The Houston 
Rockets were league champs in 1994 and '95 when Jordan missed all 
or part of two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs bid to be NBA kings, the Houston Comets are the  
proven WNBA queens. The Comets won the first two league titles and 
are 6-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Astros and Texas Rangers are giving the state's  
baseball fans reason to dream once again of an Interstate 45 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston won the NL Central the last two years and is nipping at  
the Atlanta Braves' heels for the top record in the NL this season. 
The Rangers are charging toward a third AL West crown in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the Stanley Cup out there last night and the players in  
the dugout were all rubbing it for good luck,'' Hicks said. 
``Hopefully some of it will wear off on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Texas team has ever made it to the World Series. Many  
Texans haven't noticed, though, because by October they're focused 
only on football. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a lot to cheer about last fall as Ricky Williams won  
the Heisman Trophy, setting all sorts of records as he led the 
Texas Longhorns back from misery. Texas and Texas A&AMP;M played in 
major bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Cowboys did a nice turnaround, too, improving to 10-6  
from 6-10. They were the first team ever to go undefeated in the 
NFC East as they won the division for the 19th time. 
</P>
<P>
	``When society gets fired up over their team and is anxiously  
awaiting the next game, that helps everybody,'' Cowboys owner Jerry 
Jones said. ``The bottom line is it creates a lot of pride, no 
matter if people are really into that sport or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big news in golf is Payne Stewart winning the U.S. Open.  
Around here he's known as ``former SMU golfer Payne Stewart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first family in golf these days in the Kuehne clan of  
Dallas. Hank Kuehne, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, was the 
low amateur in the Open. Two weeks before, little sister Kelli 
followed her first LPGA victory with a third-place finish in the 
U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's World Cup is being played throughout the United  
States and all eyes are on American superstar Mia Hamm, a native of 
Wichita Falls, Texas. She lived up to her hype in Saturday's 
opener, scoring the first goal and assisting on one in a 3-0 
victory over Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, the track world's spotlight will be on the  
200-meter showdown between Maurice Greene and Dallas' Michael 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	As for ``Stone Cold,'' he grew up in Edna, Texas, as Steve  
Williams. The quiet, reserved kid folks in his hometown knew is now 
considered one of wrestling's baddest dudes -- and one of the most 
popular.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Failure Cause Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An errant signal that prematurely set off  
explosive fasteners caused the loss last March of a $75 million 
NASA telescope satellite, an investigation board announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, WIRE, was designed to explore  
the heavens using a telescope that detected faint infrared 
radiation, or heat, coming from distant stars. 
</P>
<P>
	WIRE was launched successfully on March 4, but quickly went into  
an unexpected tumble, spinning at up to 60 revolutions per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers stabilized the craft, but discovered that all  
of its supercold hydrogen had been vented into space. Without the 
hydrogen cooling, the WIRE telescope was unable to detect faint 
infrared stellar radiation. The mission was declared a failure on 
March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation board determined that an unexpected electric  
signal set off explosive fasteners that were designed to eject a 
cover over the telescope. The cover was ejected prematurely, 
exposing the supercold hydrogen to sunlight. Solar heat caused the 
hydrogen to convert to gas and vent into space. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Darrell Branscome, chairman of the investigation board,  
said in a statement: ``This was simply a case of a design error 
that allowed power to get to the explosive charges before it should 
have. The system operated the way it was designed. Unfortunately, 
the design was flawed.''

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Rumor Closes Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States temporarily shuttered six  
embassies in Africa as a ``prudent measure'' after learning they 
were under surveillance by suspicious individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The closings, at least through Sunday, followed U.S.  
intelligence indications that Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi 
millionaire suspected of heading a terrorist organization, was in 
the final stages of planning a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The first anniversary of twin bombings last Aug. 7 of the U.S.  
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania is approaching, and bin Laden is 
accused in a trial in New York of masterminding the attacks. There 
are 15 defendants of whom nine are fugitives, including bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts killed 224 people, including 12 Americans in Nairobi.  
</P>
<P>
	The embassies in Gambia, Togo, Madagascar, Liberia, Namibia and  
Senegal were closed Thursday. State Department spokesman James P. 
Rubin said officials would decide this weekend whether to reopen 
them Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had information suggesting suspicious individuals were  
surveying the sites, and as a precautionary, prudent measure, we 
suspended operations,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. embassies worldwide have been placed on a heightened state  
of alert due to increased security concerns, he said. All six 
embassies closed have undergone security upgrades since last 
August's bombings, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether bin Laden is suspected, Rubin said, ``We think  
that Osama bin Laden is responsible for the deaths of Americans and 
he will have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. We're determined 
to find those responsible for killing Americans, no matter how long 
it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden is thought to be in Afghanistan.  
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, guard duties have  
been doubled at U.S. government installations around Africa and 
concrete crash barriers have been installed on nearby streets. In 
addition, U.S. embassy in Uganda has been closed on occasion for 
security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gambia, U.S. officials were taking no chances even though the  
country is a ``safe place,'' said Cherno Jallow, Gambia's deputy 
permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temporary closures are warranted by external factors; that  
is, the Americans fear that bin Laden is planning to mount 
terrorist attacks on U.S. installations in Gambia,'' Jallow said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the sites of U.S. installations:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In the Gambian capital of Banjul, a cultural center and the  
residence of the U.S. ambassador have been under rigorous security 
since last year, Jallow said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An officer stationed outside the embassy in Lome, Togo, said  
Friday that security already was tight and had not been increased. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In the Senegalese capital of Dakar, gendarmes cordoned off  
three streets surrounding the closed U.S. Embassy, stopping traffic 
in the bustling downtown and prompting frustration among commuters 
and motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin did not cite any specific threats or militant  
organizations. However, he said, ``We have seen a pattern of 
activity indicating continued planning for terrorist attacks by 
members of Osama bin Laden's network. And we take reporting of such 
threats seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most U.S. embassies in sub-Saharan Africa were closed for two  
days last December in the tense environment that followed the U.S. 
bombing of Iraq over President Saddam Hussein's refusal to let 
international inspectors explore suspected weapons sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin said terrorists were not intimidating the United  
States or having an impact on U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have foiled their objective of stopping our determination  
to have an American presence around the world and to interfere with 
our determination as a global power to have American troop presence 
in various countries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That assessment was questioned by Harvey Kushner, chairman of  
the Criminal Justice department at Long Island University's C.W. 
Post campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you close six embassies in a region in the world, you  
send a message to the world that not only have the terrorists made 
us blink but we have written off a large number of people in a part 
of the world,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., urged Congress to  
complete action on the State Department appropriations bill that 
provides $583.5 million to improve embassy security. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg, chairman of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, added  
$105 million in security money to the administration's request for 
embassies. ``The sudden closing of six U.S. embassies in Africa 
yesterday underscores the need to improve security overseas for our 
personnel and facilities,'' he said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Concerns Close Six U.S. Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States temporarily shut down six  
embassies in Africa after receiving information they were under 
surveillance by suspicious individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassies in Gambia, Togo, Madagascar, Liberia, Namibia and  
Senegal were closed Thursday and will remain shuttered through 
Sunday. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said today a 
decision would be made over the weekend on whether they will be 
reopened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be assessing that this afternoon and tomorrow,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had information suggesting suspicious individuals were  
surveying the sites, and as a precautionary, prudent measure we 
suspended operations,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, U.S. embassies in Africa and the rest of the world  
have been placed on a heightened state of alert due to increased 
security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin did not cite any specific threats or militant  
organizations. However, he said, ``We have seen a pattern of 
activity indicating continued planning for terrorist attacks by 
members of Osama bin Laden's network. And we take reporting of such 
threats seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American embassies have been closed before in response to  
terrorist threats or concerns they might be targeted. But Rubin 
said terrorists were not intimidating the United States or having 
an impact on U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have foiled their objective of stopping our determination  
to have an American presence around the world and to interfere with 
our determination as a global power to have American troop presence 
in various countries,'' he said. ``So, they have failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``That doesn't mean we don't have to adjust our  
practices, that we don't have to spend more money to protect our 
people, and we are determined to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that the United States  
was putting pressure on a number of governments to capture accused 
terrorist bin Laden. He is accused in the deadly attacks on U.S. 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August and has been placed on 
the FBI's list of 10 most-wanted fugitives. He is believed to be in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, U.S. intelligence officials said bin Laden was  
believed to be in the final stages of planning another attack on 
U.S. facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that Osama bin Laden is responsible for the deaths of  
Americans and he will have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide,'' 
Rubin said today. ``We're determined to find those responsible for 
killing Americans no matter how long it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department noted that U.S. embassies in Africa and the  
rest of the world have been on a heightened alert status due to 
increased security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Most U.S. embassies in sub-Saharan Africa were ordered closed  
for two days in December, following U.S. action in Iraq. The U.S. 
Embassy in Uganda also has closed on a few occasions due to 
security concerns since the nearly simultaneous bombings of the 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherno Jallow of Gambia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said  
closing the Embassy in Gambia's capital of Banjul had resulted in 
no extraordinary security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temporary closure is warranted by external factors -- that  
is, the Americans' fear that bin Laden is planning to mount 
terrorist attacks on U.S. installations in the Gambia,'' Jallow 
said.

<HEADLINE> Haskins Appears Set To Leave Minn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins' job as Minnesota basketball  
coach appeared over today, with university regents considering a 
buyout package and the governor saying he was told Haskins would 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Regents was discussing a $1.3 million buyout for a  
coach whose program is under university investigation for possible 
academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	However, university president Mark Yudof could seal the deal on  
his own. Gov. Jesse Ventura said on his statewide radio show he 
spoke with Yudof today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He informed me that unfortunately, well maybe fortunately in  
some people's minds ... we will have a new men's basketball coach 
at the University of Minnesota,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' lawyer, Ron Zamansky, told the Star Tribune he and  
university general counsel Mark Rotenberg agreed to the buyout 
package Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted an unidentified source saying the package  
was valued at $1.3 million plus benefits. A source, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, confirmed the figure to The Associated 
Press today, but said it could change. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials cautioned there was no deal without the coach's  
approval. Zamansky didn't immediately return a call to his office 
today from the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has been under pressure since March when accusations  
about the program first broke. The coach has maintained he had no 
knowledge of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the phone at Haskins' suburban Minneapolis  
home this morning said he was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' fate apparently was decided after two critical meetings  
within 24 hours at his home. He met Tuesday for three hours with 
independent investigators Michael Glazier and Donald Lewis. On 
Wednesday, Haskins and Zamansky met with Yudof and Rotenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't negotiate anything,'' Yudof said Thursday. ``I told  
him what my concerns were about the program. He told me he would 
like to remain to coach. ... He stated some observations, and I 
stated mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof authorized Rotenberg to negotiate a buyout three weeks  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began after the Saint Paul Pioneer Press  
reported in March that Jan Gangelhoff, a former office manager in 
the academic counseling unit, said she did more than 400 pieces of 
course work for at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation widened to include accusations of improper  
payments, travel irregularities and improper relationships between 
the team and university police investigating possible crimes 
involving players. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said today that mere discussion of a Haskins buyout  
vindicated her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... think that the university would not have began  
discussions with coach Haskins unless they had some firm evidence 
to make this decision,'' she told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins had three years left on a 10-year contract he signed in  
1994, retroactive to the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract ensured Haskins about $423,000 even if the  
university could prove a just-cause firing. If Haskins were 
terminated without cause, the contract entitled him to about $1.3 
million plus several hundred thousand dollars in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before a group of lawyers Thursday, Yudof said there's  
no way around a legal contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often these contracts reflect market power,'' Yudof said. ``In  
the sports business, frankly, negotiating contracts ... is not like 
negotiating a contract for a professor or even for a university 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Lord, who represents several clients making  
accusations in the case, faxed a letter to Yudof, Rotenberg and 
regents Thursday urging the university not to give Haskins a 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited state law and previous court decisions in claiming  
Haskins may have breached his contract by wrongdoing, and the 
university may not be obligated to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof called Lord's letter ``outrageous.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mellon Gives Museum Another Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Philanthropist Paul Mellon has left the  
National Gallery of Art yet another gift: a 73-piece art collection 
assembled in the last years of his life at his office and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection includes French, American and English works, The  
Washington Post reported in Friday's editions. Among them is the 
Mellon set of unique Edgar Degas waxes, including ``Little Dancer 
Fourteen Years Old,'' and five domestic still lifes by John 
Frederick Peto. One of the contributions -- a poodle portrait from 
1780 -- is by Mellon's favorite British painter, George Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of the Degas works, including the painting ``Fallen  
Jockey,'' deeply enhances the museum's collection by the artist, 
National Gallery Directory Earl A. Powell told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The gifts will arrive later this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Mellon died Feb. 1 at the age of 91. He left the museum its  
largest gift of $75 million and a collection of more than 100 works 
of art, including paintings by Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and 
Winslow Homer. Those donations, which will remain with Mellon's 
widow until her death, were announced earlier this year.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edgar Degas' original wax sculpture ``Little  
14-Year-Old-Dancer'' is expected to go on show this fall for the 
first time since 1991, part of the last gift of the late Paul 
Mellon, announced Friday by the National Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	The heir to the fortune of former Treasury Secretary Andrew  
Mellon died Feb. 1 at 91. The 73 items in this collection, held in 
a trust and not part of his will, brings to about 1,100 the total 
number of works he donated to the gallery that his father was 
instrumental in founding. 
</P>
<P>
	The precise date and contents of the memorial Mellon exhibit  
have not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only version of the 'Little Dancer' Degas himself  
ever touched or saw,'' said Alison Luchs, a sculpture curator at 
the gallery. It was the only example shown in his lifetime of what 
must have been a highly personal form of expression. Most of the 
waxes were found in his studio after his death in 1917 -- his 
fingerprints can be seen on some. 
</P>
<P>
	Degas himself adorned the wax figure with hair about 1880. He  
chose the orange-yellow bodice, which has not been replaced, and 
the ballet skirt which has. In past centuries, sculptors often put 
clothes on statues, but by Degas' time the idea was a radical 
novelty. 
</P>
<P>
	A foundry made more than 20 casts of the wax original, following  
Degas' death in 1917, which are in museums and private collections. 
The foundry and later owners have dressed the casts. One fetched 
$11,882,500 at a New York auction in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 73 gifts is a landmark painting, ``The Fallen  
Jockey,'' which Degas worked and reworked over 30 years. It will 
get a show to itself at the gallery in mid-July, after appearing 
there in a collection of the artist's horse paintings -- the first 
of its kind -- in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Horses, ballet dancers and women bathing -- all among the French  
artist's favorite subjects -- also appear among the sculptures in 
the gift: 29 waxes, four bronzes and four of plaster or mixed 
materials. The gallery already has 37 Degas sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
	The sculptures and the 19 paintings -- including ``The Fallen  
Jockey'' -- make the gallery's Degas collection one of the world's 
most notable. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift also includes a 200-year-old picture by the English  
animal painter George Stubbs -- ``White Poodle in a Punt.'' Poodles 
were trained for hunting, and this one looks poised to jump into 
the water from the small flat-bottomed boat, perhaps to retrieve a 
bird. A horse painting by Stubbs was the first ever bought by 
Mellon, whose Sea Hero won the Kentucky Derby in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	American art is represented in the gift by five small oils of  
the painter John Frederick Peto of the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Mellon gave hundreds of millions of dollars during his life  
and in his will: for Van Goghs, Cezannes and other paintings to 
museums, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina and 
beautification of the park across the street from the White House.

<HEADLINE> Rail Slay Suspect Was Let Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Immigration officials say they didn't know Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez was wanted for questioning in three murders in 
Texas and one in Kentucky when they took him into custody early 
this month but then let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested  
Resendez-Ramirez in the El Paso area during the week of June 1 for 
being in this country illegally and deported him to Mexico later 
that day, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was processed as one of the approximately 1.5 million  
illegal immigrants captured by the Border Patrol in the Southwest 
every year,'' INS spokesman Russ Bergeron said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time he was in the custody of the Border Patrol, they  
didn't have any information on his criminal record or of any 
outstanding warrants. He was simply treated like any other illegal 
immigrant and repatriated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears he did not remain in Mexico long.  
</P>
<P>
	Two days after his June 2 release, authorities believe he killed  
a 73-year-old woman west of Houston. The following day, they 
believe he killed a 26-year-old Houston schoolteacher at her home. 
His fingerprints then were found June 15 in Gorham, Ill., at the 
scene of the murder of an 80-year-old man and his 52-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force of more than 200 investigators has been  
fielding hundreds of tips since Resendez-Ramirez, believed to be 
38, went on the agency's 10 Most Wanted list Monday. A $125,000 
reward is posted for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been charged with the two slayings in Illinois and is  
suspected of a 1997 Kentucky killing and five since last fall in 
Texas. A common thread is that the crimes occurred in homes near 
railroad tracks; authorities believe he traverses the country 
aboard freight trains. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a history of slipping into the United States illegally  
since 1976, has served state prison time in New Mexico and Florida 
and had been deported at least four times. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI declined to assign blame for immigration officials not  
having the information on Resendez-Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to discuss whether it was a mechanical error or  
an error at all,'' said Don Clark, special agent in charge of a 
task force pursuing him. ``Mr. Ramirez has not slipped through our 
fingers. This is another piece of lead information for us.''

<HEADLINE> Next Justice Named Will Be Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court's 5-4 commitment to giving  
states more power at the federal government's expense grew more 
intense in its 1998-99 term. The hardening split, identical to the 
court's rift over the role of race in American life, emphasized the 
enormous impact the next president could have with just one 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	The just-completed term saw Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.  
Kennedy, who wield great power from court's ideological center, 
join the more conservative Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, 
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas to dramatically enhance states' 
rights by eroding Congress' power. 
</P>
<P>
	Their more liberal colleagues -- John Paul Stevens, David H.  
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- joined in 
dissent as a decade-long trend continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The same division developed in previous terms in a series of  
rulings that curtailed racial affirmative action when election 
districts are drawn and government money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next presidential election means a great deal for the  
Supreme Court's future,'' said Douglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine 
University law professor. ``The current cast of justices is so 
closely balanced in terms of ideology that whoever gets elected in 
2000 could be deciding the court's philosophy for the next decade 
or more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the court's members appears to be contemplating imminent  
retirement. Stevens is 79, and Rehnquist will turn 75 before the 
court returns to the bench in October. 
</P>
<P>
	In three rulings, the court invoked states' sovereign immunity  
in sweeping terms to shield them from being sued by individuals or 
businesses who claim a state or one of its agencies has violated 
some federal right. An act of Congress could not trump such 
immunity, the court said as it banned, among others, private 
lawsuits against states to enforce patent, trademark or copyright 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen nothing like this since the 1930s,'' Washington  
lawyer Walter Dellinger said, referring to a conservative Supreme 
Court's dismantling of various federal economic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's deference to state power was not absolute, however.  
O'Connor and Kennedy joined the four more liberal justices as the 
court banned California, and by extension all other states, from 
paying lower welfare benefits to newcomers than longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cases focusing on individual rights yielded mixed results.  
</P>
<P>
	The court, by striking down a Chicago ordinance, limited cities'  
authority to use anti-loitering laws to rein in street-gang 
dominance of terrified neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In other law-and-order decisions, the justices said police can  
search the personal belongings of all passengers in a car whose 
driver is suspected of possessing illegal drugs. But the court 
barred officers from searching people and their cars after merely 
ticketing them for routine traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	On personal privacy, the court ruled that short-term guests in  
someone's home have no constitutional protection against 
unreasonable police searches. It also ruled, however, that police 
cannot let TV camera crews and other news media accompany them when 
they enter someone's home to make an arrest or conduct a search. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled that the Americans with Disabilities Act  
obligates states to place mentally disabled people in community 
settings, not state hospitals, whenever appropriate and financially 
possible. But they said the law does not protect the more than 100 
million Americans whose physical impairments can be corrected with 
medication or devices such as eyeglasses or hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court's record in more traditional civil rights case was  
probably better than expected,'' said Steven Shapiro, national 
legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Theodore Olson said the term's record  
indicated how difficult it can be to place labels on its 
jurisprudence. ``We want to characterize `the court,' and there are 
nine fiercely independent justices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major decisions, in summary:  
</P>
<P>
                          *SEX HARASSMENT   	
</P>
<P>
	--School districts can be sued, under a federal law that bans  
discrimination in educational programs receiving federal money, 
when officials ignore serious sexual harassment against students by 
other students. 
</P>
<P>
                              *CENSUS   	
</P>
<P>
	--Statistical sampling, said to make up for traditional  
undercounting of racial minorities, cannot be used in the 2000 
census to determine how many members of Congress each state is 
entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
                            *FREE SPEECH   	
</P>
<P>
	--The federal government cannot ban full casino advertising in  
its effort to protect compulsive gamblers. The court said the 
federal ban unlawfully interfered with truthful commercial speech. 
</P>
<P>
	--States cannot require people who circulate initiative petitions  
to be registered voters or wear identification badges. Initiative 
backers cannot be required to file reports identifying paid 
petition circulators. 
</P>
<P>
                             *JOB BIAS   	
</P>
<P>
	--Victims of on-the-job discrimination can collect punitive  
damages from employers without proving ``egregious'' conduct, but 
employers cannot be forced to pay awards intended to punish them if 
their managers' misconduct went against the employers' bid to 
maintain a bias-free workplace. 
</P>
<P>
                           *DEATH PENALTY   	
</P>
<P>
	--Jurors considering sentences for convicted murderers do not  
have to be told what punishment will be meted out if they fail to 
agree whether life in prison or death is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
                             *BUSINESS   	
</P>
<P>
	--The Federal Communications Commission, not the individual  
states, has the authority to set pricing rules for opening local 
phone markets to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	--The guidelines that let judges exclude ``junk science'' as  
trial evidence apply to the proposed testimony of all expert 
witnesses, not just scientists.

<HEADLINE> IBM Cuts 1,100 Jobs in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- IBM on Thursday began eliminating 1,100  
jobs in San Jose, roughly 10 percent of its Northern California 
workforce, in preparation for moving most of its server disk drive 
business to Japan and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Storage Systems Division will remain headquartered  
in San Jose, with a focus on research and development of new 
storage technologies and high-end disk drive design. IBM also plans 
to add some customer and technical support jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever possible, we'll try to match folks with eliminated  
positions and the needs of the company,'' IBM spokesman Dave Berman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Managers began meeting individually Thursday with the affected  
employees, who have two months to try for other jobs within IBM -- a 
difficult proposition for factory workers without advanced degrees. 
All are all regular, full-time workers in the storage division. The 
cuts should take a year to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said it is moving its tape drive assembly operations from  
San Jose to Guadalajara, Mexico. Other manufacturing operations are 
going to other sites in Mexico and Hungary. Only a few employees 
will be transferred to Fujisawa, Japan, where the server disk drive 
business is being moved. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest restructuring, announced generally to employees a  
month ago, is intended to standardize design features high-end and 
low-end server drives, reducing costs and shortening the time it 
takes to get products to market. Most of the products will actually 
be manufactured in Singapore and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Disk drives remain one of the seminal products of the Silicon  
Valley, a business worth $32.4 billion this year, said Jim Porter, 
founder of market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. in Mountain View. 
IBM's 27 percent share of the market earned it revenues of more 
than $8.2 billion in 1998, the majority from sales of server 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
	But manufacturers are scrambling to cut costs and keep ahead as  
prices for computers steadily fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxiety reigned among employees Thursday at lunch spots near the  
IBM campus in south San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why I went to IBM was they told me that as long as  
you work hard and are dedicated, you'd have security and be taken 
care of,'' one 20-year veteran told the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done more than my share, overtime, weekends, you name it.  
Now they're just kicking me out the door and saying we don't need 
you no more?''

<HEADLINE> Stefan, Brendl Likely Top NHL Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Patrik Stefan's two concussions last season might  
keep him from being the No. 1 pick Saturday in the NHL entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	He still could get the nod when Tampa Bay, choosing first for  
the second straight year, begins the nine-round selection process. 
And Stefan says there's nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit too much, everybody talking about it,'' he  
said Friday, ``But I know how I feel. I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was given medical clearance about two weeks ago to  
resume skating and working out. His agent, Rich Winter, was 
expected to share the medical records Friday with interested teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``These injuries are severe injuries,'' Lightning head scout Don  
Murdoch said before the records were made available. But, he added, 
Stefan ``is one guy that could step right in next year and play. He 
is a power forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, which picked 26 players in Friday's expansion draft,  
has the second pick Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's Central Scouting Service made the 205-pound Stefan the  
top-rated North American player eligible for the draft. He had 11 
goals and 24 assists in 33 games last season for Long Beach of the 
International Hockey League, where he was one of the youngest 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great experience,'' the native of Prague in the Czech  
Republic said of his two IHL seasons. ``That's why I came to play 
in the IHL because I want to be ready as soon as I can to play in 
the NHL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the experience wasn't so great.  
</P>
<P>
	His first concussion caused him to miss 38 games last season  
after he was checked into the boards against the Houston Aeros. The 
second came soon after he returned when he was hit in the head by 
an opponent's knee, ending his season on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike recent first choices -- Joe Thornton to Boston in 1997 and  
Vincent Lecavalier to Tampa Bay in 1998 -- there is no consensus No. 
1 selection this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Stefan, the candidates for that honor include another  
Czech player, Pavel Brendl, who scored 73 goals in 68 games for 
Calgary of the Western Hockey League last season, and identical 
twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin of Sweden. They who hope a trade can 
be worked out so they can continue playing together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a good chance,'' Daniel said. ``We're working  
hard to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't think he and his brother are strong enough to  
play in the NHL next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better for us to play in Sweden for two more years,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The top American in the draft is center Tim Connolly of  
Baldwinsville, N.Y., who had 34 goals last season for Erie of the 
Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading goalie is Brian Finley, who had a 2.66 goals against  
average and 36-10-4 record with three shutouts last season for 
Barrie of the Ontario Hockey League. The Lightning had Corey Schwab 
at that position, but Atlanta took him in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's more pressing need is on offense. It scored a  
league-low 179 goals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very strong draft and it's very strong at forward,  
which is good for us. We all know that's an area we have to get 
better on,'' Murdoch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford to make a mistake with this pick,'' said  
general manager and coach Jacques Demers. ``This pick could make a 
difference, a huge difference, in the future of this franchise. We 
cannot mess it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Tampa Bay has reached the playoffs just once in  
seven seasons since joining the NHL in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, the newest NHL team, doesn't face quite the same  
pressure with the second pick. Thrashers general manager Don 
Waddell is taking a long-term approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying, `Which player's going to be the best for us five  
years from now, not this year,' '' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be Stefan, if Tampa Bay passes on him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried'' about being bypassed, he said. ``I don't  
want to think about it. They've seen me play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver has the third pick. Chicago won the draft lottery  
despite having just a 3.7 percent chance and moved from eighth to 
fourth, the maximum number of spots a team could advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest pressure will be on the Lightning as they choose  
among several strong candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a no-brainer this year,'' Murdoch said. ``Beyond  
that, about the only thing I can assure you is we won't take a 
goalie first. Anything is possible.''

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Hearing Moves to Next Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having established that the chief prosecution  
witness against former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros spun a 
years' long web of lies for federal investigators, lawyers for the 
one-time Clinton Cabinet member sought today to undercut her 
statements on the witness stand this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Texas lawyers subpoenaed by the defense offered testimony  
today in direct contradiction to statements that Cisneros' 
ex-mistress, Linda Jones, made on the stand as a government 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubbock attorney Floyd Holder, who represented Ms. Jones in her  
1994 breach-of-contract suit against Cisneros, denied that he 
ordered her to alter the tapes she secretly made of her phone 
conversations with Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified on several occasions this week that Holder and a  
second Lubbock attorney, Bruce Magness, suggested she should edit 
out embarassing passages and sections where she threatened 
Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	She claimed no recollection of talking to another Lubbock  
lawyer, Michael Carper, about the existence of tape recordings. But 
Carper testified that she called him, unsolicited, in 1990 to 
explore her legal options and mentioned she had tapes that could 
prove ``very embarrassing'' to Cisneros if publicly disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Carper acknowledged that she didn't ask him to  
represent her, he said he wanted nothing to do with her pursuit of 
a financial settlement from Cisneros because ``I just perceived it 
as nothing short of a shakedown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today marked the fifth day of a pretrial hearing that carries  
high stakes for both prosecutors and the defense as they move 
toward Cisneros' conspiracy and obstruction of justice trial in 
September. The hearing will continue next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has sought to portray Ms. Jones as an opportunist  
preying on a vulnerable Cisneros. During what U.S. District Judge 
Stanley Sporkin referred to as ``grueling'' cross-examination, Ms. 
Jones was forced to admit again and again that she lied previously 
to FBI and IRS agents investigating Cisneros, as well as a host of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' legal team is seeking to thwart the government's use  
of the tapes Ms. Jones recorded as her relationship with Cisneros 
deteriorated and she scrambled to obtain proof of his verbal 
commitment to support her financially. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings are central to the government's contention that  
Cisneros conspired with Ms. Jones and two aides to conceal from the 
FBI the scope of his payments to her after their extramarital 
affair exploded into public view in 1988, torpedoing her marriage 
and career as a political fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' attorneys contend the 88 tapes -- all of which are  
copies of since-destroyed originals -- are inadmissible because they 
constitute ``tampered'' evidence. The government contends they are 
legitimate and that only five of the 34 tapes they are seeking to 
play at trial were altered by Ms. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence in part because  
she ran afoul of Independent Counsel David Barrett for 
misrepresenting the tapes as unaltered originals. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett has pledged to support a reduction in her prison  
sentence, and to dismiss two remaining counts against her, if she 
provides complete cooperation at trial -- an agreement that Cisneros 
lawyer Brendan Sullivan underlined Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who served as HUD secretary from 1993 through 1996,  
acknowledged to the FBI agents conducting his Cabinet background 
check that he had provided financial support. But prosecutors 
contend he falsely told the FBI that he never paid Ms. Jones more 
than $2,500 at one time or more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that he paid her more than $264,000  
between 1990 and 1993, in installments as high as $15,000. He has 
pleaded innocent to an 18-count indictment charging him with felony 
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements to 
the FBI.

<HEADLINE> Some Online Students To Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department announced Friday  
which universities providing courses or degree programs online will 
be allowed to offer their students federal financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 118 institutions in 17 states will offer federal student aid  
under the Distance Education Demonstration Program, a pilot program 
approved last year after years of aid restrictions on 
nontraditional programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional lawmakers cautiously expanded federal financial  
aid to students in such programs following reports of scholarship 
fraud by correspondence schools several years ago. Ultimately, 
lawmakers decided to waive a host of federal requirements for how 
student aid is used. 
</P>
<P>
	One such waiver will allow distance-education students at the  
selected institutions to use their federal aid to buy computers and 
modems or pay living expenses, all of which are not allowed for 
traditional college students. 
</P>
<P>
	Distance learning supporters worry that federal financial-aid  
policies -- which change about every five years -- will not keep up 
with a rapidly changing trend that includes learning via the 
Internet. Others complain that the selected programs will get an 
unfair edge in the distance-education market. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said in a statement that  
the pilot project will ensure that students in distance-learning 
programs get the financial help they need. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department statistics for fall 1998 show that distance  
education courses were offered by 90 percent of all higher 
education institutions enrolling more than 10,000 students and 85 
percent of schools with enrollments between 3,000 and 10,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will be monitored carefully, Riley said. An  
additional 35 colleges or groups of colleges may be added for the 
third year of the five-year program. 
</P>
<P>
	The selected programs are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Capella University (formerly The Graduate School of America),  
Minneapolis, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	--Colorado Community Colleges &AMP; Occupational Education System,  
Denver, Colo., 13 community colleges in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	--Connecticut Distance Learning Consortium, New Britain, Conn.,  
23 institutions in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	--Florida State University,Tallahassee, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
	--Franklin University, Columbus, Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
	--LDS Church Education System, Provo, Utah, which consists of  
four institutions in Hawaii, Utah and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	--Masters Institute, San Jose, Calif.  
</P>
<P>
	--New York University, N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
	--North Dakota University System, Grand Forks, N.Dak., 11  
institutions in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	--QUEST Education Corp., Davenport, Iowa, which includes Hamilton  
College and the American Institute of Commerce, both in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southern Christian University, Montgomery, Ala.  
</P>
<P>
	--Southwest Consortium for the Advancement of Technology in  
Education, Lubbock, Texas, 14 schools in Texas and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	--University of Maryland University College, College Park, Md.  
</P>
<P>
	--Washington State University, Pullman, Wash.  
</P>
<P>
	--Washington Community and Technical College Online Consortium,  
Tacoma, Wash., 44 colleges in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Drug Agent Convicted in Tax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former state drug agent accused of stealing  
650 pounds of cocaine was convicted of tax evasion and found 
innocent on two drug charges and a money laundering charge. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz declared a mistrial Friday on  
four remaining charges that included burglary and possession of 
drugs with intent to sell after the jury deadlocked on those 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Wayne Parker, 44, will remain in custody until July 6,  
when he is scheduled for another hearing. Prosecutors are expected 
to announce at that time whether Parker will be retried. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing on the tax evasion conviction was not set.  
</P>
<P>
	The tense jury deliberations, lasting two weeks, included a  
flare-up in which some jurors had to be restrained from fighting 
one another. The jury last week reached verdicts in four of the 
eight charges against Parker, but the verdicts weren't unsealed 
until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker was accused of stealing the cocaine from the state Bureau  
of Narcotics Enforcement's Riverside office in 1997, making the 
theft look like a forced burglary. The prosecution said he sold the 
cocaine through several ``conduits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker's lawyer, Richard Hamar, claimed during the trial that  
drug informants were trying to frame Parker, who was a drug agent 
for 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Move for Mistrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Testimony in the first class-action lawsuit by  
smokers to go to trial ended Friday, with a lawyer for smokers and 
their families mocking claims that tobacco companies worked to make 
their products safer and the defense asking for a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding an unlit cigarette to his lips, Stanley Rosenblatt told  
jurors there is ``no way to make this product safe and all the 
efforts, all the so-called efforts, at making it safe are a con and 
are a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Rosenblatt finished and the jury left the courtroom, Brown  
&AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. lawyer Ed Moss asked Circuit Judge 
Robert Kaye for a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss said several ``inappropriate'' comments during Rosenblatt's  
closing argument prejudiced the six-member jury, including a 
statement about a sick war veteran who was waiting on their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got an impossible situation here, where we can't get a  
fair trial,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye made no ruling on the motion, saying that he would take it  
under advisement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers or their  
survivors are seeking at least $200 billion from Philip Morris 
Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and other cigarette makers and 
industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Following eight months of testimony, the jury is set to begin  
deliberations Monday to determine whether the defendants are 
responsible for illnesses the plaintiffs claim they suffered 
because they were deceived into taking up a habit they couldn't 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is about responsibility, the responsibility of a  
giant industry that makes a product that when used as directed, 
causes great suffering and death to its customers,'' Rosenblatt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, lead tobacco lawyer Robert Heim argued that punitive  
damages would be warranted only if the companies' conduct caused 
injury, and said that has not been proven. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say that companies ... have had a reckless disregard  
for safety, that they showed an entire lack of care,'' he said. 
``The evidence has showed that they have been committed over the 
years ... to making cigarettes as safe as they can be.''

<HEADLINE> O'Neal's Lakers Contract Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Although there was little doubt Shaquille  
O'Neal would remain with the Los Angeles Lakers, his agent made it 
official today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will not exercise his option to terminate his contract with  
the team and will leave the remaining four-year term of the 
agreement intact,'' Leonard Armato said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, a second-team All-NBA pick this season after finishing  
second in the league in scoring at 26.3 and seventh in rebounding 
at 10.7, had a contract option that would have allowed him to 
become a free agent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he will be with the team in its first season under new  
head coach Phil Jackson. The Lakers, who were swept by San Antonio 
in the Western Conference semifinals, also will be playing in a new 
arena, the Staples Center.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Secret Recording Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court has ruled that  
news gatherers may be sued for infiltrating a workplace and 
secretly recording an employee. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court had overturned $1.2 million verdict  
awarded to Mark Sanders, an employee of a psychic hotline whose 
conversations with a reporter posing as a co-worker were broadcast 
nationally on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court had ruled that the clandestine taping did not  
violate his privacy because his conversations were in an open area 
of the workplace and could have been overheard by others. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high court ruled Thursday that employees have a right to  
expect that private conversations with co-workers will not be 
secretly taped and broadcast to others. 
</P>
<P>
	The court did not order Sanders' damages reinstated, saying the  
appellate court must still consider other issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar did say a news  
organization may be able to defend a secret recording by showing 
that it was necessary for news coverage. The recording may also be 
easier to defend if the workplace is open to the public, Werdegar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was videotaped by ABC News reporter Stacy Lescht, who  
had answered a want ad for a business advertising telephone psychic 
advice for $3.95 a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a hidden camera and microphone, she recorded two  
conversations with Sanders at their work cubicles in a large room 
divided by partitions. Six seconds of the tape were shown on ABC 
News's ``Prime Time Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My hope is that now ABC will curtail its nasty and abusive  
practices and consider apologizing,'' said Neville Johnson, 
Sanders' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said it will consider an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Take NHL Expansion Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The players chosen by the Atlanta Thrashers in  
Friday's expansion draft don't score many goals. With strong 
goalies, the NHL's newest team might not give up many either. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, which traded last week for Damian Rhodes of Ottawa,  
added Detroit's Norm Maracle, Tampa Bay's Corey Schwab and 
Carolina's Trevor Kidd in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd didn't last long with the Thrashers. He was traded to  
Florida in a four-player deal, one of eight moves made by Atlanta 
after the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Kidd, the Thrashers received defenseman Gord  
Murphy, who played 51 games for the Panthers, and forward Herbert 
Vasilyev, who had 28 goals and 76 points for Florida's American 
Hockey League affiliate in Kentucky. Atlanta also got Daniel 
Tjarnquist, who played in Sweden, and a sixth-round pick in 
Saturday's entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers also acquired defenseman Ulf Samuelsson from  
Detroit for future considerations after the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta chose 26 players, including 10 defensemen, some of whom  
could be dealt for scorers. 
</P>
<P>
	The best goal scorers drafted were Terry Yake of St. Louis and  
Mike Stapleton of Phoenix, who had nine each last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about our goaltending as I stand here now  
with Rhodes and Maracle,'' Atlanta general manager Don Waddell 
said. ``I feel good about our defense. We got the bangers and the 
checkers we wanted. Now we have to find some goal scorers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell is especially high on Maracle, who had a 2.27  
goals-against average in 16 games as backup to Chris Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was allowed to choose one player from each team, except  
Nashville. The Predators didn't lose anyone because they were an 
expansion team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers had to take at least three goalies, eight  
defensemen and 13 forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-hour before Waddell announced his picks, a workman  
stepped on the FleetCenter stage and wiped to a shine the team's 
logo for its inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the better-known players who will wear that logo on  
their jerseys next season -- barring trades -- are defenseman Darryl 
Shannon of Stanley Cup finalist Buffalo, and forwards Kelly 
Buchberger of Edmonton and Jody Hull of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing Ed Ward from Calgary and Buchberger went along with  
Waddell's philosophy of ``getting good character players to build 
around our young players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said the first area we were going to look at is NHL  
experience,'' Waddell said. ``But it was smart for us to open it up 
to'' youngsters with potential. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll pick up more of them in Saturday's entry draft. Atlanta  
has the second pick behind Tampa Bay, unless Waddell yields to 
inquiries from other teams and trades it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said we weren't going to trade our pick, but I owe it to our  
organization to listen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the more intriguing names on the unprotected list was  
38-year-old Igor Larionov, tied for second among Detroit's scorers 
last season with 63 points -- including 14 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell knew him well, having served as Red Wings assistant  
general manager before joining Atlanta last season. But Maracle was 
the Detroit player preferred by Waddell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tough being in Detroit ... and seeing what Igor  
brings to a hockey team,'' Waddell said about bypassing Larionov. 
``If we were making a run for a (Stanley) Cup, maybe, but not as an 
expansion team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 defensemen chosen were Shannon, Jamie Pushor from  
Anaheim, Petr Buzek from Dallas, Brett Clark from Montreal, Kevin 
Dean from New Jersey, David Harlock from the New York Islanders, 
Chris Tamer from the New York Rangers, Maxim Galanov from 
Pittsburgh, Yannick Tremblay from Toronto and Mark Tinordi from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got the list (of unprotected players), immediately  
defense showed up as the strength of this draft,'' Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 forwards taken were Ward, Buchberger, Hull, Yake,  
Stapleton, Peter Ferraro from Boston, Sylvain Cloutier from 
Chicago, Tomi Kallio from Colorado, Johan Garpenlov from Florida, 
Matt Johnson from Los Angeles, Phil Crowe from Ottawa, Alexei 
Yegorov from San Jose and Steve Staios from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	After the draft, Ferraro was traded back to Boston for  
minor-leaguer Randy Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
	In deals involving future considerations, the Thrashers acquired  
goalie Scott Langkow from Phoenix; minor-leaguers Sergei 
Vshedkevich from New Jersey and Dean Sylvester from Buffalo; 
Calgary's Andreas Karlsson, who played in his native Sweden last 
season; and entry picks in the fourth and ninth rounds from 
Vancouver.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Personality a `Requirement' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rising importance of personality in TV-age  
politics was the heart of Al Gore's honors thesis at Harvard in 
1969. Today, personality is the very trait some people think is 
missing in Gore's bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what word best describes Gore, two-thirds of Americans  
polled this spring said: ``Boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore jokes about his reserved demeanor, but 30 years ago he  
speculated in his thesis that television had made a personality 
that would play to the cameras a requisite for future presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as TV cameras began panning the political landscape, as  
soon as TV lights spotlighted presidential news conferences, as 
soon as presidents could bypass reporters and talk directly to 
millions of American TV viewers, personality became more than just 
a plus for prospective presidential candidates, Gore wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``A key factor in this trend is the increasing importance of the  
president's personality,'' Gore surmised in his 1969 paper, ``The 
Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency 1947-1969.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of this, it is possible to speculate that a `role  
requirement' of the president in the future might become `visual 
communication.' Just as an effective speechmaking technique has 
been a role requirement in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore presented his 103-page thesis, which traces the history of  
presidents on TV, to earn a bachelor's degree in government with 
honors at Harvard. Back in 1969, Gore's father, Al Gore Sr., the 
late senator from Tennessee, gave the paper to Herbert Klein, 
President Nixon's communications director. Klein filed it, and it 
ended up in President Nixon's papers stored at the National 
Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, personality is an issue for Gore's campaign for president --  
one he can only overcome with fresh ideas, said Erwin Hargrove, a 
political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote a 
book on presidential leadership, style and personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove was in Carthage, Tenn., this month when Gore launched  
his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was his sober self,'' Hargrove said. ``Then he started  
shouting. I guess he was trying to show he has some blood in his 
veins. It doesn't work. I think Albert has enough force of 
personality. He needs a message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Gore's bland public image, Marla Romash, deputy  
chairman of the Gore campaign, sighed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president has answered this,'' she said. ``He's said,  
`I am who I am.' Anybody who knows Al Gore knows he's a funny, 
engaging, warm guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore even pokes fun at himself, telling the joke about how he's  
so dull that the Secret Service code name for him is ``Al Gore,'' 
or standing motionless at a podium to imitate himself under a 
fast-blinking strobe light. 
</P>
<P>
	For Gore to be a contender for 2000, Aubrey Immelman, an  
associate professor of psychology at Saint John's University in 
Minnesota, said, he needs to drop the self-effacing jokes 
altogether and send the message that his stiffness reflects 
integrity; his woodenness portends what would be a focused approach 
to the business of leading the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore's personality is here to stay. Instead of treating his  
wooden stiffness as a disability or explaining it away, the Gore 
campaign should boldly proclaim it as his badge of honor,'' said 
Immelman, who presented a study on Gore's political personality 
last year to the International Society of Political Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	In case Gore doesn't take this advice, Marc Perkel, a computer  
programmer in Springfield, Mo., is soliciting new jokes Gore can 
use in his campaign. Perkel, an early Gore supporter, ran a 
lighthearted campaign for Congress last year when no Democrat filed 
in his heavily Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore gets into this Mister Rogers mode when he talks to the  
public,'' Perkel said. ``He's a real sharp guy and so sometimes he 
talks slow and simple so as to be understood by larger numbers of 
people. He needs to lose the Mister Rogers thing and be a little 
more relaxed.''

<HEADLINE> Vogue Editor To Run Harper's Bazaar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vogue fashion news editor Katherine Betts has  
been named editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, replacing the late 
Liz Tilberis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Betts, 35, is known for her strong writing style and fashion  
knowledge with an eye toward new trends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kate is a very contemporary woman and can relate to women  
between the ages of 30 and 45 and how they are thinking about their 
lives,'' Hearst Magazines President Cathleen P. Black said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Betts' departure from the Conde Nast-owned Vogue, where she  
has worked for the last eight years, is seen by some in the gossipy 
magazine industry as a major defection. She was considered by many 
to be the heir apparent to current editor in chief Anna Wintour. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Betts, who is nine-months' pregnant, resigned from Vogue  
Thursday and will take two months off before starting her new job 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Though most of her writing has been geared toward fashion, Ms.  
Betts said the magazine under her helm will include many feature 
and lifestyle articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``American women are definitely interested in fashion. But  
fashion is happening in places not necessarily on the runway. I 
hope to bring that mix of fashion and features to Bazaar, exploring 
the life style connection to fashion and the Hollywood connection, 
which is where a lot of exciting things are happening,'' Ms. Betts 
told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogue currently leads the four top fashion magazines, with an  
average circulation of 1.2 million. Harper's Bazaar is third with a 
circulation of 732,572.

<HEADLINE> Gunman's Parents Want Autopsy Sealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The parents of one of the Columbine High  
School gunmen are fighting a judge's order to release their son's 
autopsy report. 
</P>
<P>
	``To release the autopsy report of our son, Dylan Klebold, would  
additionally inflame the passions and the emotions of the public by 
unnecessarily opening a Pandora's box,'' said Susan and Thomas 
Klebold in a sworn affidavit filed Thursday in Jefferson County 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Henry Nieto last month sealed the autopsy reports  
for Klebold, gunman Eric Harris, the 12 students and teacher who 
died in the April 20 rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	He said releasing the reports would do substantial harm to the  
public's interest by prolonging grief for families in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post then sued to  
have the gunmen's reports released. Nieto ordered both reports 
unsealed, but agreed Thursday to withhold the Klebold report for 10 
days to give the family time to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Their attorney, Gary Lozow, was not available for comment  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harris autopsy was released Thursday. The coroner found  
Harris, 18, died of massive head injuries consistent with a 
self-inflicted wound from a shotgun to the roof of the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The autopsy reports for the victims remain sealed.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the parents of Isaiah Shoels, 18, who died in the  
second-floor library, released a copy of the autopsy report on 
their son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the world should see the ugliness of what's going on  
in our schools,'' said Michael Shoels, Isaiah's father. ``I think 
everybody should release them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The autopsy determined Isaiah died of a single gunshot wound to  
the chest. Previously, it had been reported that Shoels was shot in 
the head.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Contradict Cisneros' Ex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attacking the credibility of the chief witness  
against former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, defense lawyers 
summoned a trio of Texas attorneys Friday to contradict her 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fifth day of a hearing for Cisneros' September trial on  
conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges, the Texans directly 
disputed this week's testimony by Linda Jones, who had a highly 
publicized extramarital affair with Cisneros while he was mayor of 
San Antonio in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' legal team has methodically tried to destroy Ms.  
Jones' credibility, eliciting dozens of admissions from her that 
she lied to federal agents investigating Cisneros as well as in 
court proceedings in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones is tied to tape recordings that the government's  
special prosecutors want to use at trial to bolster their 
contention that Cisneros conspired with Ms. Jones and two aides to 
conceal from the FBI the scope of his payments to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who headed the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development from 1993 through 1996, acknowledged during his Cabinet 
background check that he had provided financial support. But 
prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI that he never paid Ms. 
Jones more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges that he paid  
her more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993, which he illegally 
tried to cover up. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones testified she began recording her phone conversations  
with Cisneros as their relationship deteriorated and she began to 
scramble for proof of his earlier verbal commitment that he would 
support her financially. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' attorneys contend the 88 tapes -- all copies of  
since-destroyed originals -- are inadmissible because they 
constitute ``tampered'' evidence. The government contends they are 
legitimate and that only five of the 34 tapes they are seeking to 
play at trial were altered by Ms. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	By eroding her credibility, the defense apparently plans as the  
hearing continues next week to challenge Ms. Jones' recollection of 
how many tapes she altered. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence after pleading  
guilty last years to charges of fraud, money laundering and 
obstructing justice, in part because she misrepresented the taps as 
unaltered originals. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified this week that two Lubbock lawyers, Floyd Holder  
and Bruce Magness, recommended she erase passages where she 
threatened Cisneros or those that would prove embarrassing to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder, who with Magness represented Ms. Jones in a 1994  
breach-of-contract suit against Cisneros, denied he suggested she 
doctor the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged telling her she could find herself in  
``prison garb'' or have ``about zero chance'' of prevailing in her 
lawsuit against Cisneros if she had made any threats, blackmail or 
extortion attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by prosecutor Mark Jackowski whether it was reasonable to  
believe that such statements could have suggested to Ms. Jones that 
she alter the tapes, Holder replied: ``I don't know whether I can 
comment whether it's reasonable behavior or unreasonable 
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Lubbock lawyer, Michael Carper, was summoned to reveal  
another contradiction in Ms. Jones' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	She claimed no recollection of talking to Carper about the  
existence of tape recordings. Carper testified she called him, 
unsolicited, in 1990 to explore legal options against Cisneros and 
mentioned tapes that could prove ``very embarrassing'' to Cisneros 
if disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Friday, the Bureau of Prisons said it will  
investigate whether records of Ms. Jones' counseling sessions with 
a prison psychiatrist at Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Fort 
Worth, Texas, were improperly provided to Cisneros' defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	The files, subpoenaed by Cisneros' lawyers, were released  
without court order. Prisons bureau spokesman Scott Wolfson said 
release of such information typically requires a court order, 
waiver by the inmate, or a subpoena providing that both the 
government and defense agree in writing to the release. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors told the judge they did not agree to the files'  
release.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Drug Benefit Support Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is testing  
political support for a new Medicare drug benefit that would pay 
roughly half the cost of prescriptions -- up to perhaps $3,000 to 
$5,000 a year -- in return for higher premiums from beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should offer a drug benefit but we should do it in a way  
that it's quite clear that it won't break the bank,'' President 
Clinton said at a news conference Friday, announcing that next week 
he will unveil his long-anticipated plan to offer retirees 
government assistance paying for prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most significant health care need that senior  
citizens have today,'' Clinton said. In addition to helping 
retirees, he said, a new Medicare drug benefit ``will, in the 
long-term, save medical costs because it will help keep people out 
of the hospitals and out of the nursing homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug proposal still is being written, White House press  
secretary Joe Lockhart said, and final details will not be 
disclosed until Clinton presents it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have said the drug benefit would be  
made available as an option for all 39 million elderly and disabled 
Medicare beneficiaries, offering less expensive coverage than many 
seniors currently have access to in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it is unclear how Clinton plans to answer politically  
sensitive questions such as how much the new benefit would cost 
taxpayers -- sure to be many billions of dollars -- or how it would 
be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials have been bouncing ideas off wary  
congressional Democrats this week. Among the proposals to find 
money in the already cash-strapped program: Tying Medicare premiums 
to retirees' incomes so that wealthier retirees pay more for 
coverage of doctors' office visits and other outpatient medical 
care. Currently, those premiums -- $45.50 a month in 1999 -- are the 
same for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	At one meeting, Clinton's Chief of Staff John Podesta heard  
complaints about that proposal from House Democrats who are worried 
about proposing any sort of premium hikes as they head into the 
2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they  
believe the White House would drop the idea altogether or make it 
apply only to beneficiaries with very high incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly, people are just real nervous about it. It causes  
more political and administrative problems than it's worth,'' said 
Patricia Smith, a senior health lobbyist for the AARP, the nation's 
largest organization of older adults. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the influential AARP supports the concept of adding  
prescription benefits to Medicare -- which currently pays only for a 
few drugs administered in hospitals -- and the idea also has proved 
exceedingly popular in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing that strong popular sentiment, Republicans are  
approaching the issue cautiously, preparing alternatives in 
addition to lining up an attack on Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, issued a statement Friday saying his panel will design 
it's own prescription drug benefit for consideration in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have praised one plan proposed in March by an  
advisory commission. It would provide government-subsidized drug 
benefits only for those living near the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., an author of the commission  
proposal, wrote to Republican colleagues on Thursday pointing out 
that about two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries already have some 
type of drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes retirement benefits from former employers,  
supplemental insurance policies retirees buy on their own, 
government poverty programs and extra benefits offered by managed 
care health plans that participate in Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Among questions Thomas said Republicans should raise about  
Clinton's plan: ``Would the benefit be available to retired 
millionaires who do not need assistance from another government 
entitlement?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One White House proposal floated on Capitol Hill this week would  
have the government pay half of prescription costs for Medicare 
beneficiaries up to an annual limit of several thousand dollars, 
roughly between $3,000 and $5,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	To obtain that benefit, recipients would have to pay an  
additional monthly premium. It would be higher than $20 a month but 
less than the average $90 charged for drug coverage under a Medigap 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Medigap policies cap drug benefits at $3,000 a year and also  
require senior citizens to pay a $250 deductible before drug 
coverage kicks in.

<HEADLINE> Seagram Sells Two Champagne Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In its latest move to sell assets and pay down  
debt, Canadian beverage and media firm Seagram Co. is selling two 
prestigious champagne makers to the Texas investment firm Hicks, 
Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst for $310 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram will continue to distribute the two French brands, Mumm  
and Perrier-Jouet, throughout the world. Seagram will also hold on 
to its California sparkling wine operations in California, Mumm 
Cuvee Napa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram plans to use the proceeds from the deal announced Friday  
to reduce its debt of $8.5 billion. Seagram has seen its credit 
rating slip following a massive buildup of debt last year connected 
with its purchase of the PolyGram music company for more than $10 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Seagram sold of nearly all of its film  
library in two separate deals to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. movie 
studio and Carlton Communications of Britain for a total of about 
$400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Seagram sold the Tropicana juice business to  
PepsiCo for $3.3 billion to help pay for the PolyGram acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's purchase of PolyGram last year made its Universal  
Music Group the world's largest music company. It also owns the 
Universal Pictures movie studio, which has been struggling due to a 
series of box office flops in recent months.

<HEADLINE> New Civil War Tombstones Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- A 21-shot tribute was fired and soil from  
Ireland was sprinkled Friday at an unveiling ceremony of new 
tombstones for three Union soldiers identified nearly 135 years 
after their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three restless souls can be at peace now,'' said David Evans,  
a writer who followed a trail of military documents over two 
decades to discover the identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``These three men who were so hopelessly lost for so long, now  
have been found,'' Evans said. ``I think maybe this is God's gentle 
reminder that no matter how hopeless things may seem, there's 
always hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans did his sleuthing while researching his 1996 book,  
``Sherman's Horsemen,'' recounting Union cavalry raids around 
Atlanta in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of Pvts. James Harris, 24, of Missouri, William  
Britt, 38, of Tennessee, and David Sage, 20, of Nebraska were found 
at the Marietta National Cemetery in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The three members of the 5th Iowa Cavalry were shot in a battle  
July 18, 1864, with young Confederate conscripts and University of 
Alabama cadets at Beasley's Tank, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	They were behind enemy lines to tear up railroad tracks and were  
among thousands of soldiers exhumed after the war from their 
shallow graves and moved to Marietta, where they were buried under 
numbered, six-inch-high marble ``unknown'' markers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Col. Robert King of the Iowa Army National Guard  
performed the service for Harris and Sage, both Protestants, while 
the Rev. Stephen Lyness, an Irish Catholic priest, sprinkled holy 
water over the grave of Britt, an Irish immigrant. Evans added soil 
flown here from Britt's family grave site in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite modern research techniques and increased interest in  
genealogy, such new identifications remain rare because many 
soldiers were hastily buried where they fell, with little time for 
markers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing; very gratifying,'' said Floyd Findlay,  
great-grandson of Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Findlay and his wife came from Poplar Bluff, Mo., for the  
ceremony, which was included in weekend events commemorating the 
1864 battle at nearby Kennesaw Mountain in which Confederate troops 
blocked Union Gen. William T. Sherman's forces in their effort to 
break through to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	While researching his book, Evans found battlefield reports,  
army documents and cemetery register notes that enabled him to make 
the case for the unknown soldiers' identity. Only two Union 
soldiers had died at the Beasley's Tank battle, records showed, and 
only one died in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Because both Sage and Harris died the same day and at the same  
place, cemetery officials aren't sure which is which. So their 
three-foot-high marble tombstones identify them not by name, but as 
members of the 5th Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Britt was wounded and later died in a Confederate hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Evans located Harris' great-grandson through the Internet.  
Findlay's wife, an avid genealogist, had put together the story of 
Harris' service and death years earlier, and they had even made a 
trip in 1989 to Alabama to search for his grave there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that was a lost cause,'' said Findlay.  
</P>
<P>
	Evans said he was unable to locate any descendants of Sage.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is like coming to the end of a long, hard road,'' he  
said. ``These fellows have been such a part of my life. They're 
like my family.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Swiss Ignore IOC Tax Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The Swiss government turned a blind  
eye to International Olympic Committee tax fraud in an effort to 
sway the 2006 Winter Games selection, a magazine reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC took astonishing liberties with several federal laws.  
A year later -- thanks to someone -- these accusations disappeared,'' 
the weekly L'Hebdo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine printed what it said was a secret internal  
memorandum, in which a Swiss government official described how the 
IOC was involved in tax fraud, falsifying documents and bending the 
law on foreign workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees, backed by false documents from the IOC, declared  
70-85 percent of their salaries, and illegal work permits were 
obtained for workers at the Olympic Museum, according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from the IOC. Phone messages left  
for Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the committee's spokesman, were not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 dossier advised it would be imprudent for the country  
to grant the IOC an exemption from Value Added Tax, which the 
sports organization had requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss government had turned down the request in 1995. Two  
months later the Swiss city of Sion lost its bid to host the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC renewed its request for the tax exemption, and Sion  
embarked on a bid for the 2006 games. In 1998, a year after the 
memorandum was sent, the Swiss Federal Council approved the 
exemption, which needed only the parliament's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Switzerland did everything it could to obtain the Olympic  
Games -- even the worst,'' said L'Hebdo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only after the Salt Lake City bribery scandal that Swiss  
politicians began questioning the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	In February this year, its image tarnished, the IOC withdrew its  
request. IOC director general Francois Carrard said the decision 
was ``above all, a sign of the IOC's respect for Switzerland,'' and 
was taken out of ``a concern to end all misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is now required to make back payments of all VAT owed  
since its introduction in 1995, though it still receives the income 
tax exemption was granted in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Sion lost its bid for the 2006 Games, sparking a  
series of anti-IOC protests in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backer Guilty of Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- One host of Friday night's presidential  
fund-raiser for Texas Gov. George W. Bush is a businesswoman who 
pleaded guilty this week in a tax evasion case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he didn't know the woman, Remedios Diaz Oliver, who  
was among 37 people who raised at least $25,000 each for the Miami 
reception and were listed as members of its host committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a Bush spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said Ms. Diaz Oliver  
was a volunteer and that some 2,500 people have been similarly 
listed on invitations for events nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate. We were not aware'' of her legal problems,  
Hughes said. ``We are in the midst of a very large series of 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also denied any knowledge  
of Ms. Diaz Oliver's legal case. ``She is a friend of mine. I don't 
know anything about her involvement,'' Jeb Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Diaz Oliver pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors in a deal  
with federal prosecutors, who dropped an 18-count felony indictment 
against her. She and two other defendants -- her husband Fausto Diaz 
Oliver and business associate Lilliam Martinez -- also must pay 
$347,314 to the U.S. Customs Service and the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors charged the couple and some business  
associates with evading $500,000 in taxes by filing with Customs 
false invoices for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Diaz Oliver had maintained her innocence but changed course  
when prosecutors offered the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In good conscience, I couldn't tell them to turn that down,''  
said her lawyer, Howard Srebnick. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the couple as ``very strong Bush supporters.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Diaz Oliver could not immediately be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The reception at the Miami Airport Hilton listed Bush's brother,  
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, as a special guest. The host committee was 
studded with veterans of Jeb Bush's successful gubernatorial 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida finance chairman for George W. Bush's presidential  
campaign, businessman Al Hoffman Jr., was finance chairman for Jeb 
Bush's gubernatorial campaign and chaired his inaugural committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Diaz Oliver has not been a major giver to political  
campaigns, according to federal and state records. But her company, 
All American Containers, played host in 1996 to Republican 
presidential nominee Bob Dole, who spoke to female business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush brothers put on a four-city southern Florida swing  
Friday in the Texan's first outing in the state since launching his 
campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. In all, Bush expected 
to raise over $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in my life, I'm going to do what he tells  
me to do when I come to this state,'' the candidate said of his 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeb Bush said it's the right time for his older brother to be  
president. ``Our country needs his kind of leadership, his big 
heart,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Transplant Policy Favors Sickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People across the country whose livers  
suddenly fail and are given less than a week to live will have a 
much better shot at getting a liver transplant under a new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy, which should take effect within months, brings the  
United Network for Organ Sharing closer to the position of the 
Clinton administration, which has been pressing the network to send 
scarce organs to the sickest patients first, rather than favoring 
patients in the area where the organs were donated. 
</P>
<P>
	But network officials emphasized that they would have made the  
change even without the pressure. Their insistence offers fresh 
evidence that the dispute between the network and the Department of 
Health and Human Services is about who makes the decisions as much 
as what those decisions are. 
</P>
<P>
	``This change has been coming along for a long time,'' said Dr.  
William Payne, a surgeon at the University of Minnesota, who is the 
network's new president. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's board, meeting in Atlanta, also agreed today to  
back off its long-standing refusal to release information about 
individual transplant centers and their performance. In the past, 
it has been unwilling to release transplant waiting times at each 
center and has only released outdated data on patient survival 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in liver policy will direct more livers to the  
sickest patients who are considered the most medically urgent, or 
``status 1,'' and are given a week or less to live. That includes 
people whose livers suddenly fail, for instance, due to an 
infection, drug reaction or rejection of a previous transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	But patients classified as ``status 2a,'' who are also expected  
to die within a week, are not affected by the change. These 
patients are sick from chronic, rather than acute, liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the community needs to go a little further,'' said  
Dr. Claude Earl Fox, who directs the HHS agency in charge of 
transplant policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the problem is supply and demand: The waiting list  
for organs has grown much faster than the number of donations, and 
more than 4,000 people die each year waiting. That has created 
intense competition for the organs that are available. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past year and a half HHS and the network have been  
fighting over who should direct transplant policy. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS issued rules ordering that more data be released and  
directing the network to create a new allocation system that would 
get organs more often to the sickest patients. The network 
responded with an intense lobbying effort and persuaded Congress to 
delay the regulations until this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday the network moved closer to what HHS wants on  
liver transplants, which have engendered the most debate. The 
change will take effect as soon as it can be implemented, network 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has opposed giving organs more often to the sickest  
people, arguing they are less likely to survive a transplant. But 
officials calculated that the effect of this policy change will be 
minimal: 78 percent of patients would survive one year, down from 
79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The current system offers livers first to status 1 patients in  
the designated local area, which can vary from part of a city to 
several states. If there are no medical matches, the livers are 
offered to other local patients, in order of medical urgency. If 
there are still no local matches, livers are offered to patients in 
the surrounding region, sickest first. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy, approved on a 30-3 vote, would kick in if no  
local patients are in the greatest medical need. In this case, 
livers would be offered to status 1 patients throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the nation's 11 regions have already adopted similar  
agreements on their own.

	As it stands, 14.5 percent of donated livers go to status 1  
patients. The network expects that to rise to 22.3 percent under 
the new policy and the percentages going to less urgent patients to 
drop slightly.	   Livers are the most controversial organ because they can survive 
outside the body for 24 hours, making it possible to transport them 
anywhere in the nation. Also, medically, there is no way to keep 
someone in liver failure alive while awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The network board also adopted a new policy Thursday on  
allocating livers that have been divided, with part to go to an 
adult and part to a child. Hospitals that agree to split all 
medically suitable livers will be part of the group that gets the 
first chance at other donated split livers.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 42.75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as a report on  
the U.S. economy lifted investor optimism about second-quarter 
earnings. But concerns about higher interest rates kept major 
market indexes from taking flight. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 42.75 at 10,577.58. The Dow was more than 100 points higher 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index  
was down 5.01 at 2,548.98 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was 
up 2.02 at 1,317.80. 
</P>
<P>
	With investors nervous about interest rates and corporate  
profits, the Dow fell 132.03 on Thursday, and had lost 320 points 
for the week going into today's session. The Federal Reserve is 
expected to raise rates next week in an effort to slow the economy 
and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices moved higher today after a Commerce Department report  
that the U.S. economy grew at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter, slightly better than the 4.1 percent estimated in 
May. The brisker than expected economy could stir inflation fears, 
but investors initially seemed to interpret the report as a boon 
for second-quarter corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started out well based on the economic news, but there was  
simply no strong follow-through,'' said Tony Cecin, director of 
institutional trading at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest improvement in the bond market also lifted stocks  
today. The Treasury's 30-year bond carried a yield of 6.15 percent, 
down from late Thursday's 6.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech and drug stocks that had been depressed by the recent  
selloff were among the big gainers. IBM rose 1 1/16 to 123 5/8, and 
Merck picked up 9/16, rising to 69 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin, which announced plans to sell $1 billion in  
assets, rose 1 to 36 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to an extremely 
light 482.74 million shares, down from Thursday's pace. Many 
traders have refrained all week from making big commitments one way 
or another before the Fed's Open Market Committee meets next 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.14 at 624.11, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.08 at 770.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 0.34 at  
442.82.

<HEADLINE> Congress Puts Off Y2K Bill Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting aside veto threats and confrontation  
politics for the moment, Congress and the White House are making a 
last-ditch effort to save legislation that would reduce the number 
of lawsuits resulting from Y2K computer breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate lawmakers Thursday decided to wait until  
Tuesday before formally approving the final version of legislation 
that the White House has promised to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right before the meltdown, both sides pulled back,'' said Sen.  
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., of the decision to give the White House and 
Congress a chance to discuss changes that might result in the 
president's signing the bill. Staff from the two sides are to begin 
talks today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican supporters of the House and Senate Y2K bills, angered  
by what they said was the failure of the White House to present 
details on how to save the bill, had planned to send the more 
moderate Senate bill to President Clinton for his veto. 
</P>
<P>
	That veto would have certain political repercussions for Clinton  
and Vice President Al Gore among their longtime allies in the 
high-tech industry, which has keenly sought the legal protections 
offered by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 Coalition, a group of major business and high-tech  
groups supporting the bill, wrote House Republican leaders Thursday 
thanking them for not closing off negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truly you have bent over backwards to accommodate the White  
House, despite a rather unhelpful string of veto threats,'' wrote 
the coalition, which earlier in the week wrote GOP leaders urging 
both Congress and the White House to put politics aside and 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has issued several position papers explaining  
its problems with the House and Senate bills, mostly with 
provisions it says give too much protection to defendants at the 
expense of people with legitimate grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	But both Republicans, led by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the  
chief Republican sponsor of the Senate bill, and Democrats 
complained that the White House had failed to offer to sit down 
with them to work out differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen such obdurate and noncommunicative behavior,''  
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has been waltzing around when they could have  
been working with us productively,'' said Wyden, with Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the chief Democratic sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chief of staff John Podesta wrote to House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Thursday to say the administration wants to 
stop frivolous lawsuits and to urge efforts to prevent the veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than going down this destructive path, we should work  
together to find a bipartisan solution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, which would require House and Senate votes  
before going to the president, seeks to avoid a flood of 
economy-crippling lawsuits related to disruptions caused by the 
year 2000 computer bug by giving companies 90 days to fix computers 
before lawsuits can be filed and encouraging mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would cap punitive damages for small businesses and try  
to protect companies from predatory lawsuits by stating that in 
most cases a defendant would be held liable only for the share of 
damages it caused. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech community fears it could be hit with billions of  
dollars in lawsuits from problems arising from computers that 
mistake the year 2000 for 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the Senate bill was already a ``tremendous retreat''  
from the stronger House-passed measure and there was little 
negotiating room. ``I do not think we should further emasculate 
this legislation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House sponsors also said they had given up a lot in agreeing to  
the Senate's version. ``It seems to me that if the people's House 
can move to the Senate the White House can do the same thing,'' 
said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

<HEADLINE> Jury Convicts 'Sleepwalking' Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A man who claimed he was sleepwalking when he  
stabbed his wife 44 times and held her head under water in their 
swimming pool was convicted Friday of murder and could get the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors who convicted Scott Falater, 43, said they could not  
believe he could kill his wife, hide evidence and even bandage a 
cut finger without waking up. They said Falater's actions 
outweighed testimony from defense experts who said Falater probably 
killed in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had such a short amount of time to do too much, and it just  
wasn't believable that he could have been sleepwalking,'' said 
juror John Merrill of Mesa, a worker at a tribal casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty. The judge  
will determine the punishment after a series of hearings later this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over yet,'' Falater said as he left court. He showed  
no emotion as the verdict was read and did not look at the 
solemn-faced jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of Falater's wife, Yarmila, did not attend the trial.  
Her mother said before the trial she did not want to be a part of 
the proceeding, prosecutor Juan Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Yarmila's soul is a bit more relieved today,'' Martinez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	What Falater did on the night of Jan. 16, 1997, was never in  
question. He admitted stabbing his wife, Yarmila, dragging her to 
their backyard pool and holding her under. He did not dispute 
removing his bloodstained clothes and hiding them and the knife in 
his Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater testified he has no memory of any of it, but jurors said  
his testimony seemed too rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was asked about remorse, he would drop his head and  
prepare to be remorseful,'' said juror Theresa Beaubien, a suburban 
housewife. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sleep experts cited Falater's family history of  
sleepwalking, job stress and lack of sleep as reasons for his 
violent sleepwalking episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had an expert witness testify that Falater's actions  
were too deliberate for him to have been sleepwalking. They based 
that view in part on testimony from neighbor Greg Koons, who 
watched over a wall as Falater pulled on gloves, motioned to his 
dog to lie down, then dragged his wife's body to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors agreed that Koons' testimony was key.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there had been no eyewitnesses, he would have gotten away  
with it,'' said juror Laurie Kisling of Phoenix, a dispatcher for a 
supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense painted the former Motorola engineer and his wife of  
20 years as a happily married, religious couple. Defense attorney 
Mike Kimerer said Falater had no reason to kill his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martinez noted that the couple had disputes over Falater's  
desire for more children and his wife's waning dedication to the 
Mormon faith. She was not wearing her wedding ring when her body 
was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors said they also struggled with the question of why he  
would kill his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came off as an honest, law-abiding citizen, but I think  
we're all capable of doing things,'' said juror Denise Aguirre of 
Phoenix, a driver for United Parcel Service.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Urges Europe To Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- To counter the economic and political  
clout of the United States, Brazil's top businessmen are urging 
Europe to open its market to South American goods in a 
transatlantic free trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of such a zone between the European Union and  
Mercosur -- with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay as full 
members and Bolivia and Chile as associates -- will be the most 
important issue of Rio de Janeiro's June 28-29 summit of EU leaders 
and their Latin American and Caribbean counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stronger (trade) ties with the European Union will open a huge  
market for us and reduce the economic and political weight of the 
United States in Latin America,'' said Luiz Fernando Furlan, an 
official with the Federation of Industries of the State of Sao 
Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercosur hopes to benefit by playing Europe off the United  
States, which has its own proposal for a Free Trade Area of the 
Americas to start up by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``An EU-Mercosur free trade agreement will counter'' the  
expected influx to South America of U.S. goods that the FTAA 
envisions, Furlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, EU leaders gave their authorization for talks to  
begin immediately on nontariff barriers like as food safety and 
hygiene regulations, while the more contentious tariff-reduction 
negotiations will start in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the mandate, the summit would have ``amounted to little  
more than a photo opportunity,'' said Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Luiz Felipe Lampreia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that an EU-Mercosur trade agreement would help prevent  
the FTAA from becoming the only trade alternative for South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot go down just one path, or put all our eggs in one  
basket. We want (trade) equilibrium with the EU and the FTAA,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruy Martins Altenfender Silva, one of the directors of the  
Federation of Industries, said businesses do not expect the summit 
to result in any immediate reduction of trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will only begin happening after the Millennium Round,''  
Silva said, referring to the World Trade Organization talks, which 
start in November in Seattle. ``The most we can expect from the 
summit is a clear and concise agenda of issues to be negotiated.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Continue Down; Corn Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Futures prices for soybeans fell Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, continuing a decline from the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean prices moved higher in the morning trading but  
soybeans turned lower and corn mixed as the day wore on. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the weekend approaching, traders were apparently feeling  
comfortable with the prices where they were, and there was some 
selling'' said Chicago-based analyst George Renkert of the Price 
Futures Group. 
</P>
<P>
	A forecast of much-needed rain in U.S. Midwest growing areas  
also led to the decline in corn and soybean prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for delivery in August posted a new contract low of  
$4.50 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, July soybeans had plummeted 13 cents a bushel. They  
fell another 2 1/4 cents on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvest delays buoyed wheat prices, which also were supported by  
reports the current crop may contain less milling quality than 
originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat was $2.51 1/4 a bushel, up 1 1/4 cents; July corn was down  
1/4 cent to $2.14 a bushel; oats rose 1 cent to $1.13 1/2 a bushel; and 
July soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents to $4.50 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, cattle prices were higher and the pork complex  
futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle were up .15 cent to 64.75 cents a pound;  
August feeder cattle were 77.42 cents a pound, up .30 cent; July 
lean hogs were up .20 cent to 50.87 cents a pound; and July pork 
bellies were up .40 cent to 44.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Does Community Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Hunkered over a pool table and  
surrounded by children, Darryl Strawberry is mixing games with an 
anti-drug message as part of his court-ordered community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder played pool, football and  
basketball with children at the St. Petersburg Boys &AMP; Girls Club, 
and tried to communicate the lessons he's learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm teaching them about being friends and not having bad  
attitudes, staying away from drugs and staying away from wrong 
situations,'' said Strawberry, dressed in a red T-shirt, Bermuda 
shorts and a blue cap. ``If I can inspire them to do that, that 
would be a gift to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's appearance was part of his 100 hours of community  
service he must serve after pleading no contest to drug possession 
and solicitation charges last month. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one youth was impressed with Strawberry's appearance.  
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel good that he's here. That he plays sports  
with us, hangs around with us and stuff,'' Brandon Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who has a home in Tampa, was arrested April 14 a few  
miles from the Yankees' minor league complex. He allegedly offered 
an undercover female officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also said Strawberry had 0.3 grams of cocaine wrapped in  
a $20 bill in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the cocaine did not belong to him. And though he  
acknowledged discussing sex with the undercover officer, he 
insisted he was joking and did not intend to meet her at a motel. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest to the charges May 26, and was sentenced  
to 18 months of probation. He also was ordered to undergo testing 
for drugs twice a week and is prohibited from going within 100 feet 
of bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel in my heart that I'm a very good person and I've made  
some wrong mistakes in my life,'' Strawberry said. ``I just want to 
inspire kids so that they don't have to make the same mistakes that 
I made.''

<HEADLINE>  Indian Army Pounds Himalayan Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- Indian guns pounded the slopes of a  
strategic Himalayan peak today ``to soften up'' the area for a 
final assault on Islamic militants in the disputed Kashmir region. 
Parachute commandos and infantry closed in to cut off supply lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistani and Indian army shelled each other across the Line  
of Control, the 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between 
the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, meanwhile, repeated demands that Pakistan  
withdraw forces who crossed the cease-fire line and seized 
mountaintop vantage points as snow melted in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	India accuses Pakistan of sending soldiers and Afghan  
mercenaries into Indian territory. Pakistan denies that and says 
the fighters are Muslim rebels demanding independence from Hindu 
majority India. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Anthony Zinni, chief of the U.S. Central Command,  
met today with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to express 
Washington's ``concerns about ending the fighting in the Kargil 
area of Kashmir,'' a U.S. State Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the foreign ministry statement, Sharif sounded a  
warning: ``Find a peaceful solution of the Jammu and Kashmir 
dispute ... in the shortest possible time (or) situations like 
Kargil would continue to erupt, threatening peace and endangering 
the stability of the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No details were revealed of the 45-minute meeting in Islamabad,  
where 2,500 people, chanting anti-India slogans, were stopped by 
police as they marched toward the Indian High Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan, which says its army is engaging only in retaliatory  
shelling, has said the U.S. stand is encouraging India to talk of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said India has no  
intention of crossing the cease-fire line, although the army is 
having problems disrupting the entrenched militants' supply lines 
and assaulting the mountaintop bunkers on rocky barren slopes with 
little cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cabinet ministers have spoken this week about the  
possibility of war. Both armies have reinforced troops at the 
borders and the two navies are on alert in the Arabian Sea. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Indian Army Pounds Himalayan Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- Indian guns pounded the slopes of a  
strategic Himalayan peak today ``to soften up'' the area for a 
final assault on Islamic militants in the disputed Kashmir region. 
Parachute commandos and infantry closed in to cut off supply lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistani and Indian army shelled each other across the Line  
of Control, the 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between 
the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, meanwhile, repeated demands that Pakistan  
withdraw forces who crossed the cease-fire line and seized 
mountaintop vantage points as snow melted in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	India accuses Pakistan of sending soldiers and Afghan  
mercenaries into Indian territory. Pakistan denies that and says 
the fighters are Muslim rebels demanding independence from Hindu 
majority India. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Anthony Zinni, chief of the U.S. Central Command,  
met today with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to express 
Washington's ``concerns about ending the fighting in the Kargil 
area of Kashmir,'' a U.S. State Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the foreign ministry statement, Sharif sounded a  
warning: ``Find a peaceful solution of the Jammu and Kashmir 
dispute ... in the shortest possible time (or) situations like 
Kargil would continue to erupt, threatening peace and endangering 
the stability of the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No details were revealed of the 45-minute meeting in Islamabad,  
where 2,500 people, chanting anti-India slogans, were stopped by 
police as they marched toward the Indian High Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan, which says its army is engaging only in retaliatory  
shelling, has said the U.S. stand is encouraging India to talk of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said India has no  
intention of crossing the cease-fire line, although the army is 
having problems disrupting the entrenched militants' supply lines 
and assaulting the mountaintop bunkers on rocky barren slopes with 
little cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cabinet ministers have spoken this week about the  
possibility of war. Both armies have reinforced troops at the 
borders and the two navies are on alert in the Arabian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian fighter pilots dropped laser-guided bombs on bunkers on  
Tiger Hill, a 15,000 foot peak above the front-line town of Kargil. 
Jets roared across the peaks on reconnaissance runs.

	Panicked Serbs Flee Historic Center  
</P>
<P>
	PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs fled the Kosovo city of Pec in  
panicked, tearful convoys Friday, abandoning the revered cradle of 
their faith, where ethnic Albanians looted and burned their homes. 
Smoke rose across the western city from about 20 burning, abandoned 
homes Friday afternoon. About a score more -- belonging to Serbs and 
Gypsies -- had gone up in flames in the previous 24 hours. The Serb 
exodus came as ethnic Albanian refugees streamed back into the city 
and surrounding villages -- most to find homes burned by Serbs 
during the war, several to discover the burned corpses of family 
members inside those homes.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations today announced plans  
for a conference aimed at resolving problems linked to Kosovo 
pacification. Secretary-General Kofi Annan invited several nations 
to a meeting, including the world's leading industrialized nations 
as well as Russia, China, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands and 
Turkey. The United Nations is in charge of the civilian 
administration of Kosovo while NATO is in charge of ensuring 
security so hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees can 
return to their homes. Some 50,000 peacekeepers are assigned to 
protect them.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush now is leading Vice  
President Al Gore and every other presidential candidate in the 
race to raise money. And Gore's only Democratic opponent, former 
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, is closing in on the vice president. 
Bush expects to report at least $20 million in fund raising on the 
next round of federal campaign finance reports, campaign spokesman 
David Beckwith said. Gore will have raised $15 million to $18 
million by the end of June, a campaign aide said. Bradley is 
expected to have raised more than $10 million, according to a 
source close to the Bradley campaign.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service detained 
Resendez-Ramirez in the El Paso area June 1 for being in this

assisting in an illegal $325,000 contribution to the Democratic 
Party using funds from a foreign national. The Justice Department 
said in a statement that the money for the contribution was wired

force in the probe of fund raising in the 1996 elections.

<HEADLINE> Utah Liquor Laws Part of Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Finding a drink in Utah can be an Olympic  
event -- and after all the running around involved, you might need 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictive alcohol regulations in this Mormon-dominated  
state are in the news lately because the 2002 Winter Olympics are 
drawing near. 
</P>
<P>
	At the most, light beer will be offered to Olympic spectators at  
only two already-licensed venues, during figure skating and hockey. 
Utah won't have any of the outdoor ``beer tents'' provided by other 
Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's media and some Olympic officials have requested bar  
service at the normally dry Salt Palace convention center, but that 
has brought an indignant response from Utah legislative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's myriad regulations governing liquor can be confusing,  
irritating and -- particularly after a couple of stiff belts -- even 
humorous. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has no open-door saloons. Full liquor service is  
available only to dues-paying members of ``private'' social clubs 
or at the 470 restaurants with liquor stocks they cannot advertise, 
display or even mention unless a customer asks first. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 121 taverns can pour only ``light'' beer, or 3.2  
percent alcohol, and no other alcoholic drinks. No membership is 
required at taverns. Grocery stores can sell only light beer, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine, hard liquor and heavy beer can be purchased at 36  
state-run liquor stores -- if you can find them. Typically they are 
tucked away in warehouse districts and off major thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
	A quota limits the number of private clubs to one per 7,000 Utah  
residents, or 295 clubs concentrated primarily in Salt Lake County 
and Park City. Minimum club dues by law are $12 a year, though 
visitors can buy a two-week membership for $5. Or visitors can ask 
the guy on the next barstool to sponsor them as guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to apologize for with our liquor laws,'' said  
Jerry Fenn, a teetotaling Mormon, lobbyist on liquor laws for his 
church, and former chairman of the state Alcohol Beverage Control 
Commission. ``People will be able to get a drink when they come to 
Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fenn's opinion is widely disputed by people who drink.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap over Utah's liquor laws came last month when an  
International Olympic Committee official complained that he and his 
wine could never be parted. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Frenchman, I know that a Frenchman kept from his wine  
might get cranky,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schrieber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Hales, chairman of the liquor commission, has offered a  
solution that exposes the complexity of Utah's system of alcohol 
licenses and permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials and the world's media, Hales said, need only  
find five or six sponsors to patch together a succession of 72-hour 
``single-event'' permits for a month of bar service at the Salt 
Palace during the Olympics. Hales said any established news group 
could qualify as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The media, however, are unlikely to get round-the-clock alcohol  
service, even though reporters will be working at all hours to meet 
deadlines across the world's time zones. Last call in Utah is 1 
a.m. -- no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	And thirsty visitors who think all they have to do is pack their  
suitcase with their beverage of choice should stand warned: It's a 
misdemeanor for anyone other than a licensed dealer to bring booze 
into the state. The penalty is up to six months in jail and a 
$1,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Property Seizures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted to curb the federal  
government's ability to seize private property -- cash, securities, 
cars, boats and real estate -- suspected of being linked to crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many innocent citizens have been deprived of their  
possessions without due process, House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said during debate on the House floor Thursday 
before the measure was approved, 375-48. 
</P>
<P>
	No companion bill has been introduced in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Police have used civil asset forfeiture for such things as  
shutting down drug houses quickly by taking possession of them or 
hitting drug traffickers in the wallet even before charges are 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, both Republicans and Democrats criticized current  
federal law, which lets officers seize property simply because they 
suspect it was involved in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have to convict you. They don't even have to charge  
you with a crime. But they have your property,'' Hyde said. ``This 
is a throwback to the old Soviet Union, where justice is the 
justice of the government and the citizen doesn't have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Democratic Rep. William Delahunt of Massachusetts: ``Think  
about that: Eighty percent of those whose property are seized are 
never even charged with a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asset forfeiture is a powerful anti-crime tool, but it also can  
be an opportunity for abuse, especially for law enforcement 
agencies hungry for money to supplement tight budgets, said 
supporters of the new limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many jurisdictions, it has become a monetary tail wagging  
the law enforcement dog,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed by the House -- introduced by Hyde and the  
Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of 
Michigan -- would require the federal government to prove with 
``clear and convincing'' evidence the property was eligible for 
forfeiture if an owner files a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require officers to prove criminality, not simply allege it.  
Current law requires property owners to prove they are not 
connected with the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require the government to give owners notice before seizing  
property. Owners would have 30 days -- compared with the current 10 
days -- to challenge a seizure in court. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enable a judge to release property to the owner if continued  
government possession would pose a substantial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow judges to appoint counsel for poor defendants.  
</P>
<P>
	--Let owners sue the government for negligence if their property  
is lost or damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow some owners of seized cash to receive interest if a judge  
orders the money returned. 
</P>
<P>
	--Apply only to civil asset forfeitures, not criminal ones,  
although civil forfeitures often are involved in criminal cases. It 
would not affect state forfeiture laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the federal government seized about $449 million worth  
of property through civil and criminal forfeitures. Some of the 
proceeds were sent to state and local law enforcement agencies that 
helped in investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said the Hyde-Conyers bill ``would  
have a serious negative effect on the federal government's ability 
to combat drug trafficking, alien smuggling, terrorism, consumer 
fraud and many other criminal offenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the House rejected, 268-155, an alternative the  
administration favored. It would have let police seize property 
based on a lower standard of proof -- a ``preponderance'' of the 
evidence rather than ``clear and convincing'' evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said it would have expanded the federal government's  
power to seize property, not curbed it. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Low-Key Approach on Soccer Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Women's World Cup touches all the hot  
buttons that make American marketers salivate. 
</P>
<P>
	The host U.S. team is favored to win. Thirty-two matches are  
being played over three weeks at sites from New England to 
California. Every game is being shown nationally on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening match last Saturday between the United States and  
Denmark just outside New York drew the biggest crowd ever to attend 
a women's-only sporting event -- a Giants Stadium sellout of 78,792 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is expected to attract more than 500,000 fans,  
the most ever for an all-women's team sports event. 
</P>
<P>
	But the buzz the Women's World Cup has generated on Madison  
Avenue seems quieter than the one the men's World Cup created five 
years ago when it was in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider McDonald's, one of 11 official sponsors of the women's  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last two men's World Cups, the fast-food chain put  
the tournament logo on its food sacks and drink containers to 
remind customers of its role as an official sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Not this year. Company spokesman Brad Trask said the chain had a  
long-standing commitment to promote Walt Disney Co.'s animated 
``Tarzan'' movie opening just as the Women's World Cup kicked off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two restaurant-level promotions would have been impossible,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trask said McDonald's is relying mainly on the field-level  
billboards that each official sponsor gets at all the matches to 
promote its involvement. It hasn't bought any commercial time on 
the telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola, another official sponsor, is also relying on the  
exposure from the sideline signs and plans no additional 
advertising on the match telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a change from 1994 when it advertised on the men's World  
Cup telecasts and produced a two-hour special shown on the eve of 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotionally, I want to tell you this is a great opportunity,''  
said Lesa Ukman, editor of the IEG Sponsorship Report, which tracks 
sports sponsorships. ``But the truth is it's soccer. ... You're 
just not going to make a splash here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While soccer is enormously popular among youngsters, it is a  
long way from the mass U.S. appeal enjoyed by football, baseball 
and basketball. And organized women's soccer is not nearly as 
popular worldwide as men's soccer, which has been holding World Cup 
competition for more than 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the third Women's World Cup and we are still  
selling it to sponsors and fans,'' said Marla Messing, president of 
the event's organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	For ticket sales, the organizers initially went after the  
estimated 7.5 million girls who play soccer in the United States 
and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	In courting potential sponsors, Messing emphasized the type of  
people who would probably be watching from the stands or on 
television -- ``suburban families, well-educated and affluent for 
the most part and parents that care a lot about kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 official tournament sponsors paid $1 million to $4  
million for the designation -- a fraction of the $20 million to $40 
million for the men's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcast rights went to three networks owned by the Walt  
Disney Co. ABC carried the opening match last Saturday and will 
broadcast the championship July 10 from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, 
Calif. The other 30 matches are being carried by ESPN and ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	Some advertisers are using soccer themes and active players.  
</P>
<P>
	Gatorade, for example, has an ad showing U.S. team superstar Mia  
Hamm outlasting Michael Jordan in a competition that includes 
fencing, running and martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has also featured Hamm in an ad for a Barbie doll dressed  
in a soccer uniform under license from the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas shows some of the world's top players, like Kristine  
Lilly of the United States and Sun Wen of China, in ads that 
humorously suggest they showed a flair for the sport at a very 
early age. ``There from the start,'' is the theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch has an ad with U.S. player Julie Foudy  
unintentionally kicking a doctor against the wall when he checks 
her leg reflexes. Allstate Insurance has an ad with two teams of 
girls ages 5 to 8 playing soccer. ``Here's to the women who play. 
This generation and the next,'' the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN is trying to drum up interest in its telecasts of the  
tournament with an ad campaign featuring an odd blend of 
celebrities urging President Clinton to attend the final match. The 
luminaries include Olympic gold medal winners Mark Spitz and Tara 
Lipinski, Watergate figure G. Gordon Liddy and Clinton political 
adviser James Carville. 
</P>
<P>
	The matches have not drawn ratings as high as the men's matches  
did in 1994, and ESPN programming executive Steve Risser doesn't 
expect them to be as high as five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are in a growth phase,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and now a sports  
television consultant, said the advertisers may not get big 
audiences for their ads but might get people who will ``probably 
appreciate the sponsors that put on the broadcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's something you rarely get with the more established  
sports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	 *End Adv for June 26-27

<HEADLINE> United Midfielder Fined, Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- D.C. United midfielder Marco Etcheverry was  
fined $2,000 and suspended for three games by Major League Soccer 
on Friday for his behavior following an ejection in a June 16 match 
against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension, however, will have virtually no consequences on  
the team because of Etcheverry's participation in the Copa America. 
</P>
<P>
	Etcheverry was suspended for United's June 19 game against Los  
Angeles (a 2-1 loss), Saturday's game against Kansas City and a 
July 4 match against San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the United States on June 17 to join the Bolivian  
national team for Copa America. The day before he was red-carded 
for a 77th-minute tackle on Dallas' Colombian midfielder Leonel 
Alvarez in a 3-0 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said in a release the suspension was for his  
``unsportsmanlike play and abusive behavior'' after the ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Etcheverry had been scheduled to leave for the Copa America,  
which begins Tuesday in Paraguay, and was not expected to return at 
least until July 3, the day after Bolivia plays its final 
first-round match in the South American championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relevance of whether players are called away for national  
team duty does not affect suspensions,'' MLS spokesman Dan 
Courtemanche said. ``It's something our competition committee will 
review for the future, no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first instance where a player has avoided a  
suspension in the MLS by being called away for national team duty. 
Defender Alexi Lalas, then playing with the New England Revolution, 
served a one-game suspension for accumulated yellow card points in 
1997 while on duty at a World Cup qualifying match with the U.S. 
national team.

<HEADLINE> Campbell Soup Warns on Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Campbell Soup Co. plans to reorganize its  
global businesses and also expects fourth-quarter earnings to fall 
short of analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Friday it will combine its U.S. soup and sauce  
operations with its Canadian business to form the Campbell North 
America Soup and Sauce Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The new division will be headed by F. Martin Thrasher, who  
previously oversaw Campbell's businesses in Canada, the United 
Kingdom, France, Germany and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, Campbell said Mark Leckie, who  
had been president of the U.S. Grocery division resigned. That 
division is now part of the new unit headed by Thrasher. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will take a special after-tax charge of between $35  
million and $45 million in the quarter ending Aug. 1 to pay for the 
restructuring. The company, however, said it will save $18 million 
to $25 million annually by streamlining expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell also warned that fourth-quarter earnings, excluding the  
special charge, are expected to fall about 8 to 10 cents per share 
below expectations, Campbell said. The company blamed inventory 
reductions by retailers for the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. were projecting earnings  
of 38 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said its outlook for fiscal 2000, which begins in  
August, is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell spokesman Jerry Buckley said some jobs may be cut in  
the restructuring announced Friday, but it was unknown how many 
employees could be affected. The new division will have about 8,500 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really about bringing two organizations together,''  
Buckley said. ``We don't expect any major impact on our work 
force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said forming the new division will allow the company to  
focus on growing its core market. Outside the United States, Canada 
is Campbell's largest soup business. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its line of soups, Campbell also sells food under  
the Pepperidge Farm, Godiva, V-8 juices and Pace salsa brands. It 
is the sixth-largest food company in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Campbell closed down 31 1/4 cents to $42.12 1/2 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Lays Out Legislative Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans touted their legislative  
agenda Friday in a rally on the Capitol steps, stressing proposals 
to cut taxes, protect the Social Security surplus, benefit 
education and strengthen the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just time for Washington to stop raiding the Social  
Security Trust Fund to pay for wishful, wasteful Washington 
spending,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said as the GOP sought 
to blunt a daylong public relations effort by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert added, ``We will fight for tax relief for working  
Americans. I ask the president, `Please include tax relief in your 
agenda.' Don't let Washington spend the surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans stood before the Capitol on a day in which Clinton  
delivered an address at Georgetown University on his domestic 
agenda, then fielded questions at a White House news conference 
that ran for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, the GOP is expected to produce legislation next month  
to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, eliminate estate 
taxes, cut the capital gains tax and possibly have more earnings 
taxed at the lowest current level, 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Social Security, Republicans are trying to pass a ``lock  
box'' measure that would assure the surplus generated by payroll 
taxes is preserved until a plan to overhaul the retirement program 
is developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense proposals include work on a missile shield, included in  
a bill Clinton already has signed, as well as more money for pay, 
weapons and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
	On education, Republicans have passed a measure to loosen  
strings on federal aid and expect to push for approval of another 
bill that allows savings to gain tax-free interest if it is used 
for education accounts.

<HEADLINE> Airline Union Complains About Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Airlines pilots union wants  
better enforcement of crew rest rules following a report that on 
one of the carrier's flights, both pilots fell asleep for a 
half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I woke up, I looked over at the captain. He was sound  
asleep,'' a pilot wrote anonymously in a report attached to a 
grievance filed by the union June 8. No specifics about the alleged 
incident were stated, except that the pilot said it occurred over 
Mexico during an overnight flight to Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines officials scoffed at the anonymous allegation  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to remember that this is the same union that only four  
months ago tried to convince the public that 2,500 of its members 
were sick,'' said airline spokesman Chris Chiames, alluding to a 
sickout by American pilots in February that left thousands of 
travelers stranded. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge this week ordered the union, the 9,500-member  
Allied Pilots Association, to pay a $45 million fine for violating 
his back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	American said it has more restrictive duty and rest policies  
than the federal government requires, but it is the responsibility 
of pilots to ensure they are ready for duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said it cannot investigate  
the alleged incident or others like it included with the grievance 
because the details are too sketchy. However, its general concern 
about the alertness of flight crews prompted the agency to announce 
earlier this month that it will strictly enforce rest rules at all 
airlines starting Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been simply enough reports over time and enough  
attention has been called to it that we want to make sure the rules 
are being followed,'' said FAA spokesman Paul Turk. 
</P>
<P>
	While the union grievance involves American Airlines, the issue  
of crew fatigue has been a lingering concern throughout the airline 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal regulations, airline pilots cannot fly more than  
eight hours a day. They must also be allowed to rest eight hours 
daily. Crews complain that the flight and rest limits don't address 
the toll extracted by the extra time they spend on duty, such as 
checking in for a flight or sitting in an airport during a layover. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots say backup crews are the hardest hit, because they can be  
ordered to start their workday at any time, regardless of whether 
they just woke up or are ready to go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has floated two ideas for addressing the concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, it suggested pilots be allowed to take  
``controlled rest'' -- individual naps of up to 40 minutes while a 
plane was in cruise flight. The proposal died from lack of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the FAA proposed revamping crew rest rules by allowing  
up to 10 hours of flight time within a 14-hour duty day, leaving 10 
hours for rest. Various factions balked at the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue languished until the American Airlines crash in Little  
Rock, Ark., on June 1 that killed 10 passengers and the plane's 
captain. He and the co-pilot had been on duty 13 1/2 hours, a 
half-hour short of American's maximum duty time. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey announced on June 4 that the  
agency would begin strict enforcement of its existing crew rest 
regulations. The Allied Pilots Association filed its grievance four 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Union spokesman Greg Overman said the Mexico sleeping report was  
one of several fatigue-related incidents culled from an anonymous 
reporting system set up by the FAA and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the problem of tired pilots is not limited to American  
Airlines, since the system contains similar reports from other 
carriers.

<HEADLINE> Damages Denied to Ex-Bcci Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A judge ruled today that former employees of the  
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were not 
entitled to damages for the stigma of having worked for a dishonest 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Justice Gavin Lightman ruled that BCCI, closed down  
by the Bank of England in 1991 owing its creditors nearly $6 
billion, breached an implied term in employees' contracts that they 
could have ``trust and confidence'' in their employer. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the former employees had not established that the  
breach had cost them money by blighting their career prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightman's ruling came in five test cases selected to decide  
``stigma'' actions launched by a total of 369 claimants against the 
bank's liquidators. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, the judge called the fall of BCCI ``the greatest  
scandal in the history of banking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank was hopelessly insolvent from at least 1986, but  
resorted to fraud and wrongdoing on a massive scale in an attempt 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak, the bank had 1.3 million depositors and operations  
in 70 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's liquidators had made statements to the news media  
that ``fraud permeated the bank from top to bottom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those statements were false and hurtful to the former employees,  
Lightman said. But he said the liquidators told him ``the vast 
majority of employees were totally innocent of involvement and that 
only a small body was responsible for the wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Lightman said, no presumption exists that prospective  
employers view former BCCI employees as ``under a cloud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence from three employers that stigma prompted their refusal  
of job applications was ``plainly concocted,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dole Picks Former Reagan Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole  
is turning to fellow officials from the Ronald Reagan years to 
advise her on policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole on Friday named former United Nations Ambassador Jeane  
Kirkpatrick as her principal foreign policy adviser as she seeks 
the GOP nomination and James H. Burnley IV, former transportation 
secretary, as her main domestic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnley was Mrs. Dole's deputy when she was transportation  
secretary, then succeeded her in the last few years of Reagan's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have known and worked with both Jeane and Jim for many  
years,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``We all worked closely together during 
the Reagan administration. Their sharp minds and demonstrated 
leadership will serve me well as I take my campaign of courageous 
conservatism to the voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkpatrick, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise  
Institute, endorsed Mrs. Dole in April. Burnley is an attorney at 
Winston &AMP; Strawn in Washington. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A smokers' rights group is criticizing Sen.  
John McCain for using his free congressional mailing privileges to 
tell voters across the country about tobacco industry lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Smokers Alliance says the Arizona Republican is  
abusing the mailing system to promote views connected with his 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has filed a complaint with the Senate ethics  
committee, whose chairman, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, is a 
rival of McCain for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator's mass mailing is a political letter and is not  
related to matters under current consideration by the Senate,'' 
alliance attorney Mark Braden wrote to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives told the Concord Monitor: ``This  
is nothing more than typical Washington baloney from a paid 
political mouthpiece for big tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's office sent 19,008 letters to people from all 50 states  
who had contacted a Senate committee about a tobacco lawsuit 
settlement bill he sponsored. The bill died on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the ethics committee, McCain's office said it was  
important to tell interested citizens how much money the tobacco 
industry spent to defeat the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He therefore decided to send out a mass mailing, which is a  
fully permissible process that allows senators to communicate their 
views to their constituents and other citizens,'' the office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith spokeswoman Lisa Harrison said committee members deal with  
``friends and foes'' alike and it's not a conflict of interest for 
Smith to handle a complaint against another presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Tops in Practice Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAGNY-COURS, France (AP) -- First, Michael Schumacher got a quick  
reminder of why he doesn't care for the course on which the French 
Grand Prix will be contested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he showed the rest of the Formula One drivers why he keeps  
winning the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time series champion sat out the morning practice  
session Friday, then slid off the 2.64-mile course on his second 
lap in the afternoon. But he returned to run the fastest lap of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track is very slippery and not much fun to drive on,'' the  
German said after circling the course at 121.994 mph. ``I went off 
the track in my first run this afternoon because the brake balance 
was not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher declined to take the track in the morning session  
because he wanted the save his tires after what he said was a good 
test last week. His fast lap took 1 minute, 17.912 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite winning the race twice running and four times in the  
last five years, Schumacher won't profess an affection for the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to win, but I wouldn't say it is one my favorite  
circuits,'' he said. ``It gets hot and slippery. I've done well to 
get four victories, but I would rather race somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-fastest was Schumacher's teammate, Eddie Irvine. He went  
around in 1:18.199. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came series leader Mika Hakkinen, who enters the race with  
a 34-30 lead over Schumacher in the points race. His 
McLaren-Mercedes was clocked at 1:18.251. 
</P>
<P>
	David Coulthard was next in the other McLaren, going around in  
1:18.468. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth-fastest was two-time CART champion Alex Zanardi, who has  
struggled in his return to Formula One. His Williams covered the 
course in 1:18.746

champion Connecticut are among the dozen players chosen for the USA 
Basketball men's team that will play next month in the World 
University Games. 
</P>
<P>

U.S. squad will be attempting to win the nation's sixth consecutive 
World University Games gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrawell was a junior forward on the Blue Devils team that tied  
a school-record 37 victories. Duke went on to lose to UConn in the 
NCAA championship.

<HEADLINE> Sleepwalk Slay Husband Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Scott Falater didn't deny stabbing his wife 44  
times, hiding the knife and bloody clothes, dragging her to their 
swimming pool and then holding her head underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	But Falater did deny responsibility for her 1997 death because  
he claims the entire episode happened while he was sleepwalking. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday rejected his defense and convicted the  
43-year-old of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a strange defense,'' said juror Theresa  
Beaubien. ``It seems to me that there was too much going on for it 
to be sleepwalking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty, although  
that decision will be reviewed before a sentencing hearing later 
this summer, said Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over yet,'' Falater told his mother after kissing her  
on the cheek before leaving court. He showed no emotion as the 
verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of Yarmila Falater did not attend the trial. Her  
mother said before the trial she did not want to be a part of the 
proceeding, said prosecutor Juan Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sleep experts cited Falater's family history of  
sleepwalking, job stress and lack of sleep as reasons for a violent 
sleepwalking episode. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts for the prosecution said Falater's actions were too  
deliberate for him to have been sleepwalking. They based that view 
in part on testimony from neighbor Greg Koons, who watched over a 
wall as Falater pulled on gloves, motioned to his dog to lie down, 
then dragged his wife's body to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors agreed that Koons' testimony was key.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there had been no eyewitness, we probably would have  
acquitted him,'' said John Merrill. ``Greg Koons' testimony was 
just too damning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense painted Falater, a former Motorola engineer, and his  
wife of 20 years as a happily married, religious couple. Defense 
attorney Mike Kimerer said Falater had no reason to kill his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martinez noted the couple had disputes over Falater's desire  
for more children and his wife's waning dedication to the Mormon 
faith. She was not wearing her wedding ring when her body was 
found.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Readies Medicare Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is floating a Medicare  
prescription benefit that could pay roughly half the cost of drugs 
up to a limit of perhaps $3,000 to $5,000 a year, in return for 
higher premiums paid by beneficiaries, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal still is being written, White House press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said, and final details will not be disclosed until 
Clinton presents it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats are nervous about raising Medicare  
premium charges heading into the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are concerned about another possible feature: a  
means-testing requirement that links premium costs to 
beneficiaries' incomes. Some lawmakers are concerned the higher 
costs and income tests will blow up in their faces, much like the 
1988 surtax that Congress approved -- and later was forced to repeal 
at the demand of outraged senior citizens -- to provide catastrophic 
health insurance under Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing Tuesday's deadline for the unveiling of Clinton's  
proposal, White House officials are consulting with Democrats to 
test their reaction. One official said the administration is open 
to the idea of means-testing but might not include that aspect in 
Clinton's plan, leaving it to Congress to decide what to do. 
Republicans likely would attack any income-linked benefit as a tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the White House plans floated on Capitol Hill would have  
the government pay half of prescription costs for Medicare 
beneficiaries up to an annual limit of several thousand dollars, 
roughly between $3,000 and $5,000 a year, an official said, 
</P>
<P>
	To obtain that benefit, recipients would have to pay an  
additional monthly premium -- something higher than $20 a month but 
less than the average $90 charged for drug coverage under a Medigap 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's goal is to offer a prescription benefit that ``meets  
or exceeds what's available in the private sector but is 
significantly more affordable,'' an official said. The official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, cautioned that proposed 
benefits and costs have not been locked in. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they put the final package together,'' the official said,  
``they're going to move a lot of numbers around.''

<HEADLINE> Utah Law in Olympic Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic visitors will find that you can  
get a drink in Utah -- if you know how. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as peculiar as our reputation suggests,'' said  
Nicholas Hales, chairman of the state Alcohol Beverage Control 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But the truth is almost as peculiar as the reputation, as  
officials preparing for the 2002 Winter Games are finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Their request for bar service for the world's media at the dry  
Salt Palace convention center triggered an indignant response by 
legislative leaders and, now, a search by Hales for a legal end 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's myriad rules and regulations governing liquor can be  
confusing, irritating or even humorous. They are more easily 
understood once a visitor realizes the state's liquor monopoly has 
one overriding aim: Don't promote consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a state without open-door saloons, where full  
liquor service is available only to dues-paying members of 
``private'' social clubs or at the 470 restaurants with liquor 
stocks they cannot advertise, display or even mention unless a 
customer asks first. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 121 taverns can pour only ``light'' beer, 3.2  
percent alcohol by weight. No membership is required at taverns. 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery stores can sell only light beer, too, while wine,  
distilled spirits and heavy beer can be purchased at 36 state-run 
liquor stores -- if you can find them. Typically they are tucked 
away in warehouse districts and off major thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
	Private clubs are limited to one per 7,000 Utah residents, or  
295 clubs concentrated primarily in Salt Lake County and Park City. 
Minimum club dues by law are $12 a year, although visitors can buy 
a two-week membership for $5 that is ``not much different from 
paying a cover charge,'' Hales said. Or visitors can ask the guy on 
the next barstool to sponsor them as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Former ABC Chairman Jerry Fenn says there are ``some hoops'' to  
getting a drink in Utah, ``but I don't think they are that 
onerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to apologize for with our liquor laws,'' said  
Fenn, a teetotaling Mormon and lobbyist on liquor laws for his 
church. ``People will be able to get a drink when they come to 
Utah. The perception people have about Utah is tied more to 
stereotypes about religion and Mormonism. The perception is worse 
than reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap over Utah's liquor laws came last month when an  
International Olympic Committee official said that he and his wine 
could never be parted. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Frenchman, I know that a Frenchman kept from his wine  
might get cranky,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	So an IOC working group asked ``with great respect'' that Utah  
authorities allow unfettered alcohol sales at the Salt Palace, 
where working space will be provided for 9,000 journalists, 
broadcasters and technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's legislative leaders said they wouldn't soften  
any laws and local Olympic organizers quickly backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no attempt to change laws, we are not lobbying to  
change laws and we'll just have to see how the laws apply to the 
situation at game time,'' said Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
spokeswoman Caroline Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to be helpful, Hales said the Olympics can work around  
the laws. Indeed, his proposed solution bares the sheer complexity 
of Utah's system of alcohol licenses and permits. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's media, Hales said, need only find five or six  
sponsors to patch together a succession of 72-hour ``single-event'' 
permits for a month of bar service at the Salt Palace during the 
Olympics and Paralympic Games. Hales said any established press 
group could qualify as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The media, however, is unlikely to get around-the-clock alcohol  
service for filing deadlines matching the world's time zones. Last 
call in Utah is 1 a.m. -- no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	And thirsty visitors who think they can pack their suitcases  
with booze should stand warned. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a misdemeanor to bring alcohol into the state, an offense  
worth up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Gore's Thesis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Al Gore's 1969 Harvard thesis, ``The Impact of  
Television on the Conduct of the Presidency 1947-1969'': 
</P>
<P>
	The advent of television in politics prompted the public to  
evaluate presidential appearances on personality, not issues, Gore 
said in his paper. ``This is, of course, human nature, and 
politicians have always known it,'' he wrote. ``However, the old 
medium, newspapers, filtered out references to the president's 
personality, and reported primarily the issues involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``A large part of the credit for (President) Kennedy's success  
on television was due to his personality. ... President Kennedy was 
simply better on television than most. ... He knew how to use 
visual rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Overexposure has, with television, become a significant threat  
to presidential leadership that must be dealt with. ... A 
president's overexposure is in part a function of how well his 
personality comes across on television, and his advisers quickly 
learn to sublimate any critical response in that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Gore wrote how Americans polled in 1962 gave John Kennedy high  
marks for his appearances on televised news conferences. When asked 
why, 70 percent listed Kennedy's ``personality'' as their reason. 
Gore also cited the experience of Washington journalist Peter 
Lisagor, who traveled with President Johnson in 1965 when his 
almost nightly appearances on TV prompted people to ask Lisagor for 
insight into the president's personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an ambivalence about both these examples,'' Gore  
wrote. ``Neither one makes clear whether the trend toward judging a 
president by personality characteristics helps him or hurts him. 
The answer is `either or both,' depending on how he uses 
television.''

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Might Not Keep Draft Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Picking 26 players in today's NHL expansion draft  
was just one step in Atlanta's roster-building process. Some of 
those players might not be with the Thrashers very long. 
</P>
<P>
	With a shortage of scorers left unprotected by their teams,  
Atlanta considered taking more defensemen than it needs, then 
trading some of them for forwards who could provide offense and 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 goal is to win hockey games,'' general manager Don  
Waddell said, ``but, No. 2, we have to entertain people. We're in a 
marketplace where we have to win a fan base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city hasn't had an NHL team since the Atlanta Flames moved  
to Calgary in 1980. The Thrashers will be playing in a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in it for the long haul,'' Waddell said. ``We have solid  
ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A solid team, though, might take a while to develop.  
</P>
<P>
	Each team loses one player, except the Nashville Predators, who  
won't lose any because they were an expansion team last year. Since 
Atlanta is the only expansion team this season, it was expected 
simply to announce the players it chose. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 26 teams losing a player, the unprotected lists included  
only six players with more than 20 goals last season, led by Wendel 
Clark of Detroit with 32. But in a mock draft done by the 
Thrashers, the highest goal scorer they chose had just 11, Waddell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a whole lot of guys who scored a bunch of goals,''  
he said of those on the unprotected list. ``Maybe the few that are 
on there are older players who are carrying big salaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he planned to swing a few trades before Saturday's entry  
draft, in which Atlanta has the second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would see us making five to six deals,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	One position they won't need to shore up is goalie. They already  
have their starter, Damian Rhodes, obtained last week in a trade 
with Ottawa and signed to a four-year contract after posting a 2.44 
goals-against average in 45 games for the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought it would be a possibility,'' to trade for  
Rhodes, Waddell said. ``That was a huge benefit for our 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also means such well-known unprotected goalies as Grant Fuhr  
of St. Louis, Mike Vernon of San Jose and Ron Tugnutt of Ottawa 
probably wouldn't be chosen. Waddell was looking, instead, for a 
younger goalie who could develop behind Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes for good competition, good healthy competition,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers had to take a minimum of eight defensemen, three  
goalies and 13 forwards. The final two players could play any 
position, although Waddell expected to take two defensemen or a 
defenseman and a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we take 10 defensemen, we can trade them back to teams and,  
potentially, get some better forwards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The best forwards might be those chosen in Saturday's entry  
draft, although it will be years before they develop. Only two of 
them -- Pavel Brendl and Patrik Stefan -- are considered by Waddell 
to be ready to play in the NHL next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying, `which player's going to be the best for us five  
years from now, not this year.' '' Waddell said. ``This pick is 
very important to the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan's chances of being one of the top two picks, by Tampa Bay  
or Atlanta, would be better had he not suffered two concussions 
last season while playing with Long Beach of the International 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waddell thinks he'll be able to make an informed decision if  
Stefan is still available when the Thrashers draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate we will have whatever information we need to be  
comfortable to make a decision based on ability and medical 
records,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Radiation Lawsuit Retrial Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A judge is preparing to order a new trial in a  
lawsuit against uranium plant operators who lost a $36.5 million 
judgment to eight cancer victims and their families, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose said in a order that some  
testimony was prejudicial and evidence was improperly withheld from 
lawyers for the companies, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said it obtained a copy of the order. A court  
clerk told The Associated Press the order had not been filed as of 
early this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that I'm upset just at the thought of having to  
go through this again,'' said Mary Ann Hall, who was awarded $8.5 
million after losing her 24-year-old daughter to leukemia on 
Christmas Day 1992. ``It was hard enough the first time and it will 
probably be harder the second time,'' she said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents say they inhaled white radioactive dust from the plant  
for three decades and claim microscopic particles of uranium caused 
an unusually high cancer rate. The plant shut down in 1986, and 
residents sued in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was located in Apollo, a town of nearly 2,000 people  
about 30 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for plant operators Atlantic Richfield Co. and Babcock  
&AMP; Wilcox Co. argued that the emissions were not excessive and that 
nobody could prove a link between the radiation and diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury in September ordered the companies to pay $36.5 million  
in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 37-page ruling dated for today, Ms. Ambrose, who presided  
over the original trial, wrote that jurors were prejudiced by shaky 
data and improper testimony that was ``highly prejudicial and often 
irrelevant,'' the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	She pointed to testimony in which Mrs. Hall and her husband,  
Donald, describe the anguish of losing their daughter. Their 
testimony was ``irrelevant and highly prejudicial and will not be 
admitted at a new trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said attorneys for the plaintiffs should have shared  
with company attorneys exhibits and testimony that showed an 
increase of cancer cases in Apollo compared with nearby 
communities. The evidence also should have been verified by the 
study's author.

<HEADLINE>  Man Executed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A busy telephone line prevented  
President Joseph Estrada from stopping the execution today of a man 
convicted of raping his daughter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Agbayani was executed as scheduled, becoming the second  
person put to death since the Philippines restored capital 
punishment in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada, who had said earlier today he would not grant a  
reprieve, changed his mind five minutes before the lethal injection 
was to be administered after emotional appeals from one of the 
defendant's daughters and a Catholic bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said he would stop it,'' Bishop Teodoro Bacani  
said after talking by telephone to Estrada. ``We were very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a few minutes later Estrada called and said telephone lines  
to the prison had been busy or gave a fax tone. ``I'm sorry. We 
were too late,'' he quoted Estrada as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said: ``This is the problem  
of a last-minute appeal to the president. We are talking of a few 
minutes here or seconds, even. In this case, the law took its 
course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani's execution stirred little of the passionate nationwide  
debate that accompanied an earlier execution in February, the first 
in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani, 51, was initially charged with raping two of his  
daughters while his wife was working in Saudi Arabia. The 
daughters, however, withdrew from the case, leading to his release. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he was convicted of raping another daughter, who was then  
14, and sentenced to die for that crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Bing, one of the daughters who withdrew from the earlier case,  
appealed tearfully on the radio today for Estrada to save her 
father's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am appealing to you ... for forgiveness for my father and to  
lower his sentence,'' she said. ``We are not asking that he be 
freed because my father also has to suffer and pay for his crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada had said in the morning that he wanted the execution to  
``serve as a stern warning to other criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He previously granted reprieves to seven men whose executions  
were scheduled between April and June to allow investigators time 
to check claims they were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines abolished capital punishment in 1987 but  
reimposed it in 1994 in response to widespread crime. Since then, 
more than 900 people have been sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person executed under the new law, a house painter  
convicted of repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, was 
put to death in February after months of legal battles and 
emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Another convicted rapist, Pablito Andan, is scheduled to be  
executed Monday. Andan was to have been put to death on May 28, but 
Estrada granted him a one-month reprieve to investigate claims he 
was tortured into confessing by police.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Loses Ministry Over Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.Y. (AP) -- A Canadian-born clergyman whose quest for  
U.S. citizenship has been stymied by a teen-age marijuana 
conviction was stripped of his ministry for writing an abusive 
letter to immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Steven Mullenix, the 36-year-old son of an American,  
was summoned before top officers of the Assemblies of God church 
Tuesday and given a one-year suspension for ``conduct unbecoming a 
minister of the gospel,'' said the Rev. Saied Adour, district 
superintendent in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullenix was raised in Canada. He was caught with a bag of  
marijuana at 18 and spent three months in jail. He moved to upstate 
New York in 1995 and had hoped to become a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	But under a law designed to exclude terrorists, Nazi war  
criminals and other undesirables, Mullenix is deemed ``excludable'' 
for life. Anyone arrested with more than an ounce of drugs is 
considered a potential dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	He lashed out in a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service on June 7, writing: ``You evil bastards. ... You are all 
guilty, and compared to my teen-age stupidity, it is a far more 
grievous sin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church's general secretary, the Rev. George Wood, a lawyer  
who has been trying to help Mullenix obtain citizenship, advised 
church officials that Mullenix may have breached a church bylaw 
governing moral conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``His language is extremely intemperate and becomes outright  
sinful when he labels the persons to whom he is writing as `evil 
bastards,''' Wood said in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullenix said he apologized to the church for his remarks, which  
he explained were made in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very stressful situation for me dealing with the INS,''  
he said. ``To be basically put out of the ministry is a little bit 
extreme. The phrase I used is a rude but culturally acceptable 
idiom in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing his ministry means Mullenix will probably have to leave  
the country with his wife and two children. His religious-worker 
visa, which expires in December 2000, will be revoked in four 
months unless he finds another job. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullenix expects the church will allow his family to remain  
living at the rectory in this village 35 miles from Rochester for a 
few months while he looks for pastoral work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a faith that no matter what happens, God is going to  
take care of us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Coffee, Soybeans, Orange Juice Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Weather concerns helped send futures prices lower for coffee,  
orange juice and corn on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other futures trading, wheat was higher and livestock prices  
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices tumbled across the board on the New York  
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange on prospects for large competing 
crops from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Ganes, an analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York,  
said mild Brazilian weather, coming at a critical juncture at the 
end of that country's frost season, was depressing the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are expected to export 40 million bags next year,  
compared to 26.5 million this year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	July coffee contracts fell 2.25 cents to $1.01.  
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices for frozen concentrate orange juice retreated on  
the New York Cotton Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganes said the latest government report indicated demand has  
been down. Adding to the slide were a drop in exports, and rainfall 
in Florida that should help the 1999-2000 crop, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	July orange juice fell 1.20 cents to 87.55 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices for soybeans fell on the Chicago Board of Trade,  
continuing a decline from the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	All grain and soybean prices moved higher in morning trading but  
soybeans and corn pulled back as the day wore on. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the weekend approaching, traders were apparently feeling  
comfortable with the prices where they were, and there was some 
selling,'' said Chicago analyst George Renkert of the Price Futures 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	A forecast of much-needed rain in U.S. Midwest growing areas  
also led to the decline in corn and soybean prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for delivery in August posted a new contract low of  
$4.50 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, July soybeans had plummeted 13 cents a bushel. They  
fell another 2 1/4 cents on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvest delays supported wheat prices, which also were helped by  
reports the current crop may contain less milling quality than 
originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat was $2.51 1/4 a bushel, up 1 1/4 cents; July corn was down  
1/4 cent to $2.14 a bushel; oats rose 1 cent to $1.13 1/2 a bushel; and 
July soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents to $4.50 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle prices were higher and the pork complex futures were  
mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were looking ahead to Monday as the government's latest  
pigs and hogs report was expected to give new direction to the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle prices were supported by news that Russia was interested  
in U.S. beef imports. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle were up .15 cent to 64.75 cents a pound;  
August feeder cattle were 77.42 cents a pound, up .30 cent; July 
lean hogs were up .20 cent to 50.87 cents a pound; and July pork 
bellies were up .40 cent to 44.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> EU OKs Tighter Modified Food Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union environment ministers  
agreed today to tighten rules on trading and selling new 
genetically modified seeds in the 15-nation EU, but rejected a 
French moratorium on sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Parliament must now approve the measure, which  
calls for stricter labeling and monitoring of such foods. Officials 
said it may take many months, even up to a year, for the EU 
assembly to vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tightening the rules on genetically modified foods -- notably  
corn, soy and rice -- is bound to upset the United States, which 
already complains about European heel-dragging in approving U.S. 
foods that have been genetically manipulated to make them more 
resistant to diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, such genetic manipulation is seen as a health hazard.  
Newspapers in Britain have called them ``Frankenstein Foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tighter rules the EU nations have in mind would affect  
genetically modified seeds, not food ready for consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would end permanent authorization for genetically  
modified seeds in favor of a system of temporary approvals. Also, 
the risk assessment of genetically engineered foodstuffs would be 
increased through tougher labeling and monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	EU legislation would also seek more public input.  
</P>
<P>
	``If any evidence does arise of risk to human health or  
environment, approval can be withdrawn,'' said Michael Meacher, 
Britain's agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace praised the move as a reaction to Europeans'  
rejection of genetically modified food. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear step in the right direction,'' Greenpeace  
political adviser Louise Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the all-night session of EU environment ministers, France  
pleaded for a moratorium on genetically modified food in the EU 
pending European Parliament approval of the tighter labeling rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It argued that current approval rules date back to 1990 and are  
unclear about labeling. However, Britain and others successfully 
argued that a moratorium would be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The French ``did not feel that the text was ambitious enough,''  
European Commission spokesman Peter Jorgensen told reporters in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've had for years is a factual moratorium,'' he added,  
taking note of European public opposition to genetically modified 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. administration believes genetically modified seeds pose  
no risk to the health of consumers. Almost 40 percent of some 
American crops are genetically modified. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently 18 genetically modified crops approved for  
marketing in the EU. Four more are awaiting approval, but fears 
about genetically modified foods are rising across the 15 EU 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 20, the European Commission said it will delay approval  
of pending requests to sell a genetically modified corn due to 
health concerns raised by an American study.

<HEADLINE> GDP Grows at 4.3 Percent Annual Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, propelled by strong consumer  
spending, grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first three 
months of the year despite a trade deficit swollen by overseas 
financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today the increase in the gross  
domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- from 
January through March was slightly better than the 4.1 percent rate 
estimated a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.2 percentage point improvement reflected a slight revision  
in the trade deficit, which, while still at record levels, was $6.5 
billion lower than the government estimated previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy's pace at the beginning of the year was far above  
expectations. That has trigged concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will begin raising short-term interest rates at its meeting next 
week in an effort to keep the expansion from triggering inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	While most analysts believe that growth slowed in the current  
April-June quarter to around 3.5 percent, they feel the drop was 
not enough to keep the central bank from raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Fed acts next week, it will be doing so with most  
inflation indicators still showing that price pressure remained 
benign. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose at an annual rate of  
just 1.2 percent in the first quarter. That was only slightly 
higher than the 1.1 percent previously estimated. It went up 0.9 
percent in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today that corporate profits rose in the  
first three months of this year to an annual rate of $47.1 billion, 
a marked turnaround from a drop of $5.3 billion in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter performance, which was revised up by $15.3  
billion from the initial estimate last month, reflected that 
tobacco companies paid less in court settlements during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the recent weakness in the stock market has reflected  
worries that company earnings in the second quarter will be below 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's economic growth has been powered by robust consumer  
spending. The government said today that consumer spending in the 
first quarter rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, the best 
showing in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	This was slightly below the previously estimated 6.8 percent  
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new GDP report said the record trade deficit shaved 2.23  
percentage points from economic growth in the first three months of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	While at record levels, the drag from trade was slightly lower  
than an estimated loss of 2.53 percentage points in growth in last 
month's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global  
financial crises, which has cut sharply into American export sales 
while increasing competition on American manufacturers from a flood 
of cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Business investment, spending on new equipment and plants, rose  
at an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the first quarter, even better 
than last month's estimate of 7.9 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	And, spending for new homes and apartments increased at a 15.4  
percent rate, the best showing in a year. Because of rising 
mortgage rates in recent weeks, analysts believe the housing market 
will cool in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of  
$81.9 billion in the first three months of the year, pushing the 
country's total output of goods and services to $7.76 trillion, 
after adjusting for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Man Bought Gun Just Before Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- A restraining order that required a  
man to stay away from his family did not show up on a federal 
background check, allowing him to purchase a handgun that police 
say he used hours later to kill his three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show that Simon Gonzales' estranged wife obtained  
a temporary restraining order in late May and a petition was filed 
to make it permanent on June 16. Gonzales bought the gun from a 
federally-licensed firearms dealer Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	But because Gonzales had not been served with the order, it was  
not entered into his background record and it did not turn up 
during the required check, investigators said Thursday. Authorities 
did not say why Gonzales was never served. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ATF has confirmed that this was a legal transaction, a  
legal sale,'' said Michael Knight, a spokesman for the District 
Attorney's Office and an investigator in the case.

	John Keating of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in  
Washington said a restraining order -- temporary or permanent -- will 
prevent an applicant from buying a gun once it has been served and 
has entered the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales was killed by police in a pre-dawn shootout Wednesday  
after he drove in front of the police station and fired through a 
window, narrowly missing an officer inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, police found his daughters, Rebecca, 10,  
Katheryn, 8, and Leslie, 7, dead inside his bullet-riddled truck. 
An autopsy Thursday concluded that the girls died of gunshot wounds 
before the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Gonzales picked the girls up near their house in  
Castle Rock after Mrs. Gonzales gave him permission to take them 
out Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 6 p.m., Gonzales called a gun dealer who had advertised a  
handgun in a newspaper for $375 dollars, said police. The 
background check took about one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the girls were shot in the truck. Gonzales' wife,  
Jessica, 33, her son, Jessie, relatives and friends struggled to 
understand what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't conceive it. It can't even be real to us now,  
because you can't do that to kids,'' said Tommy Rivera, Mrs. 
Gonzales' sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gonzaleses were married in 1990, separating last year,  
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In an application for a restraining order filed last month, Mrs.  
Gonzales said her husband tried hang himself in front of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gonzales called police twice in the hours before the  
shootout because she was concerned about the children's welfare. 
She said her husband had suicidal tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales had worked for the past year maintaining computer  
systems at Natural Balance, Inc. in Castle Rock, a dietary 
supplement company where supervisors said he was a valued employee 
who had shown no signs of personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He had served in the Navy and received a monthly disability  
payment.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Fight Gay Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to finally pass a federal law to ban  
job discrimination against homosexuals, New England lawmakers are 
stressing that the measure wouldn't extend any special rights to 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the next important step for civil rights in America,''  
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who is sponsoring the 
Employment Non-Discrimination Act with Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., 
and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar bills have failed in three Congresses. In 1996, an ENDA  
bill was defeated by one vote in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Los Angeles at a gay and  
lesbian center, voiced support for the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not confer any special rights, but it does outlaw the  
kind of discrimination that has become all too common in our 
society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, lawmakers have rewritten the bill to explicitly state  
that preferential treatment of homosexuals, such as hiring to meet 
quotas or affirmative action standards designed to make up for past 
discrimination, is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	That is intended to disarm opponents who have successfully  
argued in years past that gays would be granted special rights 
under the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	ENDA would extend basic civil rights protections in the area of  
employment to cover sexual orientation. Such protections are 
already afforded to people on the basis of race, religion, gender, 
national origin, age and disability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is special protection,'' insisted Robert H. Knight of the  
conservative Family Research Council, which plans to renew its 
lobbying campaign against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven states -- California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts,  
Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, New 
Hampshire and Nevada -- already prohibit job discrimination against 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other 39 states, it is legal to fire someone because they  
are homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said such firings should be allowed because sexual  
orientation, unlike race, gender or disability, involves behavior. 
Employers should be able to fire workers because of behavior they 
find disagreeable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ENDA would prohibit employers of 15 or more, employment agencies  
and labor unions from using an individual's sexual orientation as 
the basis for employment decisions, such as hiring, firing, 
promotion or compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would exempt the military and religious organizations.  
It would not require benefits for workers' same-sex partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords plans to pass the bill out of his Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions Committee and then try to force consideration by 
the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	House supporters hope Senate action would force debate by the  
House, which is also led by conservative Republicans. If the bill 
is debated, it will pass because most Americans are in favor of it, 
they said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Assembling Sweeping Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cutting capital gains tax rates in half,  
fixing the ``marriage penalty'' that affects millions of two-income 
couples and eliminating inheritance taxes are likely cornerstones 
of a huge tax relief plan being developed by Republicans in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying too much in taxes, and, as history has  
shown, any taxpayer money left in Washington will surely be 
spent,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The $778 billion, 10-year plan to be unveiled in July is  
intended to energize the GOP's social conservative and business 
supporters. It also will force Democrats to decide between tax 
relief's appeal and President Clinton's priorities of Social 
Security, Medicare and education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic tax-cutting sentiment is particularly strong in the  
Senate, where as many as eight of the 45 Democrats are either 
co-sponsoring major tax relief bills or have expressed a desire to 
return some of the projected $2.6 trillion budget surplus to 
taxpayers over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to save Social Security this year. Having done that,  
we still have money to be able to cut Americans' taxes,'' said Sen. 
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``I favor tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans generally agree on several major  
items, although Archer will not finalize his bill until mid-July. 
But these cuts are among those with strong support: 
</P>
<P>
	--Reducing the top capital gains tax rate on longer-term  
investments such as stocks, possibly from 20 percent to 10 percent. 
Cost: $143 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Easing the ``marriage penalty'' by adjusting income brackets so  
that a greater share of a married couple's income would be subject 
to the lower 28 percent tax rate and giving married couples a 
higher standard deduction. Combined cost: $187 billion over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gradually eliminating the estate or ``death'' tax over the next  
decade. Cost: $198 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Abolishing the alternative minimum tax, or at least ensuring it  
does not strike middle-class people instead of the wealthy as 
originally intended. Abolition cost: $133 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising IRA contribution limits from $2,000 to $5,000 a year.  
Total cost: $50 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Extending the research and development tax credit, a big  
priority for high-tech industries, and other expiring business 
credits for at least five more years. Cost: $12 billion over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	These proposals were included in a bill introduced Thursday by  
House GOP conservatives, whose plan is strongly backed by 
pro-business organizations and groups such as the Christian 
Coalition and the Family Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax cut is the most important issue for us,'' said the  
group's leader, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. ``We haven't defined 
what the difference is between a Republican Congress and Bill 
Clinton. Cutting taxes really defines the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they search for issues in their bid to wrest House control  
from the GOP in the 2000 elections, most House Democrats are united 
behind Clinton's pledge to use the budget surplus for popular 
government programs and not tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't want to do ... is put a huge tax bill out there  
that robs and takes money from Social Security and Medicare and 
education and other priorities,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, director of Clinton's National Economic Council,  
said the White House also believes it unwise to use projected 
future surpluses for ``exploding or irresponsible tax cuts'' that 
could trigger a new federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any of the projections are wrong, these are large and  
unsustainable amounts,'' Sperling said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is less Democratic unity in the Senate, where the  
party is thrashing out whether to support tax cuts. Senate Finance 
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., says he wants a bipartisan 
bill, but so far Democrats cannot agree on an approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said many Democrats seem to fear  
the political power of a Republican tax relief plan. ``A bidding 
war is starting to take place. If we can't hold ourselves in check 
-- that's what I fear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is urging that GOP  
senators back a bold tax cut, including a capital gains reduction, 
and said the goal for both ends of the Capitol is to finish a 
compromise measure and send it to Clinton by the first week in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Clinton vetoes such a bill, Republicans would have  
their political issue and Democrats could claim they were 
protecting Social Security, Medicare and education. Then the two 
sides would likely be left this fall with only the expiring 
business tax credits, which are extended every year.
