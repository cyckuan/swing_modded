<HEADLINE> Poverty Still a Challenge to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Poverty alleviation campaigns
launched by Vietnam's government have had little effect on poor
households and have not yet created a movement to fight poverty at
the grassroots level, Deputy Minister of Labor, War Invalids and
Social Welfare Dam Huu Dac was quoted as saying by Vietnam News
Agency (VNA) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of Vietnamese live in poverty, down from 70
percent in 1980 and 50 percent in 1993, a World Bank (WB) report
said at the consultative group meeting on earlier December in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The report also highlighted challenges facing Vietnam that may
hinder efforts to reduce poverty by an additional 10 percent in
1999, a goal set by the 8th party congress.
</P>
<P>
The first challenge is a dramatic fall in economic growth which
is expected to continue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Continuing decline in employment in industrial and agricultural
areas accompanied by sharp cuts in state spending is another
challenge.
</P>
<P>
VNA said the government estimates unemployment rate at six
percent in Hanoi but it is believed to be as high as eight
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the income gap between city dwellers and rural
people continues to widen. City dwellers earned five times as much
as rural people in 1990 - eight times in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge is natural disasters. Prolonged drought
in 1997-1998 and three tropical storms in November striking
provinces on the central highlands and the central coast put more
than one million people at risk of famine.
</P>
<P>
People in the Mekong Delta are still struggling to rebuild
their lives in the wake of typhoon Lynda in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of the poor live off agriculture, forestry and
fishing, generating average income of about 2 million VN dong (one
U.S. dollar equals to 13,890 VN dong) per capita yearly, and even
1 million VN dong in some places.
</P>
<P>
According to VNA, many policy makers said it is important to
link poverty alleviation efforts with economic growth and social
justice.
</P>
<P>
Internal resources and the potential of each province should be
released and brought into full play through practical programs.
</P>
<P>
Under the national strategy for poverty alleviation up to the
years 2000 and 2010, the Vietnamese government pledges to invest
more in building rural infrastructure and facilities with funding
drawn from all resources.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Bayi Rockets Wins Season Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Three-time Defending champion
Bayi Rockets rallied from behind to beat Jilin Northeast Tigers
108-100 to start their campaign to win the fourth consecutive
title in the Hilton China Basketball League which started in six
cities over China on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 2.12-meter center Wang Zhizhi, who just led Chinese
national team to win the gold medal at the Bangkok Asian Games a
week ago, hit a game high 34 points with slam dunks and jumpers
to lead the defending champion for the victory, their first in a
21-round home-and-away league which lasts to May 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun scored a team-high 33 point to lead the Jilin Tigers,
who jumped to a 60-51 lead at the end of the first half but soon
saw their lead blew away as starting point guard Li Aijun was out
of the game with an injury on his ankle.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Hunters also clinched their season opener with a win
of 107-91 over Sichuan Pandas. The Hunters trailed 13-12 in the
first quarter but never looked back in the rest three quarters en
route to their first win at home.
</P>
<P>
This was also the first time Chinese Basketball Association
introduced the four quarters of 12 minutes frame into their
professional league, which has entered its fourth season as the
all 12 teams started battles in six cities from northern province
of Liaoning to the southern province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Tigers nailed 12 3-pointers to kill the Jiangsu
Dragons 88-80. The Tigers outshot the Dragons 12-3 from the long
range arc and led 45-31 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
But the most 3-pointers came from Zhejiang Cyclone who shot 13
for 37 behind the arc and rallied from a 44-39 cap at the half
break to beat Beijing Ducks 103-98 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
In other first round matches, Shanghai Sharks defeated Jinan
Army Pegasus 115-100 and Shandong Flaming Bulls used a later
attacking in the third quarter to beat Beijing Aoshen 101-85.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wins Stage at Tour of South China Sea Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Xiao Yechen was the
surprise winner of the day when he captured the second stage of
the Tour of South China Sea Cycle Race '98 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old from north China's Hebei Province covered the
88 kilometers road race at Hong Kong's former international
airport at Kai Tak with a time of one hour 52 minutes 39.18
seconds. He did not burst out to lead the field until the 25th
lap and he sprinted to the finish line first, about one wheel
ahead of South African Kosie Loubser.
</P>
<P>
Loubser was 0.22 second behind for the second place and Czech
national Stanislav Tancer, who is now studying in Australia,
lagged 0.39 seconds behind the Chinese winner for the third spot.
</P>
<P>
After two stages in the week-long Tour, Loubser led the
individual time ranking list with an aggregated time of two hours
13 minutes and 32 seconds, followed by opening stage winner on
Saturday and China's ace rider Tang Xuezhong in 2:13:55, and
Tancer in 2:14:18 and Asian Games champion Wong Kam Po from Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region in 2:14:25.
</P>
<P>
Loubser will wear the leader's yellow jersey when the third
stage begins Monday morning in Guangzhou, south China. The 135.6
kilometers road race is the longest stage of the seven-leg Tour.
</P>
<P>
The Tour totaling more than 600 Km in length closes on January
1 next year after two stages each in Zhuhai, south China and
Macao.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President to Visit Greece to End Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides will arrive in Athens next Monday to discuss with Greek
government leaders the planned deployment by Nicosia of
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles with an aim to bring an
end to the missile impasse.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the third of its kind within this year,
Clerides is also expected to convey to Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis the views of the leaders of Cyprus' political parties on
the recently-adopted U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding
lowering tension and resuming inter-communal negotiations in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government announced in January last year plans to
purchase the Russian S-300 missiles as a self-defense measures to
partially counterbalance Turkey's military superiority on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which currently keeps some 35,000 troops in the
occupied northern Cyprus, has openly threatened to use force to
prevent the missile installation, saying that the missile system
will be a threat to the Turkish-Cypriot community and to the
Turkish mainland.
</P>
<P>
The missile system is due for delivery in November but has been
delayed as a result of the pressure given by the U.S. and some
European countries as well as Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides visited Greece in later November, but reportedly
failed to reach a consensus with the Greek government concerning
the missile deployment.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which signed with Cyprus a joint defense pact in 1993,
reportedly supports the idea of installing the missiles in the
southern Greek island of Crete in order to avoid being dragged
into hostilities with neighboring Turkey, but Clerides insists
that the missiles will be deployed on the island republic as
planned.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that there is a possibility of
breakthrough in Tuesday's talks between Clerides and Simitis
regarding the missile issue because the two U.N. Security Council
resolutions have opened way for ending the S-300 impasse.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Clerides will agree to deploy the S-300 on
the Greek island of Crete instead of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Demirel Calls for Formation of Government Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel on Sunday called on political parties in parliament to
work for the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
His appeal came after Yalim Erez, an independent deputy and
industry and trade minister, was entrusted by him on Wednesday to
form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Erez came to the fore after Bulent Ecevit, the previous premier
designate and leader of the Democratic Left Party, failed in his
attempt to garner enough support in the parliament. Erez has not
begun to meet with any political figures to try his luck yet.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that "at the moment nobody knows what kind of
government will be formed and we should wait and be patient for a
few days."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a year-end press conference here on Saturday,
Demirel declared that he will not exercise his constitutional
power to dissolve the parliament even after the January 10
deadline.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish constitution stipulates that the president could
dissolve the parliament and establish an election government, if
no new government could be formed with the vote of confidence in
parliament within 45 days of the collapse of a government.
</P>
<P>
The minority coalition government led by Mesut Yilmaz was
ousted by the parliament on November 25 over corruption scandals.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Housing Initiative Starts in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The presidential housing
initiative commenced Sunday with the opening of entries of the
design competition at the National Housing Authority in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Opening the competition, Local Government and Housing Minister
Bennie Mwiinga said that the initiative would realize the
construction of thousands of houses around the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency ZANA quoted Mwiinga as saying that apart
from providing high quality houses to the Zambians, this
initiative will create jobs and utilize idle capacity in building
concerns.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a 4,000 housing unit demonstration project
has started at the Chainama Hills Hospital Site in Lusaka as
directed by President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for houses to be of high
quality so that they could be used for a long time.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government wishes to replace the
unplanned settlements in Lusaka by building houses at the low
cost level through the housing initiative.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proceeds from the sale of council houses by
all the 72 local authorities are to be invested in the new
initiative.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 50 Rebels Killed in North S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- About 50 rebels were killed
Saturday by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG in the
fighting for the control of Makeni town in north Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were killed during ECOMOG's bombing raids on
rebels' positions just outside Makeni, said a report reaching
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG official in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, was
quoted as saying Sunday that the peace-keepers were battling
rebels holding on just outside Makeni, which is about 100
kilometers northeast of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched an offensive on Makeni Wednesday and once
succeeded in entering part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified ECOMOG official said he expected ECOMOG
planes to go into action again against the rebels who had
regrouped at the Makeni Teachers College on the southeastern
highway to Magburaka.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG took control of most of Makeni Saturday after
bombarding rebels' positions, said the official.
</P>
<P>
But the report quoted the fleeing residents who arrived in
Freetown Sunday as saying that peace-keeping troops had retaken
the town from the rebels Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the civilians in Makeni and the surrounding area have
fled and communications links with Makeni have been cut, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, compromising forces loyal to the ousted military
junta of Johnny Paul Koroma and those of the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), intensified their offensive on key Sierra Leonean
cities including Freetown in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Their attacks have caused a panic in the small west African
country, leading to the evacuation of their nationals by the U.S.
and Britain. The United Nations also evacuated part of its staff
to neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
RUF's No. 2 leader Sam Rockarie said that the rebels wanted
direct talks with the government and the immediate release of its
detained leader Foday Sankoh, who has been sentenced to death in
connection with the 1997 coup of Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Bockarie threatened that unless the government agreed to the
rebels' terms, the rebels would continue their offensive.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to march into Freetown on New Year's Day... We
have the will and the way," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah has refused the rebels' demand.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of west African countries are expected to
meet in Cote d'Ivoire Monday to discuss the escalating tension in
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Spreading Quickly in Sub-Saharan Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is spreading quickly in
sub-Saharan Africa as a result of deforestation, global warming,
creation of dams, irrigation schemes and commercial tree
cropping, said a fact sheet released by the World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Malaria affects 40 percent of the world's population in more
than 90 countries while over 90 percent of the cases are in
Africa where there are increasing levels of chloroquine
resistance, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Sunday quoted the
recently-released WHO fact sheet as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaria kills one million people every year in the world and
the vast majority of deaths occur among young children and
pregnant women in Africa, said the WHO's fact sheet.
</P>
<P>
It stated that the costs for the treatment of malaria in
sub-Saharan Africa exceeded 2.1 billion U.S. Dollars last year
alone.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease,"
it said, adding that research and development in malaria
prevention and treatment have made advances.
</P>
<P>
Drug combinations for multi-drug resistance malaria and
vaccines against malaria are being developed at the global level
while insecticide-treated mosqui nets and curtains have
emerged in recent years as a promising tool to prevent malaria
disease.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, the World Bank and other U.N. organizations this year
have joined forces to launch a new campaign called "Roll Back
Malaria" to fight the disease.

<HEADLINE> Likud Lawmaker Challenges Netanyahu for Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A Likud legislator declared
his candidacy Sunday for the party's leadership, adding fresh
internal pressure to embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who is already facing enormous challenges from outside his party.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, a hard-line member of the Knesset, or parliament,
announced that he will run against Netanyahu as party leader,
vowing to return the Likud to political and public norms which he
said were paralysed in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
This move came soon after Netanyahu was relieved to hear the
popular Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert announcing he would not stand
for the Likud leadership as widely speculated.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has already faced enough challenges from the left and
the central wings.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak and former Chief of Staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, who left the army last week to help lead a new
centrist political party, will be the two most formidable rivals
of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Troubles abound in his own party as well. Some members have
defected and some are considering to leave or challenge Netanyahu
from inside, as Landau did.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Dan Meridor kicked off his campaign
last week for the coming elections by quitting the Likud and
announcing plans to form a centrist party, which Shahak is
expected to join.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Knesset member Benny Begin and Communications
Minister Limor Livnat might leave the Likud Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a potential blow to Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai is also reportedly considering to leave the Likud and
join Shahak's new party to run against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a moderate in the Likud government, is dissatisfied
with Netanyahu over his decision to suspend the last peace deal
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to persuade Mordechai to stay, Netanyahu held
talks with him Sunday morning, but no results were achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Likud central committee will convene later Sunday night to
decide a date for internal elections during which the party leader
and its Knesset list would be decided.

CAIRO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemeni Minister of Planning and Development Ahmed
Mohammed Sofan said the European Union has agreed in principle to
lift the embargo on Yemeni exports of fish to the EU states.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Al Hayat daily quoted the minister as saying that
meetings of the joint Yemeni-EU committee, held in Brussels last
month, had resulted in approval of a limited select list of Yemeni
fish-exporting companies to be chosen by the EU, and that more
companies will be added in future.
</P>
<P>
He did not identify the causes of the embargo and when it
started.
</P>
<P>
He also expects the EU assistance to Yemen to reach 36 million
ECU (about 40 million U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria's natural gas production by mid December,
1998, amounted to one billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Al Hayat quotes sources at the Syrian oil company as

Fawzi as saying that Saudi Arabia, which invested in 384
companies, ranked the first among Arab investments in these
companies.

</P>
<P>
The accord is obligatory to any Israeli government as it was

Arab League chief Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Israel's Likud-led government of evading the
obligations enshrined in the agreements signed with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced astonishment over Israel's evasion of
obligations under the pretext of early elections, wondering if
Israel would suspend dealings with the U.S., Jordan or any other
countries under the pretext.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord signed between the
Palestinians and Israel last October in Washington, Israel should
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After carrying out the first phase of the pullback, Israel said
it will halt the implementation of the accord due to Palestinians'
anti-Israeli rhetoric and failure to cancel the plan to declare an
independent Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
Arafat wrapped up his two-day visit to Egypt and returned home in
the day.

<HEADLINE> Annan Raps at Rebel Offensives in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Sunday lashed out at the rebels' refusal to put down their
weapons and called them to end their on-going military actions in
Sierra Leone, a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued on Sunday through Annan's spokesman, said
that he "condemns the refusal of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
and junta remnants to lay down their arms as well as their continuing
military actions."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who is extremely concerned over the latest news of
rebel armed activities in the West African country, voiced his hope
"to take this opportunity to emphasize the unacceptability of
attempting to overthrow duly-elected government by force," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He appeals to the rebels to lay down their arms at once and to
enter the peace process without preconditions," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as fierce fighting was reported in the town of
Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. The rebels have stepped up a
campaign of hit-and-run attacks since October, prompting the United
Nations to evacuate part of its staff from the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who temporarily ousted elected President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah, are still engaged in a drive to stage a political comeback
in the country, which was widely condemned in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Plane Crashes in Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 27 (Xinhua) --The U.N. special envoy to
Angola, Issa Diallo said here Sunday that a U.N.-leased C-130
plane was missing near central Huambo city at noon Saturday, with
14 people aboard having little chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Uninted Nations observers mission to Angola
said in a press release Sunday that according to the information
available from the Angolan government and the local
government sources, the plane crashed near Vila Nova
Town at 12 hours (local time).
</P>
<P>
The press release said that 10 U.N. workers and four crew
members were on the plane when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. obervers mission is trying every possible ways to
search for and rescue the victims though there is no news of any
survivors, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government troops and the forces of the rebel
UNITA are fighting fiercely in central cities of Huambo and
Kuito. It was reported that the UNITA forces have been armed with
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
But the press release issued by the U.N. observers mission did
not confirm what was said that the plane was gunned down by the
fighters of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
It said: "The U.N. observer mission felt sad with such
incident" during the Christmas holidays, giving no details about
the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
But Reuters Sunday quoted the Luanda-based Angolan state radio
as saying that UNITA shot down the U.N. plane Saturday as it was
taking off from Huambo for Saurimo.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Arab Political Parties to Condemn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 27, (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Sunday called upon Arab political parties to condemn
the recent U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In letters sent to heads of Arab political parties, Aziz, also
head of the ruling Baath Party's Foreign Relations Bureau, urged
them to condemn the U.S.-British air strikes which started on
October 16 as a criminal, illegitimate and unjustified aggression
on a member state of the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the U.S. imposed all aggressive resolutions on Iraq
under the cover of international legitimacy with the assistance of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world yield to America's will because of
international power imbalance, and Arab countries just accept
these resolutions due to their split, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that despite the aggressive nature of those
resolutions, Iraq cooperated with the U.N. Security Council and
implemented these resolutions with a hope that the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq in 1990 would be lifted after it implemented those
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said since April 1991 until the latest U.S.-British
aggression, Iraq has destroyed all the banned weapons, all
factories, establishments, equipment and apparatuses that U.N. arms
inspectors asked Iraq to destroy.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors inspected thousands of sites all over
Iraq including factories, Ministry of Defense, Republican Guards
units, security systems, civil and military intelligence,
ministries, universities and scientific institutes, citizens'
houses and farms, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He added that arms monitoring systems were set up on 588 sites
in which cameras and surveillance systems were put up, and more
than 120 inspectors work in these systems.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that despite all the above-mentioned work, the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) did not declare that its mission
was over.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain not only impose no-fly zones in the south
and north of Iraq, but also call for overthrowing Iraq's national
regime with wicked Zionist plans to divide Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called for further Arab support for lifting the
eight-year-old economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> S. African Deputy President Warns Against Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki Sunday sent a strong warning to South
Africans against the misuse of the country's newly found
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Political liberty did not mean freedom to rape, to steal other
people's property, to stay away from work or to do as one
pleased, Mbeki said at a rally in Idutywa in the Eastern Cape.
</P>
<P>
He said it was sad to note that the advent of democracy had
seen a general decline of moral values, reported the South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Today we have among members of the African National
Congress (ANC) town mayors and councillors who aspire to
leadership positions."
</P>
<P>
"Not because they are committed to serve their communities but
because they want to line their pockets with ill-found financial
reaches."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who is ANC president, appealed for political discipline
among members of the organization. The ANC should make 1999 a
year of change, a year in which change was sought even in the
manner the country was ruled, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rally at Mbeki's birth place in Ngcingwana village is a
coming-home celebration organized by his tribal clan before he
takes over from President Nelson Mandela as executive head of the
country next year.

<P>
Los Angeles, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The smallest of the
Houston octuplets died this Sunday morning from heart and lung
failure, according to Texas Children's Hospital where the baby and
her siblings have been under care.
</P>
<P>
The baby was the fifth of the octuplets born to a
Nigerian-American couple on December 20. She weighed only 320
grams at birth.
</P>
<P>
Her condition began to deteriorate significantly Saturday
afternoon, when doctors moved her from a conventional ventilator
to an oscillator in an attempt to improve her blood oxygenation,
said the hospital in an online press briefing. Despite that, her
oxygen levels remained poor and she began to suffer episodes of
low heart rates. Attempts to reestablish normal heart rates with
medication and chest compressions were unsuccessful, the hospital
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hospital said, the youngest of the octuplets is
in critical condition after undergoing abdominal surgery yesterday
to repair an intestinal perforation. The firstborn of the
octuplets and the firstborn boy are also in critical condition and
breathing with the assistance of a ventilator. Other four babies
are all listed in critical condition, but are breathing on their
own, the hospital said.

LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit
could begin the New Year with a multi-million pound spending
spree.
</P>
<P>
He has been linked with moves for fellow Dutchman Ronald de
Boer,former England international Steve Stone and French defender
Didier Domi.
</P>
<P>
It follows the collapse of the proposed 5.2 million pounds
purchase of AC Milan winger Ibrahim Ba, after a long-standing
knee problem was revealed by his medical.
</P>
<P>
Gullit has refused to name names, but expects to complete at
least one deal in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Something good is happening. I can't say yet but we
have made a breakthrough in the transfer market.
</P>
<P>
"I've worked hard this week and agreed a fee for a player. I
hope I'll be able to announce something very soon, but it is now
down to a medical."
</P>
<P>
De Boer was a member of the Dutch squad which reached the
World Cup semi-finals in the summer, but he and twin brother
Frank were involved in a stand-off with Ajax Amsterdam over the
club's refusal to allow them to move to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Nottingham Forest midfielder Stone is a native of the
north-east, having been born at nearby Gateshead.
</P>
<P>
Gullit is reportedly willing to pay 5m for him, an offer which
Forest counterpart Dave Bassett may be willing to accept to
finance team-strengthening plans of his own.
</P>
<P>
Full-back Domi currently plays for Paris St Germain but a 3m
deal is thought to be close to completion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Four Iraqi soldiers were
killed and seven others injured in U.S. missile attacks on
Monday, said an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said U.S. war planes flying from Turkey violated
Iraqi air space in the so-called no-fly zone in the north of Iraq
and launched missiles at Iraqi air defense positions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that at
10:25 a.m. local time, enemy planes violated Iraqi airspace in
the north and flew close to Iraqi air defense positions.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 1:37 p.m., enemy planes violated Iraqi air
space again and flew to the same area and launched missiles at
Iraqi air defense positions. Iraqi soldiers fought back
courageously, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War touched off by Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, the U.S. and Britain set up no-fly zones in the north and
south of Iraq with a claimed aim of protecting Kurdish minorities
in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Iraqi
government's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan said on Sunday that
Iraq would not recognize the no-fly zones and would fire on enemy
planes violating Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
He said the no-fly zones were set up by the U.S. and Britain
unilaterally and without the authorization of the U.N. Security
Council.

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Monday called on members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) to try to solve their conflicts through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Armenian
counterpart Vartan Oskanyan following their talks, Ivanov said
Russia was interested in full and final resolution of any
conflict situations on the territory of CIS, because this is in
line with Russia's national, strategic and long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov stressed that "speculations about Russia's alleged
interest in the maintenance of tension in various regions for the
sake of preserving its presence or its influence there are
absolutely groundless."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the critical assessment by Azerbaijan of
Russian-Armenian military cooperation, Ivanov said, "the existing
suspicions will gradually vanish along with the advance towards
the settlement of the remaining problems."
</P>
<P>
Azeri Foreign Minister Tofik Zulfagarov, who visited Moscow
on December 23, has expressed concern over Russia's perceived
expansion of military and technical ties with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said "when suspicions arise in anybody's mind, they
should be moved." "We have the right to discuss any problems and
to remove the suspicions that may arise, using the way of a
dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Vartan Oskanyan, on his part, noted that Armenian-Russian
military cooperation "is not directed in any way against any
third country." It is absolutely transparent and is fully kept
within the framework of European cooperation on conventional
armaments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian foreign minister arrived in Russia for a working
visit on Sunday and is expected to meet with Russian First Deputy
Prime Minister Vadim Gustov and the Russian president's envoy in
negotiation on settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Yuri
Yukalov.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh erupted in 1988 and has remained one of
Armenia's major problems. The international community, primarily
Russia, has been working to secure a political settlement of the
conflict.

Visiting Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee signed the agreement after
they gave instructions to respective officials to overcome

</P>
<P>
It envisages annual review and safeguards, including a negative
list, to ensure minimum 35 percent value-addition of imports to
prevent third country products flooding markets in either country.
The loss in revenue as a result of tariff reduction would be made
up by additional excise accruals through increased exports.

The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding for
establishment of India-Sri Lanka foundation to promote interaction

censure should be considered only after a speedy impeachment

President Bill Clinton from office.
</P>

 There is, however, widespread agreement among Republicans
and Democrats that any trial should be quick, given that senators
of both parties widely agree that there's little chance that the
chamber will vote to convict and remove Clinton.

he does not agree to try Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the two
remaining top Khmer Rouge leaders who defected to the royal
government last Friday.
</P>
<P>
 "It is the best way to solve the problem in our own way. The
foreign interventions should be ended. Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea returned to the society only as ordinary people. So I
believe the Khmer Rouge can not stage a comeback," said Hun Sen.

 JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
confronted with more challenges from the right wing Monday as a
hard-line member of his coalition quitted the Likud and declared
his candidacy for the premiership in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
 Benny Begin, the son of Likud founder Menachem Begin,
announced that he will form a new party that will flank the Likud
from the right in the elections. He once served as science
minister in Netanyahu's government but resigned over differences
in ideology and personality.

 A hard-line lawmaker, Begin accused Netanyahu of turning his
back to the credo of the Likud by signing a peace agreement with
the Palestinians, saying he did not see essential difference
between the Likud, the opposition Labor Party and centrist
parties. (Israel-Premiership)

<HEADLINE> Low-Tar Cigarettes May Be Less Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A new test revealed that
low-tar cigarettes may actually cause more heart and lung damages
than regular cigarettes, because smokers inhale and smoke more
after switching to low-tar brands.
</P>
<P>
The test, developed by Canada's British Columbia health
researchers, showed that smokers take deeper and more puffs after
they switch to the so-called mild cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they are not doing themselves any health favors
by changing to low-tar brands.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Health officials said the new test showed tobacco
companies have tricked smokers into thinking a switch would
reduce the risks to their health.
</P>
<P>
They add this underscores the need for clearer warnings on
cigarette packaging, and urge tobacco companies to publicize the
latest research result on low-tar cigarettes as well as the
cigarette ingredients.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accident Explosion Kills 18, Injures Nearly 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A major explosion caused by a
traffic accident Saturday afternoon claimed 18 lives and injured
nearly 100 in Dingyuan County in east China's Anhui Province,
local authorities announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place on December 26 at around 3:00 pm at
Zhongxin Village in Dingyuan County, some 65 kilometers from the
provincial capital of Hefei, when a mini-bus carrying nine
passengers crashed into a cargo van loaded with 60,000 detonators
and 40,000 meters of fuse, according to the report of a local
authority.
</P>
<P>
Both the mini-bus and the van caught fire after the crash, and
the passengers' calls for help brought rescue efforts from several
hundred villagers and passers-by, who had no idea of the dangerous
cargo aboard the van, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The volunteer rescuers managed to extinguish the fire on the
bus with water, and helped the injured passengers to get out, but
the fire on the van burned out of control after about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
While several dozen people gathered around the van, trying to
push it away from the bus, a seriously injured man escaped from
the burning cabin and told them about the explosives. However, the
blast occurred before everyone could escape, killing 17 on the
spot and leaving some 100 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The report said the injured were rushed to a nearby hospital,
where one seriously wounded victim died. There are now 63 people
still in the hospital undergoing further treatment,
</P>
<P>
"There were many volunteers during the rescue efforts,"
recalled Wang Zhennian, one of the injured rescuers still in
hospital. "We saw piles of paper boxes on the back of the van, but
they had no marks or labels telling us what was inside."
</P>
<P>
"If the survivor on the van had not fled to give warning, the
casualties would surely have been much greater," said Wang.

BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) today announced that its four research institutes
of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, System Sciences, and
Scientific Computing will be integrated into one, under the name
of the Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences.
</P>
<P>
As the largest of the CAS's 12 pilot knowledge-innovation
projects for this year, this reform is aimed at establishing a
unified administration on the four institutes and introducing a
modern research institute system, said Xu Zhihong, vice-president
of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to build the academy into a national innovation
center of mathematics which will be on a par with the world's best
by 2005," said Yang Le, president of the newly-founded academy.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this goal, we will first reach the advanced Asian
level in the fields of basic and applied mathematics and system
sciences," Yang said, adding that the academy will focus on 13
major research fields, which have been recommended by the four
institutes.
</P>
<P>
He said that to meet the needs of major research projects, the
academy will employ 80 research professors and 100 associate
research professors. Researchers under the age of 45 will become
the majority at the academy within two years.
</P>
<P>
The academy has already chosen the first group of 60 research
professors from its original staff.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the academy will also increase the number of
"transient researchers" including overseas visiting scholars,
postgraduate students, and other scientists invited from outside
the CAS, until these are as many as the permanent staff.
</P>
<P>
The Research Institute of Mathematics was founded in 1952, and
the other three institutes, which originated in the Research
Institute of Mathematics, were all founded in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Refugees Continue Pouring into Botswana: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Botswana said Monday
that more than 1,700 Namibian refugees have crossed the border
into Botswana since October, with 250 arriving in the past 10
days.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of influx has slowed, but they are still coming,"
South African Press Association quoted Botswana presidential
office spokesman Andrew Sesinyi as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far 1,763 Namibians, including former Namibian opposition
leader Meshake Muyongowere, have entered Botswana, claiming they
were fleeing persecution by the Namibian government.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government has accused them of being involved in
a movement toward the secession of the Caprivi Strip from
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) was
reportedly advising the Botswana on the status of the Namibian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, the UNHCR said it was plausible the refugees
would face persecution if they returned. But Botswana hoped some
would eventually opt for voluntary repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The final decision over whether to grant asylum to the
Namibians will depend on recommendations by the Botswana Refugee
Advisory Committee, which is interviewing the Namibians.
</P>
<P>
Referring to living condition of the Namibian refugees,
Sesinyi said the leaders of the Namibian secessionist group and
their followers were separated to prevent political unrest.
</P>
<P>
However, "they are free to move, there are no restrictions
except that they must not make political statements nor
demonstrate," Sesinyi said.

<HEADLINE> Securities Law Not "Bad" News for Investors: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economist Li Yining
today reassured investors that China's first Securities Law is not
"bad" news in a time of sagging stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the Securities Law, six years in the making, is
expected to be approved tomorrow at the on-going sixth meeting of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the sharp drop in China's only two stock
exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, over the past five weeks is a
result of the draft which will ban the stock manipulation of
state-owned enterprises and the overflow of bank funds into the
stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also vice-chairman of the Financial and Economic
Committee of the NPC, noted, however, that the fluctuation of the
stock markets is related to the country's macroeconomic situation.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Law will surely help maintain a sustainable
economic growth, as it absorbs lessons from the Asian financial
crisis and takes into consideration China's actual situation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Securities Law will better protect the
interests of investors, since it is aimed at cracking down on
under-the-counter deals and fraud.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the law will help formulate the issue of
shares and bonds by enterprises to raise more funds for economic
growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the Securities Law will greatly benefit the
hi-tech industry, an industry ideal for investors because of its
great economic returns, along with its high risks.

Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in a bid to expand and enhance
bilateral economic and trade ties.

India and Sri Lanka Monday finalized a free trade agreement
paving the way for reduction in tariffs and enhanced economic

Differences reportedly cropped up between the two sides on the
issue of value addition to third-country goods by Sri Lanka which
may find their way to India and adversely affect Indian smaller
industry.
</P>
<P>
Indian senior foreign ministry officials said till Monday

between Kumaratunga and Vajpayee that a decision on it was taken,
they said.

(LTTE), the foreign ministry spokesman said that New Delhi had
already clarified its position that this issue had to be resolved
only by Colombo.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Faces More Challenges From Right Wing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) - Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was confronted with more challenges from the
right wing Monday as a hard-line member of his coalition quitted
the Likud and declared his candidacy for the premiership in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Benny Begin, the son of Likud founder Menachem Begin,
announced that he will form a new party that will flank the Likud
from the right in the elections. He once served as science
minister in Netanyahu's government but resigned over differences
in ideology and personality.
</P>
<P>
A hard-line lawmaker, Begin accused Netanyahu of turning his
back to the credo of the Likud by signing a peace agreement
with the Palestinians, saying he did not see essential
difference between the Likud, the opposition Labor Party and
centrist parties.
</P>
<P>
Begin was the third ranking figure in the Likud to
challenge Netanyahu. Another right-wing lawmaker Uzi Landau
announced Sunday that he will run against the prime minister
as the party leader, and former finance minister Dan Meridor
left the Likud last week to form a new centrist party.
</P>
<P>
Begin's declaration of candidacy came after Netanyahu got a
boost Sunday when two of his major potential adversaries,
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
announced that they will not challenge him for the leadership of
the party.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the prime minister said that efforts are being
made to persuade Communications Minister Limor Livat
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to stay in the Likud.
The two ministers are said "on the verge of leaving."
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman met separately with Netanyahu and
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak Monday, calling on the elections
to be held as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Likud and Labor will meet later
Monday to decide an election date, which Israel Radio said will
be possibly set in May.
</P>
<P>
For their parts, Meridor and former chief of staff General
Amnon Lipkin-shahak met for more than one hour Monday. Shahak, a
formidable challenger to Netanyahu, has expressed his intention to
join the centrist party Meridor will form, but said a decision
will not be made until the election date is finalized.

<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nine people in Hangzhou,
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, were arrested over the
weekend for the faulty construction of an embankment section on
the Qiantang River, the province's major river.
</P>
<P>
Five officials in charge of the project, including the chief of
the Hangzhou embankment construction administration office, Qian
Zhengzhong, and the general manager of the Hangzhou Water
Conservation Engineering and Construction Cooperation, Chen Yong,
were arrested on charge of bribery. The five allegedly accepted
money and gifts and awarded the project to the wrong contractors.
</P>
<P>
Lu Baoxin and three others who were responsible for building
the leeway in the Xiasha section of the Qiantang River were found
to have used mud instead of concrete as filling, and were accused
of endangering public safety by doing shoddy work and using
inferior material in a major construction project.
</P>
<P>
The provincial water conservation department has deprived
the Hangzhou Water Conservation Engineering and Construction
Cooperation of its right to participate in any construction
bidding and has required it to reconstruct the project.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of supervising the construction also
received administrative punishment.
</P>
<P>
The overall renovation of the Qiantang embankment began last
year, and many Hangzhou residents made donations to show their
support for the project. So far, the faulty embankment section has
been repaired.

<HEADLINE> Revised Law to Increase Securities Market Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators are
putting the finishing touches on the long-awaited securities law
to ensure that it embrace a wider range of market factors.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has
made at least six changes in the draft law concerning stock
floatation, listings and trading.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft stipulates that the special committee
responsible for examing and approving stock floating should be
composed of professionals from the State Council's securities
watchdog institutions and experts outside these institutions as
well.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee should vote on stock floating
applications and the procedures should be open and supervised "to
enhance transparency and fairness," the revised law says.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft grants companies seeking public listing the
right to choose their stock underwriters, instead of accepting
underwriters designated by the government, as the original draft
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The draft law prohibits state firms or listed companies from
operating in the market in the name of individual stock investors.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft also spells out harsher punishments for
violations. For example, violators will have to pay fines several
times the amount of their illicit gains.
</P>
<P>
The draft will be voted on tomorrow, along with the revised law
on military service and a decision on punishments for foreign
exchange fraud.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM: Priority Is to Maintain Lasting Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen said Monday that the most urgent task for the royal
government now is to maintain the lasting peace in the country,
asking foreign countries to stop interfering.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Council of Ministers, Hun Sen stressed that he
does not agree to try Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the two
remaining top Khmer Rouge leaders who defected to the royal
government last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the best way to solve the problem in our own way. The
foreign interventions should be ended. Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea
returned to the society only as ordinary people. So I believe the
Khmer Rouge can not stage a comeback," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great event in Cambodia that Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea defected to the Cambodian society. It is our great victory
and will play a positive role to the peace and development of our
country," added Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"We should bury old grudges and be oriented toward the 21st
century. Their defection to the Cambodian society means the total
demise of Khmer Rouge's political and military system which lasted
decades," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he confirmed that "Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea
and their families will come to Phnom Penh on Tuesday and will be
warmly welcomed with flowers and not handcuffs and prison."
</P>
<P>
Some foreign countries, human rights groups and opposition
party Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) asked to detain and prosecute the
nominal leader of Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan, and top ideologue
Nuon Chea when they arrive in the capital Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea defected to the royal government in
Pailin Friday evening and pledged to recognize Cambodia's
Constitution and the royal government led by Prime Minister Hun
Sen. They also asked to be allowed to live as common people.
</P>
<P>
The defection left Khmer Rouge's one-legged general Ta Mok
still holding out in the jungles with perhaps 100 loyalists.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Regret, Indignation over Tokyo Supreme Court Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed regret
and indignation once again over the erroneous verdict of the Tokyo
Supreme Court of Japan in the case of the diary of Shiro Azuma
regarding historical facts.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict of the Supreme Court has severely hurt the
feelings of the Chinese people," said Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu added that historical facts cannot be denied, and the
heinous crimes committed during the aggression against China
launched by the Japanese militarists cannot be obliterated.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma was a former Japanese soldier and witnessed the
infamous "Nanking Massacre" in December 1937.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks when asked to comment on the recent speech
by a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry concerning the
case, in which he claimed that this case was just a civilian suit,
not a suit related to whether the "Nanking Massacre" occurred or
not, or a suit concerning the complete picture of the "Nanking
Massacre."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry also said the
Japanese government believes that the undeniable fact is that the
old Japanese army killed civilians and engaged in pillage after
they entered the city of Nanking (now Nanjing).
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the remarks by this spokesman that the
heinous crimes committed by the Japanese army in Nanking are
undeniable facts. However, it must be pointed out that the case of
Shiro Azuma was not a common civilian suit, but an attempt by a
tiny minority of Japanese right-wing forces to deny the "Nanking
Massacre" under the pretext of judicial procedures," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Japanese side to face up to history and examine
itself, and to adhere to the path of peaceful development by
drawing lessons from history," he stated.

<HEADLINE> More Military Officers Promoted in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 300 Nigerian
military officers have been promoted before the end of the year,
media reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The related decision was made in mid-December at a joint
meeting of the three services presided by military leader,
General Abdulsalami Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Among the beneficiaries of massive promotion, 125 were from
the army, 95 from the navy and the rest from the air force,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the military authorities announced the promotion of
six officers, including the Chief of General Staff, the Chief and
Defense Staff and all service chiefs, from the rank of
major-generals or equivalent to that of lieutenant generals or
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
While decorating the newly-promoted officers, General Abubakar
said the promotion is proper and fit with the positions they
hold.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed at promoting the morale of the military,
particularly at a time when the soldiers are expected to return
to their barracks after the inauguration of the coming civilian
government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's military has been ruling the oil-rich west African
country for most of the time since its independence from British
rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Under the transition to civil rule program of the current
military government, an elected civilian president will be sworn
in on May 29, 1999.

<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A pictorial portraying the
diplomatic activities of late leader Deng Xiaoping titled "The
Charisma of Deng Xiaoping as a Diplomat" was published recently.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 300 photos were selected from the archives
of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and include those taken on his
first diplomatic missions in the early days of the Republic to his
last foreign tours, many of them released to the public for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
During an informal discussion at the Great Hall of the People
today, both current and veteran diplomats highly praised Deng's
contributions to Chinese diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan called Deng a world-renowned
strategist and diplomat, saying that Deng's idea that peace and
development are the world's two major issues has laid a
theoretical base for China's world strategy and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The independent foreign policy of peace that Deng formed in
accordance with China's development strategy has enabled China to
withstand drastic changes in the world and open up a new
diplomatic chapter, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Deng's idea of "one country, two systems" for
settling the issues of Hong Kong and Macao has accelerated the
process of reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that the pictorial, while showing Deng's
contributions to world peace, also reflects China's major
achievements since the founding of New China, especially in the
last 20 years.

<HEADLINE> 22 Million Nigerian Children Immunized Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- About 22 million Nigerians
children were immunized against polio this year in this most
populous country in Africa, according to Health Minister Debo
Adeyemi.
</P>
<P>
Under the National Program of Immunization (NPI) introduced by
the Nigerian government in 1997, the country held two rounds of
massive immunization for children on November 4-5 and December
9-10, respectively, the official New Nigerian newspaper Monday
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The NPI was initiated to replace the Expanded Program of
Immunization sponsored by the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), a global effort to wipe out polio, a disease that often
results in paralysis on children.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the response level to immunization in
Nigeria has shot up to over 90 percent, compared with 15 to 30
percent before the NPI was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The government had expected that about 25 million children
would be immunized during this year's National Immunization Days.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records deficit in 1998, Says Abubakar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has said that his government would record a
deficit of some 2.33 billion U.S. Dollars in 1998 and definitely
was going to run a deficit budget for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said on Christmas Day in capital Abuja that
if the current pattern continued into the new year, the
government might record a higher deficit of about 4.65 billion
Dollars in 1999, This Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the falling prices for crude oil, which started
soon after the Nigerian government announced the 1998 budget, had
messed up the government's revenue calculations for 1998.
</P>
<P>
In January, he said, Nigeria realized more than 700 million
Dollars from crude oil sales and 350 million Dollars from
royalties.
</P>
<P>
But in October this year, he added, due to the drop in the
crude oil prices and the unrest in the Delta Region (oil
producing area), Nigeria realized only 285 million Dollars from
oil sales and 83 million Dollars from royalties.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar stated that the Nigerian government might have
realized only about 6.99 billion Dollars in the first 10 months
of 1998 from the oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
Energy experts estimate that if the prices for crude oil
continue falling, the government would only be able to net in
about 7.45 billion Dollars in 1998, as against 10.89 billion
Dollars and 11.99 billion Dollars in 1996 and 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Winter is almost over now and that is when we expect the
price of crude oil to go up, but the reverse is the case," said
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a message from the multi-national oil
firms to their companies all over the world to use nine Dollars
per barrel as their budget line.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers said if the present scenario continues
unabated, the Nigerian government may have a very big crisis in
the coming year as more than 70 percent of the country's revenue
comes from oil sales.
</P>
<P>
The falling oil price has threatened the government's revenue
while the government will have to spend heavily to finance the
transitional program, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely there is no way we would have a balance budget in
1999. Definitely we are going to run a deficit budget," stressed
the head of state.
</P>
<P>
On how to resolve the dilemma, he said "we are looking into
the area of capital development, to cut down unnecessary
overhead, to minimize all the non-essentials, to cut down on the
number of conferences, trim the number of offices, cut down on
the number of vehicles and all that."

<HEADLINE> Estrada Reiterates Commitment to Saving PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Estrada
said here Monday that negotiations to save Philippine Airlines
(PAL) will reach a happy conclusion by January next year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Estrada said that there will be a settlement
with Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways, "hopefully by next
month."
</P>
<P>
"They're still negotiating and I hope they will settle it,
hopefully by next month," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated his administration's commitment to
saving PAL "at all costs," saying too much is at stake if the
airline shuts down.
</P>
<P>
He explained that among the airlines now operating in the
Philippines, only PAL has the capability to fly to all domestic
routes and carry passengers and cargoes to these destinations.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best to save PAL because if PAL closes, all
businesses will be affected," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora disclosed that
talks are still going on between PAL and possible strategic
partners, including Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cathay Pacific announced it was pulling out of talks
following speculations that a takeover of PAL management may
violate the country's 1987 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, foreign companies can own only up to 40
percent of any business firm in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Vinegar Promotes Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts
recently completed a study proving the efficacy of vinegar for
softening blood vessels, reducing swelling and fat levels in the
blood, and enriching vital energy.
</P>
<P>
The analysis revealed that vinegar contains 18 kinds of free
amino acids, including eight of which human organs are unable to
synthesize.
</P>
<P>
Septuagenarian Liu Zhengming, from north China's Shanxi
Province, worked in a vinegar distillery some 30 years ago and
claims he has never suffered from influenza.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the Qingxu Vinegar Distillery, the largest of its
kind in China, have been free of any form of cancer or heart
disease for many decades.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is famous throughout China for its long history
of vinegar production, including the popular Laochencu brand.
</P>
<P>
Contemporary local residents consume vinegar a beverage, rather
than resorting to the past practice of using the product simply as
a flavoring. Famous brand vinegars contain a dozen nutritious
ingredients, including honey, haw (hawthorn berries) and dates.
</P>
<P>
Drinking vinegar on regular basis helps lower blood pressure,
invigorate the functions of both the spleen and stomach, and
improves looks.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi residents began producing vinegar as early as the 12
century B.C., with most local families continuing the tradition
even today.
</P>
<P>
Vinegar production has emerged as a pillar industry in recent
years, with some 100-odd state and collective plants currently 50
product lines. Shanxi exports vinegar products to a number of
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
People from throughout the country trek to Shanxi to buy
Laochencu.

SINGAPORE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices dipped slightly
on the Singapore Stock Market Monday as liquidity continued to
remain thin with many investors away for their yearend holidays.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said trading almost ground to a halt as many overseas
institutions have closed their books in order to prepare for the

Analysts said the market steadily drifted lower after midday as
investors were disappointed by a smaller-than-expected interest
cut by the United Overseas Bank.
</P>

But they felt the Straits Times Index (STI) could climb to

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Expects 15,000 Tourists in 1999 from Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania expects to
receive 15,000 tourists from the Far East region next year,
doubling the number of tourists from that area last year,
newspapers here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zakia Meghji, the Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism,
told the media Sunday that the expected influx of tourists from
Japan, South Korea and Malaysia will increase from last year's
7,500 to more than 15,000 next year.
</P>
<P>
She said this move followed a massive promotional campaign
jointly undertaken by her ministry and the Tanzania Tourist Board
(TTB) during President Benjamin Mkapa's mid December visit in the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
The promotional exercise, she said, involved the holding of
tourism seminars by Tanzanian tour operators, investors and their
counterparts from the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Meghji, who accompanied Mkapa in the tour, said inquiries in
the seminars indicated that the number of tourists from those
countries would double.
</P>
<P>
"Our promotional exercise revealed that a lot of people in the
Far East do not know about Tanzania as far as tourism is
concerned. Many of them think that Mountain Kilimanjaro is in
Kenya," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many tourism operators are very interested in investing in
building luxury hotels in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Zanzibar, she
added.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed interest to establish direct air links
with Tanzania in order to promote tourism and trade through joint
ventures and aircraft leasing.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania should be aggressive in marketing its tourism
potentials in order to make it a world tourist destination,
earning the country much needed foreign currency," she said.
</P>
<P>
Though with the famous game parks including Serengeti,
Ngorongoro Crater and the highest mountain of Kilimanjaro in the
African continent, Tanzania attracted only a total of 392,000
tourists last year due to its insufficient tourism
infrastructure.

Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambians should not abandon the extended family concept
just because of the existence of orphanages and old people's
homes, Jane Chikwata, deputy minister of Community Development
and Social Welfare, said over the weekend at an old people's home
in Livingstone, the country's tourism capital on the southern
border.
</P>
<P>
The traditional family system in Zambia, where there are about
400,000 orphans, is facing dissolution with the society's gradual
westernization.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister urged the Zambians to be mindful of their
traditional responsibilities while embracing the western concept
of orphanages.
</P>
<P>
Chikwata also appealed to the citizens to get back to the
African extended family system, saying effects of poverty and
diseases like AIDS and HIV should not be used as an excuse for
the rising number of social institutions in a small country like
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"Social institutions like orphanages, homes for the blind and
homes for the aged are foreign concepts. The Zambians have
villages and extended families," she said.
</P>
<P>
The official described the abandoning of relatives as a
"shameful" conduct, saying those irresponsible for their
relatives needed counseling to help them refrain from such
conduct.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Continues to Decline in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
total exports and imports fell further in November, yet the
year-on-year rate of decline was less marked than in October.
</P>
<P>
This was based on the external trade figures for November
1998 released Monday by the Census and Statistics Department of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) fell by 9.3 percent over a year earlier to 113.1 billion
HK dollars (about 14.5 billion U.S. dollars) in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, the value of re-exports was down by 8.2 percent
to 97.9 billion HK dollars (about 12.6 billion U.S. dollars) and
that of domestic exports by 15.8 percent to 15.1 billion HK
dollars (about 1.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports also fell significantly, by
14.4 percent to 113.8 billion HK dollars (14.6 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the reason
why the export remained slack in November was mainly the plunge
in import demand in Japan and in the other East Asian economies
hit by the regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
More recently, exports to the conventional markets such as the
United States and the European Union were also affected by the
moderation in their import demand. Exports to the mainland of
China continued to fall, along with the setback in its exports,
the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Medical Employees on Mass Casual Leave in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 75,000 medical
employees in the Indian capital, New Delhi, went on mass casual
leave Monday, affecting health services in government-owned
hospitals in the city.
</P>
<P>
The move was to protest against the non-implementation of an
agreement between the government and employees on allowances and
promotion. Co-Convenor of the Joint Council of the Employees Ram
Kishan accused the government of going back on the agreement
signed on July 28 this year following an eight-day strike.
</P>
<P>
The council has also threatened to follow the mass casual leave
by a 72-hour strike from January 4 next year.
</P>
<P>
Although five months have passed since the agreement was
signed, neither the employees have been provided with the patient
care allowance nor have they set up a committee to look into
promotional grievances, Kishan said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Delhi Health Minister A. K. Walla indicated
that some announcements on the payment of arrears might be made
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Defend Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Monday vowed to defend the constitution with his life as
he rejected calls by the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in an interview that his administration would do
all it can to get the MILF to the government side and finally end
Muslim rebel movements in the south.
</P>
<P>
The MILF earlier stated that it would keep fighting for a
separate Islamic state in the southern part of the country,
despite efforts of the government to talk peace with the Muslim
group.
</P>
<P>
In asserting his group's position, Ghazil Jaafar, MILF deputy
chairman, said, "We will not compromise our demand for
independence," adding that their demand is "non-negotiable."
</P>
<P>
Reacting to this, Estrada said, "I have sworn to defend the
constitution when I assumed office as president... I will defend
it with my life."
</P>
<P>
He vowed to go all-out against the MILF, should the Muslim
separate group insist on pushing for a separate Islamic state,
even as he expressed his administration's determination to
"maximize all remedies to win them over."

<HEADLINE> Former Tehran Mayor Summoned to Face Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary
has summoned former Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi to face
the court ruling against him, a local daily Iran reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The summon was delivered to Karbaschi's home by a judicial
official on Sunday, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The former mayor must introduce himself to the relevant
judicial body within three days, otherwise he will be put into
prison.
</P>
<P>
An appeals court in Tehran issued the verdict against Karbaschi
on Thursday, reducing his sentence terms from five years to two
years and the period he is banned from taking public office from
20 years to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, publicly tried on charges of graft, was sentenced
five years in prison, a 20-year ban from holding government posts,
60 lashes of the whip and a fine of one billion rials (about
160,000 U.S. dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court also changed his lashing sentence to a cash
fine of 10 million rials (about 1,600 dollars), but it insisted on
a fine of one billion rials and ordered him to return 600 million
rials (about 100,000 dollars) to the public coffers.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's lawyer has filed a protest to the judiciary calling
for forming a public court to reconsider the case, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, a well-known reformist and a key ally of moderate
President Mohammad Khatami, has been a target of hard-line
political rivals who control the country's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was temporarily jailed in April, but was released
under an order from the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
after political disturbance occurred in the country following his
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Mideast Peace Process Deep in dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian-Israeli peace
accord, born in Washington on October 23, ended a 19-month impasse
in the Mideast peace process. However, it failed to prevent the
peace march from falling into another dilemma as Israel decided in
December to hold early elections, shelving up the accord
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that if the peace deal, called the Wye River
Accord, proceeds smoothly, Lebanese-Israeli and Syrian-Israeli
peace talks, the other two tracks in the Mideast peace process,
derailed in 1996, can be stimulated.
</P>
<P>
But the detente was short-lived, which was soon marred by a
fresh wave of bickers, violence and bombings. The hope-aspiring
peace deal struggled to keep afloat, but was spoiled at last.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government suspended its implementation on December 2
only after the first of the three troops withdrawals, the key part
in the accord, was carried out, following trading accusations of
breaching the deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Thus the world is lost about the fate of the hard-struck peace
deal and the whole peace process, in view of the
seemingly-unreconciling Palestinian-Israeli rows, the thorniest
issues to be settled in the final status talks, the uncertainty in
Israeli domestic politics with the collapse of the current
government and the unpredictable early election results and the
ominous deadlock in peace talks between Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the Wye River talks, U.S. president's national security
adviser Sandy Berger has said that "we got them back on talking to
each other." After U.S. President Bill Clinton's Mideast tour in
December, he said that the U.S. aim now is to keep that discussion
going.
</P>
<P>
But will they?
</P>
<P>
Berger answered: "there is no guarantee in the Middle East."
Reminded that Clinton had said that the peace process was back on
track, he equipped:" it's a bumpy track."
</P>
<P>
What Berger summarized may be the most certain and clear-cut
description that can be said about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Wye River Accord was the result of international efforts
and concessions made by both Israel and the Palestinians, ending
the impasse since March, 1997 when Israel broke ground for the Har
Homa Jewish settlement in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Envoys of the U.S., European Union and Russia have shuttled
between the two rivals and the Arab world has tried every means to
collaborate with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) while
pressing Israel to give up its intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Apparently out of fear that the process might collapse, the
U.S. efforts became serious early this year by raising a
specific proposal, urging Israel to hand over an additional 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in return for tougher
Palestinian actions on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA Chairman
Yasser Arafat were called to Washington on October 15 by Clinton,
where they were kept for nine days in intense talks before the Wye
River accord was hammered out.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, besides Israeli troop pull-out and
Palestinian crack-down on Islamic militants, 750 of the 3,000
jailed Palestinians would be released by the end of January, the
Gaza airport will be opened and a safe-passage route between
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza would be set up. The PNA
also promised to revoke the clauses in the Palestinian national
charter that calls for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, Israeli troops pulled out from 2 percent of the
13 percent from the West Bank, completing the first-phase
redeployment under the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
Four days later, Gaza airport opened. For the first time, the
Palestinians have their own airport. Meanwhile, Israel released
250 of the promised 750 jailed Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Things seemed to be going on smoothly, but from the very
beginning, some upsetting factors have already surfaced: Israeli
government was compelled to sign the agreement; the hawks in
Netanyahu's coalition had been threatening to topple him if he
went ahead with the agreement; Palestinian extremists who oppose
peace making with Israel launched terror attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
It was hard for Netanyahu to implement the Wye deal to its
letter any more because he, since coming to power, has been
adopting a balancing tactic, keeping the peace talks with
Palestinians alive to cater to doves while not making concessions
to anger the hawks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians were angered first after they found that most of
the freed Palestinians were common criminals, not political
prisoners as they expected.
</P>
<P>
Widespread protests burst out in late November in the West
Bank, which boiled over into violent street clashes, killing two
Palestinian youths and injuring over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the clashes on the PNA, accusing it of inciting
violence against Israel, and announced the suspension of the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the major mediator in the peace-making, rushed to the
region on December 13 to try to convince the two sides to stick to
the items of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu this time bucked the tradition to cave in to the
U.S. pressure, he stuck to his intransigent position though the
Palestine National Council, in the meantime, canceled the
anti-Israeli references in the Palestinian national charter.
</P>
<P>
For now, the peace process most likely entered another sag as
the agreement is believed to have been shelved when Netanyahu was
put to struggle for his political survival following Israeli
parliament decision on December 21, dissolving the legislative
body, abolishing the law of electing the prime minister directly
and to hold early elections within six months.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accord between the Palestinians and Israel, the
final status talks should have begun before may 1996 and the
five-year interim period for Palestinian self-rule will expire on
May 4, 1999. But up till now, the two sides are still locked in a
fight for land disputes.
</P>
<P>
Added to woes in the Middle East, peace talks between Syria,
Lebanon and Israel showed no signs of revival in 1998 due to their
disagreement over where the negotiations should be picked up.
</P>
<P>
Syria and its close ally Lebanon required the talks be resumed
from where they were left off by the previous Labor government
while Netanyahu's administration says they should start from the
very scratch.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying Syrian Golan Heights, a strategic plateau
it captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
It also set up a self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas'' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have vowed that they will not resume talks
with Israel until it agrees to hand back the Golan Heights and
unconditionally withdraw its troops from south Lebanon. And they
will not make peace with Israel separately as their disputes with
Israel are interrelated.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Undersecretary for Middle East Affairs Martin Indyk said
on December 18 that Washington is considering restarting the talks
between Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that once the talks were resumed, big progress
could be achieved within a short time.
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows the real intention of the U.S., the real power
broker in the peace process. But one thing is set for sure that
1998 has passed hopelessly. The hope is pinned on 1999 that talks
between Syria, Lebanon and Israel can be revived as soon as
possible and Indyk's predictions can come true.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Wye Suspension Augurs Ill for Mideast, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has warned that Israel's
halt to the implementation of the Wye River accord will lead to
collapse of the Middle East peace process and violence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a national daily Al Gomhuria, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said suspension of the implementation of
the accord is "very dangerous".
</P>
<P>
"This plays havoc with constant world efforts to establish
peace, stability and security in the region," Mubarak told the
mouthpiece of the ruling National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye River peace accord signed with the Palestinians
in October, Israel should withdraw from another 13.1 percent of
the West Bank in three phases.
</P>
<P>
After carrying out the first phase of the withdrawal, Israel
suspended the implementation of the second phase, citing
Palestinians' failure to stop anti-Israeli rhetoric and cancel the
plan to declare an independent state next May.
</P>
<P>
Israel's failure to honor the agreement "can result in the
collapse of peace process and plunge the region anew into a state
of chaos and violence," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader called on the United States, which brokered
the Wye accord, European Union, all peace-loving countries and
Israeli people to endeavor to keep the peace drive on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stressed the Palestinian people have the "historical
rights" to regain their land and establish their own state, which
will be secured in a just and durable peace.

U.S. Foreign Policy in 1998 -- Global Engagement and Expansion
</P>
<P>
by Yuan Bingzhong and
Li Hongqi
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1998 saw the
United States further implement the policy of "engagement and
expansion" worldwide by resorting every means, including the use
of force, to dominate world affairs in an attempt to extend its s
uperpower position into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
However, as the world order is developing irreversibly towards
multi-polarity, the U.S. has found it increasingly difficult to
carry out its global strategy oriented towards the new century.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the U.S. government set a strategic framework
for its foreign policies for the present time or even for the
next 10 to 15 years by formulating a series of important
documents, such as the National Security Strategy for the New
Century, the International Affairs Strategic Plan, the
Quadrennial Defense Review and the 1998 East Asian-Pacific
Security Strategy Report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. strategic objective is to continue the policy of
"engagement and expansion" set forth in mid-1990s. It is designed
to create an international environment favorable to itself, to
strengthen its ability in reaction to major world events and to
properly handle the post-Cold War security problems such as
nuclear proliferation, regional conflicts, transnational crimes
and environment protection. By doing so, the U.S. hopes to secure
its long-term leadership in world affairs and safeguard to the
maximum extent its economic, political and security interests
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Such a global strategy decides that the U.S. foreign policy
has always carried a tint of power politics, and the slump in the
world economy this year has lent a helping hand to the U.S.
hegemony.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, the East Asian financial crisis
continued to spread and worsen as economic recession began to
emerge in Russia and Japan, leading to a financial turmoil around
the globe. In contrast, the U.S. economy, although fluctuating,
is still growing, heightening the U.S. ambition to dominate the
world.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of weapons inspection in Iraq, the U.S., after
repeatedly threatening to use force against Iraq, finally staged
large-scale air strikes without authorization from the United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, it more than once threatened to use force in Kosovo,
proclaiming that NATO can take unilateral military actions
without the Security Council's permission.
</P>
<P>
In European affairs, the U.S. actively pushed the NATO's
expansion eastward to serve its own interests. Regardless of
Russia's strong objection, the U.S. Congress in April approved a
protocol that will admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
into NATO, a substantial step in expanding the western military
alliance to the East Europe. Earlier in the year, Washington
signed the U.S.- Baltic Charter with Lithuania, Estonia and Lat
via to bring them under the shield of the western security
system.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East, a strategic region of the Eurasian continent,
is regarded by the U.S. as a place of great interests. Other than
political factors at home, America's wish to continue to contain
Iraq and maintain its control over Persian oil and the strategic
passage in the region constituted the main reasons for the U.S.
to put pressure on Iraq and then waged a war against it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. took the initiative on the issue of Palestini
an-Israeli peace talks and succeeded in brokering an agreement
between the two rivals on the second phase of Israel's withdrawal
from the occupied land. But the objectives remain the same,
either by war or brokering peace, that is, to maintain the U.S.
lo ng-term strategic interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, the U.S. further expanded its engagement with
China while increasing security cooperation with Japan and South
Korea. After India and Pakistan challenged the U.S.
non-proliferation policy by conducting nuclear tests one after
another, the U.S. adjusted its Asian-Pacific strategy by
attaching greater importance to the Sino-U.S. relations.
President Bill Clinton's visit to China this year marked a step
forward to establish a "constructive strategic partnership" with
China.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, American policies also underwent constant
adjustment. Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit
Africa in 20 years when he toured six African nations in the
year.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. intensified its involvement in global affairs
in 1998, the growing multi-polarity put immense challenges to it.
</P>
<P>
First, instead of solving the weapons inspection crisis, the
U.S. air strikes against Iraq created a more complicated
situation. The U.S. met widespread condemnation from the
international community after resorting to force against another
country without the Security Council's authorization.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, on security issues, the U.S. and its western allies
have both coordination and cooperation and disputes with each oth
e r. Major Western European nations objected the U.S. request for
NATO to more actively engage in non-proliferation and
peace-keeping actions. Besides, the U.S. saw increased trade
conflicts with the European nations and Japan in 1998. The
emerging European Monetary Union will inevitably stimulate the
Europeans' desire to step out of the shadow of their big brother
in the new century, diminishing the America's role as a world
leader.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, more and more countries feel resentful against the
U.S. move to station troops overseas, behave as "international
police" and impose its own economic systems and values on others.
</P>
<P>
In short, the U.S. foreign policies are still in the process
of adjustment while the the three factors will significantly
restrain its effort to fulfil the global strategy.
</P>
<P>
It's predictable that, with the world heading towards
multi-polarity, any attempt to dominate the world would end up in
failure.

<HEADLINE> Research: Women Play Important Role in Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Women have played an important
role in building the ancient Iranian capital of Persepolis, local
newspaper Iran Daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 terra-cotta inscriptions unearthed in Persepolis
showed that some of the worker's groups were headed by women, the
public relations department of the Cultural Heritage Organization
announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There was no gender difference within the working class and
sometimes, women acted as the manager of a group, said
Dr. Abdulmajid Arfaee, an Iranian expert.
</P>
<P>
The inscriptions also showed there was an accurate and
complicated administrative system during the Archamenian period
(6th to 4th century B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The inscriptions, including bills, receipts, financial and
accounting reports showed that workers received wheat and barley
as their wages and those women who gave birth to children also
received horses and camels as special wages.
</P>
<P>
And there were regular workers on fixed salaries who were
summoned from cities to work for their employers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Persepolis was built during the rein of Darius the Great
(522-486 B.C.), but was burnt during the invasion of Alexander the
Great.

<HEADLINE> 54 Percent Zambians Ready for Female President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-Four percent of the
Zambian population is prepared to vote for a woman president,
Zambia's daily newspaper the Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a survey conducted by the Zambia Opinion
Research Organization (ZORO) as saying that of the 250 Lusaka
residents that were interviewed last month, 69 percent of the
women respondents said they would vote for a female president.
</P>
<P>
Half of the respondents maintained that the sex of the
candidates would not influence on their decision, while 20
percent said the candidate's sex would greatly influence their
decision.
</P>
<P>
About 36 percent respondents considered women to be weak,
while 23 percent said women were too emotional. Other reasons
cited for not voting for a female president were political
immaturity and that women are easily influenced.
</P>
<P>
The survey also noted that currently, out of 150 members of
parliament, only 16 are female, while 26 out of 1,300 councillors
countrywide are women. Both male and female respondents said
they were more willing to vote for women candidates as
councillors and MPs.
</P>
<P>
About 69 percent said they would be willing to vote for a
woman in local elections, while 64 percent would vote to send a
woman to parliament.
</P>
<P>
Only 38 percent of the participants said party's promises
influenced their decision on who to vote for.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the candidate's achievements, their
reputation and their social status are the aspects which most
voters look for in a candidate, with only six percent of the
participants citing tribe as an influencing factor.
</P>
<P>
The country's next presidential elections will be held in
2001.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Libyan Heads Discuss Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is now on a visit to Libya to discuss the Congo (K)
crisis with his Libyan counterpart Muammar Gaddafi, Presidential
Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Kivengere said there are some other
issues to be discussed, but the four-month-old crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is on top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The full details of their talks are not available yet, he
added.
</P>
<P>
A report carried in Monday's New Vision daily said the
Museveni-Gaddafi meeting follows hot on the heels of a Christmas
visit to Libya by DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, which has a large military presence in the DRC, has
been accused by Kabila of backing the rebellion in the vast
central African country, a charge Uganda has denied.
</P>
<P>
Both Museveni and Kabila eye Libya for support for their
respective stance on the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
In October this year, Museveni flew to Libya and held talks
with Gaddafi despite the U.N. air embargo imposed on the country.
He returned to Libya later in the same month to attend a meeting
which also drew the heads of Eritrea, Chad and Niger.
</P>
<P>
Museveni left for Tripoli Saturday, accompanied by State
Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi and other senior
officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president
Kenneth Kaunda criticized the government policies in the
country's Northern Province on Sunday, saying that his United
National Independence Party (UNIP) will use the local government
elections as a launch pad for the second liberation of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Chinsali of the province, Kaunda said he
cannot sit by and let Zambia go to ruins because of misguided
leadership, The Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted him as saying that the second
liberation is aimed at freeing the country from poverty which has
come as a result of economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
"This government has no direction. Education is now for the
rich. The young in Zambia have no future," he said.
</P>
<P>
At another rally in the province he said he does not fear
being arrested again for the second liberation of his country.
</P>
<P>
In Isoka of the province Kaunda said on Saturday that the
struggle to wrestle power from the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) will not be violent as the wind has
already started blowing.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, MMD leader, president Frederick Chiluba, called
on Zambians to vote for MMD in the local government elections to
be held on December 30.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba appealed to his countrymen to give his government a
little more time to improve their welfare as the rampant poverty
in the country could not be solved overnight.
</P>
<P>
After his release last June Kaunda said he will retire from
party politics.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested on December 25 of 1997 for alleged
involvement in the coup attempt on October 28 of the same year.

</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>

<P>
-- Egypt will become a big tourist country in a span of five years,

which harm would be primarily wreaked".

<P>
Highlighting Egypt's high-profile role to bring to an end the
crisis, President Mubarak said that a few hours after he had sent

<P>
MAPUTO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's animal husbandry
has been on the rise over the past three years, with cattle
increasing from 293,000 heads in 1995 to 500,000 heads this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of sheep has also grown from 435,000 in
1995 to the current 600,000, the Noticias newspaper Monday quoted
sources from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as saying.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the ministry showed that the output of
pork, beef and chicken has increased by 96 percent, 30 percent
and 105 percent respectively, while milk output has grown by 61
percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the increase to the implementation of
the country's animal husbandry development program, which was
initiated since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the government imports breeding stock and
loans them to farmers who will pay back the loan in money or
breeding stock when they have the offsprings.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique had a total of 1.3 million cattle in 1980. However,
years of civil war which ended in 1992 brought down the cattle
number sharply to 254,000 heads that year.

successful interventions in the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
With more and more countries of different standpoints drawn
into the conflict, the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo gradually escalated into one of Africa's largest regional
conflicts, making it even more difficult for a negotiated
settlement. Shortly after the Tusis started their armed rebellion
against the Hutu-led government, President Laurent Kabila accused
Rwanda and Uganda of secretly backing the anti-government forces.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the conflict from jeopardizing the stability in the
Great Lake region, the SADC foreign ministers' conference
authorized Zimbabwe, Uganda and later Sudan and Chad to intervene
militarily.
</P>
<P>
The African Unity Organization (AUO), ECWAS, SADC and other
African regional institutions also held a series of meetings to
help create favorable conditions for a peaceful settlement of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
African leaders, including South African President Nelson
Mandela, flew from place to place and spared no efforts in seeking
a way out of the entangled crisis. Although the desired outcome
has not yet been achieved, their efforts are already yielding
positive fruit. The conflicting parties undertook, at a
French-African summit in Paris in November, to stop hostilities
immediately.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the patient mediations by regional and
international organizations, pent-up rancors on the African
continent, such as those between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between
the warring factions in Somalia, are beginning to ease.
</P>
<P>
The AUO is due to hold an enlarged meeting of its central
organs in Burkina Faso in the near future to address Africa's
peace and security problems. Although one conference may not be
adequate to find cures for all these chronic and sometime
infectious problems that have plaqued the continent for so long,
the world community has reasons to believe that an era of peace
will eventually dawn on this continent, so long as its leaders
demonstrate their political will and wisdom for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> No Progress Made as NBA, Union Make Final Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The cancellation of the
NBA season appears inevitable after the league and union
exchanged final proposals today at a five-hour meeting which
ended with the sides still far apart.
</P>
<P>
"We advised the union that no further offers will be made,"
said NBA commissioner David Stern, one of just six
prepresentatives on hand for today's secret meeting.
</P>
<P>
With just 11 days before the proposed cancellation date,
there are no plans for further bargaining sessions. Stern, and u
nion director Billy Hunter now have met twice without making any
real progress since Wednesday, when Stern set January 7 as the
date he would advise NBA owners to vote to cancel the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Players Association, we presented a c
omprehensive proposal to the NBA," Hunter said in a statement.
"The league responded with a counter and we indicated to them our
willingness to negotiate further. Unfortunately, they were not
inclined to do that."
</P>
<P>
NBA players have been locked out by owners since July 1. Both
Stern and Hunter have taken time away from their holiday
vacations to meet twice in the last five days.
</P>
<P>
Stern called the meeting an "attempt to salvage the season".
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think there will be a season," said Jeffrey
Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer. "We've gone as far as
we can go. We're done."
</P>
<P>
Stern said:"In an attempt to salvage the season, we made
additional improvements in our proposal by offering increases in
the high-end limitation, the rookie salary scale, the percentage
of revenue to be shared with the players and the minimum salary."
</P>
<P>
The rookie scale still calls for teams to exercise an option
for a fourth year of a player's first contract or retain the
right of first refusal without exercising the option. However,
that year would be at an increase of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NBA's last proposal called for the basketball-related
income earmarked for the players at a rate of 52 percent, 52.5
and 53 percent over the final three years of the six-year deal.
Today's proposal increased the BRI by 1 percent in those years,
according to the union.
</P>
<P>
"We also proposed an additional exception to the salary cap
and accepted the union's 10 percent limitation on the escrow
agreement,"Stern added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a "middle-class" exception retained from the
last proposal, the NBA added a $1 million bi-annual exception
that had been part of the last agreement.
</P>
<P>
In each of its last two proposals, the NBA softened its
stance on the escrow package, which now calls for up to 10
percent of player salaries to potentially cover any amount of
total salaries above the BRI in the deal's final three years.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this was not enough for the union," Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
The exact concessions offered by the union weren't
clear,although the players were thought to have changed their
offer on a maximum salary to include all players with less than
nine years'experience instead of seven years' experience.
</P>
<P>
The union said Hunter will discuss the union's latest pro
posal in detail Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Stern, deputy commissioner Russ
Granik, and special assistant Bob Lanier, and union's
representatives Hunter, president Patrick Ewing, and chief
outside lawyer Jeffrey Kessler.
</P>
<P>
No further talks are scheduled, and a deal must be made by
mid-January to salvage a 45 to 50-game schedule.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Province to Redouble Levee Reinforcement Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan
Province, which suffered from the worst damage during heavy summer
flooding, will allocate five billion yuan and redouble efforts to
reinforce water conservation projects over the winter.
</P>
<P>
The province learned a painful lesson during summer flooding
when the vulnerability of some levees and water channels was
readily apparent due to the shrinking containment capacities
of rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The province has banned land reclamation from the Dongting Lake
which has shrunk due to encroaching farmland. The move, which
will involve the relocation of some nearly 200,000 people, will
increase the water surface of Dongting Lake by 1,900 sq.km. and
the storage capacity by 10 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province will complete afforestation projects
on 6,600 ha. by the end of the next year in an effort to
significantly reduce soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Rake in $233 Million in Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government expects
to raise 14 billion Shillings (233 million U.S. Dollars) in
revenue collection in December, as stringent fiscal and monetary
measures implemented since July begin to show results.
</P>
<P>
The measures were introduced in the 1998/99 (July/June) budget
to reduce expenditure to levels consistent with revenue receipts,
the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Customs &AMP; Excise Department brought in the bulk of the
revenue for the month with 6.5 billion Shillings (108.3 million
Dollars), followed by the Income Tax Department at 5.9 billion
Shillings (98.3 million Dollars) and Value Added Tax at 1.6
billion Shillings (26.6 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government and analysts seem agreed that if the targets
set for December are met, it will imply that government revenues
are on course to meet their second quarter target in the current
financial year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
This has been a bone of contention between the Kenyan
government and international monetary organizations, with Nairobi
being accused of not tightening revenue collection because of
corruption and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
Governmental receipts improved in the first quarter of the
1998/99 fiscal year to 42.6 billion Shillings (710 million
Dollars) from 40.2 billion Shillings (670 million Dollars) in the
same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Among measures adopted by Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae is
the creation of the new positions of financial controllers and
their posting to all ministries and departments two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to achieve a balanced budget,
reduce government borrowing requirements and start to repay the
current stock of short-term Treasury Bills.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Yangtze River Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province plans substantial environmental improvements in 14
counties in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Related counties sustained heavy damage during this summer's
record flooding.
</P>
<P>
The province will earmark initial central government and local
funding totalling 200 million yuan (24.15 million U.S. dollars)
for erosion control and environmental improvement projects in the
counties.
</P>
<P>
The environmental projects will focus on afforestation,
protecting afforested mountain areas, river purification and the
closure of small factories and mines which create serious
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Excessive logging in virgin forests, illegal mining and the
lost of forest areas to encroaching farmland have adversely
impacted the environment in the Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
Erosion has spread from 60,000 sq.km. in the 1950s to some
110,000 sq.km., with over 600 million tons of silt flowing into
the Three Gorge Dam area on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Experts have, at least in part, attributed this year's heavy
summer flooding to poor ecological conditions in the upper reaches
of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province led the nation in banning logging in virgin
forests on October 1 as part of an extensive effort to prevent the
Yangtze from becoming the country's second Yellow River.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Revises Levy Rates on Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday announced
a revision of levy rates on foreign workers effective from January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The rates for sectors such as export-oriented manufacturing and
construction in Peninsular Malaysia are reduced to 1,200 ringgit
(316 U.S. dollars) a year from the present 1,500 ringgit (395
dollars), Deputy Home Minister Mohamed Tajol Rosli Ghazali said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan, East Malaysia, the
foreign workers levy for the sectors is cut to 960 ringgit (253
dollars) a year from the present 1,500 ringgit (395 dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the revised rates will not cover the two sectors of
domestic help and plantations, where there are a large number of
foreign workers and the levy is maintained at 360 ringgit (95
dollars) a year, the deputy minister announced in a statement
issued here.
</P>
<P>
The reduced levy rates will benefit more than 1 million foreign
workers in the country and their employers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign workers in Malaysia are mostly from Indonesia,
Bangladesh and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Tajol Rosli said the decision to revise the rates was made
following appeals to the government by employers and foreign
workers for help in view of the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has also agreed to categorize activities
in agriculture, animal rearing, fisheries, logging, mining and
quarrying in the plantations sector.

<HEADLINE> Commission Urges Improved Project Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC) issued a Sunday circular urging Yunnan
Province to conduct a thorough investigation and punish those
responsible for poor quality projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Communications has urged all
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities to inspect the
quality of infrastructure projects and adopt measures to remove
hidden dangers, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC plans to dispatch quality inspection teams in
mid-January 1999 to inspect key state projects. Projects failing
to operate in accordance with operational procedures or which
otherwise fail to fulfill quality standards will be subject to the
lose of state funding.
</P>
<P>
The circular cited two projects in Yunnan and one in Liaoning
Province as striking examples of violations of state bid
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming City Bureau of Communications built the 72-km
Kunming-Luquan Highway in Yunnan Province at a cost of 377 million
yuan. However, the highway was filled with potholes and cracks
only 18 days after opening to traffic in May.
</P>
<P>
An ensuing investigation revealed that contracts used
substandard cement and an inferior mixture of stone and sand on
the project. The low quality work cost the state an additional 100
million yuan in reconstruction funds.
</P>
<P>
The Qingyanghe Bridge on the Shenyang-Siping Expressway in
northeast China's Liaoning Province was cited as another example
of low quality construction. Fatal traffic accidents occurred on
the bridge due to collapsed sections resulting from the use of
inferior cement and insufficient reinforcement beams.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in today's "People's Daily" called on all
localities and departments to draw lessons from the poor quality
projects, adopt strict requirements for project quality, improve
engineering supervision systems and render punishment to parties
engaging in fraudulent acts.

Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Guinea-Bissau, the Comoros and
between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
These conflicts derailed African states' pains-taking efforts
to rejuvenate their economies and frustrated their ambition to
boost their shares in the global economy and their voice in world
politics.
</P>
<P>
It is tragic that fighting, after decades of independence of
these countries, still haunts and hinders their development.
</P>
<P>
It has become a common belief among most African countries that
these conflicts, influencing the neighboring nations or the whole
continent, must be addressed with concerted and coordinated
efforts of all the countries concerned or the whole African
community.
</P>
<P>
That is why African international organizations have carried
out numerous diplomatic mediations and military interventions in
the passing year.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, most of these efforts have attained the
desired goals, but more remained to be made before peace and
prosperity bloom on this old continent.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, a tranquil, tiny enclave country within South Africa,
was plunged into turmoil in May. At the request of the Lesotho
government, South Africa and Botswana, on a mandate of the South
African Development Community (SADC), sent troops into Lesotho and
quickly put out the armed turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by the SADC, the Lesotho government and opposition
parties later reached agreement on holding new general elections
within the following 15 to 18 months, bringing peace back to the
south African state.
</P>
<P>
The end of Guinea-Bissau's conflict is another example of
Africa's successful collective peace-keeping efforts. The conflict
had broken out in June and turned hundreds of thousands of people
into refugees.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's New Ministers Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ten newly appointed
ministers were sworn in Monday, bringing into operation Nepal's
new tripartite government designed for general elections by
March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the presence of King Birendra, Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala administered the oath of office to the ministers appointed
last Friday, a notice issued by the king's Principal Press
Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the Nepali Congress (NC) and
the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML),
the two major ruling partners, the objective of the coalition is
to conduct free, fair and impartial elections.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member cabinet comprising the NC, the CPN-UML and the
Nepal Sadbhavana Party is expected to be expanded later for the
inclusion of other parties wishing to enter in the spirit of an
all-party government for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The government, the sixth since the mid-term polls in November
1994, was formed following the collapse of the coalition between
the NC and the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML pulled out on December 10 after sharing power with
the NC for three and a half months. It alleged that the NC had
failed to abide by the agreements reached with it and other left
parties in August.
</P>
<P>
On December 20, the NC and the CPN-UML agreed to form an
all-party government for conducting "free, fair and impartial
elections" by March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The exact date is expected to be decided by the cabinet.

construction of the second phase 600,000-kw project at the station.
</P>
<P>
The city allocated over 300 million yuan in funding for the
local technology upgrading program during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also established a solid foundation for
development of a pressurized reactor nuclear power station with a
generating capacity of one million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The city's power generating equipment manufacturing sector,
which has grown into one the six leading local industries, is
expected to substantially promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The local nuclear power industry plans to generate an annual
output value of five billion yuan by the middle of the 21st
century.

The steps are a response to requests from the private sector
for the BOI to help support business rehabilitation, BOI Deputy

</P>
<P>
For example, companies that need to import additional
machinery to restore competitiveness would be able to do so free
of tax. Corporate income tax exemptions will not be extended,
however, because most of the ventures are not making enough
revenue for paying taxes.

<HEADLINE> India's Banking, Financial Sector Worst Affected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- India's stocks of banking
and financial sector companies have been the worst affected during
the past one year, 'Business Standard' said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The downtrend witnessed in this sector was largely attributed
to large scale non-performing assets (NPAs), of which many were
those of these financial institutions, have built up over the
years.
</P>
<P>
There is a fear among market players that some of these
institutions may have to face a tough time in the days ahead
because of their large exposure to companies in the commodity
sector. Also, the fear is that these institutions may collapse
under the weight of NPAs.
</P>
<P>
Competition among banks has increased and would continue to
rise benchforth. This coupled with the slowdown in the economy has
squeezed the operating margins. And, further competition would
lead to the situation of survival of the fittest.
</P>
<P>
Fund-based income has gained importance in the profitability of
the banks. Banks would have to be innovative as far as their
products and services are concerned, the paper quoted a latest
report on banking and financial sector as saying.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Formulate Policy for Proper Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
soon formulate a policy for proper land use in the country, The
Financial Express daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Agricultural Secretary A.M.M. Shawkat Ali
at a national workshop on "Land Use and Land Degradation Situation
in Bangladesh" held in Dhaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed policy would incorporate modalities of the optimum
land use, he said, underpinning the need for proper use, planning
and management in view of increasing pressure on land.
</P>
<P>
Low productivity in agriculture was not only due to degradation
but also due to other factors like agro-economy and the present
state of lack of harmonious balance in land distribution, he
pointed out while dwelling on the relation between land use in
agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
Land for housing, industry and infrastructure in Bangladesh are
now experiencing conflicting use, he noted, calling upon the
experts to find ways and means to strike a balance between
agriculture and infrastructure for ensuring proper land management
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural secretary, however, did not mentioned the
exact time for formulating the policy.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is one of the most densely-populated countries in
the world, with 127 million people living on an area of 148,939
square kilometers.

CHANGCHUN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in
northeast China has been sentenced to 17 years imprisonment for
taking more than 270,000 yuan in bribes, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Changchun City, capital of
Jilin Province, ruled yesterday in the case of Xia Peihai, former
director of the Changchun Administration of Industry and Commerce,
and confiscated more than 900,000 yuan worth of illicitly gained
cash and goods.
</P>
<P>
The People's Procuratorate of Changchun lodged a suit against
Xia in August on charges of bribery and amassing a suspiciously
huge amount of money.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Changchun tried Xia's case
on October 8, November 26 and November 27.
</P>
<P>
An investigation revealed that between January 1991 and
September 1997 when Xia was acting as director, he received more
than 270,000 yuan in bribes by taking advantage of his power. The
source of an additional 630,000 yuan in cash and goods in his
possession remains unexplained.

FUZHOU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Grain-deficient Fujian Province
in east China plans to expand agriculural production next year by
introducing a number of measures, according to Deputy Governor Qiu
Guangzhong.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said the province will work to increase grain output, raise
income levels for farmers, guarantee the grain supply, expand
modern agriculture and improve the living standards of rural
residents. Related efforts will center on stabilizing the
government policies on rural areas, promoting basic grain sectors
and intensifying disaster reduction projects.
</P>
<P>
The province will work to raise urbanization level of rural
areas, advance industrialized agriculture, improve cooperation
with Taiwan, increase the use of agronomic techniques, train more
skilled farmers, improve water and soil conservancy and tighten
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The province's 1998 grain output remained at last year's level
in spite a devastating summer flooding in the north and the
Minjiang River Valley, two major grain production areas.
</P>
<P>
The rural economy has enjoyed continued growth thanks to
development of the diversified economy and the good performance of
rural industries. The 1998 per capita income of farmers hit 2,950
yuan, up six percent on 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt to Share Half Loss in Public Stocks Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- India's Finance Ministry has
agreed to bear 50 percent of any losses incurred by financial
institutions while offloading warehoused stocks of public sector
undertakings (PSUs) in the capital market, the ministry's
officials said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has also agreed not to dilute its stakes in the
PSUs after the shares are sold to the financial institutions, and
no fresh float will be made till the shares picked up by the
financial institutions are sold in the market.
</P>
<P>
These were agreed during a recent meeting between the chiefs of
leading financial institutions and the Finance Ministry here in
connection with sale of PSUs' stocks to financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Finance Minister Yashwant Singh instructed the
financial institutions to take PSUs' stocks worth 50 billion
rupees (1.17 billion U.S. dollars) into their books by the end of
this fiscal year. These stocks were to be sold later when market
conditions improved.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that any gains made by the institutions through
offloading the stocks later would be shared on a 50:50 basis with
the government. At that time, however, it was not clear how the
risk would be shared if the shares were offloaded below the
acquisition prices.
</P>
<P>
The PSUs' stocks will be placed with institutions at a
20-percent discount. The financial institutions will be provided
the warehousing facility for a period of 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions have expressed displeasure over the
government's pressure for picking up shares of PSUs as a move
towards disinvestment.

<HEADLINE> Thai Military Officers Encouraged to Retire Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Some Thai military officers
will be encouraged to retire starting from June next year as part
of the Defense Ministry's cost-cutting measures, source from the
ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officers will include those holding ranks of special
colonel, special group captain and senior captain for at least
three years, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Incentives, including promotion to the ranks of major, air vice
marshal and rear admiral and a one-year income tax exemption, will
be given to colonels who voluntarily quit the military service.
</P>
<P>
The move is another step the Defense Ministry takes to improve
work efficiency and reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's restructuring committee has agreed to reduce the
number of generals of all armed forces, and only 75 percent of the
generals who retire next year will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
It has also lengthened the duration of the promotion of
military officers in which the promotion of a sub-lieutenant to
the rank of special colonel will take at least 23 years.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the proposed military restructuring plan, which
put the supreme commander and the three armed forces chiefs under
the permanent secretary for defense, has been rejected by military
top brass.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces has reportedly favored the proposed joint
chiefs-of-staff system.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the supreme commander, not the permanent
secretary, will oversee the joint chiefs-of-staff committee with
the chiefs of the three armed forces serving as committee members.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Found Throughout All Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS has now spread
throughout all Vietnam, the Vietnam News English daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National AIDS Committee (NAC) said in a report
delivered at a national HIV/AIDS conference in Hanoi Saturday,
that the identification of the first two HIV-positive persons in
the northern mountain province of Ha Giang indicated that the
deadly virus has spread from one end of the country to the other.
</P>
<P>
The deadly HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the virus that
causes AIDS (acquired immuno deficiency syndrome), has now been
detected in every city and province of Vietnam and is posing a
threat to the country's young people, NAC said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's first case of HIV was detected in Ho Chi Minh City on
December 7, 1990.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that with the two new cases in Ha Giang,
the number of HIV/AIDS cases detected this year in Vietnam had
increased to 3,482, 400 more than last year.
</P>
<P>
The report says 11,301 HIV/AIDS sufferers were identified
between December 1990 and December 25 this year, of whom 2,035
were AIDS sufferers and 1,090 have died.
</P>
<P>
Most HIV/AIDS cases were reported among people at 30 or
younger.
</P>
<P>
The report reveals that between 80 percent and 90 percent of
HIV/AIDS infection in the northern coal-mining province of Quang
Ninh Lang Son and the northern port city of Hai Phong were found
among the young.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem told the
conference that the spread of the deadly HIV virus has affected
the entire society.
</P>
<P>
He called on the entire society to provide more resources in
fighting HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Stability Applauded, Stimulus Awaited by Xu Haijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 28 (Xinhua) -- For the Thai economy, the year
1998 has been a year of joy and tear, hope and fear, anticipation
and disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
Thais are happy to see that the baht has been stabilized, but
they are frowning that the liquidity crunch remains in the real
sectors, especially for small and medium-size enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The stabilization of the baht, which appears settled at between
35 and 36 to the U.S. dollar, compared with its weakest level of
nearly 57 baht early this year, is seen as one of the most
important achievements the Chuan Leekpai government has made.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has said on
several occasions that stabilizing the baht and the financial
sector reform were the government's top priorities. Without
tackling these two major problems, it would be impossible to
restore the economy to health.
</P>
<P>
After the closure of 56 ailing financial institutions at the
end of last year, the Chuan government continued its effort on
financial reforms in 1998 by intervening seven unhealthy financial
companies.
</P>
<P>
The key to the financial sector reform is recapitalization and
a policy package was announced in August which would allow the
government to intervene in commercial banks' recapitalization
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Five of the 14 privately-owned commercial banks have been
nationalized while Bangkok Bank of Commerce has been liquidated.
</P>
<P>
The August package helped restored public confidence in the
health of the banking sector, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
They also said the crisis had taught the banks valuable lessons
and they would have to revamp their credit analysis to avoid
repeating the mistakes of the past.
</P>
<P>
All the reforms seem to be effective as the economy is showing
first signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are regaining their confidence in the Thai
economy as direct investments from January to July this year
reached 3.3 billion dollars, exceeding that for the whole of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The heavy burden of foreign debts, especially short-term debts,
has been partly alleviated. By December 10, the total foreign
debts of Thailand had been 84.7 billion dollars, compared with the
94.7 billion dollars before the government was forced to devaluate
its currency in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's foreign reserves, which was almost drained in the
defense battles against the speculators last year, were recovered
to 27.2 billion dollars in September this year, thanks to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)-brokered 17.2-billion-dollar
bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Praised as a model student of the IMF, Thailand has
successfully obtained loans from the organization through six
letters of intent.
</P>
<P>
Not only did Thailand get loans from the IMF, but also approval
of a larger budget deficit next year to stimulate the sagging
economy.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, stimulation is needed at the time when the financial
reforms are coming almost to an end. Now it is time to enter the
second stage of real sector reforms.
</P>
<P>
Though the Chuan government won praises for its achievements in
tackling the crisis, criticism remains in some circles that the
government has focused too heavily on reforming the financial
sector and has made little effort to get other sectors moving
again.
</P>
<P>
Masatsugu Nagato, country manager of the Industrial Bank of
Japan (IBJ), identified three conditions necessary to promote
recovery, but said only one -- improving the current account which
enjoys 15 billion dollar surplus -- had been tackled successfully.
</P>
<P>
The other two -- overcapacity and non-performing loans -- were
being addressed much more slowly.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 53 percent of the factories in Thailand are in
operation, while non-performing loans (NPLs) account for nearly 40
percent, or 57.5 billion dollars, of the total loans of all banks.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said one regret for the government is that it
did not move to push interest rates down earlier, which could have
helped to solve some of the NPL problems.
</P>
<P>
Even with a stable baht and substantially lower interest rates,
new investment has not been stimulated because productive
businesses can not obtain loans, said Chirayudh Vasuratna,
secretary of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
With high proportion of NPLs, banks are lukewarm to the
government's financial reform package.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin once hinted that tougher measures might
be taken to force them to apply for recapitalization support from
the 300-billion-baht (8.3-billion-dollar) fund the government has
set aside.
</P>
<P>
The money would come with strings attached: banks must speed up
debt restructuring as well as making new loans.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government predicted earlier this year that the
country will experience a seven to eight percent contraction this
year, while the IMF and other international institutions forecast
that Thailand will be "first in, first out" and bottom out of the
crisis at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Hajime Kuwata, president of the Japan External Trade
Organization, suggested: "The government needs to stimulate
domestic demand and once this happens, Thailand would be the best
place for economic growth of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) countries."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Ranks as World's Tenth Largest Container Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Projections call for
Shanghai, China's leading port city, to become the world's tenth
largest container terminal this year, with a total of 3.05 million
standard containers handled during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 21 percent percent increase over last
year.
</P>
<P>
Mao Guohua, an official with the Shanghai Port Administration,
said the port has enjoyed stable foreign trade in spite of the the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first 11 months of the year show the imports
increased by 6.2 percent on the 1997 period, with exports rising
by 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The port handled 247,000 more import and 260,000 more export
containers than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth has also been attributed to port's improved
infrastructure. The first phase upgrading project at the Pudong
Waigaoqiao Container Dock went into operation in July, raising the
facility's annual handling capacity from 590,000 to 680,000
containers.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Port has attracted increased worldwide attention, with
12 international container companies establishing offices in
Shanghai during 1998. Twenty of the world's largest container
companies have established operations in China's leading economic
and financial center.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai entered the world's top 20 container terminals in
1995, said Mao. The port has doubled its handling capacity and
entered the top 10 within three years.
</P>
<P>
Mao said the ports combined total for export and import
containers is expected to hit 3.5 million annually in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Enjoys Record Earnings from Expatriates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's earnings from
private remittances have topped 710 million U.S. dollars for the
first nine months of this year, a 12.7 percent growth over the
same period last year, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these earnings have come from the expatriate
community," said a Foreign Employment Bureau official, adding that
there is an increasing demand for Sri Lankan skilled labor from
many countries.
</P>
<P>
Private remittances have now become a major foreign exchange
earning source for the Sri Lankan economy and the expatriate
community contributes the lion's share of these earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East countries are experiencing an influx of
housemaids from Asian countries. The Foreign Employment Bureau is
therefore encouraging Sri Lankan skilled workers to go for foreign
employment.
</P>
<P>
A national policy introduced recently to register every person
leaving for foreign jobs has helped the bureau to maintain
statistics.

Significant questions remain over whether a deal for ce
nsuring the president can be worked out before a trial begins.

There is, however, widespread agreement among Republicans and

both parties widely agree that there's little chance that the
chamber will vote to convict and remove

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Expects 14 Percent Annual GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's first
Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in south China's Guangdong Province,
expects to generate 128.8 billion yuan of gross domestic product
(GDP) this year, an annual growth of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the city's Economic and Trade
Commission, Shenzhen is expected to enter the nation's top five
list in terms of annual GDP.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen used to be a small town, but its economy soared after
it became a SEZ in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Shenzhen's GDP was 196 million yuan, and the city's
annual growth rate since has been 32.25 percent, or 22.4
percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, this coastal city became the tenth largest city in
China in terms of GDP, and by last year it ranked sixth.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, the GDP in Shenzhen stood
at 114.14 billion yuan, and its foreign trade and export volumes
remained at the top of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that between January and October, foreign trade
volume for Shenzhen stood at 32.3 billion U.S. dollars, and export
volume was 18.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The per capita GDP for the city in the first 11 months this
year was 29,000 yuan, and the figure for the entire year is

<HEADLINE> Philippines Presses For Miyazawa Funding for PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has formally
requested the Japanese government to help bail out the ailing
Philippine Airlines (PAL) through the Miyazawa Initiative, the
Philippine Star newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance of the Philippines proposed the grant
of a loan of 150 million U.S. dollars under the Miyazawa Fund
through the Japan Export-Import Bank to finance PAL's
rehabilitation, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu earlier raised the
possibility of another PAL's shutdown if his government failed to
obtain financial assistance for the flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Japanese government still has to send words if
it is amenable to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said the aid falls under the objective of Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to help ailing firms struck by the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines expects to get at least 3 billion dollars from
the Miyazawa Fund of 30 billion dollars for crisis-hit Asian
economies.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old PAL grounded its local and domestic planes for
two weeks starting September 23 this year, weighed down by a
2.1-billion-dollar debt aggravated by a crippling 22-day pilots'
strike in June.

CHENGDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has been tough on illicit logging activities since
the promulgation of the province's anti-logging order at the
beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Forestry department said that since September 1,
it has handled 33 cases of violations of the order, with six of
the accused detained and one arrested.
</P>
<P>
"Most of those cases took place before the order was issued,
but were reported to the government by local people after the
promulgation of the order," said Yu Shufeng, a provincial forest
department official.
</P>
<P>
Yu attributed the reports to an improved environmental
awareness among ordinary citizens and the popularity of China's
forest protection project in the hearts of the people.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 17,000 forest-related cases occurred in the
province in 1998, the number of cases which took place after the

</P>
<P>
"We should be thankful for this diversity, and it should be

diversity become a trigger for division. And we must not allow
intentional attempts to divide the national unity," the president
was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Monday as saying.

mosques and churches in the last two months of 1998 in a number of
places like Ketapang, Central Jakarta, and Kupang, East Nusa
Tenggara province.

<P>
Leaders of both religions have condemned the accidents as
irresponsible actions and have said they have nothing to do with
religious conflict.
</P>
<P>
"In celebrating Christmas this year, I appeal Christians to
develop a harmonious religious life in the midst of the diversity
in our life," Habibie said, adding that "religious communities in

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Province Predicts 9 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province is expected to achieve an annual economic growth of 9
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
This rate is high compared with the national one, estimated at
8 percent by China's State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
A recent economic meeting of the provincial government
announced that Sichuan's total grain output is expected to reach
36 billion kilograms, 500 million kilograms more than last year,
though the province was severely hit by floods this past summer.
</P>
<P>
Projections show that fixed-asset investments will stand at 118
billion yuan, an increase of 24.6 percent over last year, and
post-tax industrial profits will be 4.2 billion yuan, accounting
for one-tenth of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show a marked growth in overseas investments in
Sichuan, reaching 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in the first 11
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Economists say the growth of Sichuan will be an strong boost
to the developed of China's vast western regions, which are less
developed than the eastern coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is a better developed and more open province than
others in western China, and the size of its economy is one-third
of the entire western region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that other provinces in southwest China are
also growing faster than the national average.
</P>
<P>
For example, Guizhou Province expects a growth rate of 8.6
percent this year, and the Tibet Autonomous Region, 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Reports Positive Effects of Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, December 27 (Xinhua) -- DaimlerChrysler said
Sunday that the newly merged group is expected to start its first
business year with strong increases in revenues, sales and
earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics released by
DaimlerChrysler, group revenues were up 13 percent in 1998 to 148
billion U.S. dollars, compared to the pro forma combined figures
for the former Daimler-Benz and Chrysler operations -- 127.1
billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Unit sales in the automotive businesses of the group will reach
a total of approximately 4.4 million. Of these, over 3 million are
from the Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and Jeep car and truck brands,
far more than the 850,000 units from the Mercedes-Benz and smart
passenger car brands, and 480,000 by the commercial vehicles
division of the group.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 earnings are also expected to reach "a significant
higher level" than the pro forma combined individual figures for
1997, DaimlerChrysler said in its first annual review.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler started confidential negotiations
about the merger in mid-January this year. The announcement of
completion was made in early October. Six weeks later the first
trading of its shares on the worldwide stock exchanges began,
after more than 98 percent of the Daimler-Berz shares were
tendered into DaimlerChrysler shares enduring participation in the
growth prospects of the merged group.

The number of employees grew by an additional of 13,000 to
434,000 worldwide in 1998. More than half of the workforce is
located in Germany, one third in the United States and the rest in
other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
"The coming year is expected to show the first substantial
positive effects of the merger," DaimlerChrysler said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pans Labor's Stance in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- With an eye on the coming
early elections, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday criticized the stance taken by his rival opposition Labor
Party in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering of the Central Committee of the ruling Likud
party, Netanyahu said that the former governments led by
left-wing Labor gave too much to the Palestinians in peace talks
but got nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that he would stick to the principle of
reciprocity, and that only after the Palestinians "give," will
they "get."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he would not go ahead with the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from the West Bank until the Palestinians met his
demands over issues concerning unilateral Palestinian declaration
of statehood and their fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In response, Labor leader Ehud Barak told Israeli TV Channel
One that Netanyahu was leading the country to a "disaster" and his
government was doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he would not make concession over the final
status of Jerusalem, adding that Jerusalem is Israel's undivided
capital.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli Knesset (parliament) passed the first
reading of a bill calling for early elections, which could be held
in a few months. Both Netanyahu and Barak have already kicked off
their election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told Likud members that he will
not run for the premiership. The hawkish leader hailed Netanyahu
as the best candidate to lead Israel in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat said Sunday that Israel was using the elections as an
excuse for not withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Israel had completely halt the peace process,
Arafat called on Israel to honor the latest land-for-security
accord.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu suspended the second stage of troop pullback citing
Palestinian violations of the Wye accord over statehood and
crackdown on anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Since the Wye accord was signed in October, Arafat has on
several occasions said he will declare, with or without agreement
with Israel, an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem
as its capital in May 1999.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Urge Speedy Impeachment Proceedings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Several Republicans of the
U.S. Senate say censure should be considered only after a speedy
impeachment trial, and perhaps only after a vote on whether to
remove President Bill Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
"We ought to vote on these articles of impeachment, and then
that is the appropriate time to consider a censure," Senator Mitch
McConnell, a Republican, said on "Fox News Sunday."
</P>
<P>
"Assuming neither of those articles pass, which is what's
widely expected will be the outcome... you sit down and you
negotiate the censure alternative," he said.
</P>
<P>
Significant questions remain over whether a deal for censuring
the president can be worked out before a trial begins.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, widespread agreement among Republicans and
Democrats that any trial should be quick, given that senators of
both parties widely agree that there's little chance that the
chamber will vote to convict and remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Without the 67 votes needed, Senate leaders then would "come up
with the strongest censure resolution there is," Senate Judiciary
Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican, said on CBS' "Face the
Nation."
</P>
<P>
Democrats, Meanwhile, are pushing for a strongly worded censure
to punish Clinton for his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans are insisting on trying Clinton on the perjury
and obstruction of justice charges passed along party lines by the
House.
</P>
<P>
Senators of both parties agreed on one thing during their
appearances on the Sunday talk shows: They, like most Americans,
want the matter disposed of swiftly.
</P>
<P>
Several senators on Sunday suggested that the trial conclude by
March, the traditional starting time for the full Senate's
legislative work.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has said the chamber has a
constitutional responsibility to at least open such proceedings.
