<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Reaches All-time High in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Business inventories in
U.S. rose by 0.4 percent in July and reached to 1 trillion U.S.
dollars for the first time, the Commerce Department reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. business inventories were unchanged in June after falling
0.1 percent in May. The increase in July, which was much larger
than many analysts had expected, matched the gain in April, which
was the largest since stockpiles grew 0.6 percent last January.
</P>
<P>
The department said that business sales jumped 1.2 percent in
July to 720.5 billion dollars, after falling 0.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The jump in sales was led by a 1.2 percent increase by
manufacturers and 2.4 percent gain by wholesalers. But retailers
rang up a small 0.1 percent increase after registering a 0.6
percent loss in June.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.39, down from
1.40 in June and matching the May ratio, which was the lowest
since the government began tracking the data in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The ratio means it would take 1.39 months to exhaust stockpiles
at the July sales rate.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing inventories edged up 0.2 percent and stockpiles
at the wholesale level rose 0.1 percent. But retailers posted a
1.1 percent gain, the largest increase since a 1.3 percent advance
in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Because of an inventory accumulation early in 1995, U.S.
businesses cut back on stockpiles late last year, resulting in a
drag on the economy.
</P>
<P>
But many U.S. companies began refilling their shelves earlier
this year which helped to spark strong economic growth in the
nation during the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Recent signs indicate the U.S. economy now is moderating, with
little evidence of any substantive inflation. Still, analysts are
divided over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase
interest rates later this month.

<HEADLINE> Industrialized Nations And Ozone Layer Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Industrialized nations should
increase efforts at protecting the ozone layer, this complaint is
once again heard today at China's first national conference on
ozone layer protection, which opened here.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed common knowledge that the industrialized world
has caused the problem of ozone layer depletion partly through the
development of CFCs, HCFCs and other similar chemicals, and partly
through the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption,"
noted Sam K. Ongeri, executive chairman of the Multilateral Fund
for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"The developing world, on the other hand, has been the major
victim of the negative effects of ozone depleting substances," he
went on to say, "since it was not and has never been adequately
prepared to deal with such negative consequences."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the industrialized nations have the
"inescapable responsibility" of providing financial and
technological help to developing countries to help them continue
to improve living standards for their people without using the
older, polluting technologies that destroy the ozone.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer was adopted in Montreal, Canada on September 16, 1987, and
the multilateral fund was established in 1990 to help developing
countries meet the costs of phasing out of ozone depleting
substances (ODS) that is called for by the protocol.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Yangzu, deputy head of the State Bureau for
Environmental Protection and director of the National Leading
Group for Ozone Layer Protection, developing countries will gain
substantial control over ODS in the next five years, thereby
increasing the demand for multilateral funds.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the United Nations Environment Program,
developing countries will need 3.1 billion US dollars worth of
multilateral funds to stop the use of such controlled substances
as CFC and Halon by 2010. "But some developed countries do not
contribute to the multilateral fund as planned," Wang noted. At
present, contributions to the multilateral fund amount to less
than 500 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, strengthening international cooperation, urging
developed countries to follow their commitments and the provisions
in the Protocol, and to fulfill their international obligations to
make contributions on time, is important," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Official Denies Poor Relations with Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bulgarian official
denied that relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia remained
stagnant, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Khristov said
after a meeting with Macedonian Foreign Minister Ljubomit
Frckovski last weekend that he believed Macedonia, like Bulgaria,
is also keen to find a way to upgrade their friendship.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides agreed to speed up
negotiations on establishing trade and economic cooperation. They
also fixed a timetable for a meeting between the two countries'
foreign ministers during the coming U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia's relations with Bulgaria, its eastern neighbor, have
been held back over the question of language. Bulgaria recognized
Macedonia in January 1992, two months after the latter declared
independence from the former Yugoslavia, but refused to recognize
the existence of a distinct Macedonian nationality or language.

<P>
ATHENS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary-General's
envoy on Cyprus Han Sung Joo arrived here today on the second leg
of a French shuttle tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
Han, who flew in from Cyprus, held talks with Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos and briefed the latter on his contacts
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks, han said "at this moment
we should concentrate on dealing with two aspects of the Cyprus
problem -- the return to the status quo prior to the recent sad
incidents and to continue to seek a permanent settlement to the
issue."
</P>
<P>
Tension between the Greek-Cypriot and the Turkish-Cypriot
communities on the island intensified after the killing last month
of two young Greek-Cypriot protesters by the Turkish side near the
UN-patrolled demarcation line on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"Despite tension and the feelings of regret that have been
caused due to the sad incidents, both communities show a
constructive will to prevent such incidents from breaking out in
the future," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said Greece would not enter into dialogue with Turkey
on the dispute unless "a minimum common ground" was defined
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Han is expected to visit Turkey following his contacts in
Greece on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Vows To Continue Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
vowed to continue its fighting against the Kabul government till
its fall, said reports from the Afghan capital today.
</P>
<P>
"Our mission to bring down the evil government in Kabul and
establish a truly Islamic state in Afghanistan will continue,"
said the Taliban's official in charge of cultural affairs, Amir
Khan Muttaqi, in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as the Kabul government and the Taliban, which
is sweeping through eastern Afghanistan, are preparing for the
next major battle to win control of the embattled Afghan capital
after the government's jets bombed eastern city of Jalalabad taken
by the Taliban last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official said that the air raid launched by the
government air forces left four people dead and several injured.
</P>
<P>
Jalalabad holds Kabul's main supply route between the besieged
city and the western Pakistani city of Peshawar. The road has
been totally closed due to the recent fighting.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said the Taliban's next target is Sarobi, a stronghold
of Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar which lies between Jalalabad
and Kabul, controlling the passage to Bagram, the only airbase
left under the control of the Kabul government.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul said the coalition government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and Premier Hekmatyar, who had been until June
based at Sarobi, has been sending reinforcements to the threatened
town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other reports quoted Muttaqi as saying that UN
special envoy on Afghanistan Norbert Holl has arrived in Kandahar
along with his delegation and held in-depth discussions with the
Taliban leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban held detailed negotiations with them,
saying that negotiations with the Kabul government would be a
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
"We are not ready to hold talks with them," Muttaqi said.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany to Solve Differences over EMU Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The high officials of France
and Germany in charge of economic and financial affairs will meet
Tuesday in the Bavarian town of Kempten to solve their differences
over some rules of the future European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The German Minister of Finances Theo Waigel, his French
counterpart Jean Arthuis, German Minister Economy Minister Gunter
Rexrodt, president of the Bundesbank Hans Tietmeyer and governor
of the Bank of France Jean-Claude Trichet will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Germany has proposed that in the future EMU, any member who
fails to observe the rule of keeping its public deficit below 3
percent of its gross national product (GNP) must deposit 0.25
percent of its GNP in EMU without interest for each point it
breaks.
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission, the executive body of the European
Union, has suggested a deposit of 0.2 percent of GNP, while France
said that sanctions for trespassing the rule should be "very
rare."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Germany also wants all future EMU members to lower
their public deficit to below 1 percent of their GNP by 1999, the
year when the EMU and its monetary unit "the EURO" is due to
begin working.
</P>
<P>
France, which is having much difficulty adopting an austerity
budget for 1997 in order to lower its public deficit to 3
percent,is still faced with the threat of social instability as
some calls have been made by trade unions to launch strikes this
autumn to protest the austeriry budget plan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is called before the finance ministers of 15
European Union countries will meet informally in Dublin on
September 20-21.
</P>
<P>
The EU monetary committee agreed earlier this month in to
endorse a pact of budgetary stability within the future EMU
mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Hungary Sign Historic Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIMISOARA, Romania, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania and
Hungary today signed a treaty aimed at resolving their historical
disputes and advancing their bid for membership of NATO and the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The treaty signed by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu
and his Hungarian counterpart Gyula Horn in the western Romanian
city of Timisoara, pledges that the two countries will never make
territorial claims against each another and will not threaten or
resort to force in their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This new treaty signed on Sunday, a result of five years of
negotiations, is expected to end political sabre-rattling between
the two countries and lay the ground for historic reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The pact guarantees the rights of the 1.7 million ethnic
Hungarians in Romania, who make up 7 percent of the country's
population and also guarantee Romania's borders.
</P>
<P>
Some minority parties in Romania oppose the treaty,
including the nationalist Romanian National Unity Party who
denounced the treaty as endangering the country's national
sovereignty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania, which
boycotted the signing ceremony, said the treaty did not resolve
the issue of the 1,500 Hungarian churches confiscated by the
communists in Romania in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Romanian President Ion Iliescu called the signing of
the treaty a major event with a deep impact on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
An accord to end strained relations between the two countries
is vital for both countries' ambitions to join NATO and EU.
However, the final text of the treaty leaves several sensitive issues
unresolved, including ethnic Hungarian demands for greater
language and education rights in Romania.

<HEADLINE> Noncommunicable Diseases Seen as World Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Noncommunicable diseases and
accidents are quickly replacing infectious diseases and
malnutrition as leading causes of premature death and disability
worldwide, according to a comprehensive study available here
today.
</P>
<P>
The new pattern was drawn up by an international team of
experts from Harvard School of Public Health, the World health
Organization and the World Bank after five-year study.
</P>
<P>
The changing pattern are caused by the aging of population
almost everywhere and more deaths related to accidents and the
growing use of tobacco, the survey says. Even new epidemics, such
as the spread of HIV-aids and the resurgence of tuberculosis are
being counterbalanced by advances against other infectious
diseases, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The study provides new statistics on "hidden diseases"whose
incidence is often unacknowledged in developing countries. The
diseases are mental illness and impact of injuries on national
health.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that there are 50 million deaths in the world a
year. Five million of those deaths are from injuries, both the
unintentional injuries, like road accidents and the intentional
injuries like homicide or suicide.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Gov't Troops Attack Taliban Near Sarobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government
troops today launched an offensive on the Taliban Muslim student
militia near Sarobi, 75 kilometers east of Kabul, said reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The report said that about 80 soldiers were killed during the
fierce fighting but nobody knew the casualties were inflicted on
the government troops or the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Sarobi, the major stronghold of Afghan Premier Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, is a hub of communication in Afghanistan and has a big
power plant which provides electricity for Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The government had sent heavy troops to defend Sarobi as the
Taliban forces, which captured three provinces in eastern
Afghanistan last week, were advancing towards Sarobi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Afghan government is trying hard to rope in
Rashid Dostum, leader of Uzbek militia which controlled seven
provinces in northern Afghanistan, to offset the Taliban
offensive.
</P>
<P>
The latest report reaching here said that a three-member Afghan
government delegation led by Interior Minister Younus Qanooni is
holding talks with Dostum in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Attacks Hungarian-Romanian Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 16 (Xinhua)-- A historic treaty signed
today by the Hungarian and the Romanian governments to pave the
way for reconciliation has met strong objections from opposition
parties in the parliament, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Baba Ivan, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF),
was quoted as saying that the MDF opposed the pact because it only
represented the narrow and limited interests of the two countries'
governments instead of their people.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers of Romania and Hungary, Nicolae Vacaroiu
and Gyula Horn, signed the pact in the western Romanian city of
Timisoara in the presence of Romanian President Ion Iliescu. The
treaty, agreed upon last month by Bucharest and Budapest after
five years of negotiations, ended a longstanding rift between
the two countries, but sidestepped the most sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the pact, the MDF demanded the government
cancel the signing, saying it would breach the agreement reached
on July 15 between the government and the parties in the
parliament as well as the representatives of ethnic Hungarians
living in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The national presidium of the Christian Democratic People's
Party called upon the government earlier today to renounce the new
treaty and renegotiate the text with Romania.
</P>
<P>
The party demanded that the rights for ethnic minorities,
expected by Hungarians in Romania and contained in other
international treaties, be added to the text.
</P>
<P>
The other two opposition parties, the Federation of Young
Democrats and the Smallholders' Party, have also repeatedly voiced
their opposition to the current Hungarian-Romanian Treaty claiming
it jeopardizes the interests of the 1.7 million or so ethnic
Hungarians living in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Romania and Hungary have long been strained
over the territorial settlement imposed on them by the 1920
Versailles Treaty which ended the First World War. The treaty cut
off some three fifths of Hungary's territory, including
Transylvania which was transferred to Romania.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today that about
150,000 Iraqi Kurdish people are approaching the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Red Crescent Society (IRCS) said that so far 75,308
Kurdish refugees had settled in five camps set up by the society.
</P>
<P>
The IRCS appealed to the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies for humanitarian assistance in
cash and relief operations for three months.
</P>
<P>
The IRCS said in a message that it has undertaken all other
costs, including transport, communications, personnel, packing,
which are needed for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
It also included tables, relief tents, blankets, ground sheets,
clothing, nylon sheeting, wheat flour, bread, rice, edible oil,
sugar, canned food and tea required for some 100,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
It said that all IRCS staff in the Tehran headquarters and 375
relief workers in the society's operating branches in the
provinces of West Azarbaijan, Kurdistan and Kermanshah are working
round-the-clock to provide relief services to the Kurdish refugees.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Iran's Interior Ministry said that the
Iranian government has spent 20 billion Iran rials (about 5 million
U.S. dollars) on relief service for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
It criticized the United Nations and other international
organizations for offering no assistance to the Iraqi
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Shelling Starts in South Mogadishu Amid Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy shelling was heard
in South Mogadishu last night after 46 days of calmness since the
death of Somalia's late warlord General Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Kulmiye, spokesman of Osman Hassan Ali Atto's faction
in South Mogadishu, immediately accused the militiamen of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, son of the late General Aidid, of violating the
ceasefire they declared immediately after the death of the
general on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Hussein's fighters had launched an attack
on Atto's positions at Bosnia vicinity, and the Medina and
Dharkeyley districts in southwestern Mogadishu controlled by
militiamen of another warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
He added Atto's forces had repulsed back what he called "the
forces of aggression."
</P>
<P>
Kulmiye ordered that the civilians living in those areas
either stop the militiamen of Hussein by using their residence as
militia bases, or move to other parts of the city to avoid any
catastrophe that might be created by the retaliatory actions.
</P>
<P>
Despite this renewed hostility between the factions of
Hussein Aidid and Osman Atto, there has been a low level
negotiations between these rival factions of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
Atto's envoy, General Mohamed Galal who has held closed-door
meeting with Hussein twice within this month, said the contacts
were "peace encouraging" but refused to give any details.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a militia commander supporting Hussein accused
Atto's faction of trying to expand their territory of Bosnia
Vicinity.
</P>
<P>
"That's when the shelling started and if they stop moving
towards us we won't fire at them," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Unemployment Slightly Down in June, July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in the European
Union (EU) fell marginally to 10.7 percent in June and July, down
from 10.8 percent in the two previous months, Eurostat, the
statistical office of the EU said today.
</P>
<P>
That translates to an estimated 17.9 million unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
EU unemployment reached 10.9 percent in March but is now at the
same level as July last year. However, the overall figure masks
great disparity in the unemployment rates in the 15 EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been falling steadily for two to three years
in several EU member states: Denmark (from 10.6 percent in June
1993 to 6.3 percent this July), Spain (24.5 percent in May 1994 to
21.3 percent), the United Kingdom (10.7 percent in January 1993 to
8.3 percent) and Finland (19.6 in March 1994 to 16.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
The jobless figure has also been falling this year in Belgium,
the Netherlands and Portugal, the Eurostat report showed.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that unemployment rates were "noticeably
higher" than a year ago in Germany - 8.9 percent this July
compared to 8.1 percent in May last year - and France - 11.7
percent in the latest month compared to 11.2 percent the previous
July.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg still has EU's lowest unemployment rate of 3.1
percent, followed by Austria's 4.1 percent. Spain has the
highest rate at 21.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Disperse Palestinian Protesters in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel today declared
Hebron a closed military zone after its soldiers dispersed
hundreds of Palestinian protesters who demanded reopening a
local market.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian protesters, led by their Mayor Mustafa Natshe
and other local officials, tried to break through the human
chains formed by Israeli soldiers, demanding to reopen shops in
the vegetable market near the Machpela Cave, where a Jew shot
dead 29 Palestinian worshipers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers soon dispersed the crowd, and no violent
clash was reported. The Israeli military immediately sealed off
the volatile town in a bid to ease the growing tension.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable market, near the entrance to the Jewish
quarter, was closed by Israeli troops following the 1994 massacre to
prevent further violence between the Jewish settlers and the
Palestinian residents. About 450 Jews are living among
about 200,000 Palestinians in the town, a flash-point for
Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
However, under the Oslo II agreement signed by Israel and the
Palestinians in 1995, the market should have been reopened after
the signature of the document.
</P>
<P>
Natshe told reporters that he would continue pushing Israeli
government to honor the signed agreement by allowing the
reopening of the market. The Palestinian mayor held a meeting
a day earlier with local officials and called for today's
protest.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement signed in Taba 10 months before declared
Israeli authorities would open the market ... after the
signature of the agreement. But they did not implement it,
so we will urge them to implement the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Jewish settlers insisted Israel
alter the agreement by relocating the market in order to protect
the safety of the Jewish residents.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a compromise proposal put forward by
the Israeli government on building a wall to separate the market
from the Jewish quarter was flatly rejected by the Palestinian
side.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has been a stumbling dispute blocking the progress on
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Under the Oslo accords,
Israeli troops should have been redeployed from the town by the
end of March, but the process was frozen after four suicide
bombings in Israel from late February to early March.
</P>
<P>
Israeli new government led by the hardline Likud party
demanded a revision of the redeployment plan, which was strongly
objected by the Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> Relations Between S. Africa, Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Economic and cultural
relations between South Africa and the Middle East countries have
improved 500 percent since the country returned to the
international community after the 1994 general election.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made by South African Deputy Foreign Affairs
Minister Aziz Pahad today when he was addressing delegates at the
Afro-Arab cooperation promotion meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had in the past been isolated from the
international trade and there had been no link with countries in
the Middle East and northern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This has robbed South Africa of the riches of the Middle East
and countries in the northern part of the continent," said Pahad.
</P>
<P>
However, he said South Africa had managed to establish
diplomatic ties with most of the countries in the Middle East and
Africa since the start of the transitional period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela will visit the Middle East, including
Israel, Lebanon and Palestine, to further develop relations
between South Africa and the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Pahad also stressed that South Africa supported
a decision by the Arab states, northern African states and some
European Union countries, who were against the United States
trade embargo against certain countries like Libya and Iran.

<HEADLINE> World Cops Convene to Tackle Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Police and magistrates from 80
countries gathered today at a secret rendezvous to discuss ways to
combat mafia-style gangs, drug trafficking, money laundering,
child trafficking and other organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said organized
crime had now infiltrated the economy, public services and
private enterprises of many countries, and is "threatening the
stability of our democracy."
</P>
<P>
Among top crime fighters at the meeting are Colombia's Luis
Enrique Montenegro Rinco, the deputy-director of the Bogota police
force who captured drug baron Pablo Escobar, Italy's
anti-mafia judge Bruno Siclari, and Felix Baenziger of Berne,
Switzerland, a specialist on money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Juan Miguel Ponce Edmondson, head of the Mexican Justice
Ministry said Mexico needs new ideas on combating drug trafficking
and corruption of public services, the two problems that are
shaking the country to its foundations.
</P>
<P>
Eight hundred "bent cops" were sacked last week alone in
Mexico, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Suelta Margaritova, a Bulgarian jurist, said that "two parallel
economies" exist side by side in her country, which lacks proper
laws to fight the black economy and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Kendell, general secretary of Interpol, said organized
criminal groups are sucking in 500 billion U.S. dollars of profits
each year with their criminal activities, including drug
trafficking, smuggling in children and nuclear waste and producing
counterfeit money.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Andres Anvelt of Estonia said his country is
used as a dumping ground for stolen cars from neighboring
countries.
</P>

The meeting has been held annually since its inauguration in
1978 at the University of Messine in Sicily, Italy.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. May Study Offshore Heliport in Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 17 (Xinhua) --Japan and the United States are
to launch a joint feasibility study into building a floating
military heliport at sea to replace one due for closure at a major
U.S. base on the island of Okinawa, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto during his brief visit to Okinawa, an island on the
country's southernmost tip, to appease local residents who resent
the huge U.S. military presence in their home town.
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that both countries consider an
offshore floating facility as a new home for the U.S. heliport
installation at Futemma Air Station within the same
prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said he will work for a cut in
U.S. military bases in Okinawa and promote the prefecture's
economy, which is lagging behind the rest of the country partly
due to the U.S. military occupation of land.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, about 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, is home to
some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan, although the
prefecture makes up only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's visit today followed Okinawa Governor Masahide
Ota's backdown last week over forcible leasing of land to the
U.S. military. Ota ended his year-long battle with central
government and finally agreed to take the legal steps needed to
renew the forced leasing of land for use by the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Ota declined to comment on the offshore heliport plan, only
saying the prefectural government will decide on whether to
support the proposal after receiving reaction from local people on
whether it might cause any disturbance to residents, reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Pollution Serious in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 36 percent of vehicles
plying the streets in Bangladesh were found exhausting black
smoke and other emissions which are injurious to human health,
according to a survey published here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey was jointly conducted by Bangladesh's Department of
Environment (DOE) and traffic police from January to August,
covering the four major cities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and
Rajshahi.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 814 vehicles surveyed in the four cities, 297 were
found to be faulty and cases were filed against those defective
vehicles, DOE Director General A.N.M. Wahed confirmed, adding that
buses, micro-buses, trucks, auto-rickshaws, vans, jeeps and tank
trucks were found exhausting black smoke and other injurious
emissions increasing the incidents of respiratory and lung
diseases in the country.

One of the major pollution problems the city-dwellers are
facing today is air pollution from vehicle exhausts and the DOE

Many large Swedish companies, such as Ericsson, Astra,

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Kill 230,000 Cattle to Curb Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has
announced a plan to slaughter up to a quarter of the country's
cattle herd in a bid to eliminate the threat of "mad cow" disease
in the country, local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 230,000 of the one million cattle in Switzerland will be
slaughtered if the plan is approved by parliament in its autumn
session.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement on Monday that it was
proposing the slaughter of cattle born before December 1, 1990,
the year when Switzerland introduced a ban on feeding cows with
beef bone and other remains that could help spread the disease
BSE. The offspring of infected cows are also targeted.
</P>
<P>
The government said the move was designed to minimize potential
risks and restore consumer confidence in the beef market which has
been hit by a beef health scare in Britain.
</P>
<P>
But Swiss farmers associations strongly protested the plan,
saying it was meaningless and would worsen the suffering endured
by farmers since "mad cow" disease hit the headlines in March.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland trails only Britain in the number of reported cases
of mad cow disease, which is formally called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). The cumulative total reported in September
was 223 cases. Sales of beef in Europe have plummeted after the
British government admitted in March that there was a possibility
that the deadly BSE could be transferred to humans who eat
infected beef.

<HEADLINE> Former ECOWAS Official Prosecuted for Passport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 17 (Xinhua)- -Former Executive Secretary
of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States,Abass
Bundu, whose prosecution over an alleged fraud of Sierra Leonean
passports was halted by the government on Monday has accused the
government of President Tejan Kabbah of ''a political which
hunt''.
</P>
<P>
Bundu, who was Foreign Minister in the military government of
Valentine Strasser and contested subsequent multi-party election
as a presidential candidate of the People's Progressive Party
(PPP), was freed of a six point larceny on Monday involving 40
Sierra Leonean passports sold off to an Hong Kong businessman,
Frank Yui.
</P>
<P>
Bundu was alleged to have received 210,000 U.S. Dollars for
the sale and Attorney General Solomon Berewa said at a press
conference that Bundu has already refunded 100,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bundu said, ''It was strange that (Frank) Yui only found it
convenient to report the so-called theft to the civilian (SLPP)
government''.
</P>
<P>
''The full story (of the passport racket) will soon be told'',
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bundu said Yui had ''voluntarily donated to his political
campaign'' during the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The passport affair, which the government claimed that netted
602,000 Dollars to Strasser was originally billed as an
immigration investment program to attract Hong Kong nationals who
wanted to invest in Sierra Leone when the colony reverts to
Chinese rule in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Backs Probe Into Fate of Nazi Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government on Monday
backed an official inquiry into the whereabouts of hundreds of
millions of dollars held by Nazis and Jews in secret Swiss bank
accounts during World War II, local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which must be approved by the Swiss parliament later
this year, would allow a commission of experts to lift bank
secrecy laws and gain access to wartime bank files to find out
what happened to gold deposited during the war by Nazis and their
victims.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government said in a statement on Monday that the
investigation will cover the lost or stolen assets of victims of
the German Nazis as well as Nazi assets brought into Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland passed its famous bank secrecy laws in the 1930s to
draw deposits from, among others, Jews and others seeking a safe and
neutral haven to hide their assets from the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, the Swiss banking industry and Jewish
organizations agreed to set up a joint committee to launch an
unprecedented search for funds deposited in Switzerland by
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Bankers Association had said that it found 775 accounts
with 34.1 million U.S. dollars that had lain dormant since 1945
and that presumably belonged to Holocaust victims. But Jewish
organizations suspect that the figure could run into billions.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has been under pressure to counter
speculation that Nazi gold was still hidden in the country,
particularly since a British Foreign Office released earlier this
month claimed that the Swiss handed over to the Allies only a
small part of the 500 million U.S. dollars in gold looted by Nazis
during World War II.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets With Tadzhikistan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress says that the NPC
wants to find various ways to co-operate with the parliament of
Tadzhikistan to develop good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, the committee chairman, made these remarks during a
meeting here this afternoon with the President of the Republic of
Tadzhikistan, Emomali Sharipovich Rakhmonov.
</P>
<P>
Referring to close links between the two parliaments in the
past few years, Qiao noted that after Rakhmonov's 1993 China
visit, Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tomur Dawamat
and First Deputy Speaker of Tadzhikistan parliament Abduajid
Dostaev also exchanged visits.
</P>
<P>
This laid a solid foundation for exchanges and cooperation
between the two parliaments, Qiao said, adding that since the
establishment of diplomatic relations, the ties have developed in
a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' leaders maintain close contacts and often
exchange views on issues of common concern in the region and the
rest of the world, with the result that there is greater
understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov said that this is his third visit to China. This
morning, he visited a new technological development area in
Beijing, which deeply impressed him.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he first visited China in March, 1993,
as chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Tadzhikistan. During the
visit, the two sides signed a total of 11 co-operative
agreements. Since then, he said, Tadzhikistan-China relations have
been close and contacts between the two parliaments frequent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two parliaments should increase legislative
co-operation in addition to that in the economy, and science and
technology.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets With Tadzhikistan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting here this
afternoon with the President of the Republic of Tadzhikistan
Emomali Sharipovich Rakhmonov, Premier Li Peng said that China and
Tadzhikistan are friendly neighbors with a 400-km border and that
China attaches importance to developing co-operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral co-operation has good prospects, since
the two economies are complementary, for bilateral economic and
trade cooperation, even if bilateral co-operation is small in
scope at present.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov said that he and President Jiang Zemin reached a
consensus on many important issues during their talks, and that
Tadzhikistan, as China's neighbor, has always paid attention to
China's reforms, and that his country is ready to learn from
China's experiences.
</P>
<P>
He noted that one of the important objectives of his China
visit is to learn about China's reform and opening-up policies,
including those on establishing special economic zones and
introducing foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Li said, in referring to the Taiwan issues, that "we appreciate
Tadzhikistan's support for China," and added that China will, as
always, respect Tadzhikistan's independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed the hope that any questions about the border
between the two countries can be settled at an early date through
joint efforts, to make this border area one of peace and
friendship.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian-Romanian Treaty Gets Mixed Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 17 (Xinhua) -- As the United States and
other western countries hailed a treaty signed on Monday between
Hungary and Romania to solve their long-standing ethnic and border
disputes, Hungary's main political parties have strongly attacked
the accord.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement released today by Hungary's 11 main political
parties said the treaty jeopardizes the interests of Hungarians.
The government has unilaterally abandoned the promises made at a
meeting between Prime Minister Gyula Horn and ethnic Hungarian
leaders overseas two months ago, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department on Monday hailed the
treaty as marking significant progress in relations between the
two neighbors and said it showed their desire to join NATO and
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said the treaty
was very important for the expansion of the 15-member EU.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed on Monday in the western Romanian city of
Timisoara, caps five years of negotiations over the status of
Romania's 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians and Romania's insistence
that the pact should guarantee its borders.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians dropped demands for ethnic autonomy for the
minorities that had fueled Romanian fears of a Yugoslav-type
secession, in exchange for minority rights guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Even so, several of the most sensitive issues which have
created tension between the neighbors have not been resolved by
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
But both countries were eager to sign a pact to bury
their historic differences as the EU and NATO set the signing of
such a treaty as a precondition for the admission of the two
eastern European countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here today offered to sell Indonesian-made aircraft to Australia.
</P>
<P>
Following formal talks between Soeharto and visiting Australian
Prime Minister John Howard at the presidential palace, State
Secretary Moerdiono told the press that Howard promised that "the
airplane offer will be considered in accordance with the other
proposals."
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said possible trade development between the two
countries includes the purchase of Australian wheat, livestock and
meat products.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders also agreed on the need to increase the
frequency of businessmen's visits to each other's country to "know
each other better."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a meeting with the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce
and Industry and the Indonesia-Australia Business Council today,
Howard said that trade between the two countries has been
increasing so rapidly that he expects it to reach 10 billion US
dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was Australia's 12th largest trading partner in 1995,
with two-way trade in goods topping 2.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit, said
Indonesia and Australia could strengthen their trade relations in
telecommunications, computer software, construction,
infrastructure and health care.
</P>
<P>
The Australian prime minister also stressed the need for
political stability and economic growth in the ASEAN (Association
of Southeast Asian Nations) and Pacific regions in the future.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meets With Cuban, Togolese Assembly Heads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator met
here this afternoon, on separate occasions, with Ricardo Alarcon,
president of the National Assembly of People's Power of Cuba, and
Dahoukou Pere, president of the National Assembly of Togo, who are
in Beijing to attend the 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference (IPC).
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, said that visits by his Cuban and
Togolese counterparts are bound to advance China's ties with the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Alarcon, Qiao said that President Fidel
Castro's first state visit to China at the end of last year
marked a new period in the history of Sino-Cuban ties, and that
the two sides have had high-level visits and contacts to promote
economic and trade, scientific and technological, and cultural
exchanges, which China finds quite good.
</P>
<P>
Qiao expressed his appreciation for Cuba's pursuit of reforms
and opening-up while maintaining its stability, and trying to
develop in a way that suits itself, by sticking to its
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has always opposed the United States'
sanctions against Cuba, and added, "We believe that no country has
the right to interfere in other nations' internal affairs, let
alone impose its laws upon others."
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the Chinese people will, as always, continue to
support the Cuban people's just struggle to defend its sovereignty
and national dignity, and that he hopes that relations between
Cuba and the US will improve through equal dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon voiced his appreciation for China's preparations for
the conference and said that to maintain friendly cooperative
relations with China is a strategic principle of Cuba's diplomatic
policy.
</P>
<P>
In meeting with Pere, Qiao spoke highly of China's good
relations with Togo, and said that Pere's visit is certain to
increase his understanding of China and promote the development of
relations between the two legislative bodies as well as the two
countries.

<P>
The chairman expressed his appreciation for Togo's "One China"
policy and said that he hopes the two countries' legislatures will
increase contacts and co-operation at this conference.
</P>
<P>
Pere said that he is glad to witness the resumption of ties
between the National Assembly of Togo and the National People's
Congress of China, and said he hopes that friendly relations
between the two peoples and the two legislatures will be
maintained, and that the two legislatures will play a more active
role in promoting friendship and co-operation between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Swiss Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan said here today that China understands and respects
Switzerland's policy of neutrality and attaches great importance
to its ties with Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks during
a meeting with Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti.
</P>
<P>
With an eye on the 21st century, China and Switzerland should
and can push their relations to a new high based on mutual respect
and understanding, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs, equality and mutual benefit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Switzerland has risen consistently over
the last few years, a good demonstration of the sound relationship
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for trade and economic cooperation between China and
Switzerland are promising and have great potential, added
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Li said that next month's visit to China by the President of
Switzerland's governing Federal Council, or cabinet, Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz will be a major event in the history of bilateral ties
and will undoubtedly be a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Cotti said Switzerland has paid great attention to
strengthening its ties with Asia, especially with China. The
frequent high-level exchanges between the two countries have
helped promote mutual understanding and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Zurich Monday for a four-day visit to
Switzerland, the fourth leg of his European trip which has already
taken him to Poland, the Netherlands and Austria. His next stop is
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Parliamentary Delegates Call for New World Economic Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the 96th
Inter-Parliamentary Conference strongly condemned political
involvement in the global economy at today's general session, and
called for the establishment of a new economic order.
</P>
<P>
A Cameroon representative said that conditions for
international trade are worsening as the gap between rich and poor
nations widens, and the distribution of natural resources becomes
more and more unbalanced in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that these are some of the negative results of power
politics as practiced by some western countries in their global
activities.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton and d'Amato-Kennedy acts are two typical
examples of "power economics" ideology, whose goal is to force
other nations to accept the US ideas without considering their own
political and economic situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The debt problem in Africa and Latin America, as a reflection
of inequality in the world economic system, is a potential danger
to economic development in both creditor and debtor countries,
according to the parliament member from Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Sudanese delegation said that in order to
eliminate inequality in the global economy, a new economic order
should be established in the world to provide developing nations
with more opportunities for development.
</P>
<P>
Some big countries place their own interests above those of
others and this cannot but bring about negative influence on the
development in the global economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to M. Katjiuongua, a member of the Namibian
delegation, international economic problems can only be solved
with self-restraint, through open political discussions, and not
through the use of the military.
</P>
<P>
He first came to Beijing in the early 1960s, and said that
developing nations could learn from China, and that China's
significant economic success is a result of its opening-up policy
and the attention it paid to science and culture.
</P>
<P>
For those countries who have suffered from severe economic
stagnation in the past, China can provide a good example, he said,
a suggestion that was supported by representatives from the EU,
Mongolia, and Bangladesh.

CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's volume of foreign trade reached 18.4 billion
Egyptian pounds (5.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter
of this year, compared to 15 billion pounds (4.4 billion dollars)
in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported 4.5 billion pounds (1.3 billion dollars) worth
of goods in the first three months of 1996, against 3.6 billion
pounds (1.1 billion dollars) in the first quarter of last year,
The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports increased from 11.3 billion pounds (3.3
billion dollars) to 13.9 billion pounds (4.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade deficit went up from 7.7 billion pounds
(2.3 billion dollars) to 9.4 billion pounds (2.8 billion
dollars), the English-language paper said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Minister of the Public Business Sector and
Administrative Development Atef Obeid has announced that the
government would put up 23 hotels for sale.

AMMAN -- Jordan is expected to increase its foreign exchange
reserves by 250 million dollars by the end of this year after it
receives funds pledged by donors at a meeting in Paris in July.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning Rima Khalaf Monday also rejected as
totally groundless rumors that a "devaluation" of the Jordanian
dinar was under consideration, according to today's
English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said recently that the exchange rate of the
Jordanian dinar against the U.S. dollar, which currently stands
at 1 to 1.41, is expected to be devalued at 1 to 1, due to the
slack economic performance and the decline of confidence in
dinars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's current-account deficit totaled 3.1
billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, 700 million
dollars more than that of the same period last year, according to
a report issued by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The current-account deficit, excluding unilateral transfers,
primarily U.S. aid, increased between January and June to 5.3
billion dollars from 4.5 billion dollars in the first half of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The current-account deficit has increased in size four-fold
over the past three years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Israel imported goods and services worth 20.8 billion dollars,
compared to 19.2 billion dollars in the first half of last year,
while exports brought in 14.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Textile Makers Warn Against Anti-dumping Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- British textile producers have
warned that looming anti-dumping action against Asian exporters
could threaten hundreds of jobs in the United Kingdom (UK) and
thousands elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping move, due to be announced by the European
Commission (EC) this week, is against imports of undyed cotton
fabric from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, China, Egypt and China's
Taiwan. They account for more than half of the unfinished cotton
fabric imports into Europe.
</P>
<P>
Today's Financial Times quoted British-based Coats Viyella,
Europe's largest textiles producer, as saying that the EC action
could threaten more than 300 jobs at the group's own UK operations
and up to 1,000 jobs across the British textile finishing sector.
</P>
<P>
"Fabric finishers are dependent on these imports because so
little of the fabric is woven in Europe," it says.
</P>
<P>
However, the trade body Eurocotton claims that the
anti-dumping action is necessary to stop a "hemorrhaging"
of the European cotton weaving industry.
</P>
<P>
Fabric finishers argue that Europe is a minor player in
weaving, but further downstream in activities such as dyeing,
printing and finishing it is still significant.
</P>
<P>
"There is a dearth of grey cotton fabric in Europe, which
is why we import so much," said Keith Foley, Chairman of
Coats Viyella's home furnishings division. "Dyeing and
printing add more value than weaving, and developing
countries are keen to capture this market," he added.

</P>
<P>
But he added that this would certainly be linked to the
fulfillment of the commitments by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Hanegbi, concurrently health minister, said that Israel would
not turn "a blind eye" at the economic difficulties in the
territories, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) must continue
fighting what he called terrorism and not seek to gain influence
in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Today's session was called at the initiative of the Labor
faction, who expressed concern about the lack of movement in the
peace process by the current government.
</P>
<P>
Labor faction spokesman Yitzhak Rav-Yihye charged that the
Likud government had only paid lip service to the peace process
instead of taking real actions.
</P>
<P>
"Even the meeting between (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu
and Yasser Arafat was an empty gesture. The government wants to
continue the way of the previous government under Yitzhak Rabin
and Shimon Peres, but the new leadership gives no substance to
it," said Yihye.
</P>
<P>
However, Likud faction leader Michael Eitan strongly refuted
the criticism, saying the Labor faction should have praised the
meeting as an attempt to further the peace process while
preserving the state's security interests.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat on September 4 has
been hailed as historic because it broke the ice on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
In fact, no tangible result was produced by the largely
symbolic meeting, which was widely regarded as a result of
increasing domestic and international pressures on Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians formally resumed peace talks
Monday last week, but no progress had been made as the Israeli
government refused to give up its hardline policies on the major
issues of Hebron redeployment, Jewish settlements, and the
status of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Refutes Charges about Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese legislator
today refuted a Norwegian parliamentarian's claim that China
violated human rights in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
What the Norwegian said about Tibet is a "groundless charge",
and "does not conform to the spirit of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union", said Zhu Qizhen, vice-chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a general debate at the 96th
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, a Norwegian representative made use of the
solemn forum of the IPU to make groundless charges against
China. I have to respond, to straighten out the facts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Norwegian representative does not know the conditions of
China's Tibet, but made unwarranted charges, with some groundless
remarks, saying that China violated human rights in Tibet, even
claiming overtly that Tibet is a conquered land," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The words, which interfere with other country's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, were extremely irresponsible," Zhu
said, adding that the words do not accord with the spirit of the
IPU, and are not helpful to the true efforts of the international
community to safeguard human rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, Tibet was a society of feudal serfdom before
1959, which was darker and more merciless than serfdom during the
Middle Ages in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of the Dalai Lama, serfs, who accounted for more
than 90 percent of Tibet's total population, had no human rights
at all, and they themselves were just personal property of their
masters.
</P>
<P>
After democratic reform, the serfdom was eradicated, and the
serfs stood up and became masters of their own fate, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, Tibet has made social and economic
achievements, and the living standards have continued to rise. The
population increased from one million to more than two million,
and the average life expectancy rose from 36 years to 65 years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the culture, tradition, customs and religious
freedom have been respected and well protected, he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the central government allocated more than 50
million yuan (about six million US dollars) to renovate the Potala
Palace, the most famous buildings in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Expands Air Routes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Airlines said
here today that it is expanding its flights to three international
cities in a bid to transform the airline into an competitive
player in the international air service.
</P>
<P>
The company said that starting next month its airliners will
fly directly from Manila to Vancouver of Canada and Newark of the
United States. The planes will also fly between Laoag and
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
The new direct flight from Manila to Vancouver is made possible
by a joint air service agreement between the Philippine Airlines
and the Canadian Airlines which was approved recently, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the airline said that it is also planning to open
new flights from Manila to London, Shanghai, Seoul as well as
other big cities in Korea, Indonesia, Colombo and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the airline, to expand international routes was
only one of the steps it is taking to strengthen its
competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent meeting of the stockholders, Lucio Tan,
the chairman of the airline, said that the national carrier is
embarking on a four-billion-US-dollar modernization and refleeting
program.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the airline will buy 36 new aircraft until
the year 2000 as part of its effort to become one of Asia's best
airlines.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that when all aircraft -- eight Boeing 747-400 and 28
new generation family aircraft from Airbus Industries of France --
are delivered, the airline will be in a better position to improve
its market share in the trans-Pacific, European and Middle East
operations.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest Against Home Demolition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians in Jerusalem
observed a partial commercial strike today in protest against the
demolition of a Palestinian house in eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a Palestinian source, workers of Jerusalem
Municipality started early in the morning to demolish a
Palestinian house located near the Post Office near Jaffa Gate of
Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
The 120-square-meter home belongs to Ayman Yagmour, a
Palestinian resident in Jerusalem, and consists of five rooms,
the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center reported.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Municipality said that the home was built
without a license, and that they had informed the owner of the
house ahead of the demolition.
</P>
<P>
However, Rani Yagmour, the owner's brother, told Xinhua during
a telephone interview that they did not build any new buildings,
but just had "fixed the old house."
</P>
<P>
Yagmour condemned the Jerusalem Municipality for its decision
to demolish the house, and termed Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert as
"a criminal."
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian residents, as well as PLO senior
official in Jerusalem Faisal Husseini and Palestinian Council
Member Hashem Zgayar, stood at the cite as the demolition went
through.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians pointed out that this was a continued effort
by the Israeli authorities to deny Palestinian residents' right
in Jerusalem, and would exterminate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Today's demolition followed a similar action last month, when
the Jerusalem Municipality demolished a Palestinian club for the
disabled in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
The demolition caused sharp criticisms from Palestinians, who
later observed a one-day general strike in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, called by Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, to protest against the demolition and Israeli government's
intention to expand settlements.

<HEADLINE> French President Attaches Great Importance to Sino-French Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac attaches great importance to relations between France and
China, a French government minister said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Pons, French Minister of Equipment, Lodgement,
Transport and Tourism was speaking at a press conference at the
end of his China tour.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Chirac is expected to visit to China
next May.
</P>
<P>
The President's trip to China "is very important and will have
great international impact," the minister said, adding that Chirac
is a long-time friend of China.
</P>
<P>
Chirac believes that China is a very strong motivating power in
Asia's development. It is necessary for France, and other European
countries, to keep frank and friendly ties with China, Pons quoted
the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pons defined the purpose of his China trip is to deepen
French-Chinese relations. During the visit Chinese Premier Li Peng
and other senior government officials met with him and the more
than 30 entrepreneurs accompanying him on the visit.
</P>
<P>
Pons said it seemed to him that the momentum of the
increasingly enhanced bilateral relations generated by Li Peng's
trip to France last April is being continuously strengthened, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have the desire to conduct cooperation, and both
sides are working on the set road of cooperation, he stated.

<HEADLINE> Relevant Countries Warned for Receiving the Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang said today that some countries have
interfered in China's internal affairs as their leaders held
meetings with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning the Dalai Lama's visits to
New Zealand and Australia, Shen said that these countries would
bring harm to their relations with China, including unavoidably
bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Beijing, the spokesman noted that the Dalai Lama is
not a mere religious figure, but more of a political exile engaged
in activities aiming to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The central government is always willing to have contact with
the Dalai Lama, but he has never shown any willingness to abandon
the idea of Tibet's independence, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
While advocating that he held no preconditions, the Dalai Lama
is actually be-fuddling world opinion, and cheating leaders of
certain states as well, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"State leaders, including those of New Zealand and Australia
should be fully aware of this point," he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's New UNGA President Determined to Bring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today expressed
confidence that its seasoned diplomat Razali Ismail, who is to
assume the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly
(UNGA), is capable of initiating much needed changes in the world
body.
</P>
<P>
Razali's appointment to the post today came at a time when the
whole world was hoping that a comprehensive change could be made
in the UN, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahamd said here.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly Razali, who has certain qualities, can play the role
of the president of the General Assembly effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is scheduled to leave for New York tonight to
attend the 51st session of the General Assembly, said Razali's
appointment reflected the international community's respect for
Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur's effective diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Razali said in an interview in New York with
Malaysia's TV3 that the UN, a large organization with various
mandates, must go through a process of reformation and its
activities must be studied in depth.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the criticism(s) leveled against the UN are true....
There are too many overlapping activities. Therefore we as well as
other countries want to find ways to bring a lot of changes to the
UN," said Razali, former Malaysian permanent representative to the
UN.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of work that needs to be done at this 51st
session. For instance, I will strengthen all the main committees
of the General Assembly and try to get a consensus among working
groups especially on the reformation of the Security Council," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Razali, who is replacing Diogo Freitas Do Amaral of Portugal,
said the UN must also improve its financial management as its
monetary position was among the critical problems that had to be
resolved immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said he would give priority to G-77 (developing countries)
and the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said advanced countries should honor their
promise to make contributions to the UN to be channeled as
official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Malaysia's position on international
issues at the UN would not be affected by the appointment of a
Malaysian as the president of the UN General Assembly because
Malaysia's stand on all issues discussed at the UN is clear.

</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Beijing, Li said that Britain has

<HEADLINE> Parliamentarians Hold General Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians from around
the world held a general debate today on a wide range of issues as
the 96th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union got down to
business in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Many representatives said that the world economy and trade are
continuing to develop, and advances in science and technology are
leaving an ever-increasing impact on the world.
</P>
<P>
But disparity in economy and trade has also become more and
more serious, the participants said, noting that the gap between
rich and poor countries is widening, while the overall debt of the
developing countries continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from many developing countries said that
intervention through power politics in the international political
and economic order by some western developed countries has
resulted in grave consequences.
</P>
<P>
The power-politics practice of imposing the values and
political and economic systems of one country on others will
definitely meet with opposition and denouncement, representatives
said.
</P>
<P>
The protection of the rights and interests of women and
children is an urgent task facing the international community, and
all countries, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Pauperization in developing countries is putting women and
children on the streets, and attention should be given to serious
human rights problems in industrialized countries, the
representatives said.
</P>
<P>
Human rights are a complex issue that can not be solved through
international sanctions, they said.
</P>
<P>
Sanatan Bisi from India said that human rights cover many
aspects, including the right to development, adding that the first
priority for India is maintaining a stable economic development.
</P>
<P>
Human rights problems should be solved on the basis of
negotiations and discussions, Sanatan Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations overall policy on the protection of the
rights and interests of women and children should be respected,
representatives said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jue, member of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) and vice-chairman of the NPC's Foreign
Affairs Committee, said that special attention, and high priority
should be given to tackling problems faced by women and children
in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
To promote the protection of the rights of women and children,
developed countries along with the international community should
take concrete actions to help the developing countries develop
their economies and improve the living standards of their people,
as well as the environment for their subsistence, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Qizhen, another member of the Standing Committee of the
NPC, and vice-chairman of the NPC's Foreign Affairs Committee,
replied to questions put forward by some overseas representatives.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, the conference participants will hold a general
debate on the formulation of policies and strategies to guarantee
the right of people to food, at a time of economic globalization
and trade liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Russian Delegate Denounces Power Politics at IPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia has denounced missile
attacks by the US on Iraq, and strongly opposes power politics, a
Russian delegate to the 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference (IPC)
said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During a general debate at the conference, Gennady Seleznev,
chairman of the State Duma -- the Russian parliament, said that
the world is in need of a new kind of state-to-state relations at
the turn of the centuries, and of a new understanding on the issue
of security.
</P>
<P>
Security should be an integral body combined with military,
economic, ecological and other interacting factors, Gennady
Seleznev elaborated. And the dual standards now existing in
politics should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Russia opposes the sacrifice of other countries'
interests for the sake of one's own."
</P>
<P>
With this position, Gennady Seleznev said, Russia disapproved
of the Helms-Burton Act passed by the US congress, and denounces
the US missile attacks on Iraq, as well as power politics
featuring the arbitrary use of economic sanctions and embargoes.
</P>
<P>
Russia hopes that the peace problem in the Middle East will be
justly solved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznev emphasized that Russia opposes the
re-emergence of antagonistic blocs, the eastward expansion of the
NATO, and the attempt to replace the present multipolarized world
with a unipolarized one.
</P>
<P>
Russia endorses the implementation of United Nations
resolutions, not just for certain country's interests, nor at the
cost of sacrifices of innocent people, said Gennady Seleznev.
</P>
<P>
Also during the general debate, El Saket, representative of
the secretary-general of the League of Arab States, voiced a
strong disapproval of armed offenses against Iraq, saying the
offenses violated the principles of international law, and
infringed upon Iraq's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said use of force will only cause the situation in the
region to further deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Saket called on the international community to find a solution
to the problem through peaceful means, and by following the
resolutions of the UN Security Council. But he added that the
state integrity of Iraq must be maintained, and the sufferings of
the Iraqi people must be relieved.

LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian-based
international firm has introduced a direct marketing system and
will invest five to 10 million U.S. Dollars in it's operations in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Matthew Kuttamathayathu of Wholesale
Warehousing Industries (WWI) said the system will bring utility
products at the consumer's doorsteps at a much cheaper price,
according to today's Financial Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said the whole chain of distribution if followed is a long
process while the direct marketing system is a quicker way of
getting products to the consumer as it cuts away middlemen.
</P>
<P>
He said that this kind of marketing has proved worthwhile in
many parts of the world and has given employment to many people.
</P>
<P>
The firm will be on a phase by phase investment project which
will take about two and half years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambians are being trained to be managers of the firm once it
finallythayathu settles down.

<HEADLINE> Suicides on Rise in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of deaths from
suicide increased considerably in Hong Kong over the past decade
to hit a record high of 776 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Befrienders International, a charity body working to prevent
suicide, today released a report on facts and figures of suicide
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Ewan Simpson, regional director of organization,
Hong Kong has the second highest suicide rate in Asia, with 12 out
 of every 100,000 people killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
The report reveals that in Hong Kong the elderly represent the
most vulnerable group to commit suicide as a result of the
breakdown of traditional family networks and the lack of adequate
health care due to financial strains.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of an individual taking his own life appears to
increase with age and reach a climax around the age group of
between 25 and 29, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Simpson said that more than half of the suicides in Hong Kong
are unemployed, and the other vulnerable groups are housewives,
blue collar and white collar workers.
</P>
<P>
Male suicides have continued to outnumber female suicides
because men tend to restrain pressure and unhappiness to
themselves instead of talking to others.
</P>
<P>
To help those on the verge of suicide, Befrienders
International has opened two hotline centers in Hong Kong, one of
multilingual service and the other in Cantonese. The two centers
received more than 50,000 phone calls last year.
</P>
<P>
Befrienders International currently supports some 340 hotline
centers in 34 cities around the world.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Foreign Reserves to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is expected to increase
its foreign exchange reserves by 250 million U.S. dollars by the
end of this year, after it receives funds pledged by donors at a
meeting in Paris, France in July.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Jordanian Minister of Planning Rima
Khalaf Monday, who was quoted by today's English-language daily
Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
Khalaf said Jordan expects to receive about 600 million
dollars this year from donor countries out of 1 billion dollars
pledge made at the Paris meeting, but she did not specify the
donors.
</P>
<P>
The minister rejected the alleged "devaluation" of the
Jordanian dinar as "totally groundless rumors," reaffirming that
"no devaluation was under consideration," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said recently that the exchange rate between
Jordanian dinar and the U.S. dollar, which currently stands at 1
to 0.708, is expected to be devalued at 1 to 1, due to the slack
economic performance and the decline of confidence in dinars.
</P>
<P>
Khalaf did not provide an expected figure for the country's
foreign exchange reserves, which are under control of the Central
Bank of Jordan (CBJ).
</P>
<P>
"I can only tell you that we expect to build our foreign
exchange reserves by 250 million dollars before the end of
this year," she said.
</P>
<P>
Figures given by the CBJ show that the country's foreign
reserves now stand at around 625 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of the issuance of currency by the
Palestinian Authority (PA) itself, the minister said that Jordan
found it unnecessary to set up a so-called redemption fund to
handle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Economists here noted such issuance could lead to a demand for
dollars in exchange for Jordanian dinars now in circulation in the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
"Now we do not believe that such a fund is necessary," she
said, "But, in any case, we are continuing to build our reserves
to face any eventuality."
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Local reports and economic experts said the PA appears to have
shelved the idea of issuing its own currency for at least another
two years, given the need to have hard currency or gold reserves
to support the issuance.
</P>
<P>
She also said Jordan had achieved major success in bringing
down its foreign debts in terms of its relations with the
kingdom's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Jordan's foreign debts stood at more than 200 percent of its
GDP only a few years ago, but now it stands at around 100
percent, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This means that we have not simply brought down the debts
but increased our GDP," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> New Way Found to Lose Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Spitting out food instead of
swallowing it could become a new way to lose weight, a nutrition
conference was told today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists claim that merely chewing food can persuade your
brain that you have eaten a satisfying dinner, said The Daily
Telegraph published today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Edmund Rolls of Oxford University told the
conference at the Roehampton Institute in London that he has been
able to reduce people's attraction for certain foods simply by
getting them to chew them for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
The researchers gave volunteers chicken or banana to chew and
after five minutes their appetite had dropped significantly. those
who were told just to smell the food also lost some of their
desire for it - although not to the extent that the chewers did.
</P>
<P>
Professor Rolls said that the results could have possible
implications for appetite control and that the findings followed
the discovery of a region of the brain known as the secondary
taste cortex, which tells us what a pleasant experience testing
food is.
</P>
<P>
For chewing to work in Dieting, people would need to keep the
food in their mouth for a while. A short chew would stimulate the
the appetite.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Adopts New Security Measures for Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to adopt new
security measures to guard the Egyptian Museum in the wake of a
foiled attempt to steal invaluable antiquities from the museum in
downtown Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Trained police dogs will be used to secure the Egyptian Museum,
The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a 25-year-old Egyptian spent one night hiding under
a showcase at the museum and broke it, taking some 24 pieces of
the treasures on display and was planning to carry them out during
the visiting hours the next morning.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the guards found the showcase broken and
arrested the thief after a through search for the missing items
including several gold bracelets and a gem-encrusted dagger.
</P>
<P>
All these treasures were found in the tomb of the famous young
Pharaoh Tutankhamun, who lived over 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Nawar, head of the Museums' Sector at the Higher Council
of Antiquities (HCA), was quoted as saying that it has been
decided that police dogs should search the museum twice a day.
</P>
<P>
A number of alarm systems will be installed in some of the
museum's halls that display rare and precious gold artifacts.
</P>
<P>
All the halls will have close-circuit televisions to guard the
whole building, including the surrounding garden.
</P>
<P>
Following the failed attempt to steal Tutankhamun's treasures,
HCA Secretary General Abdul-Halim Nour Eddin was dismissed and
replaced by Ali Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Farouq Hosni announced that 20 million
Egyptian pounds (5.88 million U.S. dollars) have been earmarked to
step up security at the Egyptian Museum and purchase high-tech
equipment to safeguard it and protect Egypt's monuments.

<HEADLINE> China and Tajikistan Defence Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defence Minister Chi
Haotian said today that China adheres to a defence policy of
active defence, adding that the so-called "China threat" theory
spread by certain western countries is totally groundless.
</P>
<P>
"China has never made expansions into foreign lands, with not a
single soldier outside its borders, and no participation in any
military groups," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the remarks today in Beijing during a meeting
with Tadzhikistan's Defence Minister Sherali Khairulayev, who is
currently accompanying President Rakhmonov on his China visit.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace,
advocating that all countries, big or small, strong or weak,
should be treated equally.
</P>
<P>
China values a friendly cooperative relationship with all
nations, particularly a neighborly friendship with surrounding
countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"There are great potentials and good prospects in developing
friendly ties between China and Tadzhikistan," said the Chinese
defence minister, adding that he believes the current visit by
President Rakhmonov, and the meeting between the two heads of
states, will usher in a new stage of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that the Chinese army attaches great importance to
friendly relations with the Tadzhikistan army, and has taken an
active approach to the development of such ties.
</P>
<P>
According to Chi, the joint accord on the build-up of
confidence in military fields in border areas, signed by China,
Russia, Kazakstan, Kyrghyzstan and Tadzhikistan, in Shanghai last
April, is not only conducive to the essential interests of the
five countries concerned, but also to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific area, and the whole world.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Current-Account Deficit Totals 3.1 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's current-account
deficit totaled 3.1 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of
this year, 700 million dollars more than that of the same period
last year, according to a report issued by the Central Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The current-account deficit, excluding unilateral transfers,
primarily U.S. aid, increased between January and June to 5.3
billion dollars from 4.5 billion dollars in the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The current-account deficit has increased in size four-fold
over the past three years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Israel imported goods and services worth 20.8 billion dollars,
compared to 19.2 billion dollars in the first half of last year,
while exports brought in 14.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has made it clear it sees as a priority
the need to drastically cut the balance of payments deficit, and
in 1992, this comprised a small surplus, but had become a
4.1-billion-US-dollar deficit in the last full year of the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debt reached 20.5 billion dollars net (45.5 billion
dollars gross) by the end of June, an increase of some 700 million
dollars, and this debt was offset by Israel's
25-billion-US-dollar state assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the period rose 200 million dollars to
1.2 billion dollars, meanwhile, Israel's investments abroad
increased from 200 million dollars to 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
People living in the Palestinian autonomous areas spent 700
million dollars in the first half of this year, down
100 million dollars from the equivalent figure last year.
</P>
<P>
Of this sum, 100 million dollars was spent by Israelis living
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, some 50 percent of the
amount purchased from January to June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Israel paid 3 billion dollars in unilateral transfers in the
first half of this year, a 300-million-US-dollar increase, and
this is mainly because of internal U.S. political difficulties in
the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the government's four years in office, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated he hopes Israel will be
well on the way to weaning itself of US financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
During his first official trip to the U.S. in July, Netanyahu
told the US Congress that Israel must learn to live without the
annual 1.2 billion dollars in civilian aid, but there is
probably a long way to go before he could achieve this
goal.

<HEADLINE> Results of Elections in Eastern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A minister lost his seat in
the parliament after votes of the elections in the Beqaa Sunday,
the fifth and last round of a five-phased general election in
Lebanon, was recounted, Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr said
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The unlucky minister was Rober Ghanem, minister of national
education, youth and sport, who was the only one defeated among
two dozens of ministers in the government of Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri who participated in the competition of the
election.
</P>
<P>
Ghanem was a candidate on the list of an electoral coalition
brokered by Syria, which scored a overwhelming victory in
Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, comprising representatives from Lebanon's two
major Shiite groups, the Amal movement and Hezbollah, six
governmental ministers and several incumbent deputies, won 21 of
the 23 seats in the constituency in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Besides Ghanem, another candidate of the "National Concord
and Unity" coalition, Al-Hussein Hassan Al-Hojeiri, was also
defeated.
</P>
<P>
The two seats they left were won by Henry Shdid, a candidate
in the "List of Loyalty to the People's Will," and Ismail
Sukkariya, an independent candidate supported by Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and forty candidates were competing in the Beqaa
for the 23 parliamentary seats, and the voter turnout was
officially put at 52 percent, the highest since the first round
of election started on August 18.
</P>
<P>
The turnout remained relatively low during the day and
amounted to only 21 percent at 4:00 a.m., but suddenly
multiplied in the last hour before the scheduled time of
close-up.
</P>
<P>
The polling had to be extended for two hours to allow
crowding voters to cast their votes, an event which had never
occurred in Lebanon's history.
</P>
<P>
Among the winners in Sunday's elections are three Hezbollah
candidates and two of its allies, adding the number of
Hezbollah's bloc in the next parliament to nine members.
</P>
<P>
The votes were recounted after a fist-fight between
supporters of Ghanem and Shdid inside the election center, and
the clash was only dispelled by an interference of interior
security forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Ghanem had obtained votes more than
Shdid by 700.
</P>
<P>
The official announcement had been scheduled for 8:30
p.m. Monday but was delayed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Delegates at the 96th
conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Beijing today
strongly appealed for international efforts to protect the rights
and interests of children.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians from across the world expressed great concern
about problems plaguing children, ranging from child labor,
maltreatment, disasters inflicted upon by wars, sexual
exploitation, and children being threatened by the fatal disease,
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Enrico Loggia of Italy said that the majority of countries have
failed to formulate a strategy to promote the development of
children.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the protection of the rights and interests of
children be taken into account from national and international
heights.
</P>
<P>
The voice of children should be heard by the international
community, and their needs be understood by adults, Loggia said.
The ability for self-development of children will be increased
if they are supported by grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United Nations Children's Fund and
Zaire, Cuba, Finland, and a number of other countries, also aired
their views on legislation for the protection of children, the
guarantee of the right of children to subsistence, and an end to
sexual exploitation of children.

<HEADLINE> ADBC to Open Branches in Cities, Counties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Development
Bank of China (ADBC), a two-year old state policy bank, has
decided to open branches in cities and most of the country's
2,000-plus counties, say official sources at the bank.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to a recent State Council
decree to speed up reform in China's agricultural banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The bank was established in 1994, when the central government
separated the country's policy banking and commercial banking,
through commercializing existing banks and setting up policy banks.
</P>
<P>
As a policy bank, ADBC is responsible for distributing
poverty-relief loans and other kinds of government subsidies to
rural areas, while the existing Agricultural Bank of China (ABC),
which played both roles in the past, now only provides commercial
loans to rural customers.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Accused of Pushing "Pragmatic Diplomacy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China today urged relevant
countries to guard against "pragmatic diplomacy" carried out by
the authorities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At a routine press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang said that the Taiwan authorities have
recently been pushing forward its so-called "pragmatic diplomacy"
through various tricks.
</P>
<P>
They have engaged in activities aimed at creating "two Chinas"
or "one China, one Taiwan" through secret means, or even the use
of alias's, with the purpose of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that relevant countries will keep a sharp vigilance
against these activities," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
So far, instead of making any positive response to the
eight-point proposal put forward by President Jiang Zemin, the
spokesman said, the Taiwan authorities are continuing with their
activities in the international community to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates once again that the Taiwan authorities lack
the sincerity necessary for the improvement of relations across
the Taiwan Straits, and the realization of peace and
reunification, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Taiwan authorities should be fully
aware that the reunification of the motherland, which accords with
the general trend and popular feeling, is a common aspiration of
all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan authorities must go with the historical tide, and
stop any activities aimed at sabotaging the reunification of the
motherland," Shen added.

Building rafts also requires bamboo which grow on river banks,

<HEADLINE> New Medicine Produced to Relieve Suffering from Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Shanghai have
produced a new technique to battle tumors known as high polymer
guidance medicine.
</P>
<P>
The medicine was designed by restructuring molecules in order
to integrate sulphanilamide compound and anti-tumor medicine into
the same polymer chains.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time Chinese scientists have made progress
in the field, a local scientist said.
</P>
<P>
According Huang Junlian, professor from the high polymer
materials department of the Shanghai-based Fudan University, as
tumor tissues absorb less medicine than human organs, such as the
liver, patients usually have to take heavy doses of medicine in
order to achieve results.
</P>
<P>
However, such medicine contains poisonous substances and may
cause side effects, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The new medicine allows patients to take less medicine while
getting greater results, he said.

<HEADLINE> World's Highest Oil Pipeline Lives On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Soldiers from China's
People's Liberation Army (PLA) have battled against the world's
most savage weather to maintain the world's highest oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The 1,080 kilometer oil lifeline was built with a lifespan of
20 years. But thanks to the dedication of the PLA the pipeline has
just past its 20th birthday - and is expected to last another 10
years.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, starting from Golmud in northwest China's Qinghai
Province, has transported over 2.3 million tons of refined oil to
Lhasa, capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance of the pipeline, which is vital to the economic
development of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, has not
been easy. It runs across nine mountains and 108 rivers, and 90
percent of the pipeline is located on the frozen belts of plateaus.
</P>
<P>
PLA soldiers have conquered the difficulties of coldness, lack
of oxygen, and have adopted state-of-the-art technology to
maintain the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated the pipeline has saved gasoline worth 500
million yuan (about 60 million US dollars) if the fuel oil had
been transported by road transport.
</P>
<P>
China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) experts said that
the PLA has created another miracle on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
known as the "roof of the world."

<HEADLINE> China Renovating Qinghai-Tibet Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Communications
has started its second-phase renovation of the Qinghai-Tibet
Highway, the highest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Jingmin, a senior engineer in charge of the
scientific research and designing of the highway, during the
second-phase work, renovation and reconstruction of 204 km on the
highway from Golmud City in Qinghai Province, to Lhasa, capital of
Tibet Autonomous Region will be completed.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the project is an estimated 500 million yuan, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Golmud-Lhasa section is 1,147 km long, 740 km of which
zigzags through frozen areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where
the annual average temperature is below zero and the cold season
lasts for more than eight months, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The highway at this section is severely damaged due to the
harsh natural environment, said the engineer.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in April of 1992, the central government invested 850
million yuan to renovate 334 km of the highway at this section, Wu
said. This first-stage renovation work was completed in late July.
</P>
<P>
The engineer said that researchers at the No.1 Highway
Prospecting Designing Institute under the Ministry of
Communications have strengthened cooperation with scientists from
the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as with local highway
transport departments in Qinghai and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
They also have put forward new technical measures, including
raising road foundations and using new materials to build road
surfaces, which have provided ideal road conditions as a result of
the first-phase renovation, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the first-phase renovation, the traffic
capacity on the section from Golmud to Lhasa has been greatly
enhanced, and the journey from Golmud to Lhasa, which formerly
took two days, now requires 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase work will be finished by 1999, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Bicycle Market Going Saturated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Experts want to slam the
brake on new small-scale bicycle plants as China's market becomes
saturated.
</P>
<P>
They want a ban on the launch of new bicycle projects,
especially smaller plants.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that bicycle output fell by more than 20
percent in the first half of this year, compared with the same
1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Densely-populated Jiangsu Province in east China reported a
year-on-year decrease of 1.11 million bicycles over the period.
</P>
<P>
Bicycles are a major means of transport in China. The country
now has 450 million bicycles, nearly two for each household,
according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The industry's rapid growth in the past has brought down its
existing market demand, experts say.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bicycle business has witnessed very fierce
competition so far this year. Foreign-funded bicycle enterprises
now occupy the high-grade products market, while small plants have
the biggest share in the ordinary bicycle market, posing a threat
for old name-brand enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Another reason experts cite for stopping new bicycle projects
is that some countries of the European Economic Community have set
barriers measures to reduce imports of Chinese bicycles, the
experts note.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Introduces Overseas Funds to Expand Hi-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the leading
manufacturing center in China, has been trying to introduce
overseas funds and personnel over the past five years to expand
its hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Shanghai Municipal Economic Commission said
that during this period, Shanghai has brought in 12 billion US
dollars in overseas funds for expansion purposes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 70,000 foreign experts have been invited to work in
Shanghai, the official said, adding that 130,000 local technicians
and workers have been sent abroad for training.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, manufacturers in Shanghai have spent 51 billion
yuan to undertake 22,000 technological upgrading projects in a bid
to speed up the growth of the hi-tech industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Shanghai has formed six pillar industries,
including automobiles, steel, telecommunications equipment, power
station equipment, petrochemicals and household electrical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
The six industries now contribute 53 percent to the city's
annual industrial production value, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai currently has 500 hi-tech enterprises, which turned
out 55 billion yuan-worth of goods last year.
</P>
<P>
He cited the Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Company, a
Sino-German joint venture, as an example of a company that has
introduced foreign personnel.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the company has hired 100 foreign managers and
technicians and sent several hundred workers to Germany for
training. This has greatly improved the efficiency of workers and
staff, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of parts and accessories of Santana cars built by
the company are manufactured by Chinese. The company's share of

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A doctor who specializes in

<P>
He said he would donate one million yuan every year to help
poverty-stricken patients in the country.

new medicine to cure cancer.
</P>
<P>
So far, he has acquired more than 1,200 folk anti-cancer
remedies and produced 36 new medicines to combat cancer and other
complicated diseases.

</P>
<P>
Over 600,000 patients in 50 countries around the world have

percent. It has become patent medicine in six countries, including
the United States and Japan.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Swiss government Monday gave its green light to a draft
law which obliges all Swiss banks to reveal the contents of their
chests. This decision, bound to put into light the properties
deposited by the Nazis and their victims, was demanded by the
World Jewish Congress and the Swiss Association of Banks.
</P>
<P>
-- The idea of neutrality is good in time of peace, but it is
also good for the time of war. During the World War Two, neutral
countries, first of all Switzerland, was a place of most tortuous
diplomatic intrigues and financial schemes. It is no secret for
historians that there existed close ties between the Nazis and Swiss
banks, but the de-classified archives of allied countries have
brought about irrefutable illumination on the whitewashing of Nazi
gold by Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French Ministry of Labor will present in autumn a law
against underground employment, which is considered one of the
sources for illegal immigration, as well as the cause of losing
100-160 billion francs (20-32 billion U.S. dollars) each year.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentarians Debate on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The protection of the rights
and interests of women and children has become an urgent task of
the international community and respective governments, -- this
view is shared by parliamentarians here today in a general debate
of the 96th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
Valer Suian, a Romanian representative, said that
discrimination against and persecution of women and children still
exist in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
It is the duty of the whole mankind to solve the problem, Suian
said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from China, Japan, Jordan and a number of other
countries pointed out that women and children have become the
biggest victims of wars and disasters.
</P>
<P>
Human rights protection is a complex issue that has something
to do with the economic situation and cannot be solved through
international sanctions, some participants said.
</P>
<P>
Sanatan Bisi, vice-president of the Senate India, said that
human rights cover a wide range of aspects, including the right to
development, adding that the fist priority to India is maintaining
stable economic development.
</P>
<P>
Human rights problems should be settled on the basis of
negotiations and discussion, Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian representative Sue Barnes said that discrimination
against women and children is often caused by economic inequality.
</P>
<P>
Representative from Norway, Cyprus, Egypt and other countries
agreed that international sanctions cannot solve the issue of
child labor and the international community should take measures
to prevent one country from intervening in the human rights of
another country.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians were particularly concerned with human
rights in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese representative Zhou Jue said: "It is our view that
special attention and high priority should be given to tackling
the problems faced by women and children in the developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
"To promote the protection of the rights of women and children,
the developed countries along with the international community
should take concrete actions to help develop their economy and
improve their people's living standards as well as the environment
for their subsistence," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Representative from Uruguay, Uganda and other countries said
that the international community must not neglect the penetrating
problem of human rights in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Some parliamentarians noted that human rights problems also
exist in industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Kwon Young-Ja, a representative from the Republic of Korea,
said that women and children are plagued by problems ranging from
exploitation, sexual harassment and violence, domestic violence
and pornography.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Uruguay and Romania argued that free
markets will not necessarily provide women and children with
equality.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu, the Romanian representative, said that the protection
of the rights and interests of women and children is of political,
economic and legal significance.
</P>
<P>
Jorma Kukkonen, a representative from Finland, said that the
Beijing Declaration marks a progress in human rights protection
and should be observed by all countries.
</P>
<P>
Many representatives said that the task of human rights
protection should be accomplished through legislation and economic
and educational development, adding that international cooperation
should also be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the conference shows that there are more than
one billion people still living in poverty and the majority of
them are women and children in developing countries.

"To promote the protection of the rights of women and children,
the developed countries along with the international community
should take concrete actions to help the developing countries
develop their economy and improve their people's living standards
as well as the environment for their subsistence," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The gap of wealth between the developing and the developed
countries is widening. Many of the peoples in the developing
countries have long been living in poverty due to historical
reasons and affection of the irrational international political and
economic order, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than one billion world population living in poverty
a large majority of them are women and children, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhou pointed out that fully protecting the rights and interests
of women and children is an urgent and important task facing all
states and the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Women and children are always most likely to fall major
victims to wars, disasters and violence. All states and the
international community should take measures to eradicate the
causes which hinder the full enjoyment of human rights by women
and children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the United Nations and the international
community have done a lot for protecting and promoting the rights
and interests of women and children. The UN Fourth World
Conference on Women held last September has a far-reaching
significance for promoting the status of women world-wide and the
protection of their rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country which concentrates its efforts on
economic development, China also attaches great importance to
protection of human rights, especially the rights of women and
children, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a series of laws to protect women and
children and issued development outlines for them, he said, adding
that in China, women fully participate in politics. Women deputies
in the NPC account for over 20 percent of all NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have also seen rapid development in education and
medical service for Chinese women and children.
</P>
<P>
"Due to our large population, relative shortage of per capita
resources, as well as uneven economic development in the country as
a whole, there are still tens of millions of people living in
poverty in China, and we still face some difficulties in
protecting the rights of women and children," Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> China Scores Stable Economic Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy showed
stable growth in August, despite a continuing slowdown of its
industry, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Its monthly report, issued today, indicates that China's
industry achieved an added value of 150.3 billion yuan in August,
10.6 percent up in real terms on a yearly basis. This growth rate
is 1.6 percentage points lower than that in July.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of the industrial sector was brought about mainly
by recent floods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China's state sector invested 696.4 billion yuan on fixed
assets during January-August period, 20.2 percent up on an annual
basis, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Investment in technical upgrading and renovation showed a
strong increase of 17.4 percent in August, said the report, adding
that this indicated that China is paying close attention to this
sector.
</P>
<P>
The country's retail sales volume rose 16.7 percent, or 10.3
percent in real terms, over the same month last year, to 191.6
billion yuan in August.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted a rise of market prices in August,
attributing the increase to seasonal factors, and effect of the
floods.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index and the consumer price index rose by 1.3
percent and 1.5 percent over July respectively.
</P>
<P>
And the two indexes rose 5.8 percent and 8.1 percent compared
with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In August, China's exports stood at 14.1 billion US dollars,
12.8 percent up over the same period last year. Meanwhile, the
country's imports dropped 4.2 percent to 11.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report also mentioned the stable financial situation,
noting that deposits in August increased 49.1 billion yuan over
the same period last year, with the second drop interest rates
this year having little effect.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the most critical issue in the
Chinese economic life is low economic efficiency, especially in
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of profits made by the state-owned industrial
enterprises dropped by 36.1 percent during the first seven months
of the year from the same 1995 period.

<P>
WUHAN, September 17 (Xinhua) --The well-known ancient Yellow
Crane Pavilion in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, has received more than 30 million tourists since it was
rebuilt 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The pavilion was built in 223 A.D., during the period of the
Three Kingdoms (220-280) on Snake Hill in Wuchang, a part of the
triple city of Wuhan. It is said to commemorate the spot where Fei
Wei, an angel, flew up to heaven on a yellow crane.
</P>
<P>
The pavilion was repeatedly destroyed and reconstructed. It was
built once again in 1868, and burnt down in 1884 during the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911). The pavilion's latest rebuilding started in
1981 and was completed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Crane Pavilion, together with the Yueyang Pavilion
in the neighboring Hunan Province and the Tengwang Pavilion in
east China's Jiangxi Province, are recognized as the three most
famous ancient pavilions in areas south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, a total of 60 million yuan (7.2 million

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Government Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian United Front
government has been continuing its struggle against corruption
since it came to power on June 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
It introduced a bill for establishment of a Lok Pal (people's
supervision committee) in the lower house of parliament here on
September 13 to press charges of corruption against public
functionaries including the prime minister, cabinet ministers and
MPs.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the Lok Pal will inquire into complaints
relating to an offense punishable under the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1988.
</P>
<P>
To enable the Lok Pal to act independently and discharge its
duties without fear or favor, the bill provides that the Lok Pal
chairman and two members should not be removed except by order of
the president on the ground of proved misbehavior or incapacity
after an inquiry made by the chief justice of India or by any
other judge of the Supreme Court. The bill is widely welcomed and
is expected to be approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Former Communication Minister Sukh Ram was arrested last night
by the Central Burro of Investigation (CBI) as soon as he arrived
at the International Indira Gandhi Airport here from London where
he had his medical treatment, for his involvement in a
multi-million-U.S.-dollar telecom scandal.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in London, the CBI raided Sukh Ram's several
houses both in New Delhi and his home state of Himachal and seized
40 million rupees (1.21 million dollars) in cash and some gold
jewelry. Ram claimed that the money seized belonged to the
Congress party for its election campaign for the Uttar Pradesh
Assembly. Yet a spokesman of the Congress party headquarters
denied Ram's claim.
</P>
<P>
Since April this year after receiving complaints from
Telecommunication Department officials, the CBI has probed into
the case and so far it has discovered that Ram accepted at least
300,000 dollars in kickbacks in the scam.
</P>
<P>
Currently, several big corruption cases are under
investigation. They include the 18-million-dollar Hawala case, a
44.3-million-dollar urea import scandal case, a
1.17-million-dollar pay-off case, a 100,000- dollar cheating case
and a 3.9-million-dollar fodder scam.
</P>
<P>
Of these cases, the United Front government's major partner, P.
V. Narasimha Rao, who is also former prime minister and current
president of the Congress party, has so far been involved in
three. In the Hawala case which was unearthed early this year,
seven cabinet ministers were forced to quit and some leaders in
the opposition have also been investigated or tried by court.
</P>
<P>
Rao is reported to have received 1.17 million dollars in
related cases. He is expected to be sued soon.
</P>
<P>
The CBI on the night of September 5 arrested four MPs in
connection with the bribery case involving the former prime
minister and Congress leaders, who paid the four MPs big money for
their support to defeat the no-confidence motion tabled by the
opposition in the parliament in 1993 against the Rao minority
government. At the same time, the CBI questioned Rao twice on the
matter on September 4 and 6.
</P>
<P>
On July 9 this year, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Prem
Kumar summoned Rao as an accused in a cheating case to appear
before the court on July 24. Although the supreme court exempted
Rao from personal appearance before the court, it refused to quash
the court's summoning order.
</P>
<P>
UK-based non-resident Indian businessman Lakhubhai Patak had
testified before the CMM court that he had given 100,000 dollars
to Indian Godman Chandraswami and his associate for the supply of
newsprint and paper pulp to India on the assurance of Rao, who was
the then Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
R. K. Rana, leader of Janata Dal and a protege of the Bihar
chief minister, was arrested on September 12 by the CBI in
connection with the multi-million-dollar animal husbandry scam. He
is alleged to have patronized suppliers and officials of the
animal husbandry and financial departments, who were responsible
for fraudulent withdrawals to the tune of 234.37 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda also belongs to the Janata Dal and
Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav is the party's president.
</P>
<P>
The Bihar High Court has asked the CBI to go ahead with its
move to arrest and file charges against those in high positions in
connection with the animal husbandry scam.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Caution on Demolishing Palestinian Home in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has urged Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert to delay
demolishing a Palestinian home in east Jerusalem, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The request, made by Netanyahu at his meeting with Olmert and
other government officials Monday, was largely aimed at avoiding a
showdown over the "illegal" construction recently discovered next
to Al-Aksa Mosque, the Jerusalem Post quoted government sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Noting the sensitivity to the subject shown by the
Palestinians and the international community, Netanyahu urged
Olmert to act with restraint when dealing with demolishing
Palestinian homes in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said it was not the right time to take
actions against the Palestinian building, although "there is no
question that the construction is illegal."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu wanted Olmert to hold off on taking
actions against the Wafk, the Moslem religious authority in
charge of Al-Aksa Mosque, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Olmert presented a report to Netanyahu to
brief on his plans to demolish the Moslem Quarter home in
which a second floor was built without a permit and has
been occupied.
</P>
<P>
Israeli High Court issued an order to the Wakf about 10 days
ago demanding an end to the "illegal" construction in the Old
City. Jerusalem municipal officials said that they would assign
inspectors to ascertain whether the order was being obeyed.
</P>
<P>
Olmert indicated that the city would go ahead with the
demolition, but hoped that the Palestinian residents would
dismantle the buildings on their own in order to avoid clashes and
losses.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem has been at the center of the
Israeli-Palestinian disputes, as Israel has declared the holy
city as its only indivisible and eternal capital. The
Palestinians also claimed east Jerusalem as the capital of its
future independent Palestinian state, which was denied by Israeli
new hardline government.
</P>
<P>
The demolition of a Palestinian building in the Old city late
last month as well as the decision by Israeli government to
expand Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories, led to a
furious outcry from Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on the Palestinians to stage a general strike on
August 29 and a protest prayer in Al-Aksa Mosque a day later,
creating the greatest crisis between Israel and the Palestinians
since the two sides signed peace agreements in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet with Israeli Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat will meet with Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today, or Wednesday morning at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Radio quoted a senior PA source as saying that
the meeting might take place this afternoon at the Erez
checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two had been scheduled for last
Sunday during the first ever meeting between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on September 4.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting was then postponed due to Arafat's busy
schedule last week, which included a two-day official visit to
Japan and the participation in a meeting of the Arab League's
foreign ministers in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Arafat and Mordechai contacted by phone for the
first time in order to reschedule their meeting, and the two
sides later said that they had a "positive and friendly"
conversation, but no date was set for the meeting at that time.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the meeting will be the Israeli army's
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron, the lifting of
Israel's closure of the Palestinian self-rule areas, combating
terrorism, the release of Palestinian prisoners and a security
arrangement at the Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between Arafat and Mordechai,
who has spent over 30 years in the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, just prior to the meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu, the Israeli defense minister said that Israel's
new leadership should have met with the Palestinians much
earler.

inflation resulting mainly from high transportation costs in
rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Greater Benefits Result From Agricultural Products Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China has become world leader
in the output of many crops, leading the country to achieve great
benefits from agricultural product processing.
</P>
<P>
The total output of grain, cotton and oil crops across the
country ranks first in the world. Some agricultural and sideline
products, including tobacco, pigs, poultry, tea and vegetables,
can also be processed to produce great economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the value of grain, wheat, and cotton can
increase 20 percent to 80 percent, 40 to 100 percent and 80
percent respectively, after they are processed.
</P>
<P>
Now agricultural product processing is developing faster in
coastal provinces than central and western provinces and regions
of the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the value of agricultural products in Jiangsu,
Guangdong and Shangdong provinces increased over 30 percent after
processing.
</P>
<P>
The development of people's living standards has provided a
great market for the processing of agricultural products. In 1995
central China's Hubei Province attained a total sales value of
over 40 billion yuan from manufactured goods of agricultural
products, including foods, drink, textiles and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural product processing is playing an important role in
the development of rural economies.

In cities, many commodities, such as household electrical
appliances, and items for use in offices, are being updated, which
requires the establishment of flea markets to handle secondhand
goods and promote urban consumer demand, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A fossil of a buffalo horn,
believed to be more than 10,000 years old, has been found by a
farmer in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dongge of Dongga Township in Changtu County, spotted the
fossil while digging sand near a local river.
</P>
<P>
The brown fossil is 45 centimeters long and weighs 2.25
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
According to Gu Yucai, deputy director of Liaoning Provincial
Cultural Relics Research Office, the horn could have been washed
to the spot where it was discovered along the river from another
place, where the buffalo died. A conclusion is that the buffaloes
in those days were much bigger than existing cattle.
</P>
<P>
From 10,000 years to 50,000 years before, large numbers of
animals, including rhinoceros and buffalo, lived in the
northeastern part of China.

<HEADLINE> International Court Hears Iranian Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Court of
Justice in The Hague has began hearings on an Iranian complaint
against Washington for having destroyed Iran's oil platforms in
the Persian Gulf nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Eftekhar Jahromi, head of International Legal Services Bureau
of Iran, said Monday that Iran's claim against the United States
had been filed on November 1, 1992 for damages as the result of
U.S. attacks on Iranian offshore oil platforms by four U.S. navy
warships.
</P>
<P>
On October 19, 1987, American warships surrounded and shelled
the two Iranian oil platforms of "Resalat" and "Reshadat" in the
Gulf. The fire completely destroyed one and damaged the other by
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Americans pounded Iran's Salman oil platform
and the Nasr oil platform, destroying the two platforms along
with their peripheral installations.
</P>
<P>
Washington has alleged that it attacked Iran's oil platforms
because Iran had laid mines in the Persian Gulf which, Washington
claims, had damaged an American ship named USS Samuel and injured
a number of her crew.
</P>
<P>
The Americans has claimed that the Iranians used the two
platforms for military purposes, while the Iranian government has
shown that it never used either of the two platforms for military
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said in its complaint to the court that the United
States is responsible for its "unwarranted attacks" on the Iranian
platforms which were in transparent violation of the treaty between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Iran demanded that the United States must offer
adequate compensation to Iran for physical damage to those
platforms, according to the official news agency IRNA.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism Authority Advocates Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) is seeking to liberalize aviation routes between
Thailand and the southern Chinese provinces in an attempt to boost
the number of tourists from China.
</P>
<P>
Pradech Phayakvichen, TAT deputy governor, was quoted today by
local daily, The Business Day, as saying that the idea, named the
North-South Tourism Corridor, has already been approved in
principle by the Committee of the Greater Mekong Subregion
Development (GNSD) at their meeting in Kunming last month.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), financial supporter for GMSD
projects, is currently conducting a study on how to put the idea
into practice.
</P>
<P>
Pradech said that the prime objective of the corridor is to
promote the use of new transportation routes by air and land
between countries represented by the GMSD committee. The countries
covered are Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam as well as the
Chinese province of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of aviation routes is far easier to
carry out than improving land links, as air route liberalization
is a quicker solution to improve transportation than constructing
new roads, which is both time-consuming and difficult to
coordinate.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral agreement, without having to wait for the approval
of the five countries in the committee, is sufficient enough to
improve the transportation links between any two given countries
within the group. Thailand and Yunnan are ready to conduct the
first such bilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to Pradech, China is one of the countries that TAT is
hoping to receive more visitors from. Its economic development
means that more and more people are able to travel overseas and
with its huge population, China represents a very promising
market.

CHANGSHA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three new towns have
sprung up in central China's Hunan Province, bringing the total
number of towns there to 936.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of new towns has helped to promote the

<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A local court Monday cleared
two Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party (CTP) canvassers of
vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
The Buri Ram provincial court acquitted Narupol and Prapaporn
Siripanich, saying the prosecution failed to prove where the 11.4
million baht (0.46 million US dollars) cash seized in the couple's
house came or would go.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that police raided the couple's house on
June 29 last year, three days before the general elections, and
found the money and election cards for CTP candidates, including
Newin Chidchob, former deputy finance minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the court has ordered the confiscation of the money on
the ground that the defendants intended to use it for illegal
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor reportedly will appeal against the verdict and
some judges said that the historic case would have an influence on
future elections.

NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- India continued taking the
lead worldwide in the consumption of gold despite higher prices of
gold in the Indian market, the Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the total gold consumed in 1996 till
the end of June was 253 tons which is five percent more than last

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average gold price in Mumbai (Bombay), the
leading gold market in the country, was nine percent above its
prices a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the increase in gold consumption to
income growth, political uncertainty and record official imports
of the metal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group began its 37th meeting in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Senior Representative Zhao Jihua and his British
counterpart Hugh Davies both expressed the hope that the meeting
will achieve new progress on the question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, the two sides will discuss a
wide-range of issues concerning the transfer of political power in
Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's
participation in international organizations, and treaties and the
localization of Hong Kong laws, as well as tourist documents.
</P>
<P>
As today's meeting began, both Zhao Jihua and Davies thanked
experts from both sides for the efforts made in achieving new
progress in a number of subjects on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that as a normal practice, the meeting was held in
China in the harvest season of autumn, adding: "we have the reason
to expect that this plenary session will produce more progress."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two or three months, between the previous and
present sessions, there have been contacts between senior leaders
of the two countries, he said. Bilateral relations are now
developing towards the direction of further improvement.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group is still
confronted with very arduous tasks indeed.
</P>
<P>
Noting very slow progress in some subjects directly related to
the smooth transition of Hong Kong, he said it is the Chinese
side's hope that through this session there will be some new
breakthroughs or positive progress.
</P>
<P>
Davies said that the Moon Festival, a Chinese traditional
festival, is approaching. "It is certainly our intention to live
up to the spirit of the moon festival and produce the next sound
harvest on its occasion," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the time for the transfer of the government in
Hong Kong is now getting quite short, and there are only nine
months to go.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging results achieved on many subjects, Davies
expressed the hope for more progress during this meeting.
</P>
<P>
The localization of Hong Kong laws, the question of the
garrison and laws, as well as economic issues will be hopefully
addressed and resolved in a good time, Davies said.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian Minister Arrested on Bribery Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian
communications minister Sukh Ram, who was accused of taking a huge
sum of bribes, was arrested immediately on his arrival at the
airport here from London midnight Monday, the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
Ram had managed to linger on in Britain for about a month after
the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) issued summons against
him following raids on his various residences in India, which led
to the recovery of cash and other assets worth over four million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The former minister was on trip to Britain one month ago when
the raids were carried out. He had repeatedly delayed his return
to India on pretext of health conditions.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Ram and his wife disembarked from an Air-India
plane, CBI officials served him a non-bailable arrest warrant and
took him away to an undisclosed destination for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued by a special court here on
Monday, approximately the same time as the former minister boarded
the Air-India flight in London for India.
</P>
<P>
Moments before his departure for India, the former minister
said at the airport in London that the cash recovered by the CBI
at his residences belonged to the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
He said the money had been given to him by a senior Congress
party official for party use in the coming state assembly election
campaign in Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
However, a Congress party spokesman clarified in New Delhi on
Monday that the party had never authorized any of its ministers to
collect money on behalf of the party.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Shifting Trends in Russia's Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign trade
registered a 6.2 percent increase in the first half of the year,
amid changes of trading partners and the mix of import and export
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Russians exported 40.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods
and imported 23.3 billion dollars worth of commodities in the six
months, a 4.6 percent and 9.2 percent increase respectively over
the same period of last year. Its surplus, at 17.4 billion
dollars, represents a slight decrease from the last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth of foreign trade was achieved amid three major
changes in its trading partners and in import and export
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, an increased trading volume with members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States constitutes a major shift in
Russia's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Russia exported 7.9 billion dollars worth of goods to members
of the CIS, a 20.6 percent increase over the last year. At the
same time it imported 7.8 billion dollars of commodities from
them, a jump of 53.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the rebounding trade between Russia and CIS
members was fueled by several factors, including the lack of aid
from Western countries and the economic recovery of CIS members.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, much of the promises of economic aid to Russia
from Western nations turned out to be only lip service. Though
Western nations delivered few of their promises, their aid came
with harsh terms. The disappointment prompted Russia to turn to
its former trading partners -- members of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
During the same time, CIS members started an economic recovery
process after suffering serious recessions in the early years of
their independence. As the production of their industries resumed
to a fuller scale, their international solvency has also
improved. These provided a foundation for them to develop trade
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Second, Russia's trade with non-CIS member nations slowed
down. In the first six months, Russia's exports to non-CIS member
nations reached 32.8 billion dollars, up only 1.3 percent from the
last year. Its imports from non-CIS member nations even fell 4.6
percent to 15.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the slow-down to Russia's presidential
elections and its more protective policies for domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
Awaiting the results of the Summer elections, many nations
adopted more cautious policies in developing trade with Russia,
because of the unpredictability of the political situation in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the end of last year, Russia also tightened its
import controls, adopting strict food inspection policies,
imposing quotas on some commodities and raising tariffs.
</P>
<P>
But Russia's trade with China saw a fast increase, growing by
41.2 percent. Russia's exports to China reached 2.46 billion
dollars and imports from China, 801 million dollars, up 52.2
percent or 15.7 percent respectively from last year.
</P>
<P>
Russia's trade with China is highly complementary, with China
supplying Russia with food, light industry products and other
consumer goods, while Russia provides China with power and
transportation equipment, steel, fertilizers and chemical products.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the increased trade volume between Russia and
China shows enterprises and trading corporations in both countries
have adjusted to the changing market and achieved progress in
establishing new channels of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the structure of Russia's import and export
commodities also changed. Though raw materials, especially oil,
natural gas, iron and steel, still account for the bulk of
Russia's exports, its exports of machinery registered a 6.5
percent increase, accounting for 9.1 percent of its total export
volume.
</P>
<P>
Among its imports, furniture, garments and chocolate decreased,
reflecting both the limited purchasing power of Russian consumers
and strengthened import control by the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian press today praised
the Bosnian elections last Saturday as an historic event in the
history of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The elections, marking the end of war in the region and the
beginning of peace and reconstruction, were a turning point in the
state's history, said the press.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that the elections would go down in history no
matter what the result.
</P>
<P>
The press reported that Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini,
who is visiting Spain, tonight hailed the conflict-free elections
conducted in a peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
However, Dini said it was too early to give a comprehensive
estimate of the elections because of some unsatisfactory facts in
its process.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to pay attention to the
fact that the nation had entered a phase to perfect its political
system, which was seen as a weak link in establishing sustained
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia had suffered huge economic losses due to the
four-year-old civil war, in which 200,000 people were killed.

<HEADLINE> Coal-Rich Shanxi Increasing Economic Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TAIYUAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province,
dubbed the "sea of coal," has been hard at work turning its rich
coal resources into economic advantages.
</P>
<P>
To improve its economic efficiency, the province has designed a
series of measures to change the former practice of simply digging
coal and transporting it outside the province, which not only
yields small returns, but also puts extra presure on the railway
transport departments.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that new thermal power stations will be
established, and local industries will be developed to boost
Shanxi's economy.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shanxi has concentrated on building four major
coking bases and four coking experimental projects in its effort
to upgrade and enlarge leading local coal mines, and to build 35
commodity coal bases.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the province is now capable of producing
50 million tons of coke a year, and can wash -- or "dress" -- 60
million tons of coal, which combined can add several billions of
yuan to the local financial picture.
</P>
<P>
In the past, local coal mining and power departments have been
working in close cooperation and built four major pit thermal
power stations, in a move to transmit more electricity outside the
province and gain better economic results.
</P>
<P>
Through the end of 1995, Shanxi had a generating capacity of
9.02 million kw, and could generate 48.8 billion kwh of
electricity. Of this amount, 10 billion kwh were transmitted to
other areas outside the province.
</P>
<P>
The province has also worked to develop industries which consume
one-sixth of the locally-produced coal, greatly alleviating the
pressure for transporting the coal outside the province and
producing greater profits.
</P>
<P>
Local chemical industry has been expanding due to the adequate
coal supply that resulted from the province's new policies.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has more than 900 medium-sized and small
fertilizer plants, which enable it to become a leading fertilizer
production center in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since early this year, the province has started
screening coal mines and stopped the production at more than 3,000
illegal mines, while reorganizing its coal distribution stations.
</P>
<P>
As a result, in first seven months of this year, the province
produced 212 million tons of coal, nine million tons more than
during the same period last year, and sold 202 million tons of
coal, up 4.45 percent over last year's related figure.
</P>
<P>
The ratio between production and marketing of coal is 95.14
percent, easing the long-term problem of production outweighing
marketing.

trafficking, stockpiling and illegal production cases.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attempting to Broker Kurdish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
is attempting to broker peace between the two warring Kurdish
factions after receiving a letter from one of them asking for help
in reconciliation with the other, U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent over the weekend by Kurdistan Democratic
Party leader Massoud Barzani to U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Barzani asked the United States to again offer
good offices in his reconciling with Jalal Talabani, leader of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
Barzani, whose party went into fight with the Patriotic Union
in August, invited Iraqi forces to enter northern Iraq, where the
Kurds have been self-administering, to fight against his rival
Talabani, which led to massive U.S. cruise missile strikes against
Iraqi air defense installations on September 3.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said, "We have
received a letter from Barzani, and in it he indicates an interest
in renewed discussions with Talabani.
</P>
<P>
"We do want to continue the U.S. effort to bring the Kurds back
to the negotiating table. We have not decided how we will do it,
who will do it or where."
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau, who accompanied
Defense Secretary William Perry over the weekend on a round of
consultations in the Gulf and Turkey, remained behind in Ankara to
work out some of the questions, the U.S. officials said.

<HEADLINE> Inoculations Programme Expanded in Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Vaccinations have been
expanded to cover more than 85 percent of children in Chinese
towns, and the total incidence of major children's diseases
preventable by inoculation has dropped sharply, China Daily quoted
a top health official today.
</P>
<P>
At a national conference yesterday in Beijing, State Councilor
Peng Peiyun said that the State Council has urged governments at
all levels to provide more support to the extended program on
immunization (EPI) in their localities, and to guarantee that the
Government's commitment to preventing children's diseases will be
fulfilled on time.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the central government set the goal of immunizing over
85 percent immunization rates for children at provincial and
county levels in 1988 and 1990 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health will further extend the planned
immunization program to cover more than 90 percent of children at
township level in the next five years, according to Minister Chen
Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 targets also include promoting the hepatitis-B
inoculation rate to more than 90 percent in cities and over 60
percent in the countryside; providing tetanus vaccinations for
over 90 percent of women of reproductive age, and reducing the
incidence of infant tetanus to below one per 1,000 at county level.
</P>
<P>
Other goals include further reducing the rate of measles among
children under age five and wiping out measles in China.
</P>
<P>
The government regards EPI as a basic right of Chinese
children, said State Councilor Peng.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that health officials of local governments should
include EPI in their daily work agenda and work out measures to
ensure smooth carrying out of the work.
</P>
<P>
Insurance systems should be introduced to encourage the public
to invest in preventive health care for their children.

<HEADLINE> First Set of English-Education Laser Discs Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The first set of
English-education laser discs ever produced in China has been
circulated throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The ten discs are based on English textbooks for nine-year
compulsory education published by the People's Education Press.
</P>
<P>
Xie Mingqing, an official from the Press and Publication
Administration of China, said that the publication of the discs,
called "Gold Disc English", indicates that laser discs have become
a new educational medium in China.
</P>
<P>
The Daotian Cultural Communications Center in the Shantou
Special Economic Zone spent more than 10 million yuan (some 1.2
million US dollars), producing and publishing the new discs,
together with the People's Education Press and the China Central
Television (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
More than 200 experts, students, scholars, and actors and
actresses were involved in the production of the discs.
</P>
<P>
Four discs deal with primary school English education and the
rest, junior middle school English instruction. Programs contained
in each disc are 120 minutes long.
</P>
<P>
The set provides two kinds of learning environments on TV,
namely, classroom conversations and situational conversations that
can be adapted to parks, streets, cinemas, hotels, restaurants and
other sites.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Pavlof Volcano near
the tip of the Alaska Peninsula erupted today, ejecting large
glowing rocks from a crater near its summit.
</P>
<P>
"There's a pretty good steam plume up there," Terry Keith, the
scientist in charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, was quoted
by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Local residents told observatory a red glow near the summit of
Pavlof late Sunday night and satellite imagery confirmed a hot
spot at the same place.
</P>
<P>
Pilots who flew near the volcano also said that boulders and
magma were being thrown from the crater at the summit of the
2,518-meter mountain, Keith said.
</P>
<P>
According to Keith, there was no immediate danger to people
living along the Alaska Peninsula, but there was the potential for
an explosive eruption. If it continued this type of activity, it
could last for weeks or months, she said.
</P>
<P>
Pavlof is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian
volcanic arc, with nearly 40 documented eruptions dating back to
1790. The most recent volcano erupted in April 1986 and continued
through August 1988.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Work for Bosnia Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
work together with winners of the Bosnian elections on Saturday to
establish new government institutions for the war-torn former
Yugoslav republic, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The official winners of the first yet national polls are
expected to be announced in the next few days, say news reports
from the capital of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus will be to work with the people who win in the
elections -- to arrange meetings so that the new institutions can
be formed and fully established," U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said. He was discussing new steps Washington would
take after the Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord for ending the nearly
four-year-old war, the new government institutions include the
Bosnian presidency, the courts, banks and the legislature for the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman indicated that the Clinton administration would
make the final decision on whether or not there would be a need
for the U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping troops to remain in Bosnia
after the formal establishment of the new government institutions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has repeatedly stated that about
16,000 American ground troops, core of the 60,000-strong NATO
forces, would be pulled out of Bosnia at the end of this year as
planned.
</P>
<P>
But the Americans' West European allies have been calling on
the United States to keep some of its forces in the country to
help safeguard its stability and post-war reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Burns pledged that the Clinton administration would "have
conversations with our allies" about the deployment of the
follow-on NATO troops in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Rate Gets Higher in U.S.: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans
living below the poverty level is at its highest since the 1960s,
with children and young families affected the most, said a report
released by the Population Reference Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
The controversial welfare reform law recently signed by
President Bill Clinton will have little effect on reducing the
official poverty rate, according to the report, entitled "A New
Look at Poverty in America".
</P>
<P>
"Only about one-fifth of the 23 million adults and one-half of
the 15 million children living below the poverty line are enrolled
in the AFDC (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) program, and
welfare by itself does not provide enough cash to put a family's
income above the poverty line," said the report by the private,
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the poor who move off welfare through employment will
simply become part of the 'working poor'," it added.
</P>
<P>
The number of Americans living in poverty climbed from 23
million in 1973 to 38 million in 1994, and the child poverty rate
increased 50 percent between 1974 and 1994, according to William
P. O'Hare, author of the report and a demographer with the Annie
E. Casey Foundation, a philanthropic group that deals with
children's issues.
</P>
<P>
O'Hare said more than one-fifth of the children in the United
States are poor, almost twice the share of other age groups.
</P>
<P>
"In 1994, the poverty rate among those aged 65 and older was
only about half of that for children, and was about the same as
the rate for working-age people," O'Hare's report said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest population census in 1994, O'Hare found
that roughly one of every seven Americans is poor, up from one in
nine during the early 1970s. The poverty rate was 14.5 percent in
1994, compared to 11.1 percent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of poor Americans, or more than 15 million
people, had incomes less than half the official poverty threshold
in 1994, compared to roughly 30 percent in the 1970s. The poor
income threshold in 1994 for a single-parent household with two
children was 11,929 dollars and 15,000 dollars for a two-parent,
two-child household.
</P>
<P>
O'Hare said the poverty gap between whites and African
Americans and Hispanic minorities was 3-1 in 1994, the same as it
was in 1959. He said 31 percent of African Americans and
Hispanics are poor, while about 9 percent of whites are poor.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Protect Companies Against Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
introduced a bill to counteract the U.S. Helms-Burton Law aimed at
punishing foreign companies active in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation stipulates that Canada will not recognize
court rulings issued in accordance with Helms-Burton law and will
not help collect judgments issued against Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
Canada is one of the largest foreign investors in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A Toronto-based mining company, Sherritt International, has
become the first target of the visa-ban provision of the
Helms-Burton bill passed by the U.S. Congress last March and
signed into law by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Under the Helms-Burton Law, lawsuits can be filed in
U.S. courts against foreign companies whose operations in Cuba
make use of the property confiscated from American firms during
the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The new bill will allow targeted Canadian firms to file
countersuits against Canadian subsidiaries of American firms that
make use of Helms-Burton to pursue damages.
</P>
<P>
The bill also makes it possible for the Canadian government to
fine Canadian companies which give way to provisions of
Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Canada has been joined by Mexico and European Union countries
in denouncing the Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
The sharp criticism seemed to have led Clinton to decide in
July to waive the lawsuit provision of Helms-Burton law until
after the November presidential election.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Secretary of the Security Council Alexandr Lebed
agreed that the interim Chechen coalition government should
strictly abide by the Chechen peace agreement, the Itar-Tass
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The common position was reached when Chernomyrdin met Lebed
today.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement, which was signed by the Russian central
government and Chechen rebels last month, is designed to end the
18-month-long conflict, in which some 50,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, the special envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
the Chechen issue, will announce his appointments of Russian
officials to the coalition government when he re-visits the
war-torn republic. Lebed's appointees will be composed of leaders
from important departments.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both sides are expected to discuss issues
including restoration of economy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government needs no approval of Chernomyrdin for
its nomination of leading figures before the Chechen elections.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is reported to meet Doku Zavgayev, head of the
pro-Moscow Chechen government late today to discuss issues
relating to the coalition government.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's apparel industry
recorded a total income of 421 million U.S. dollars in the first
quarter of 1996, the highest for any quarterly period, industry
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the apparel sector's earnings doubled in
comparison with the total earnings from traditional exports such
as tea, rubber and coconut in the same quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's apparel industry has demonstrated its ability to
move toward competitive markets when the quota system is phased
out in year 2005, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to bringing in valuable foreign exchange, the
apparel industry has created thousands of jobs for the country's
youth.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, America led the importers of Sri Lankan garments with
936 million dollars, followed by Britain with 212 million dollars,
Germany 136 million dollars, the Netherlands 58 million dollars
and France 40 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Poverty to Spread in Rural Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Experts today warned poverty
is to spread in rural Latin America when the fifth Agricultural
Economy Congress of Latin America and the Caribbean (Alacea) was
inaugurated here today.
</P>
<P>
Agrarian economists told the week-long meeting that
macroeconomic policies by the governments have relegated the
agrarian sector, giving way to more problems that cause poverty in
the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Government policies that are being applied in practically all
Latin American countries have triggered a negative redistribution
of income which bypass small growers and agricultural producers,
former Alacea President Carlos Pomareda said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the structural conditions have gone through
profound changes in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Young people have left the rural areas, where only the old
remain, and women have to assume the leading role in farming.
</P>
<P>
The former Alacea president said macroeconomic and trade
policies have affected agriculture and he urged people to
acknowledge the fact that the state has a role to play in defining
and implementing these policies.
</P>
<P>
Pomareda asked to include into the congress agenda the
plantation of illegal crops such as marijuana, opium and cocaine,
which totally cover 1.2 million hectares in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to continue hiding this topic from the
agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current Alacea President, Maximiliano Cox, reiterated that
the agricultural and livestock sectors have been affected by the
globalization process and neo-liberal policies.
</P>
<P>
Countries that took the lead in the liberalization, such as
Colombia with its flowers and Chile with its fruits, have attained
benefits but countries that entered into the transformation
process later are facing growing difficulties in a saturated
market, said Cox.
</P>
<P>
Cox illustrated the lack of vigor in the agricultural and
livestock sectors by citing the annual growth rate of Latin
America which has averaged 1.9 percent during this decade.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew an average 3.6 percent in the same period whereas
imports increased by 11.7 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
Cox said that the low growth rate will not be conducive to
fighting poverty in the agricultural and livestock sectors.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Spend $5.3 Million to Protect Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Environmental
National Commission (Conama) will spend more than 5.3 million
U.S. dollars to subsidize enterprises that want to reconvert their
production processes to eliminate the emission of substances that
damage the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Conama's ozone project coordinator Carlos Canales said today
that the plan aims to reduce more than 50 percent the present
emission from now until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The project is being financed with grants from the World Bank,
on the International Ozone Day.
</P>
<P>
Canales said that the first stage of the project, to end in
April of 1997, will cost 480,000 dollars in subsidies to 12
enterprises that can obtain up to 90 percent of the cost of
renovation.
</P>
<P>
He said the ozone issue in Chile is relatively not complicated
in that all the ozone-damaging substances used in the country are
produced abroad.
</P>
<P>
He added that it means that the elimination of the substances
requires a technical change or modification of the production
processes using the substances.
</P>
<P>
Chile is estimated to emit 110 tons of ozone-damaging
substances this year.
</P>
<P>
The Conama plans to eliminate the emission of a total of 440
tons more ozone-damaging substances during the second stage of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Conama project is being developed in collaboration with the
"Country for the Protection of the Ozone Layer" plan approved by
the executive committee of the Montreal Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The protocol is an international agreement that limits,
controls and regulates the production, consumption and trade of
substances that damage the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Damage done to the ozone layer has increased the ultra-violent
radiation, especially its B-type radiation which is most damaging
to human health and other life on Earth.

KIEV, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Supreme Soviet of
Ukraine Alexandr Moroz has announced that Ukraine will draft a
non-allignment policy as quickly as possible to contend with NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN reported that Moroz told Caston
Voight, the visiting Chairman of North Atlantic Assembly, that no
one could force Ukraine to join NATO because of a non-allignment
policy to be established soon.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said NATO should consider the interests of those
countries which would not join NATO, and must make a thorough
investigation of the results of NATO's eastwards expansion, which
had caused Ukraine's revising its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Caston Voight said the aims of the North Atlantic Assembly and
NATO were improving harmonious relations between the countries in
the area, and strengthening safety in the area.
</P>
<P>
The new European-safety system would be based on cooperation
between countries in the area including NATO member and non-member
states, Caston Voight said.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought the forming of a new European safety model
could reduce the possibility of military equipment competition.
</P>
<P>
Caston Voight arrived here on September 14 to begin his two-day
formal visit to Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's Economy Recovers From Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's gross domestic
product (GDP) rose 0.1 percent on a yearly basis to reach 561.1
billion tenge (about 8.25 billion U.S. dollars) in the first seven
months of the year, as the country's economy rebounded from a
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the GDP of the former Soviet republic
gained an increase since its independence in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by the government,
in the first seven months of the year, the industrial sector grew
0.2 percent over the same period of last year, while the business
sector increased 12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector was still unable to get out of its
straits, but the pace of slipping was slowing down.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months, agricultural output fell 6.9 percent
over the same period of last year to 76.6 billion tenge (about
1.13 billion dollars), but this was much less than the 21 percent
drop in 1995 from 1994.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, agricultural output increased 16.6 percent
in July from June.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade as a major economic indicator continued to grow
with high speed for the second year. Trade volume jumped 41
percent to reach 5.2 billion dollars in the first half of the
year, with a surplus of 1.25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In other aspects of the economy, measures have been taken to
put inflation and unemployment under control. In the first seven
months, consumer prices rose 18.9 percent over December of last
year, and the unemployed number stood at 340,000, or 5.1 percent
of the working force.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh government declared that the overall economic
slowdown, prompted by the country's sweeping economic reform
measures in 1992, had completely come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the economic figures of last year and this year
indicated that the reform measures had gained initial success.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Women parliament speakers
from throughout the world are calling for more women members in
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by nine women speakers at the Third
International Women Parliament Speakers Conference which closed
here today. The nine came from from Croatia, Finland, Germany,
Norway, Jamaica, Ethiopia, El Salvador, Britain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
They focused their discussion on how to increase the proportion
of women members in the world's parliaments which number about 180.
</P>
<P>
At present, 14 parliaments have women speakers and only five
nations have more than 30 percent women members in their
parliaments. Women account for 43 percent of parliament members in
Sweden, 40 percent in Norway and 33.5 percent in Finland.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study, women members can only play an
important role in a parliament if they account for at least 30
percent of the members.
</P>
<P>
Swedish speaker Birgitta Dahl called for education and social
reforms to change the situation. "Women can only increase their
political influence when they gain economic independence," said
Dahl.

MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee evaluation team Monday began its quest to determine who
will host the 2004 Summer Games, visiting St. Petersburg in the
first in a series of trips to the 11 cities vying for the honor.
</P>
<P>
"This is a record number of candidate cities," said Thomas
Bach, head of the 15-member Ioc delegation. "The message linked
with the games -- understanding the need for peaceful competition
between countries -- is more important than ever."
</P>
<P>
But St. Petersburg, struggling financially and still smarting
from problem-hit 1994 Goodwill Games, faces an uphill battle
against more financially sound competitors such as Cape Town, Rome
and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Rome is the current favorite but Cape Town, hoping to become
the first African city to hold the Games, also has a strong chance
and would focus world attention on the peaceful change from
apartheid to democracy in the Republic.
</P>
<P>
Athens, the historical home of the Games, also has a chance
after being passed over the 1996 centennial Games.
</P>
<P>
Other hopefuls include Lille, Stockholm, Buenos Aires, Rio De
Janeiro, Seville, San Juan and Istanbul. The list will be narrowed
down to four or five cities by spring, with the final decision set
for September 1997.

playing the lowest-rated teams, so many teams played without their
best players to save them for more important games.
</P>
<P>
"Garry Kasparov will join the team not earlier than after the
second round. We have to save his energy," Russian coach Boris
Paustovsky said.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, the world's highest-ranked player, heads a Russian
team that won the last Olympiad in Moscow two years ago and will
contend for top honors again this time.
</P>
<P>
British player Nigel Short, Bulgarian Veselin Topalov and
Hungarian Judit Polgar also were saved by their coaches on Monday
for more decisive games.
</P>
<P>
The strong American team playing against low-rated Paraguay
unexpectedly lost a game when its leader, former U.S. champion
Boris Gulko, was upset by low-ranked Valiene R. Cristobal.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Armenia,
Ukraine, Georgia, Israel and the Netherlands are expected to
challenge Russia in the men's division.
</P>
<P>
Georgia, China and Hungary, who finished 1-2-3 in the women's
competition two years ago, again are expected to contend for that
title.
</P>
<P>
Play runs through October 2.
</P>
<P>

Georgia bt New Zealand 4-0

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Ask US to Help Clean Wastes in Subic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Foreign
Affairs Department will ask the US government to help clean up
seven of the 44 sites at Subic which was contaminated by toxic
wastes left by US troops, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that it was confident that
the issue of remedial measures to these toxic wastes will become
an area of "cooperation rather than a point of contention" between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
An environmental study by Philippine government agencies showed
that some children and pregnant women living near the area have
gotten many kinds of diseases due to the presence of the wastes.
</P>
<P>
Subic, the biggest among the six former US bases in the
country, has been converted into a special economic zone since the
US military was forced to close it in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The United States was charged with failing to properly cleanup
the toxic wastes when its troops pulled out of the base.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Farmers Protest Farm Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- About 8,000 farmers took to
the streets here today to protest against the government's
agrarian policies and to demand the approval of new laws in
support of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The protesters marched from the city center passing the
presidential mansion and the parliament building. They also
demanded the implementation of a program of credits to small and
medium-sized growers and agricultural producers, and government
support for a food security policy that had been abandoned by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Guido Vargas, coordinator of the Costa Rican National Farmers
Board, said: "We expect to see a series of measures adopted in
answer to the problems of the rural growers and producers."
</P>
<P>
He said action was being taken to demand compliance with an
agreement signed by the government but yet to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
He said the marchers, small and medium-sized growers and
agricultural producers, had been mostly affected by government
macroeconomic measures and policies toward the liberalization of
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The protesters presented several proposals to the government
and parliament.
</P>
<P>
Growers of onions, potatoes, rice and other staples have been
affected by the opening up of domestic markets which permits the
import of products subsidized by the export countries.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government has signed an agreement with the
National Farmers Board promising measures to enable small and
medium-sized domestic growers and agricultural producers to face
the pressure of agricultural imports.
</P>
<P>
But the board said the government was not honoring its
commitment.

<P>
SANTIAGO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said today that his visit to Chile is aimed at
improving the trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who arrived on Sunday, held a working meeting with his

Alatas said that although bilateral trade has been increasing
in recent years, it is still relatively small, just 395.7 million
U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount, Chilean exports and imports were 291.3
million and 104.4 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chile opened an embassy in Indonesia in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that an Indonesian business delegation organized by
the ministry of commerce will visit Chile soon.
</P>
<P>
During this visit, "We expect to conclude an agreement for the
promotion of investments" and also "to negotiate an agreement to
avoid double taxation", he added.

NEW YORK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average set another record on Monday, one session after it broke
the 5,800 mark.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, the gauge of the market's blue chips, rose to 5,905.47
in the early trading before pulling back to finish at 5,889.20,
which was still an advance of 50.68 points and a new high. The
index gained more than 66 points on Friday to post its first
record close since May 22.
</P>
<P>
Other major market indicators also advanced on Monday, with the
S&AMP;P 500-stock index setting its second-straight record and the New
York Stock Exchange composite index reaching its first record
since May 24.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rallied on Friday as two economic reports supported the
growing belief that economic growth is slowing sufficiently to
keep inflation steady without the need to raise interest rate by
the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported on Monday that business
inventories rose 0.4 percent in July, led by a 1.1 percent surge
in retailers' stockpiles.

JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian troops Monday
found one of the three people missing since 16 logging workers
were kidnapped by an armed gang last month in Indonesia's
easternmost province of Irian Jaya, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Frans de Wanna, head of the kidnap relief team, said
the hostage was very weak when he was found not far from where he
was kidnapped in central Irian Jaya, the Antara News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
A group of about 50 armed men raided the base camp of Pt.
Kamundan Raya, a logging company, 60 kilometers north of Timika on
August 14 and kidnapped 16 workers.
</P>
<P>
After the abduction, two hostages escaped separately while two
others were released to deliver a letter to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
On August 30, Indonesian troops rescued nine of the 12 hostages
held by the Security Disturbance Group.
</P>
<P>
The troops are continuing their efforts to find the other two
workers, Frans added.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Businessmen Seek Ransom to Help Free Kidnapped Couple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Dutch entrepreneurs are
trying to raise funds to pay the ransom for two of their employees
who were kidnapped in Costa Rica on August 25.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapped Dutch couple, Huite Sierd Zijlstra and Jetty
Cuors, were working at the Altamira Hacienda company, an
enterprise exploiting forestry resources in the north of the
country, when they were kidnapped by a Nicaraguan group who
demanded a 1.5-million-U.S.-dollar and 2-million-colon (9,500
dollars) ransom.
</P>
<P>
Police said the kidnappers were members of the former
Nicaraguan counter-revolutionary forces "Contras" who fought
against the Sandinista government in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers may have moved into Nicaragua where they may
keep the Dutch couple captive, police said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are being held near the Altamira Hacienda company
located in a mountain area near the Nicaraguan border.
</P>
<P>
Two intermediaries, a priest and a Nicaraguan, had to move
along the roads in a vehicle to contact the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The ransom has been reduced to less than 1 million dollars, the
priest said today. But the exact amount has not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Some sources say the amount might be between 500,000 and
800,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two Dutch entrepreneurs still have to consult with the
Dutch owners of the enterprise to decide how much they can pay for
the ransom.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Spend Two More Days at Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin will spend two more days in Moscow's Central Clinical
Hospital for medical tests before his planned heart surgery, the
president's press office said today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin broke a long Kremlin tradition of secrecy about the
health of Moscow's leaders earlier this month when he said he was
going to have a heart bypass operation to improve blood supply to
the heart. Doctors will decide later this month when to operate.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin is reported to have invited experienced Western
cardiologists to join a special medical team to discuss how best
to treat the president, who had two heart attacks last year.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old Yeltsin went into hospital last Friday for
medical checks which, his aides said, were routine before such
operations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's operation has prompted speculation about who will
control the country when he has his operation, and who will hold
the "red button" triggering Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said last
week that Yeltsin was considering options but gave no clue as to
who it could be.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Russian NTV commercial television said Yeltsin might
hand over the "nuclear button" to Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin only for as long as was unconscious during surgery.
</P>
<P>
"We have learnt from Kremlin sources that just before the
operation starts the president will sign a decree handing over the
"nuclear button" to Viktor Chernomyrdin for a very short period of
time," NTV said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, the prime minister takes over
as caretaker ahead of new elections if the president is
permanently incapacitated. But the 1993 basic law makes no mention
of a temporary handover of power.

HELSINKI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Europe's national coaches
are against deciding matches with sudden death extra time, apart
from Czech Dusan Uhrin, trainer of the only side to have lost the
final of a senior competition with such a "golden goal".
</P>
<P>
The controversial sudden death issue and a need for more
support of national team trainers by clubs emerged as main
concerns on the first day of the UEFA national coaches convention
in Copenhagen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed things like the golden goal and they're almost
all against it. Even Berti Vogts, who won the European
championship with the golden goal, doesn't like it," said the
European soccer body's technical director Andy Roxburgh.
</P>
<P>
"Dusan Uhrin, who is the only one to lose with the golden
goal, is for it. It's a paradox," the former Scotland manager,
who organised the convention, told a press briefing.

<HEADLINE> African Progress Slow But Steady: Ghali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- African countries have
consistently taken appropriate actions to achieve sustained and
sustainable growth and development, according to U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
In his mid-term report, delivered today, on the U.N. New Agenda
for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, Ghali said that thanks
to the actions taken by African countries, the African continent
has achieved signs of "tangible progress."
</P>
<P>
A significant improvement in overall economic performance is
that the number of countries achieving the target of a 6 percent
annual GDP growth rate, suggested by the New Agenda, increased
from three in 1992 to 12 in 1995, and the number of countries with
negative growth dropped from 19 in 1993 to three in 1995.
</P>
<P>
There has been a growing commitment to regional and subregional
economic cooperation and integration, since the agenda was adopted
in December 1992, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reforms have been made to boost agriculture and improve access
to food by the poorest groups as well as programs to safeguard the
environment and address population issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
African countries, for their part, need to acknowledge that
"Africa's future is in their hands," according to the
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Turning to capacity-building, Ghali said that African countries
need to improve health care systems, intensify efforts towards
universal primary education and literacy, integrate population
policies into their development strategies, address problems of
unemployment and empower women to participate fully in the
development process.

<HEADLINE> UN to Initiate Big Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
said today that it was going to initiate a vast Internet service
expected to contain 270,000 documents in six languages by December
in its effort to become an organization suitable for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"You can call up and find out what the most recent thing that
happened in the Security Council or you can ask about rainfall and
it is there," said Joseph Connor, the under-secretary-general for
administration and management.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the 400 efficiency measures designed to cut costs
and improve services in the world organization.
</P>
<P>
With mountains of paper still the main means of communication,
Connor said its was time for bureaucracy as well as most
governments in the world to change work habits.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he also pointed to widespread travel by U.N.
officials, saying much of it could be replaced by audio-visual
conference hook-ups.
</P>
<P>
"This organization does not always consider whether travel is
necessary or not," Connor said at a press conference. "I told the
Security Council members this morning that you don't have to wait
for Mr. Blix to come over on his planned trip," he said in
reference to Hans Blix, the director of the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
"They can have him on hand any time they want him," he added.
"But you've got to get people comfortable with the methodology.
It is worth pursuing and it's really cheap."

<HEADLINE> Burundi Urges End to Economic Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's U.N.
Ambassador today called for an end to economic sanctions against
his country, saying that the measures were leading to severe
shortages of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to the international community to help
Burundi get rid of this nightmare imposed by neighboring
countries," Ambassador Nzanze Terence said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"This is penalizing the very innocent people, children who are
not guilty of any crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that sanctions had led to drastic shortages
of food, fuel and medicine and that farmers were unable to bring
their produce to the market and food prices were soaring.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's African neighbors imposed economic sanctions last
month after a Tutsi major, Pierre Buyoya, seized power.
</P>
<P>
Although Buyuya has said that he would reinstate the National
Assembly and lift a ban on political parties, African countries
have not moved to ease the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> UK, US, French Defense Ministers Meet on Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
Michael Portillo held talks with his American and French
counterparts, William Perry and Charles Millon, here this evening
to discuss the continuing crisis over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting held at a military base near London, Perry
briefed Portillo and Millon on talks he had in Bahrain, Kuwait,
Turkey and Saudi Arabia over the latest developments about Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the U.S. defense
secretary warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to stop deploying
anti-aircraft missile units in the extended southern Iraqi no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein poses a threat to our airmen, not only by the
six missile firings carried out in the past days but also by the
aggressive deployment of mobile surface-to-air missile units in
the southern sector," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
Perry noted that U.S. President Bill Clinton had warned that
the United States reserved the right to take any action against
Iraq and "our position still stands."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British defense chief Portillo said that the three
countries agreed to prevent Iraqi forces from threatening their
planes.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is very important for Saddam Hussein to understand
that he should not take actions which affect the safety of the men
flying those planes," Portillo said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Introduces Bill to Counter US Helms-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government
introduced legislation in the House of Commons today to counteract
the U.S. Helms-Burton Act that punishes foreign companies doing
business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The legislation amending the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures
Act (FEMA) will give Canadian companies more legal tools to defend
themselves against U.S. court claims under Helms-Burton, said
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision in July to
suspend the right of U.S. companies to sue, "the act is still in
effect, and remains a serious breach of international law," said
Axworthy who was quoted by a government news release.
</P>
<P>
"These amendments send a strong signal that we are not backing
down, and that we are prepared to take strong measures to protect
both Canadian interests and international law," Axworthy noted.
</P>
<P>
Becoming law in 1985, the FEMA was designed to defend Canadian
interests against attempts by foreign governments or courts to
apply unreasonable laws or rulings in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The proposed FEMA amendments allow the Canadian attorney
general to issue "blocking" orders declaring that judgments handed
down under any objectionable foreign law, such as Helms-Burton,
will not be enforced or recognized in Canada.
</P>
<P>
They also permit Canadians to recover in Canadian courts any
amounts awarded under those foreign rulings, along with their
court costs in Canada and the foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Under the Helms-Burton Act, U.S. nationals may launch lawsuits
in U.S. courts against Canadian and other foreign firms allegedly
"trafficking" in property expropriated from these American
citizens by Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for restrictions on temporary entry into the
U.S. of corporate officers of these companies, along with their
spouses and minor children.
</P>
<P>
Executives at Canada's Sherritt International Corp. have
already been told that they and their families will be barred from
entering the U.S. as of August 24 because of the mining company's
ties with Cuba.

LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets
extended their gains last Friday and closed higher today, with
London and Frankfurt hitting new records, supported by a strong
start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
British shares closed at another record high of 3,977.2, up 9.3
points, as Wall Street's strength continued to bolster London.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the FTSE 100 index had briefly set a new
all-time high of 3,980.8 before slipping back again.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the psychological 4,000 level seemed a
probability in the near term.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks closed the session 33.91 points
higher on the DAX-30 index, a new record, boosted by a firmer
dollar which made German exports more attractive.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse had started the session flat before recovering
in the morning and finishing up 5.82 points, underpinned by rising
bond prices, a stronger franc and a stronger Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 9.3 points higher at 3,977.2. The Frankfurt

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on Support to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador
Wang Xuexian to the United Nations today urged the international
community to extend its helping hand to Africa, whose economy, he
said, remains rather weak.
</P>
<P>
Wang delivered his statement today at a U.N. meeting for the
Mid-Term Review of the United Nations New Agenda for the
Development of Africa for the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Five years after the New Agenda was adopted, he said, the
African continent, as a whole, is yet to be lifted out of
difficulties. Its economic growth remains rather weak. Its share
in the world's total exports has dropped. Many African countries
are plagued by shortage of financial resources, heavy debt burdens
as well as lack of improvement in the worsening environmental
problems and the living standards of their people.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is faced with the real risk of being marginalized while
the integration of the world economy is accelerating," he said.
</P>
<P>
It must also be noted that the objectives set forth in the New
Agenda are far from being achieved, he said. The international
community is yet to fulfill the commitments made to African
countries in some key areas of the New Agenda.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, he said that official development assistance by
the developed countries continues to drop, producing a negative
impact on many African countries.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community and organizations of the
United Nations to take sincere and concrete actions for African
countries. "Effective measures should be adopted to alleviate the
debt burdens of African countries and increase capital flows into
Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is continuing to unswervingly support the African
countries in their efforts for economic development and
nation-building, and conduct cooperation with them in various
forms and through various channels.
</P>
<P>
China will be prepared to make greater contributions to the
development of Africa when it grows stronger itself, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Palestinian Workers to Be Allowed into Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister
Dan Meridor today announced the government intention to increase
the number of Palestinians working in Israel to 50,000, but he
warned that it would be harder to find work.
</P>
<P>
Meridor made the announcement following the first session of
the Israeli-Palestinian Joint Economic Committee held in
Jerusalem. He said the government also intends to liberalize
import licenses in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meridor said that even though more workers will be allowed
into Israel, in addition to the 37,000 permits granted to
the Palestinians, they will find it more difficult to find
jobs due to the large number of foreign workers currently
working in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
February and March which left more than 60 dead and more than 150
wounded, hence barring tens of thousands of Palestinian workers
from returning to their jobs inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Due to the closure, Israel has brought in a large number of
foreign workers from Romania, Thailand and other countries to
fill the vacant positions left by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Following today's meeting, Palestinian National Authority's
Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Maher Masri warned that the
poverty caused by the seven-month closure will always work against
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The closure has reportedly caused great economic difficulties
in the Palestinian self-ruled areas, and Palestinians estimate
losses from the closure at two to three million U.S. dollars
a day from salaries alone, and about the same in loss of
trade.
</P>
<P>
Masri also complained that Israel has created more difficulties
for Palestinian businessmen in traveling in the region, saying a
special committee will be set up to address the hardship.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed a new Palestinian directive
cautioning against partnership with Israeli companies unless the
Palestinians retain a 51 percent share in the business.

<HEADLINE> French Far-Right National Front Refuses to Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- France's far-right National Front
(FN) has refused to yield to intensive condemnations from both the
left and the right and instead marked several winning points in its
local electoral plan last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The candidates of FN will be present next Sunday at the second
round of municipal elections in Toulon and Chaville, Upper Seine,
while its president Jean-Marie Le Pen further radicalized his talks
on "racial inequality."
</P>
<P>
Gerard Bauer from the FN was now on top of the candidates for the
mayor of Toulon in the first round of election last weekend with
34.41 percent of votes, against 22.1 percent of the candidate of the
ruling Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR), Philippe Videl.
</P>
<P>
In Chaville, Sophie Brissau, director of communication of FN, won
18.11 percent of votes in the first round of election, four points
more than her last running, against 32.31 percent of RPR candidate
M. Badre.
</P>
<P>
The FN organized a big demonstration last Saturday in Marseille
to protest the killing of a 14-year-old boy, young Nicolas, by a
15-year-old naturalized Moroccan immigrant.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was condemned by all political groups of
France, and a survey made by the Liberation daily showed today that
two in three Frenchmen and Frenchwomen were "shocked" by Le Pen's
racist talk.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen defied by declaring on television Sunday evening that
"all races are equal, but some are more equal than others."
</P>
<P>
He also launched an offensive against the "establishment" by
accusing it of "letting the fire fighters that we are to walk on
loose stones."
</P>
<P>
"If you jump into the water to save a baby, they call you a
pedophile," he said.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen also announced that he would make another speech to
consolidate his stand on September 29 at the "Blue-White-Red
festival" held annually by FN in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old FN president earlier accused the Minister of
Justice of trying to impose censorship on free thinkings by
proposing tougher laws against provocation of violence, hatred and
racial discrimination.

<HEADLINE> UN Office in Geneva Cutting Operating Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Office at
Geneva (UNOG) announced Monday that it is shedding 200 posts as its
contribution to the major streamlining and cost cutting measures
underway throughout the UN system.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the UNOG reforms to permanent missions in Geneva, the
UNOG Director General Vladimir Petrovsky said that by the end of 1997,
there should be around 1945 posts at the UN in Geneva, down more than
nine percent from the current 2147 posts.
</P>
<P>
Staff reductions are being achieved through a combination of freeze
on recruitment, normal departures, early retirement and redeployment.
The move is expected to produce 29 million U.S. dollars of savings.
</P>
<P>
The cost cutting programs, announced earlier this year by UN
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, total 154 million dollars for
the 1996-97 biennium budget. The Geneva Office's share of this amounts
to 35.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other cost cutting measures which are being undertaken by the UNOG
include tighter control over the production and distribution of
documents.
</P>
<P>
UN staff are being directed to make greater use of e-mail and the
optical disk system to access documents while diplomats of permanent
missions here are encouraged to use new technologies to obtain
official documents.
</P>
<P>
The combined effect will be a 10 percent reduction in the volume of
documentation for 1996 compared to 1995. Maintaining this trend
through 1997 will produce a cost saving of 5.4 million dollars for the
biennium, the UNOG said.
</P>
<P>
Petrovsky emphasised that the commitment to cut costs would
continue although there were limits to the amount that could be saved
without compromising the quality of service provided at the UN
building in Geneva which is Europe's major centre for conference
diplomacy, hosting on average 15 intergovernmental, technical or
expert meetings each working day.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Chief Optimistic over EMU Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, Governor of the
Bank of England, has expressed his conviction that the City of
London is likely to "reap large benefits" from the European
Monetary Union (EMU) even if Britain is not a founder of the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a Financial Times interview, George said: "I feel
that European Monetary Union is an absolutely huge opportunity for
the City (of London)."
</P>
<P>
The Governor stressed, " But I am making two assumptions about
that. Firstly, that we are technically ready, which I see no
reason at all why we won't be. The second is that negotiations
continue in a constructive way, mutual interest kind of way."
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the current dispute between Britain, France
and Germany over access to a future European Union (EU) interbank
payment system threatened to undermine co-operation between
Europe's central banks and create an unnecessary split between
members and non-members of the EMU.
</P>
<P>
The French and German governments are insisting that countries
outside EMU should have limited access to the new payment system,
known as Target, according to separate reports.
</P>
<P>
George said that the access issue was "trivial" in itself, but
it was symbolically significant given current efforts by French
and German banks to gain commercial advantage by restricting
non-members' access to the payment system.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time something was being introduced into the EMU
discussion which is discriminatory for a non-monetary reason and I
don't see why the situation should develop into a split between
the `ins' and `outs'," he added.

<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General Urges More Support to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Africa has made
significant progress in key sectors over the past five years, but
it needs greater commitment at both the African and international
levels to consolidate these gains.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed here today by UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali in a mid-term report on the UN "New Agenda for the
Development of Africa (NADAF) in the 1990s", which was adopted in
December 1991.
</P>
<P>
The international community should provide "adequate and
assured resource flows" to Africa, said the Secretary-General in
his report.
</P>
<P>
A deeper commitment to a "dynamic partnership" between Africa
and the international community is critical to the realization of
the continent's potential over the coming years, Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
The international community must improve the "level, scope and
modalities of aid" and take "additional and decisive measures" to
resolve Africa's debt crisis. It must also take concrete steps to
help African countries adjust to the new global market
environment, he said in his report.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General noted that financial flows to Africa over
the first half of 1990s "stagnated at a level below what was
expected," with net flows of official development assistance to
the continent declining from 25 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 23
billion U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At this critical point, Ghali said, the international community
should accelerate its support in order to sustain the momentum
leading to recovery and sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Religious Leader Calls on Army against US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ali
Khamenei today called on the Iranian armed forced to protect his
country against plots of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, said
that the responsibility of the armed forces is to "promote justice
and cut off the hands of illogical power seekers".
</P>
<P>
Khamenei criticized the United States for "interfering with the
international affairs of the Persian Gulf, obeying the law of
jungle and following the logic of barbarism."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fact that the United States, with its long
geographical distance, is ordering Iraq what to do or what not to
do, is an example of following the law of jungle.
</P>
<P>
Addressing commanders and officials of the Islamic
Revolution's Guards Corps (IRGC), Khamenei warned "our enemies
are trying to take the banner of justice-seeking from us."
</P>
<P>
"They want to force us confess that we will no longer seek
justice in the world and claim that all efforts made by the
Moslem nation of Iran to propagate Islamic values and uphold the
supremacy of the Almighty God had been in vain," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the Iranian
supreme leader indicates that the fear of Iranians for potential
military attack against Iran are growing as the United States is
increasing its military build-up in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranians worry that the U.S. forces might launch military
attack on Iranian targets after they crash Iraq.
</P>
<P>
To confront with such military threat, Khamenei tried to beef
up military capabilities and boost combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
He said:"Islam is not a means in the hands of hegemonic
people but is a means directed against those seeking power. The
Iranian armed forces are now in the front of confronting power
seekers."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: General Election Determines Lebanon's Political Pattern (I) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's 1996 general
election from August 18 to September 19, which gives birth to a
128-seat parliament with a four-year term, has determined the
political pattern of this country in several years to come.
</P>
<P>
Results of the fifth of the five-phased elections in the Beqaa
Sunday has not yet been officially announced, however.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics showed that an electional coalition
brokered by Syria won 22 of 23 seats in the constituency,
leaving the last one to a candidate close to Prime Minister
Rafik al-Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The coalition includes representatives of the country's two
major Shiite groups, the moderate Amal movement led by House
Speaker Nabih Berri and the fundamentalist Hezbollah, six
governmental ministers and several incumbent parliamentary
deputies.
</P>
<P>
A political observer in a foreign diplomatic mission in Beirut
said today that the general election has positive effects on the
political stability in the country, which was once devastated by a
15-year civil war and repeated foreign aggressions.
</P>
<P>
He described the election as a "continuation" of a process
launched by the 1989 Taif Accord on national reconciliation, which
put an end to the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The accord, named after Taif city in Saudi Arabia, changed the
pattern of power distribution in Lebanon inherited from the French
mandate. It weakened the privilege of the Maronite Christian
communities and expanded political role of the Moslems, both
Sunni and Shiite.
</P>
<P>
The first effect the general election's outcome has brought
about is consolidating the position of the Sunni Prime Minister
Hariri and the Shiite House Speaker Nabih Berri in the parliament
in particular and in Lebanon's political life in general.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and Berri have become the heads of the two largest
blocs in the next half-Christian-half-Moslem house, making them
the most-favored candidates respectively for the premiership and
the speakership after the new parliament inaugurates.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, thanks to their powerful blocs, with each having
some 30 members, the two leaders will find that they are not
dispensable for each other and have to be hand in hand to make
their decisions workable.
</P>
<P>
The second effect is strengthening a Syrian influence in
Lebanon, and enhancing the Syrian-Lebanese cooperation on
regional and international issues, especially their coordination
and commitment to a unified position in the peace negotiations
with Israel.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: General Election Determines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Israel's failure to drive a wedge between the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks in the past, the Jewish state will find it even
more difficult to achieve this aim following the general elections
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The next house is to be dominated by major blocs, including
the pro-government ones respectively led by Hariri, Berri and
Druze leader Walik Jumbaltt, and opponent ones led by former
minister Suleiman Franjieh and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Without an exception, all these blocs have close relations
with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon with a 35,000-strong
force deployed on its lands.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources also mentioned a Syrian role in sponsoring
and forging electoral alliances during Lebanon's general
election, especially its successful mediation to bring about a
coalition between two major Shiite groups, the Amal and
Hezbollal, in southern Lebanon and in Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
The third effect of the elections is a cripple of opposition
forces, especially Maronite Christian opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders represented by former President Amin
Gemayel, former Army Commander Michel Aoun and former Deputy
Raymon Edde, all Maronite Christians and living in exile in
France, had called on a boycott of the election before it
started.
</P>
<P>
The call did not draw a positive response from the rank and
file and the average turnout in the five rounds of elections was
officially put at 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The turnout in the last parliamentary election in 1992 only
amounted to 13 percent, because of a boycott observed by most
Christians and some Moslems in protest against the presence of
foreign troops on Lebanon's soil.
</P>
<P>
Among the winners, only Hezbollah could constitute an
important opposition since it will have a nine-deputy bloc,
including seven Hezbollah members and two allies in the next
parliament.
</P>
<P>
But compared with its 12-strong bloc of eight Hezbollah
deputies and four allies in the outgoing parliament, the Shiite
fundamentalist party's power has remarkably shrunk.
</P>
<P>
To what extent Hezbollah will wield its limited influence
is also in doubt due to the fact that the nine seats were
ensured only after it formed a coalition with the Shiite giant,
Berri's Amal movement, under the mediation of Syria rather than
Iran, the party's sponsor.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Development of Renewable Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
this evening that the Chinese government has always attached
importance to the exploitation and use of the renewable sources
of energy.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Luo Gan made the remarks while delivering a
speech at the world solar summit, which is sponsored by the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) and opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Luo is attending the two-day summit on behalf of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, a member of the 17-member World Solar
Commission, which was set up in September last year to boost
worldwide the development and use of renewable sources of energy
like solar, wind, geothermal, tidal and biomass energies.
</P>
<P>
Luo said, China's principles in the development of energy
resources are energy conservation, greater energy efficiency and
widest possible substitution of renewable energy sources for oil,
coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels, whose reserves are
running out.
</P>
<P>
China began large-scale exploitation of biogas in rural areas
as early as in the late 1950s and incorporated the exploitation
and use of solar energy into its national plans in the mid 1970s.
</P>
<P>
And, after the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the Chinese
government explicitly stated that China will exploit and
popularize renewable sources of energy in light of specific local
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Renewable sources of energy have now become an indispensable
and integral part of China's current energy system, Luo said,
adding that various kinds of renewable energy provide an
equivalent of 300 million metric tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
Renewable energy sources have now played an important role in
promoting national economic development, alleviating the
shortages of conventional sources of energy in the remote and
border areas and reducing the damage to the eco-environment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China has put the stress in the rural areas
in the development of renewable sources of energy.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that in this respect the third world countries
should formulate applicable policies and programs in accordance
with their national conditions and strengthen the south-south
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the UNESCO, the United Nations Development
Program and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP),
among other international organizations, to strengthen
coordination and mobilize all sorts of financial and material
resources to support the development of renewable sources of
energy.
</P>
<P>
One of the power giants in the world, China produces 1,000
billion kwh of electricity a year. However, 120 million of its
1.2 billion people have no access yet to electricity. They all
live in the rural and remote areas.

<HEADLINE> Election Results in Eastern Lebanon officially </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 12 (Xinhua) -- An electional coalition
brokered by Syria scored a overwhelming victory in elections in
the Beqaa on Sunday, the fifth and last of a five-phased general
election in Lebanon, the state-run Lebanese National News Agency
said this evening.
</P>
<P>
The results were scheduled to be officially announced by
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr at
8:30 p.m., but have been delayed for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
The coalition comprising representatives from Lebanon's two
major Shiite groups, the Amal movement and Hezbollah, six
governmental ministers and several incumbent deputies, won 22 of
23 seats in the constituency in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Only one of the 23 candidates on the list of the
"National Concord and Unity" coalition, Al-Hussein Hassan
Al-Hojeiri, was defeated, leaving the seat to Ismail Sukkariya,
an independent candidate supported by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Sukkariya had been in the strong coalition, whose victory
had been undoubtedly predicted, but his name was deleted from
the list and replaced with that of Al-Hojeiri at request of
Hezbollah in a bid to reduce Hariri's weight.
</P>
<P>
The quarrel lasted until the last moment and forced Damascus
to exert pressure upon the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Syria had earlier intervened to bring about a coalition in
southern Lebanon between the two rival Shiite groups, and it won
21 of 23 seats in the elections, leaving two to Bahia Hariri,
sister of the prime minister and Mustafa Saad, who was backed by
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
A total of 132 candidates were competing in the Beqaa for the
23 parliamentary seats, and the voter turnout was officially put
at 52 percent, the highest since the first round of election
started on August 18.
</P>
<P>
The turnout remained relatively low during the day and
amounted to only 21 percent at 4:00 a.m., but suddenly
multiplied in the last hour before the scheduled close time.
</P>
<P>
The polling had to be extended for two hours to allow crowding
voters to cast their votes, an unprecedented event in Lebanon's
history.
</P>
<P>
Among the winners in Sunday's elections are three Hezbollah
candidates and two of its allies, adding the number of
Hezbollah's bloc in the next parliament to nine.
</P>
<P>
The Beqaa is a stronghold of Shiite Moslems, and Hezbollah
maintains a number of military training camps in the valley
for its guerrillas, who are fighting Israeli troops in a
southern Lebanon border strip.

productivity last year the organization achieved a zero budget
growth and reduced staff by nearly 10 percent, to the lowest level
since 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Four hundred efficiency projects have been identified and while
77 percent are still under way, 23 percent have been implemented,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"While those efforts will not transform overnight the
Secretariat or its management culture that took decades to create,
it will, incrementally, bring about a major shift in how the
United Nations conducts its business," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The slashing by 13 per cent of the volume of documentation and
publications since January is regarded described as the top
achievement in the field of cutting cost by the report.
</P>
<P>
Other major achievements include participation in the
information super-highway with a new, more user-friendly United
Nations Home Page on the internet and the reduction by more than
one quarter as well as that of the costs of administering travel.

<HEADLINE> France Pays Attention to Security of Kuwait: de Charette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette said this evening that France pays attention to the
security of Kuwait and the stability of the Gulf region as well.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Sabah
al-Ahmad al-Jabah in Paris, de Chrette recalled that France has
been engaged in the protection of the security of Kuwait for six
years since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jabah said that Kuwait has the right to ask any country with
which it has defense agreements to deploy additional forces on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the additional deployment of U.S. troops in
Kuwait following the heightening of tension in the region this
month.
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept the dismantling of Iraq, but at the same time
we don't accept to be victims of an aggression," said al-Jabah.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated his stand that Kuwait would not authorize U.S.
troops to move around its territory to launch an attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been this kind of declarations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the defense ministers of the United
States, France and Britain held a meeting this afternoon in
London, during which the three reached a "total convergence of
views" on the protection of allied aircraft over the no-fly zones
in Iraq, according to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blasting in Saudi Air Base Amounts to 30,000 Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The bomb that blasted a
complex at a U.S. air base near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on June 25,
killing 19 American soldiers, was equal to as much as 20,000 to
30,000 pounds of dynamite, a Pentagon report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the Pentagon said investigators studied
the force of the blast which left a crater 35 feet deep and 85
feet wide and shattered windows as much as a quarter-mile away and
found that the likely yield of the bomb was "20,000 to 30,000
pounds of TNT-equivalent explosives".
</P>
<P>
It was six times the size of previous estimates that had put
the bomb at 3,000 to 5,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
The massive size of the bomb, which was held in the back of a
fuel truck and parked next to the complex before it was detonated,
was determined to be a military-type explosive with a
military-grade detonator.
</P>
<P>
The report, completed late last month by an assessment team led
by retired Army Gen. Wayne Downing, found that a lack of attention
was given to protect U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Downing, appointed by President Bill Clinton to take on the
study, said in the report the Pentagon can do more to protect its
troops.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that insufficient attention is being given to
anti-terrorism measures and force protection," Dowing wrote.
</P>
<P>
Dowing said in the report that the Pentagon should establish
a singly office to take on troops protection.

<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The embassy of Thailand in
Nigeria is closing its mission from October 1 this year for
"economic reasons", the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted sources close to the embassy as saying that
the mission was shutting down for now not because of any strain
in relations but because of economic reasons, and it may resume
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The mission, according to the official news agency, has
intimated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since July of its
intention to shut down.
</P>
<P>
Representation at the mission in Nigeria has not been at the
ambassadorial level over the last five years. It has been running
by charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigeria does not have a resident mission in Thailand,
and a mission in the Philipines oversees Nigeria's interests
in the Asian country.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Health Minister Condemns US for Impeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Minister Omed
Medhat Mubarak condemned here today the United States for
impeding the oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the
U.N. in May.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference here that the suspension of the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal aggravated the health
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"It is inhuman and unfair ... it is a unilateral decision made
by the U.S. administration," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq could export two billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over a six-month period. And about 1.13
billion dollars could be used to purchase food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that allocations under the oil deal would have
definitely helped ease sufferings of the Iraqi people caused by
the U.N. sanctions on Iraq following it's invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that the breakdown of sewage systems, lack of pure
water and latest frequent cuts in power supply further
aggravated the health situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has announced the suspension of implementation of the
oil-for-food deal following Iraq's military intervention in
fightings between two Kurdish rival factions late last month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces fired missiles at selected air defense systems
in southern Iraq early this month in retaliation for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's attack against Kurds in northern
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Call for Incentives to Use Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today called on world governments to introduce incentives
that facilitate the development and maximum use of renewable
energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
In his statement to the two-day world solar summit in Harare,
Chiluba said there is need for renewed political will to harness
natural resources for the improvement of the people's quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
He said solar energy is the answer to most of the
socio-economic problems in developing countries, where more than
2.4 billion people have no access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
Senegalese Prime Minister Habib Thiam said solar energy has
brought hope for development in many African rural areas which
have no access to grid electricity.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the world solar summit will nourish this hope for
development through the use of solar technology and translate it
into a reality that can relieve destitution," Thiam told
delegates to the first world solar summit which began in Harare
today.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to governments, international donors and other
world bodies to help alleviate poverty through the provision and
development of solar and other renewable energies in
disadvantaged areas.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, who outlined the solar energy
projects currently underway in his country, called on the
international community to work together to implement the world
solar program to be launched at the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said Namibia has a great challenge to provide
electrification to over 200,000 rural homes which have no access
to conventional energy.
</P>
<P>
The world solar program (1996-2005) outlines some 253 national
high priority projects that will be implemented to promote the
use of solar and other renewable energies.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that the United Nations was in the
midst of a dramatic transformation, which had been neither smooth
nor easy.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the work of the organization released here
today, he noted that the process began with the abrupt end of the
cold war, when the bipolar system suddenly collapsed.
</P>
<P>
With that collapse came a new hope that the promise of the
Charter of the United Nations could be renewed, that an
international system based on collective security, shared values
and cooperatives problem-solving could finally be achieved, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"Expectations for the United Nations were too high at the
outset of what must inevitably be a long and difficult process,
for after every major conflict in history has come to a close, it
has taken years, sometimes a generation or more, to put in place a
workable and enduring international system," the report said.
</P>
<P>
New forms of international cooperation had been required and
continued to take shape. New rules, concepts and procedures were
emerging case by case, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The structures of the United Nations were being streamlined and
opened, the organization streamlined and deregulated, costs
reduced, accountability strengthened and performance improved. In
the past five years alone, the distance traveled had been great,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Reaffirms Stand with US against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today reaffirmed
its position to stand side by side with the United States and to
protect its territory against any possible aggression.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by Kuwaiti Information Minister Sheikh Saud
Nasser Al-Saudi Al-Sabah at a press conference here, attended by
dozens of correspondents from many parts of the world to cover
the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the confusion in the international media about the
Kuwaiti position, he said: "I want to make quite clear here
beyond any doubts" that a joint meeting held by the parliament,
cabinet and military leaders today had come to an "unanimous
decision by us all to accept ... ... all the arrangements
we discussed with the United States."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there should also be no doubt whatsoever
about "our intention to deter any possible aggression against
Kuwait and our resolve to stand with our allies against this
dictator is beyond any doubts," a reference to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we will go to any extension to guarantee the
security and stability of Kuwait" and to avoid the repetition of
the 1990 Iraqi invasion.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to further action Kuwait would take in response to
U.S. requests, the minister said: "I believe that the situation
now is that if there is any other arrangement that needs to be
taken in consultation with our allies, we will not hesitate to
take."
</P>
<P>
He said that "all of the arrangements are within the scope of
the joint defense agreements that we have with the United States
and our major allies."
</P>
<P>
On how long the U.S. forces will stay here after they arrive,
the minister said it would depend on the situation and whether
the Iraqi threat is cleared.
</P>
<P>
When asked what Kuwait would do if the United States launches a
further strike against Iraq and requests Kuwait's support, the
minister said the situation will dictate.

<HEADLINE> France Plays Appeasement Role at Defense Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- France played a role of
appeasement to avoid an escalation of tension in the Gulf during
the meeting of defense ministers of the United States, France and
Britain in Northolt, England, this afternoon, said the French
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, French Defense Minister Charles Millon
reminded his U.S. and British counterparts, William Perry and
Michael Portillo, of France's stand that "it is essential to avoid
an escalation," said the ministry in a communique.
</P>
<P>
"France has very firmly made it clear to Baghdad its stand.
This appeal has been, it seems, been understood. The Iraqi
decision to suspend all military activities against allied
aircraft deployed for Provide Comfort and Southern Watch missions
is a signal of appeasement, which should be taken into
consideration," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Millon told Perry and Portillo that France, being a member of
the Western coalition, is loyal to its allies and particularly
concerned about the security of its pilots, according to the
communique.
</P>
<P>
"France has made it clear that any threat to the pilots would
justify a proportionate reaction from our part, which relates to
the right of defense," it said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gets Police Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who is seeking re-election, today accepted the
endorsement of the country's largest police organization and
described himself as a proven crime-fighter.
</P>
<P>
"For four years I've worked hard to stand with the police
officers of America and I am profoundly honored that they have
decided to stand with me for four more years," Clinton was quoted
as saying in Cincinnati, Ohio, by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Clinton won the endorsement of the 270,000-member National
Fraternal Order of Police after receiving a government report
showing an increase in gang prosecutions and a drop in violence
during his term.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his travel to Ohio, Clinton said in the Oval Office
that the progress report on an anti-crime initiative launched in
1994 is "further evidence that our efforts are actually working."
</P>
<P>
"We've made a good start in fighting violent crime and gangs,
but we must keep going," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole unveiled
his anti-drug, anti-crime agenda in Pennsylvania and criticized
Clinton's record, particularly the rise in teen-age drug use on
his watch. Dole's agenda includes proposals to double federal
funds for prison construction and to require inmates to work off
the cost of their incarceration and compensate their victims.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department report cited a 58 percent increase in
the number of gang-related prosecutions under federal racketeering
laws and an overall drop in murder, rape, robbery and aggravated
assault during 1994 and 1995. Clinton said those numbers are a
direct result of his strategy to put more officers on patrol in
American neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
"We have a straightforward approach: more police on the
streets, guns and drugs off the streets," Clinton said. "We have
to have a community-based approach to this, but the government must
do its part as well."
</P>
<P>
Clinton was to return to Washington tonight, travel to Michigan
and Illinois on Tuesday, Arizona on Wednesday and hit the West
Coast again late in the week.

PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe today hailed the normalization of relations with Australia
during a meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we have new bases for a new relation between
Australia and France," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Australia strongly protested the nuclear tests France conducted
in the South Pacific in the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.
The dispute led Canberra to ban French aircraft producer Dassault
from bidding for the construction of some 40 military training
aircraft for Australia.
</P>
<P>
Downer, who arrived in Paris Sunday, today also met with his
French counterpart, Herve de Charette, who said the visit "allows
one to turn a page and write on a new page" in relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Australian foreign minister praised France for "being
extremely helpful" in bringing about the success of the
negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly President on UN Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
50th session of the General Assembly today expressed the hope that
the financial crisis of the United Nations will begin to be solved
early next year.
</P>
<P>
President Diego Freitas Do Amaral, a Portuguese, made the
remark while summing up the work of the current session, which is
drawing to an end today.
</P>
<P>
"I very much hope that the financial crisis of the U.N. will
begin to be solved at the beginning of next year," the president
told a press conference today. "If it won't, I can see big trouble
coming over the United Nations." But he did not elaborate on how
to resolve the chronic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president also declined to give his view on the question of
who will become the secretary-general of the 51st session, an
issue also attracting worldwide attention. He said that it will
be for the General Assembly to elect the new secretary-general.
"Let the proper organs decide, according to the U.N. charter, who
the next secretary-general will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the United Nations, he said that very big
progress has been made on matters related to working methods and
transparency of the Security Council. On the enlargement issue, he
said, two major points of progress have been made.
</P>
<P>
First, the proposal that the enlargement should consist only in
the entry into permanent membership of Japan and Germany alone has
been dropped. "Nobody suggests any longer that the enlargement can
consist only of the entry of Germany and Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, a proposal that emerged during the session is the
so-called permanent rotating membership. "The idea is that instead
of having five permanent members, you should have five permanent
seats, one for each regional group." He described the proposal as
interesting and deserving observation of the next session.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly president praised different working
groups, which he said have done very good and hard work during the
whole year. "We deliver to the 51st session well advanced work in
almost all working groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the working groups have been much more difficult, he
said. Those are the working group of the financial situation of
the United Nations and the working group of the reform of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"I am informed that more than 50 percent of the draft reports
of the working groups have been agreed upon. It means that
governments agreed on a lot of important things," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Managers Suffer Stress at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- About 90 percent of managers
in Britain believe their job-related stress is adversely affecting
morale, health, efficiency at work as well as their personal
relationship, according to a survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, jointly conduted by the Institute of Management and
a health products manufacturer, said that the main causes of
managers' stress are unreasonable deadlines, office politics and
the strain of firing someone.
</P>
<P>
But those stressed managers are keeping silent because
admitting to stress is seen as a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 1,100 managers interviewed complained of
overwork, compared with 40 percent in a similar survey in 1993.
Half of them said they did not look forward to going to work,
against 38 percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey said poor stress management meant inefficiencies,
lost production and absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 270,000 people are taking time off because of
work-related stress, representing a 7 billion pound (11 billion
U.S. dollar) annual cost in lost production and meeting health
payments.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the business community to abandon the macho and
heroic image of stress and encourage greater cooperation and
support," said Roger Young, the institute's director-general.

<HEADLINE> UN Strengthens Capacity of Preventive Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations'
capacity for preventive diplomacy has been strengthened and a
preventive deployment force authorized, U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said.
</P>
<P>
In an annual report on the work of the organization released
today, Boutros-Ghali said that the U.N. had worked to bring peace
and security to a world in which conflicts and confrontations
within states were now more prevalent than wars between them.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever summit meeting of the Security Council in
January 1992 and the subsequent report to the council on an Agenda
for Peace launched an international debate on the role of the
United Nations in maintaining international peace and security
under these new circumstances and engendered an ongoing process of
initiative, discovery and reflection, he noted.
</P>
<P>
While traditional U.N. peacekeeping has continued to prove
effective in conflict situations between states, the U.N. has
worked to adapt its peacekeeping instrument to deal with internal
conflicts through more complex, multifaceted operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
These incorporated elements of traditional peacekeeping with
political, social, economic, humanitarian and human rights
aspects, an approach that has proved most successful where
conflicts were being resolved through process of negotiation, but
had encountered setbacks where war situations continued, he said.
</P>
<P>
"An important part of these efforts has been to advance United
Nations cooperation with regional organizations in peace and
security on an ad hoc basis and under Chapter VIII of the
Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Another important dimension has been a new emphasis on
post-conflict peace-building -- linking conflict control and
resolution with action to address the roots of conflict and
strengthen the basis for reconstruction and development," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declines to Rule Out Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today still declined to rule out air strikes against Iraq
despite its announcement last Friday of suspending firing at U.S
and allied aircraft over the no-fly zones in northern and southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the White House today that the United
States sought "no confrontation with Saddam Hussein," but avoided
a conclusive statement on whether the likelihood of striking was
diminishing.
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that we limit Saddam Hussein's ability to
threaten his neighbors, that we do it with the no-fly zone and
that we keep our pilots safe," the president said when asked if
Iraq's decision to stop firing could forego any immediate U.S.
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. intelligence was still getting
"mixed" signals on Iraq's air defense movements in the south and
Washington would continue its buildup, including plans to send
3,000 or more troops to Kuwait from Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
"We are not standing down," he told reporters. "Whether air
strikes will be necessary or not will very much depend on Saddam
Hussein's actions, not his words," he said.
