	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police fired warning shots and tear
gas and mobs burned army tents and several cars Saturday during
rioting and student protests against the government.
	   At least 10 people have died this week in the worst violence
since unrest ousted former President Suharto in May after 32 years
of authoritarian rule.
	   Protesters say a government assembly on political reform is
being dominated by Suharto's camp, making prospects for true
democratic change unlikely.
	   Young men set military tents afire in the street near Parliament
and burned vehicles at the University of Indonesia, where students
had gathered to mourn friends killed in clashes with security
forces. Riot officers tried to disperse them.
	   Meanwhile, about 3,000 students gathered at a mosque for a
memorial service for a victim. Other funeral services were planned
Saturday.
	   The mourners, arriving in buses, waved red and white Indonesian
flags and chanted their hatred of Indonesia's military chief, Gen.
Wiranto.
	   On Friday, his troops unleashed an arsenal of plastic bullets,
tear gas and water cannon on stone-throwing protesters in two days
of clashes near Parliament.
	   ``Hang Wiranto,'' the students shouted, jeering at police
officers on the side of the road.
	   During the fighting Friday, a policeman accidentally shot and
wounded a navy marine in the leg.
	   On Saturday, protesters again converged near Parliament, where a
government assembly had endorsed reforms that critics say stopped
short of promised democratic change.
	   Late Friday, the nation's highest legislative body backed a plan
by President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, to hold
parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed to name Suharto
in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Members of the People's Consultative Assembly say the decree
will bolster an ongoing investigation of the wealth of the
77-year-old former president.
	   Students reject the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto. The assembly also did not heed their demand that
the military be banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military directly appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.
	   Opposition groups and student leaders said Habibie had lost his
credibility as a leader and demanded the military return to
barracks.
	   ``The government has lost any legitimacy it had,' The Jakarta
Post quoted Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, a former Cabinet minister, as
saying.
	   Many of the dead were students shot with plastic-coated bullets.
Military chiefs have ordered their troops not to carry live
ammunition.
	   In May, as many as 1,200 people were killed in the rioting that
forced Suharto to relinquish power. Those riots erupted after
troops shot dead four student protesters.
	   Habibie expressed his condolences to the families of this week's
victims, describing the dead as ``victims of the reform process.''
	   Squads of troops were on duty at main intersections across the
city Saturday.
	   They were also guarding the presidential palace as well as the
green-domed Parliament where the assembly earlier passed the
decrees.

Graf upsets Hingis, joins Davenport, Seles and Tauziat in Advanta
</HEADLINE>
semis &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Unseeded Steffi Graf, already
recovering from wrist surgery, overcome a sore leg Friday to upset
second-seed and defending champion Martina Hingis and move on to
the semifinals of the Advanta Championships.
	   Graf defeated Hingis 6-2, 4-6, 6-0 after having to leave the
court momentarily for medical treatment on a pulled led muscle.
When she returned, Graf quickly retook command, allowing Hingis
only eight points in the final five games.
	   Graf will meet sixth-seed Nathalie Tauziat, who downed Amanda
Coetzer 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in one semifinal matchup Saturday. No. 1 seed
Lindsay Davenport, the top-ranked player in the world, and
fifth-seeded Monica Seles, also winners Friday, will face off in
the other.
	   The win for Graf continues an impressive streak since returning
to the tour last week at the Leipzig Open after a two-month layoff
from wrist surgery. Graf beat Tauziat 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday to win
that tournament.
	   Graf said qualifying for the Chase Championships in New York
next week, which happened Thursday thanks to Seles' defeat of Ai
Sugiyama, helped her get over her leg cramp.
	   ``While they were working on it I just tried to tell myself to
go for everything and go as long as you can,'' said Graf, who has
competed in just 12 tournaments this season. ``After making the
(Chase) Championships, I felt I had nothing to lose. The only way
to beat her is to go for my shots.''
	   It paid off particularly against Hingis' serve, which Graf broke
eight times in 12 attempts to run her record to 6-1 lifetime
against Hingis. As for her sudden run of success, after a
frustrating injury-plagued year, Graf really has no explanation.
	   ``I've had it happen many times, showing up at a tournament with
no preparation, coming off an injury and winning,'' said Graf. ``In
1996 I came to Wimbledon and arrived the Saturday before the
tournament and won that.
	   The loss hurts Hingis' chances of overtaking Davenport as the
top-ranked player in the world.
	   ``I don't know what happened (Graf) with the injury,'' Hingis
said. ``But after she came back she pulled into another gear.
	   ``I haven't played against her in two years, so I didn't know
what would happen.''
	   Davenport had to overcame a slow start to defeat Amy Frazier
5-7, 6-3, 6-3. A point away from being down a set and a service
break, the 22-year-old Davenport rallied to victory to ensure a
meeting with Seles in the next round of the dlrs 450,000 tournament
at Villanova University.
	   Seles had little trouble with her doubles partner, Natasha
Zvereva of Belarus, in a 6-0, 6-1 win.
	   ``She played some great tennis,'' Davenport said of Frazier, who
came through qualifying. ``Luckily it didn't continue.
	   ``I kind of toughed her out. That's something I've learned to
do. The better players when they're not playing their best have to
dig down deeper to pull it through.''
	   Seles needed just 40 minutes to win her match. Zvereva claimed
she wasn't bothered by a strained left thigh which was heavily
wrapped.
	   ``I just got on Natasha from the beginning and played really
well,'' said Seles, avenging a crushing defeat to Zvereva at
Wimbledon. ``She never had a chance to get into the first set.
	   ``In the second set I didn't give her too many free points and
was able to win pretty easily. But Lindsay should be a really good
test for me,'' he added.
	   After splitting sets, Tauziat, a Wimbledon finalist this year,
gained the decisive advantage when she broke Coetzer's serve at 2-2
in the final set, then served it out. Tauziat screamed in delight
when Coetzer netted a backhand return on her third match point.

Stock investors on Fed watch are safe no matter what
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICIA LAMIELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It doesn't matter what the Federal Reserve
decides next Tuesday about interest rates _ stocks should do well
into the end of the year even if Greenspan and Co. don't push rates
lower for the third time in less than two months.
	   That prediction comes from Wall Street analysts who, despite
their apparent nonchalance, are still taking sides around the
crystal ball.
	   One side argued this past week that the Fed will again lower
rates in a bid to prop up recent fragile advances in foreign
financial markets. Another camp believes the Fed's priority is the
domestic economy, which continues to hum and doesn't need the
stimulation that lower rates would provide.
	   The Fed first lowered its target for the federal funds rate, the
interest charged on overnight loans between banks, by 0.25
percentage point in late September.
	   On Oct. 15 it followed with a surprise cut of 0.25 percentage
point in the discount rate, which it charges its member banks, to
4.75 percent. It also dropped fed funds another 0.25 percentage
point to 5 percent.
	   Invoking years of history from the annals of Fed-watching, many
economists believe the Fed won't stop with two small rate cuts but
clip them again Tuesday.
	   Although they ended up supporting domestic stock prices, both
earlier cuts were aimed more at propping up weak global markets
than they were at Wall Street, said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald in Darien, Connecticut.
	   A third rate cut could finish the job, by giving an extra boost
to foreign currencies that have been rising against the dollar and
to fixed-income markets in places like Korea and Thailand, where
interest rates have fallen dramatically. It would be especially
important to Brazil, which won a commitment from the International
Monetary Fund Friday for financial assistance worth dlrs 41.5
billion.
	   ``It's not going to do a heck of a lot of good to the emerging
markets to provide dlrs 42 billion for Brazil, or to keeping things
on a relatively even keel here, if the Fed fails to lower rates one
more time,'' Meehan said.
	   A rate cut would lower corporate borrowing costs and could
stimulate further domestic economic growth and support corporate
profits, both happy outcomes for the stock market.
	   But while bond investors are counting on a rate cut and have
priced it into bond prices, it may not be so crucial for stocks,
other analysts said.
	   On Friday the Commerce Department said retail sales advanced a
strong 1 percent in October, the biggest increase in five months,
indicating consumers are still confiden as they head into the
holiday season. That prompted some analysts to assert that the Fed
won't risk stimulating inflation by easing credit, or lower rates,
again.
	   By not easing, Fed bankers would send a signal that they believe
the economy is strong and that the stock market doesn't need their
help. And stock index figures would bear that out. The Dow closed
Friday's session at 8,919.59, up 89.85, but down 55.87 for the
week. That is below its all-time closing high of 9,337.37 on July
17, but up 18 percent from 7,539, where it closed Aug. 31 after
Russia stunned the world by devaluing its currency by 85 percent.
	   ``It is the return of confidence to the market that would make
them not ease,'' said Charles H. Blood Jr., senior financial
markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman and Co.
	   Peter Anderson, chief investment strategist at American Express
Financial Advisors in Minneapolis, said there is a 50-50 chance the
Fed will ease Tuesday.
	   One reasonable position, Anderson said, is that ``things are
looking better, we may not a need to cut, there's a bubble in the
economy and further easing would exacerbate it.''
	   But, Anderson said, ``real economies overseas are still fragile
and may need further bolstering.''
	   Anderson said the Fed might cut rates another quarter-point on
Tuesday but then say this will be the last cut for three or four
months. ``I think the market might take that negatively.''
	   And Blood believes the Fed may compromise, which it is famously
able to do, by cutting fed funds another quarter-point to make it
even with the discount rate at 4.75 percent. ``That would be one
way of conveying the idea that we're basically finished,'' he said.
	   The Standard and Poor's 500 rose 8.03 to 1,125.72 Friday, but
was down 15.29 for the week.
	   The Nasdaq composite index declined 3.07 to 1,847.99 Friday and
8.57 for the week.
	   The New York Stock Exchange composite rose 3.61 to 556.17 Friday
but fell 8.93 for the week; and the American Stock Exchange
composite rose 1.48 to 668.36, and fell 2.44 for the week.
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.84 to 389.36
Friday and 10.96 for the week.
	   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and Nasdaq issues, closed at dlrs 10.31 trillion Friday,
down dlrs 147.887 billion for the week. A year ago the index was
dlrs 8.82 trillion.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs set a military truck and army
tents on fire and hurled stones at police Saturday as street
violence escalated following deadly student protests.
	   Police tried to disperse crowds with tear gas and warning shots.
	   At least 10 people have died this week in the worst violence in

	   Students had gathered there to mourn friends killed in clashes

to gather at the front gates.

to entrench Habibie, the military and the ruling Golkar Party.

Triumphant king leaves Cambodia for Beijing

 &UR; BY KER MUNTHIT &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A day after brokering a watershed
deal for a new coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen, a
triumphant King Norodom Sihanouk left Cambodia on Saturday for
routine medical treatment in Beijing.
	   In sharp contrast to the quiet arrivals and departures of
Sihanouk during the political turmoil that has swept his country
for more than a year, the ailing monarch was sent off at the
airport by an enthusiastic crowd including Hun Sen and his
rival-turned-coalition partner, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   A light rain could not dampen the jovial spirits of the king,
who lingered at the airport's VIP terminal for more than
half-an-hour chatting and joking with diplomats and politicians.
	   ``This is a great honor for our nation. We have reconciled and
become united,'' Sihanouk said of the compromise struck between Hun
Sen and Ranariddh.
	   The longtime political enemies had been locked in a
three-month-long stalemate since Hun Sen narrowly won a July
election. The prince finished a strong second in the polls and
refused to give Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to
approve a new government.
	   Sihanouk's initiatives to bring the bitter rivals to the
bargaining table bore fruit this week when Ranariddh returned to
Phnom Penh on Thursday for a hastily convened summit meeting at the
royal palace.
	   The deal concluded Friday will make Hun Sen sole premier in a
coalition government of his ruling Cambodian People's Party and
Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh served as joint premiers in a government
formed after 1993's U.N.-supervised election, but Hun Sen ousted
his rival in a violent coup d'etat last year.
	   The prince will become president of the National Assembly, even
though Hun Sen's party holds 64 of the chamber's 122 seats.
	   Key to the compromise was an agreement for a constitutional
amendment creating a new Senate in the legislature to be led by the
president of Hun Sen's party, Chea Sim. The king will initially
appoint the Senate's members.
	   Chea Sim, the outgoing National Assembly president, will retain
in his new position his powers as acting head of state when the
king is outside the country, a privilege Hun Sen was reluctant to
give Ranariddh.
	   The breakthrough should see the rapid formation of a government
and encourage international aid donors and businesses to resume
operations in poverty-stricken Cambodia, which is in desperate need
of economic assistance.
	   It could also hasten the country's entry into the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold by the regional body last year
after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh.
	   Sihanouk flew to Beijing for a routine medical examination.
Although he said at the airport that he would return to Cambodia if
needed, it is unclear how long the monarch will remain in the
Chinese capital.
	   The 76-year-old king suffers from a variety of illnesses and
often makes extended stays in Beijing for treatment from his
Chinese doctors. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it
has since gone into remission.

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Randy McKay scored his second
goal of the game with 5:07 to play to lead the New Jersey Devils to
a 4-3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday night in referee
Paul Stewart's first NHL game since beating colon cancer.
	   Brian Rolston and Jason Arnott also scored as the Devils blew a
3-0 lead and lucked out on a couple of goal posts before winning
for the eighth time in 10 games.
	   Chris Terreri stopped 17 shots in winning his third game in as
many starts. A last-second pass through the crease by Jaromir Jagr
glanced off the goal post.
	   The night also belonged to Stewart, who was diagnosed with
cancer in February, underwent surgery in June and then
chemotherapy. He started his comeback with some work in the minor
leagues before making his reappearance in the NHL on Friday night.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Bruins 3
	   In New York, Dmitri Khristich scored with 1:02 remaining in the
third period to lead the Boston Bruins to a comeback tie against
the New York Rangers.
	   Don Sweeney intercepted a clearing pass from Ulf Samuelsson and
flipped a shot from the side boards that Kristich redirected with
his stick past Rangers goaltender Mike Richter for his seventh
goal.
	   Steve Heinze took advantage of a turnover by Niklas Sundstrom to
pull the Bruins within 3-2 with his sixth goal of the season at
13:31 of the third period.
	   John MacLean scored a pair of goals for the Rangers.
 &UR; Stars 5, Red Wings 1
	   In Detroit, Joe Nieuwendyk's goal just seven seconds into the
game _ the fastest in franchise history _ started Dallas to victory
over Detroit in a matchup of NHL Western Conference powers.
	   Nieuwendyk also had two assists in a four-goal first period for
the Stars, now 2-0 this season against the two-time defending
Stanley Cup champion Red Wings.
	   Derian Hatcher, Darryl Sydor, Grant Marshall and Mike Modano
also scored as the Stars won for just the second time in their last
21 games at Joe Louis Arena. Darren McCarty scored for Detroit,
which beat Dallas in six games for last season's conference title
before sweeping Washington in the Stanley Cup finals.
 &UR; Avalanche 8, Lightning 1
	   In Denver, Joe Sakic scored his 900th career point, and Peter
Forsberg and Adam Deadmarsh each had two goals to lead the Colorado
Avalanche over the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   Sakic had a five-point game, scoring the first Avalanche goal
and adding four assists. He recorded his 900th point on his third
assist, a second-period goal by Forsberg, then extended his point
total to 901 with another assist in the final period.
	   Forsberg finished with four points as Colorado outshot Tampa Bay
45-18.
	   Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy had a relatively easy night,
making 17 saves. He lost his shutout bid at 16:49 of the third
period when Darcy Tucker scored a shorthanded goal.

Report: APEC draft communique calls for urgent handling of crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC, BC-APEC-US

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Leaders of Pacific Rim countries
urge ``special urgency'' to deal with the region's worst financial
crisis in 50 years, including shining more light on the operations
of secretive hedge funds, according to a report on a draft of the
group's final statement.
	   The draft final communique adopted a somber tone with the
leaders admitting the financial turbulence which began 17 months
ago in Thailand has been more devastating than anticipated both in
its intensity in Asia and its contagion effects around the world.
	   ``The regional financial crisis had economic and social
aftershocks more severe than anticipated, and similar problems have
appeared in other parts of the world,'' according to a report
obtained Saturday by the Japanese news agency Kyodo.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and other leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum are scheduled to issue the statement at the close
of two days of discussions next Wednesday.
	   Their foreign and trade ministers were meeting Saturday and
Sunday to work out compromises in final wording. The biggest issue
left unresolved was how far to go in lowering trade barriers in
nine sectors covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   U.S. officials would not comment directly on the Kyodo report,
but stressed that work was continuing on the final document. In
addition to the leaders' statement, the foreign and trade ministers
will issue their own joint declaration Sunday night.
	   The draft communique, according to Kyodo, said the leaders'
``welcome the conclusion'' of the trade package, but it leaves out
any details of what will be in the final package.
	   On hedge funds, the draft communique says the APEC leaders see
an urgent need for the group's countries ``to examine the questions
of appropriate transparency and disclosure standards for
private-sector financial institutions involved in international
capital flows, such as investment banks, hedge funds and other
institutional investors.''
	   The draft statement calls for creation of a task force to
``develop practical proposals in these areas.''
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the chairman of this
year's APEC meetings, has been a leading critic of the actions of
hedge funds in precipitating the crisis by sparking panicked flight
of foreign investors that leveled the economies of a number of
countries in Asia and of Russia.
	   But other countries have also called for greater scrutiny of the
operations of hedge funds, largely secretive, risky investment
funds that cater primarily to the very rich.
	   Hedge funds invest in currencies and other financial
instruments. In the United States, the near collapse of a fund
based in the state of Connecticut which suffered heavy losses
following Russia's August default on debt has generated calls in
America's Congress for greater regulation.
	   The reported draft communique also gave Mahathir a victory on
another issue, the conduct of international credit rating agencies,
saying they should be reviewed because of their recent performance.
	   On Friday, Mahathir gave a speech that blasted foreign credit
agencies that have downgraded Malaysia's credit rating, as
``negative and biased.''
	   But while Mahathir has been openly critical of the International
Monetary Fund's handling of the financial crisis, the draft
communique praised the IMF and other multilateral financial
institutions for the work they had done in combating the crisis.
	   It also praised the IMF's recent move to introduce greater
flexibility in providing emergency loans to stem capital flight, an
initiative of President Clinton.
	   While the United States has been lobbying for support for other
proposals to expand credit assistance to banks burdened with bad
loans and debt-strapped corporations in crisis countries, the
communique was more vague on that issue.
	   It did call for a comprehensive program of support for efforts
to strengthen financial systems, restore trade finance and
accelerate corporate sector restructuring.
	   On another Clinton effort to expand programs to support millions
of people plunged into deep poverty by the financial crisis, the
draft communique urged expanded assistance to strengthen social
safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable.
	   The APEC leaders also reaffirmed the group's commitment to
create a free-trade area among their countries by the year 2010 for
developing countries and 2020 for all APEC members.
	   The push to slash tariffs in nine sectors ranging from chemicals
to medical devices by 2002 represented an effort to make an early
down payment on that goal, but it has been bogged down at this
meeting by insistence of Japan that they cannot participate in two
politically sensitive areas _ wood and fish.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Saturday, the seventh
attack in as many days, security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of Sojod in
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south, the officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6:45 a.m.
(4:45 GMT) air raid. The region is about 12 kilometers (seven
miles) north of this southern market town.
	   Israeli planes have raided suspected bases of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah daily since Nov. 8.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the
occupied zone Israel set up in 1985 to stop cross-border attacks.

Red Sox sign Offerman for dlrs 26 million; Belle to meet with
</HEADLINE>
Steinbrenner &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Unable to re-sign Mo Vaughn, the Boston Red Sox
went out and agreed Friday to a dlrs 26 million, four-year contract
with Jose Offerman, never thought of as a huge offensive threat.
	   Meanwhile, Albert Belle said he met Thursday with Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette and intends to get together next week
with New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
	   ``These teams (Yankees and Red Sox) are really making the
decisions easy,'' Belle said Friday. ``They want to pay you well
and they want to put you in a situation where you can win. What
more could you want?''
	   Also Friday, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed reliever Alan Mills
to a dlrs 6.5 million, three-year contract, San Diego signed
outfielder John Vander Wal to a dlrs 1.75 million, two-year deal
and the Cleveland Indians traded pitcher Chad Ogea to the
Philadelphia Phillies for reliever Jerry Spradlin.
	   Belle, one of the most prized free agents, has until Dec. 2 to
go back to the Chicago White Sox under his old contract, which
calls for a dlrs 10 million salary in each of the next three
seasons and gives the team a dlrs 10 million option for 2002 with a
dlrs 5 million buyout.
	   He met Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, and said he's agreed to a
meeting with Steinbrenner, who is unsure whether Bernie Williams
will re-sign with the Yankees.
	   Belle said his first choice is to return to the White Sox, who
refused to give him a dlrs 1.42 million raise and allowed him to go
free. Another key White Sox starter, third baseman Robin Ventura,
also became a free agent.
	   ``I don't think they want me or Robin to return,'' Belle said.
``It just shows me there's no commitment to winning.''
	   After Vaughn turned down a dlrs 62.5 million, five-year final
offer, Duquette met with Belle and then signed Offerman, likely to
bat leadoff and see time at first base, second base and designated
hitter.
	   He led Kansas City with a .315 average and .403 on-base
percentage this year, stealing 45 bases, hitting seven homers and
driving in 66 runs. Offerman led the major leagues with 13 triples.
	   ``I'm real happy going to play in Boston,'' Offerman said.
``It's hard for me to say what position I'm going to play.''
	   Offerman, paid dlrs 2 million this season, gets a dlrs 1 million
signing bonus, dlrs 4.5 million next year, dlrs 5.5 million in 2000
and dlrs 6.5 million in each of the following two seasons. Boston
has an dlrs 8 million option for 2003 with a dlrs 2 million buyout.
	   Mills, who made dlrs 1 million this year, gets dlrs 1.25 million
next season, dlrs 2.25 million in 2000 and dlrs 3 million in 2001.
With the Dodgers, he reunites with Davey Johnson, his manager in
Baltimore in 1996 and '97.
	   ``I know what he can do as a manager and he knows what I can do
as a reliever,'' Mills said.
	   Vander Wal, acquired by San Diego from Colorado on Aug. 31 to
give the Padres another left-handed hitter off the bench, gets a
dlrs 100,000 signing bonus and salaries of dlrs 775,000 in 1999 and
dlrs 875,000 in 2000. He can earn another dlrs 200,000 per season
in performance bonuses.
	   Ogea, one of six starting pitchers the Indians had under
contract, became expendable with the emergence of young
right-handers Jaret Wright and Bartolo Colon.
	   Ogea, a 28-year-old right-hander, battled injuries all year and
went 5-4 with a 5.61 ERA in nine starts and 10 relief appearances.
	   ``Any team that I've ever played for I've felt we can win,''
Ogea said. ``Just because it's a team that is rebuilding doesn't
mean we can't win and we can't go to the playoffs.''
	   Spradlin was 4-4 with a 3.53 ERA in 69 relief appearances for
the Phillies, striking out a career-high 76 in 81 2-3 innings.
	   ``In Jerry Spradlin we have acquired a strong physical guy with
a power arm who could help us in the back end of our bullpen,''
Indians general manager John Hart said. ``Our scouts really, really
like this guy.''

Canadian government hosts Anwar wife, first of several high-level
</HEADLINE>
talks
 &UR; With BC-APEC
 &UR; By KEVIN COSTELLOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Canadian government invited to
a luncheon Saturday Anwar Ibrahim's wife, who is expected to start
meeting with leaders visiting Malaysia to talk about the plight of
her imprisoned dissident husband.
	   Anwar, once the No. 2 official in Malaysia, is on trial on
charges of abuse of power and sexual misconduct. Anwar, who has
denied the charges, says he is the victim of a political vendetta
orchestrated by his arch-rival, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``We want to use this opportunity to hear from you as to what
you think should be addressed on the agenda,'' Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy told Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, before
the luncheon in a luxury hotel.
	   Axworthy appeared to be referring to the agenda for the
preparatory talks among government ministers, and not the agenda
for the summit meeting of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group.
	   While Mahathir is fighting to keep the Anwar case out of the
summit, the trial of the former deputy prime minister is certain to
be a topic of discussion among the government chiefs.
	   Axworthy and his colleague, Canadian International Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi, met with Azizah shortly before they headed
in to prepare for the summit of government leaders from Pacific Rim
nations next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We're appreciative that you took the time,'' Axworthy told
Azizah. He said the Canadian delegation was looking forward to
hearing her ``ideas and views.''
	   Azizah, sitting quietly under a floral-patterned scarf in pastel
orange and green, gently brushed aside reporters who tried to ask
her questions.
	   Azizah, an ophthalmologist by training, has become the de facto
leader of Anwar's pro-reform movement.
	   In apparent retaliation for Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien's refusal to meet Mahathir, Malaysia canceled a previously
planned meeting between Trade Minister Marchi and his Malaysian
counterpart, Rafidah Aziz.
	   Anwar's wife is also scheduled to meet with visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, further infuriating the
Malaysian government.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was asked about
the likely meeting between the two women.
	   ``Of course we don't expect people to interfere,'' he said. ``If
she (Mrs. Albright) sees my statement she will understand. She is
here as a guest.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Friday did not rule out
meeting with Azizah.

Wanted: new leader for World Trade Organization

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization is looking for a new
leader at a time when international economic turmoil is casting a
shadow over its cherished open market philosophy.
	   For the past 50 years, trade has played a key role in boosting
economic growth. But many poor countries complain they are getting
poorer. And criticism among the rich _ over environmental and labor
issues, for instance _ is increasingly troublesome.
	   The four candidates for the job of WTO director-general are
under no illusions about the challenges ahead.
	   ``There are a number of fundamental issues facing the system,
issues which will seriously test our resolve,'' said former
Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren, one of the candidates.
	   The other candidates are former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore,
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Moroccan trade
ambassador Hassan Abouyoub. Each took a turn facing WTO members
this week in Geneva.
	   All concur the 132-nation WTO must do a better job in selling
itself than it has done since its 1995 start as a more powerful,
permanent version of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.
	   ``There is a view in some parts of the world that the WTO is
meeting in some nuclear-safe cave in Geneva,'' Moore said. ``With
some good management and a lot more listening, we can do a better
job'' of making the case for free trade.
	   The current incumbent, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, wants to step
down by April. Officials hope to make a choice by the end of
December.
	   The new leader will have to guide sensitive negotiations on
farming and services and a possible wider round of trade talks.
	   In recent speeches at the WTO's lakeside headquarters, would-be
leaders stressed their concern for the world's weaker economies.
	   Some diplomats predict the WTO will turn to one of the
candidates from developing countries _ Supachai and Abouyoub _ to
translate that into reality.
	   Supachai, who is also Thailand's commerce minister, pointed to
his experience in dealing with Asia's economic crisis and ``really
having gone through the process of boom and bust.''
	   All four say they want to speed up the entry of about 30
countries that have applied for membership, including China and
Russia. Beijing has been negotiating for the 11 years to join the
world's main trade forum.
	   There is also concern that, although the WTO works by consensus,
the procedure for implementing WTO rulings should be clearer.
	   The problem is highlighted by the threat of U.S. sanctions
against the European Union in a long-running row over bananas.
	   Washington and Brussels disagree on whether the EU has done
enough to comply with a WTO verdict last year that the EU's
favorable treatment of former and present colonies in Africa and
the Caribbean violated trade rules.
	   With a growing number of trade disputes being hauled before the
WTO, the credibility of its arbitration procedures is vital.
	   In the final choice of candidate, much will depend on the
choices of the United States and the European Union, the two
largest trading blocs in the organization.
	   Governments are eager to avoid a replay of 1994's leadership
contest, which degenerated into a regional fight.
	   Ruggiero, backed by Europe, eventually emerged the winner from a
contest in which Asian members favored Kim Chul Su of South Korea
and the United States and its allies pushed former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   ``We have a very open mind, and we're looking at all four
candidates,'' U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said.
	   European countries also have yet to decide on their man.
Australia, however, has thrown its weight behind Supachai, who also
has the backing of Southeast Asian countries.

More violence erupts in Indonesia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with funeral, Habibie in meeting with Cabinet. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs burned a military truck and army
tents and hurled stones at a police station in Jakarta on Saturday
in continuing street violence after a night of deadly protests.
	   Students buried friends killed in the overnight clashes with
security forces. The protests broke out this week against a
government assembly on political reform that students believe is
not serious about democratic change.
	   At least 10 people, most of them students, have died this week
in the worst violence in Jakarta since unrest ousted former
President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Riots at that time, fueled by discontent over Indonesia's
economic crisis, were set off when Suharto's military fatally shot
four student protesters at a rally.
	   While police fired barrages of warning shots and tear gas in an
attempt to disperse thousands of angry youngsters, President B.J.
Habibie held an emergency meeting with military chief Gen. Wiranto,
the defense minister, and other Cabinet members.
	   A statement was expected later in the day.
	   Neighborhood youths set military tents afire in the street near
Parliament and burned several vehicles, including an army truck,
next to the University of Indonesia. Students had gathered there to
mourn friends killed during the protests.
	   Police and soldiers who had used force to block hundreds of
students from marching on Parliament allowed hundreds of protesters
to gather at the front gates. The rally was peaceful.
	   Meanwhile, about 5,000 students gathered at a cemetery for the
funeral of Sigit Prasetyo, a 20-year-old student who was shot dead
Friday.
	   They watched as his casket, draped in a red and white Indonesian
flag and a traditional Islamic funeral cloth, was lowered in damp
red earth.
	   Mourners, arriving in buses, chanted their hatred of Indonesia's
military chief, Gen. Wiranto.
	   ``Hang Wiranto,'' the students shouted, jeering at police
officers on the side of the road.
	   On Friday, the troops unleashed an arsenal of plastic bullets,
tear gas and water cannon on stone-throwing protesters in two days
of clashes near Parliament.
	   During the fighting, a policeman accidentally shot and wounded a
navy marine in the leg.
	   Critics say the nation's highest legislative body stopped short
of promised democratic change, although it backed a plan by Habibie
to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed to name
Suharto in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Members of the People's Consultative Assembly, filled with
holdovers from the Suharto era, say the decree will bolster an
ongoing investigation of the wealth of the 77-year-old former
president.
	   Students reject the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto. The assembly also did not heed their demand that
the military be banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military directly appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.
	   Many of the dead in Friday's fighting were students shot with
plastic-coated bullets. Military chiefs have ordered their troops
not to carry live ammunition.
	   In May, as many as 1,200 people were killed in the rioting that
forced Suharto to relinquish power.
	   Habibie expressed his condolences to the families of this week's
victims, describing the dead as ``victims of the reform process.''
	   Squads of troops were on duty at main intersections Saturday.
They were gathered in force at the green-domed Parliament, where
the assembly passed 12 decrees that Habibie said would deliver
democracy and respect for human rights.
	   Students say the decrees of the 1,000-member assembly, which
includes legislators and presidential appointees, will only serve
to entrench Habibie, the military and the ruling Golkar Party.

United States loses public relations war in Mitch relief campaign

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The United States has been upstaged
by its southern neighbor in the eyes of Hondurans digging out from
the storm that killed an estimated 10,000 people across Central
America.
	   While Mexico's swift response to the disaster has been lauded,
the large but slow aid package offered by the U.S government is
seen as little more than the duty of the world's richest country.
	   Last week, President Bill Clinton called for a global relief
effort for Central America and gave orders boosting U.S. emergency
aid to dlrs 70 million. Then, Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice
President Al Gore, announced an additional dlrs 10 million.
	   Beyond the dlrs 80 million in emergency aid already promised,
Clinton planned Saturday to announce that the U.S. government will
offer dlrs 45 million in additional defense equipment and services
to help Central American nations.
	   No other country has given more, but Honduras was not impressed.
	   ``Of course we expect more from the United States. We have a
right to. Every Honduran would expect in a crisis to count on
Washington,'' said Moises Starkman Pinel, the minister of
international cooperation.
	   Mexico, meanwhile, was quicker off the block. Within days after
Mitch hit two weeks ago, Mexicans sent helicopters, cargo planes,
ships, rescue teams and a convoy of tractors and other heavy
machines.
	   ``People were overwhelmed by the size of the response from
Mexico, with all its limitations,'' Starkman said. ``They were not
helping with what was extra. They were helping with what they
really have.''
	   Underlying the seeming double standard is Honduras' perception
of itself as a U.S. dependent.
	   The coffee and banana industries, the country's two biggest
revenue sources, depend on U.S. customers. The third-largest source
is money sent home by Hondurans living abroad _ mostly in the
United States.
	   ``We are part of the American empire, this is the reality,''
said Delmer Urbizo Panting, minister of government and justice.
	   Part of the problem was that Washington seemed slow to react.
Mitch stalled over Honduras in late October, and by Sunday, Nov. 1,
it was clear that a catastrophe had occurred.
	   On Monday, the Clinton administration pledged dlrs 2 million in
food, medicine, water and other emergency relief supplies, plus
some dlrs 1.5 million for aircraft to help deliver it. Hondurans
expected more.
	   ``The impact of Mitch was not perceived properly in Washington,
probably because of the elections,'' on Nov. 3, minister Starkman
said.
	   Europeans and Asians also were on the scene quickly. Japan flew
in teams to rebuild bridges. France and Spain offered debt relief.
Germany, England, the Netherlands and other countries also were
present.
	   The Americans stepped up the aid _ and the battle for the media
spotlight. The government sent down Tipper Gore, wife of Vice
President Al Gore, who shoveled mud for the cameras and slept in a
tent. Hillary Rodham Clinton is coming next week.
	   ``We got the pilgrimage of personalities and announcements of
aid, but little action,'' said Thelma Mejia, editor of the
respected newspaper El Heraldo. ``The perception is that Mexico and
Europe care about the people, and the United States cares about
politics.''
	   Honduran officials don't want to seem ungrateful. Even if
Washington lost the public relations battle, its support is
indispensable.
	   ``The U.S. came through, it just took them a while,'' said
Starkman.
	   He paused. This wasn't over.
	   ``At least, they came through on the assistance side,'' he said.
``The rebuilding side is another story.''

Report: New Chinese rules tighten control on social groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ New regulations make it harder for Chinese
citizens to set up non-government groups, a human rights group
reported Saturday.
	   Although China's constitution guarantees freedom of association,
its laws have long curtailed this right. Under previous laws, all
groups must have official sponsors and government permission.
	   The new regulations make the requirements for setting up a group
more difficult, increase government supervision over citizens'
groups and prohibit groups that might be at odds with communist
ideology, New York-based Human Rights in China said in a report.
	   China announced the regulations in October, the same month it
signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
which affirms the right of freedom of association.
	   The rules on social groups prevent any from representing people
who have conflicts with the government or want to express dissent,
the report said.
	   Among other provisions, the new rules say a group must have at
least 50 members and funding of 30,000 yuan (dlrs 3,600) for a
local group and 100,000 yuan (dlrs 12,000) for a national group.
	   The report said these increased requirements would make it hard
for groups of low-income people to form.
	   The rules allow official interference in the day to day affairs
of social groups that is ``entirely unnecessary'' and ``an
unacceptable infringement of freedom of association,'' the report
said.
	   China's leaders say the country is moving toward what they call
``ruling the country in accordance with law.'' But the rights group
said the new legal system was no guarantee of basic rights.
	   The laws allow the government to deprive citizens of fundamental
rights and are written to leave officials with a wide range of
interpretation about what the laws mean in practice, it said.

Estrada opposes birth control, supports responsible parenthood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Saturday that he supported ``responsible parenthood'' over birth
control to cope with the problem of the Philippines' surging
population.
	   Estrada said the problem should be solved by boosting the
nation's productivity.
	   ``Perhaps the solution is in education, not birth control, I am
against that,'' he said. ``I am pro-life because we are 10 siblings
and I am the eighth child. If there had been birth control, I would
not have been born.''
	   In 1996, after the latest census was taken, the Philippine
Population Commission reported that three Filipinos were born every
minute, expanding the population to more than 70 million and making
the Philippines the 13th most populous country in the world.
	   In 1903, there were just 7.62 million Filipinos, fewer than the
population of metropolitan Manila today.
	   Estrada said China, with its population of 1.2 billion, is the
``best example'' of a large nation able to feed its people and
still export rice to countries like the Philippines.
	   ``What we need is to be more hardworking and not have a
care-free attitude or leaving work for tomorrow,'' he said.
	   Estrada did not say whether responsible parenthood would include
the use of artificial contraceptives, which is opposed by the
influential Roman Catholic church.
	   The administration of Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, pushed
family planning that promoted natural and artificial contraception.
That set off a conflict with the Catholic church.
	   In a statement earlier this week, the Catholic Bishops
Conference of the Philippines said it is opposed to the sex
education being taught in primary and secondary schools under the
government's population education program.
	   ``The responsibility for the sex education of children belongs
first and foremost to their parents,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Cabinet ministers from Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5
trillion in global trade, but Japan and the United States remained
deeply divided over a key provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and
fish _ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   Leaders of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
will meet in Malaysia on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the
free-trade agreement and a host of other issues, including the
global economic crisis that began in Asia last year.
	   In other developments:
	   _A Japanese news agency, which obtained a draft of the group's
final statement, reported Saturday that it urges APEC to deal
urgently with the global crisis and to closely examine the
operations of the world's secretive and risky hedge funds.
Investments by the funds have been blamed for the some of the wild
fluctuations in Asia's currency and stock markets.
	   -----
	   _Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC host who
favors some limitations on free markets, didn't put much importance
on the summit's outcome. He said some countries had tried to
politicize the economic meeting.
	   ``The APEC summit is important, but we should not place much
hope on it because there are others with a different agenda,''
Mahathir said in an interview with the Malaysian government
national news agency, Bernama.
	   ----
	   _Anti-government demonstrators who had promised to take to the
streets during the APEC meetings, which began last week, remained
absent from the streets of Kuala Lumpur. The activists have been
angered by Mahathir's ousting of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is
currently on trial for corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   On Saturday, the focus of the APEC meetings remained the dispute
over the proposed tariff agreement.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   APEC officials who met in Kuala Lumpur last Thursday and Friday
were unable to resolve disputes over the deal. So, on Saturday they
turned the issue over to their countries' finance and trade
ministers, who were scheduled to meet for two days.
	   The group was considering compromise proposals that would water
down the pact by allowing nations a longer time to cut tariffs, or
more flexibility in deciding which sectors to cover.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Japan's
foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, met privately just before the
ministerial meeting began Saturday.
	   A Japanese government official quoted Barshefsky as saying that
not only does Japan refuse to open its forestry and fisheries
markets, it also is discouraging other APEC member nations from
moving toward trade liberalization.
	   Komura repeated that Japan can't cut tariffs on fishing and
forestry because they are politically sensitive sectors that could
shake its government's political base, the official said on
condition of anonymity. Tokyo remains willing to participate in the
other seven sectors, he said.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Japan was not budging
during the talks, and that little progress was made. He also said
that some officials wanted to turn the discussion away from the
stalled free-trade pact and spend more time discussing Asia's
financial crisis.
	   Don McKinnon, New Zealand's minister of foreign affairs and
trade, said he feared a watered down tariff agreement.
	   ``There's a danger in trying to slice the salami too many
times,'' he said in an interview. ``I think then we lose sight of
the overall objectives.''
	   On Friday, Barshefsky insisted the United States was willing to
compromise, but said any agreement must include Japanese
participation in all nine areas. ``Token participation...by the
world's second largest economy doesn't cut it,'' she said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Australian umpire Hair not fair, say Sri Lankans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's top cricket official
criticized Australian cricket umpire Darrel Hair Saturday for
reporteded accusing spinner Muthiah Muralitharan of an illegal
bowling action, and asked the International Cricket Council to
penalize him.
	   Reports from Australia earlier this week said Hair threatened to
call Muralitharan for throwing if the bowler did not sort out his
bowling action before the Sri Lankans tour Australia in January.
	   ``We are deeply disturbed by the remarks made by Hair,'' said
Thilanga Sumathipala, president of Board of Control for Cricket in
Sri Lanka, told The Associated Press.
	   Sumathipala said by raising the issue a team of experts had
pronounced resolved, Australian umpire Hair has violated the
International Cricket Council's code of conduct.
	   ``We are making a protest to the ICC to take stock of the
situation and penalize the umpire,'' Sumathipala said.
	   Muralitharan suffers from a birth defect in his right arm. To
overcome the problem he uses an unusual double jointed wrist action
that makes it appear he is throwing.
	   Muralitharan, one of the world's top off-spinners, was first
called for throwing by Ross Emerson, one of two Australian umpires,
during a tour of Australia in 1995. During the same tour Hair
called Muralitharan for throwing seven times during a three-over
spell in the second Test.
	   To quell suspicion, Muralitharan underwent bio-mechanical tests
in Hong Kong and Australia.
	   Three Australian cricket specialists, Daryl Foster, David Lloyd
and Angus Burnett of the University of Western Australia cleared
Muralitharan after viewing films of his bowling.
	   ``It is clear that this apparent straightening of the bowling
arm was a visual illusion,'' the team said in a report. The
International Cricket Council then cleared Muralitharan.
	   But the issue has continued to crop up off and on. This is the
second time this year that someone has raised doubts about
Muralitharan's bowling action.
	   ``Hair must learn to be fair,'' said Sri Lanka's top cricket
commentators Elmo Rodrigopulle.
	   The 26-year-old bowler was not available for comment.

Irvine keen on Ferrari's chances in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BATHURST, Australia (AP) _ Ferrari No. 2 Eddie Irvine says he
has rejected several offers to leave the Formula One giant because
he is so impressed with plans for next season.
	   Irvine said he does not enjoy being the Italian team's second
driver behind German star Michael Schumacher but decided to keep
the job.
	   ``Next year's car will be a massive step forward,'' Irvine said
Saturday. After a slow start, Schumacher finished second behind
McLaren's Mika Hakkinen with the title chase going down to the
final race in Japan. ``Hopefully they don't make the same step we
do,'' Irvine said of McLaren.
	   Irvine said he stayed with Ferrari because of its potential.
	   ``A lot of the time I have to look after what Michael's doing
and help his race. I don't enjoy that at all but that's my job at
the moment,'' Irvine said. ``I've had offers to go to other teams
next year for better pay and a better position but I think next
year the fight will be between Ferrari and McLaren.''
	   Irvine was at Bathurst for Australia's biggest touring car race.

Two weeks after Mitch, many villages still cut off

	   LEON, Nicaragua (AP) _ Even in the best of times, it could take
a horse or an ox to reach many settlements in the dirt-poor
countryside of Honduras and Nicaragua. Now, with major highways and
many phone lines cut by Hurricane Mitch, there is no way to reach
them at all.
	   Enormous efforts are under way to reconstruct Central America
after an estimated 10,000 people died in Mitch's fury two weeks
ago. Yet with so many villages still unaccounted for, the full
scale of the devastation remains unclear.
	   ``It has not been possible to send aid to more than 300 small,
remote communities which remain incommunicado,'' Col. Guillermo
Pinel, president of Honduras' National Emergency Committee, said
Friday.
	   Red dots scattered across the map on Margarita Clark's wall show
villages still not heard from in Nicaragua. The Save the Children
charity worker said there has been no word yet from about a dozen
of the 148 villages the organization serves in two northwestern
provinces.
	   ``The access roads are still very full of mud,'' she said,
adding that one village, Versailles, is surrounded by the Casitas
Volcano mudslide that overwhelmed several villages and killed
hundreds of people.
	   Clark said she thinks many of those still cut off have food, but
she is worried that their drinking water is contaminated, which
could lead to outbreaks of disease.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop of Leon, Bosco Vivas Robelo, appealed
for people to come forward with names of Nicaraguan villages still
isolated. ``After 15 days, practically since the hurricane, they
think of themselves as abandoned brothers,'' the bishop said.
	   Nicaragua has confirmed almost 2,000 dead, with hundreds more
missing. Several hundred people also died in Guatemala and El
Salvador.
	   The death toll in Honduras is about 7,000.
	   ``The government is making efforts to rehabilitate the roads,
the bridges, the telephones and the drinking water systems in many
places, but it lacks resources enough to carry out urgent work,''
said Honduras' Pinel.
	   He said Honduras' own 14 military helicopters had been
supplemented by 16 from Mexico and 12 from the United States. But
they were not sufficient to both ferry aid and survey damage in a
country where the road system was almost destroyed and where 10,000
people remain missing.
	   Honduras announced Friday that it had received dlrs 67 million
worth of aid from 20 nations, though President Carlos Flores
Facusse has said the cost of rebuilding could top dlrs 4 billion.
	   Two or three aid flights were arriving each hour, and one or two
ships with supplies each day.
	   The commander of the U.S. Army's Southern Command, Gen. Charles
E. Wilhelm, announced Friday that the U.S. government will set up a
base at El Salvador's international airport to aid in the relief
effort.
	   An initial contingent of U.S. military engineers was set to
arrive Saturday to begin rebuilding roads and bridges destroyed by
the storm.
	   Wilhelm arrived in El Salvador on Friday to coordinate delivery
of 175 tons of food, clothing, medicine and water collected by the
nongovernmental organization Fischer House in New York City.

Hair said he received death threats over throwing incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian umpire Darrell Hair has
revealed he received death threats after calling Sri Lankan spinner
Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing in a test match in 1995.
	   Hair is under fire from Sri Lankan officials after saying he
would call the Muralitharan for throwing again in January if he
believes bowler breaks the rules.
	   Thilanga Sumathipala, president of Board of Control for Cricket
in Sri Lanka, said he would protest to the International board over
Hair's comments.
	   Hair, speaking on Australian radio Saturday, said he wished the
incident had never taken place.
	   ``I must admit I wasn't prepared for the consequences when they
occurred and it was very difficult at the time,'' Hair said. ``When
you start getting death threats in your mailbox it's obvious there
are some quite passionate people out there.''
	   Hair said he never felt threatened on the field but ``you're a
lot more vulnerable going about your personal life. You're probably
in more danger away from the ground.''
	   Hair said he had never spoken to Muralitharan about the
incident.
	   ``The only words that were spoken were during the throwing
affair,'' Hair said. ``Since then I haven't spoken to him at all
since that day.''
	   Hair said there would obviously be a lot of expectation
surrounding Muralitharan's return for a limited-overs series
against Australia and England. Hair is Australia's No. 1 umpire and
will officiate during the series.
	   ``To be honest I don't know what's going to happen. I haven't
seen him bowl since then,'' Hair said. ``What I will do is judge
everything as it happens _ I won't be going in with any
preconceived ideas.''

Blind cricketers from seven nations compete in World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sightless or nearly sightless players
from seven nations are ready to demonstrate that cricket can be a
game of sound and determination in the first international cricket
tournament for the blind.
	   ``For the players, it will be a dream fulfilled. It will
reinforce their achievement capabilities and make them role models
for hundreds and thousands of other visually handicapped people,''
said George Abraham, chairman of the Association for Cricket for
the Blind in India.
	   Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka,
Pakistan and host India _ all countries with teams among the
international elite of the sighted cricket world _ will compete for
the Kanishka Trophy in the tournament starting Tuesday. They use
special balls that emit a rattle to help batsmen direct their bats
and fielders know where the catch can be made. Players range from
the partially sighted to the totally blind. International umpires
will take part.
	   All seven nations have blind cricket domestic leagues, but this
is the first time an international tournament is being held,
organizers said. Each team will play six matches before the
semifinals.
	   There are no sponsorship bonanzas for the players, no fancy cars
to be won and no huge TV or radio audiences. But all that means
little to the players.
	   ``I love this game, it helps me face life more easily. I don't
care for anything else,'' said Anand Sharma, captain of the Indian
team. Sharma, a batsman his manager compared to sighted Indian star
Sachin Tendulkar, learned the game listening to radio commentaries
of international cricket matches.
	   In the background, fielder Veeresh Patel, guided by the loud
rattle of a ball lobbed high by a batsman, dived to his right for a
spectacular catch, ending dramatically prone on the grass.
	   ``I love to dive at the last moment and take a catch,'' Patel
said.
	   Players chuckled, shouted, scolded each other _ there cannot be
a moment of silence on the ground. This game is about sound.
	   The players play with a hollow plastic ball that rattles as it
moves, an ordinary cricket bat and iron stumps. Most rules are the
same as in international cricket, with a few modifications.
	   Bowlers shout ``ready?'' and wait for a ``yes'' from batsmen
before responding with a shouted ``play'' and flinging the ball.
	   Nearly 200 cricket tournaments for blind men are held each year
in India, and three for women.

Reports of killings, rapes in Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Indonesian troops killed scores of
villagers in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya in July and
raped and tortured many others, according to Australian newspapers
Saturday.
	   Reports in The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald said witnesses
and church officials gave graphic accounts of the violence in the
province, which has been the site of a separatist movement.
	   ``The atrocities ... allegedly began in a dawn raid on July 6
when Indonesian troops were brought in to crush defiant villagers
who had raised the flag of independent West Papua,'' one paper
said.
	   The reports said soldiers fired on a crowd of about 200
demonstrators as they slept beneath an independence flag on a pier
in the township of Biak.
	   ``Since then dozens of bodies have washed up on beaches around
the island and a task force sent to Biak by the Indonesian Council
of Churches says they are linked to the military's crackdown on
pro-independence supporters,'' one paper said.

Saddam says open to 'any initiative' that would end sanctions
</HEADLINE>

support, changes byline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Statements by the U.S. and Iraqi presidents
about the crisis over U.N. arms inspections suggest the two sides
are no closer to a compromise that would avert a threatened U.S.
military attack.
	   The comments Friday by Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton mirrored
past declarations made since the crisis began in August _ and
offered little room for compromise.
	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections, Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a
pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and
would accept ``positively any initiative'' that would lift the
sanctions.
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   They spoke amid widening fears in the Iraqi capital that a U.S.
military strike was imminent. Motorists jammed their cars by the
hundreds into gasoline stations, forming long lines to fill up
their tanks. Shoppers found some prices rising in Baghdad's crowded
markets.
	   On Saturday, the editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers
pleaded with the Arab world to back Iraq.
	   Al-Qadissiya pointed out that Iraq in the past sent troops to
aid Arab countries fighting Israel and urged them to reciprocate.
	   Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense
of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples
have to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its
confrontation against American threats.''
	   Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's uneasy Gulf neighbors _
have called for a diplomatic solution to the latest crisis. But
they also have insisted that Iraq resume cooperation with U.N.
inspectors or risk the consequences.
	   The official Al-Iraq daily had a similar argument.
	   It spoke of Iraq's ``helping hand'' to its Arab brothers and
sought help to prevent the United States from destroying its
industry and infrastructure.

	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart had his
best innings on tour but watched his side struggle against
Queensland Saturday on the second day of their four-day match.
	   Stewart, who had a pair of ducks in the previous match against
South Australia, scored 52. England, playing its final match before
the start of the five-test series against Australia from Friday,
was 182-7 at stumps in reply to Queensland's 209.
	   Adam Dale, who has played several limited overs internationals
for Australia, claimed 5-31 off 20 overs.
	   Dale had opener Michael Atherton caught behind for a first-ball
duck and bowled Mark Butcher with his sixth ball to reduce the
visitors to four for two.
	   He then snared three lbw victims _ Stewart, John Crawley for 27
and Robert Croft for none.
	   Stewart figured in a 100-run partnership with Nasser Hussain
(40) after England's early collapse. Stewart batted for two hours,
20 minutes.

Estrada crams for APEC meeting, concerned about lifting tariffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Saturday he has been cramming in preparation for next week's
Asia-Pacific leaders' meeting in Malaysia.
	   Estrada, who has been in office for only about four months, said
he has even refused speaking engagements to give more time study
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``I takes me up to 2 in the morning just to review and review
what I would be saying there because I don't want to cause
embarrassment,'' he said in his weekly radio program.
	   ``If I make a mistake there, it would not be the president that
would be put to shame but our countrymen, and our country, the
Philippines; that's why I am making sacrifices.''
	   He said he is new to the job but would be dealing with veteran
leaders, including those from the Philippines' partners in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   He said one subject he is studying closely is the issue of
lowering tariffs in the APEC member countries.
	   He expressed concern about demands by other APEC nations to
lower tariffs on selected products soon.
	   ``They want tariffs to be removed as soon as possible,'' he
said. ``If we allow agricultural goods to come in, our own
agriculture will collapse.''
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are expected to use the
APEC summit to press for a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   These would include chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, jewelry and fisheries.
	   Presidential spokesman Fernando Barican said the Philippines
will give full support to several APEC initiatives such as efforts
by international financial institutions to provide new loans
guarantees and other emergency credit for still ailing economies in
the region.
	   Manila also will support a Japanese initiative to provide dlrs
30 billion in loans and guarantees to help Asian governments
surmount debt burdens.

ASEAN officials satisfied with steps to counter currency crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations is satisfied with steps that already have been proposed to
solve the region's currency crisis, according to trade and
diplomatic officials.
	   ASEAN Cabinet officials said they do not plan to suggest any new
measures for inclusion in a statement on the financial crisis to be
issued this coming week by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.
	   Seven ASEAN nations are members of the larger APEC forum, which
is meeting this week in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The ASEAN officials said the most important issue now is
ensuring that enough money is available to cover plans to
restructure Asian debt.
	   In a meeting late Friday to coordinate policies among ASEAN
members of the APEC forum, the ministers said they agreed that
various recent proposals, including a Japanese dlrs 30 billion aid
package for the region and suggestions by the Group of Seven
industrialized nations, should be adequate for solving the regional
crisis, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said.
	   ``All these taken together would seem to be a sufficient
package,'' he said. ``What's important now is that enough money is
available.''
	   Thai trade minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said he welcomed the
G-7's proposals to grapple with recent financial market volatility.
The proposals include a new lending mechanism from the
International Monetary Fund, and the study of ways to regulate
hedge funds.
	   ``I said they should have done this around a year ago,'' he
said. ``But at least this is better than nothing. We have to
prevent recession or slowdown next year.''
	   Supachai said ASEAN hopes all APEC members will agree to a
nine-sector trade liberalization package that would cover an
estimated dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade. Japan has declined to
participate in two sectors, forestries and fisheries.
	   ``Our goal should be to get everyone on board,'' he said. ``If
that's not possible, then we have to find a way out. We discussed
referring it to the World Trade Organization,'' he said.

Canadian prime minister deplores violence in Indonesia, calls for
</HEADLINE>
restraint

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called
Saturday for restraint in Indonesia, where violent protests for
political reform have left at least 10 people dead.
	   ``I deplore that, and I hope everybody will show restraint and
make sure that there is no more violence,'' Chretien told reporters
in neighboring Singapore, where he is on a four-day visit.
	   Mobs burned a military truck and army tents and hurled stones at
a police station in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on Saturday
as students buried friends killed in clashes with security forces
over the past few days.
	   At least 10 people, most of them students, have died this week
in the worst violence in Jakarta since unrest ousted former
President Suharto in May.
	   Chretien said he will discuss the situation with Indonesian
President Habibie when they meet next week on the sideline of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia.
	   ``I hope (the government) will show restraint and will move
quickly to have the proper institution in place to have a democracy
that will be more acceptable to the population,'' he added.
	   Chretien said there are no immediate plans to resume an
evacuation of Canadian citizens from Jakarta. Thousands of
foreigners, including Canadians, were ferried out of Indonesia
during the unrest in May.
	   He added that he is not concerned about his personal safety
while visiting the region, despite the escalating Indonesian
violence, political unrest in the APEC host country of Malaysia and
tension in the nearby Persian Gulf.

Sosa delivers home run to lead major league stars to 9-0 win in
</HEADLINE>
Japan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa finally delivered what Tokyo fans had
been waiting for _ a home run _ to lead his team of major league
stars to a 9-0 shutout Saturday over Japanese baseball's best.
	   The Chicago Cubs outfielder, whose home run race against Mark
McGwire riveted Japan, slammed a three-run homer in the sixth, as
camera flashes blinked all over the Tokyo Dome filled with 55,000
fans.
	   The major leaguers now lead the seven-game series 4-2, with just
one game left.
	   Milwaukee Brewer second baseman Fernando Vina also had a
three-run home run, and Texas Rangers starter Rick Helling struck
out three and allowed four hits in five innings.
	   ``I feel like I'm in heaven,'' Vina said. ``I got a good piece
of the bat.''
	   Sosa's first at-bat in Japan, a warm-up against Tokyo's Yomiuri
Giants, was a homer, but he hadn't had one since.
	   Sosa, who also batted in the first run for the major leaguers in
the first inning Saturday with a hit to rightfield, has taken
center stage during the series.
	   He has been seen daily on Japanese TV blowing kisses with his
two fingers and is reportedly going to give batting lessons to
Yomiuri players.
	   Sosa has donated the proceeds from TV commercials he has made
here to help the victims of Hurricane Georges in his homeland, the
Dominican Republic, and he has asked a Japanese governor whether
temporary housing used after the 1995 Kobe Earthquake can be
shipped there, Japanese media reports say.

expressing concerns, wife saying Anwar is honored by attention;
CHANGES slug from Malaysia-Anwar's Wife
 &UR; By KEVIN COSTELLOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's foreign minister on
Saturday expressed his concerns about Anwar Ibrahim's treatment in
prison during a meeting with the Malaysian dissident leader's wife.
	   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy hosted Azizah Ismail to a
luncheon at the start of her expected round of talks with several
high-level leaders in the Malaysian capital.
	   Anwar, who was once deputy prime minister, the country's No. 2
official, claims he was beaten by police while awaiting trial.
	   Azizah's talks include a session with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright before next week's summit meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group (APEC) in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar is being tried for alleged abuse of power and sexual
misconduct. He denies the charges and says he's the victim of a
political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor and now
arch-rival, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy told reporters after the luncheon with Anwar's wife.
	   The foreign minister added: ``We have been meeting with a number
of people to get a briefing on what the situation is, (and)
expressed concerns with the treatment of Anwar and others
detained.''
	   In late September, Anwar sat in court with a clearly visible
black eye that he says he received during a police beating. The
government denies the accusation but has been investigating the
claim.
	   ``Anwar is very honored and proud that his wife is able to meet
with the Canadian officials,'' Azizah told reporters after the
luncheon. ``We are happy and encouraged by the fact that we have
been given a positive response.''
	   While Mahathir is fighting to keep the Anwar case off the agenda
of the APEC summit, the trial of the former deputy prime minister
is certain to be a topic of discussion among the 21 visiting heads
of state.
	   Foreign Minister Axworthy and his colleague, Canadian
International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi, met with Azizah shortly
before they headed into preparations for the summit, which will be
held next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Since her husband's arrest, Azizah, an ophthalmologist by
training, has become the de facto leader of Anwar's pro-reform
movement.
	   The planned meeting with Mrs. Albright has infuriated the
Malaysian government.
	   ``Of course we don't expect people to interfere,'' Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said. ``If she (Mrs.
Albright) sees my statement she will understand. She is here as a
guest.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Friday did not rule out
meeting with Azizah.

Robbins equals record to pressure McGuire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ United States golfer Kelly Robbins
equaled the Yarra Yarra course record Saturday to loom one shot
behind third-round leader Marnie McGuire at the women's Australian
Open.
	   Robbins had an 8-under 65 to be at 214 through 54 holes while
McGuire led for the third-straight day after a 69.
	   ``Today I had one of those days where you can't complain, I just
did a lot of good things, made a lot of good puts when I needed
to,'' Robbins said. ``If I can keep my putter rolling anything is
possible.''
	   The poor conditions of the previous two days disappeared
Saturday and there were some good scores posted in the Australian
dlrs 350,000 (U.S. dlrs 222,250) event.
	   Local favorite Karrie Webb had birdies at the final two holes to
be one under in a three-way tie for fourth on 218 while Sweden's
Liselotte Neumann was on her own in third after a 69 put her three
behind McGuire.
	   McGuire was 2-under after the second round and started with
birdies on the first two holes before she gave them back in the
first nine.
	   With Robbins and Neumann in hot pursuit she played a brilliant
back nine picking up strokes at the 10th, 12th, 13th, 16th and 17th
holes for her 4-under.
	   ``You really have to concentrate on what you are doing and not
worry about what everybody else is doing and control your game,''
said McGuire. ``I know to play one shot at a time, stick with my
own game and not worry about what other people are doing.''

Howard pledges support if U.S. strikes Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's prime minister said
Saturday his country will offer political support to the United
States if it launches a military strike against Iraq.
	   John Howard said that U.S. President Bill Clinton has not
requested military involvement from Australia and such a call was
not expected.
	   As an expanded force of U.S. bombers, warships and troops began
assembling in the Persian Gulf, Clinton has warned Iraq it could
avert attack if it cooperated with United Nations weapons
inspectors.
	   ``I received a letter from President Clinton this morning
outlining the history of recent events, asking for Australian
support in the event of an American military strike,'' Howard said
in a television interview Saturday.
	   ``Certainly there was nothing in the letter that I disagreed
with. There's no doubt that the patience of the world has been
sorely tested by Saddam Hussein.''

Saddam says he is open to initiative that would end sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with editorials in today's Iraqi
newspapers.
 &UR; With US-Iraq
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has made clear
nothing less than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions will end the
current crisis over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   At the United Nations and in Washington, the words from
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and President Clinton are equally
clear: Iraqi defiance is intolerable and Saddam should resume
cooperation with inspectors before it's too late.
	   With U.S. bombers, warships and troops moving to the Persian
Gulf, fears were growing in the Iraqi capital that a U.S. military
strike was imminent. Motorists jammed their cars by the hundreds
into gasoline stations to fill up their tanks. Shoppers found some
prices rising in Baghdad's markets.
	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute, Saddam
said Friday he was not trying to create a crisis but said any
initiative must lead to an end in sanctions.
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The statements suggested the two sides were no closer to a
compromise that would avert a threatened U.S. military attack on
Iraq. They mirrored past declarations made since the crisis began
in August _ and offered little room for compromise.
	   Editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers today pleaded with the
Arab world to back Iraq.
	   Al-Qadissiya pointed out that Iraq has sent troops to aid Arab
countries fighting Israel, and it urged them to reciprocate.
	   Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense
of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples
have to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its
confrontation against American threats.''
	   Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's uneasy Gulf neighbors _
have called for a diplomatic solution to the latest crisis. But
they also have insisted that Iraq resume cooperation with U.N.
inspectors or risk the consequences.
	   While many Baghdad residents prepared for the worst, their mood
was pragmatic, even defiant _ reflecting the government's efforts
to forge a united front against the U.N. sanctions, imposed eight
years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, selling
vegetables Friday in downtown Baghdad. ``But it's not about any
kind of aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money
to buy food.''
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, shopping for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her four
children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting
Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards had been
dispersed around Baghdad and in provinces farther north. It said
several intelligence and security departments, such as military
intelligence and the Special Security Organization, had been
ordered to move to the outskirts of the capital.
	   ``All their offices are empty now,'' the group said in a fax
sent to Cairo.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with riots spreading.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs burned cars and shops, looted
goods and hurled stones at police stations in several parts of
Jakarta on Saturday after deadly clashes between security forces
and student protesters.
	   While outnumbered riot officers fired warning shots and tear gas
at crowds of angry youths, thousands of anti-government students
marched toward Parliament to press their demands for democratic
reform.
	   President B.J. Habibie, meanwhile, held an emergency meeting
with military chief Gen. Wiranto, the defense minister and other
Cabinet members. A statement was expected later Saturday.
	   At least 10 people, most of them students, have died this week
in the worst violence in Jakarta since riots and protests ousted
former President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian
rule.
	   The looting and burning on Saturday was reminiscent of the May
riots, which were fueled by discontent over Indonesia's economic
crisis and triggered when Suharto's military fatally shot four
student protesters at a rally.
	   As in the tumultuous days before Suharto quit, police and
soldiers were again largely helpless in the face of the rioting.
	   Protests broke out this week against a government assembly on
political reform that students believe is not serious about
democratic change.
	   Suharto weighed in Saturday, saying the government should
apologize for the students' deaths and listen to protesters'
demands, according to the official Antara news agency.
	   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed. Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?'' Suharto was quoted as saying by
his half-brother, Probosutedjo, in the Antara report.
	   The violence on Saturday started when neighborhood youths set
military tents afire in the street near Parliament and burned
several vehicles, including an army truck, next to the University
of Indonesia.
	   In another area, mobs stoned a shopping center as crowds cheered
and police and soldiers stood by. In northern Jakarta, armored
personnel carriers parked amid a crowd of rioters who smashed car
showroom windows and set shops on fire. But soldiers did nothing.
	   Security forces who had used force to block hundreds of students
from marching on Parliament allowed thousands of protesters to
gather at the front gates. More students were marching on a toll
road toward the legislative building.
	   Meanwhile, about 5,000 students gathered at a cemetery for the
funeral of Sigit Prasetyo, a 20-year-old student who was shot dead
Friday. They watched as his casket, draped in a red and white
Indonesian flag and a traditional Islamic funeral cloth, was
lowered in damp red earth.
	   ``Suharto is running the government by remote control,'' said
one student mourner.
	   Mourners, arriving in buses, chanted their hatred of Indonesia's
military chief, Gen. Wiranto. On Friday, his troops unleashed an
arsenal of plastic bullets, tear gas and water cannon on
stone-throwing protesters in two days of clashes near Parliament.
	   ``Hang Wiranto,'' the students shouted, jeering at police
officers on the side of the road.
	   During the fighting Friday, a policeman accidentally shot and
wounded a navy marine in the leg.
	   Critics say the nation's highest legislative body stopped short
of promised democratic change, even though it backed a plan by
Habibie to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed
to name Suharto in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Members of the People's Consultative Assembly, filled with
holdovers from the Suharto era, say the decree will bolster an
ongoing investigation into wealth acquired by the 77-year-old
former president.
	   Students reject the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto. The assembly also did not heed their demand that
the military be banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military directly appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.
	   Many of the dead in Friday's fighting were students shot with
plastic-coated bullets. Military chiefs have ordered their troops
not to carry live ammunition.
	   In May, as many as 1,200 people were killed in the rioting that
forced Suharto to relinquish power.
	   Habibie expressed his condolences to the families of this week's
victims, describing the dead as ``victims of the reform process.''

Taiwanese party halts visits to military sites in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's pro-unification New Party said
Saturday it has called off a plan to send a delegation to China
because the visit ahead of Taiwan's general elections was
considered too sensitive.
	   The party did not give any other details, but the China Times
newspaper said Beijing had agreed to let the delegation, dubbed the
strategic peace mission, visit its missile base in central Jiangxi
province, facilities of the East China Sea Fleet and army bases
facing Taiwan.
	   The newspaper quoted unidentified New Party official as saying
retired general Hau Pei-tsun had declined an invitation to head the
mission after opposition politicians accused him of trying to sell
out Taiwan to rival China.
	   New Party official Jaw Shau-kong refused to comment on the
report, but said that during a September visit to China a party
delegation had agreed to make another trip to help ease hostilities
and to discuss issues related to reunification between Taiwan and
China.
	   The Taiwanese government has informally broached the idea to
China of informing each other about military deployments to avoid
confrontations caused by misjudgements. Beijing hasn't responded.
	   The tiny New Party supports unification with China. The stance
has prompted attacks from the larger Democratic Progressive Party,
which supports formal independence.
	   Taiwan will hold elections for parliament and the mayoral seats
of its two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, on Dec. 5.

Malaysia to suggest currency controls at APEC summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
will take his biggest pet peeve to Pacific Rim leaders when he
hosts a trade summit next week: currency speculators.
	   Mahathir has made it clear that international controls on
foreign currency trading will be on the agenda of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' Mahathir said in an interview Saturday with
the Malaysian government news agency, Bernama.
	   ``We hope to bring forward the economic crisis in Asia and the
need for attention to be given to the real reasons for the crisis,
which was caused by currency traders,'' he said.
	   Mahathir estimates that Malaysia has lost dlrs 150 billion in
market capitalization in the past 20 months.
	   Mahathir, who boycotted the first APEC summit in 1993 because he
objected to APEC's inclusion of large Western economies, said he
could not pass up the chance to bring up currency controls.
	   ``If we only attend meetings without getting any benefit, that
is such a waste,'' he told Bernama. ``We are a small nation and we
cannot afford to waste.''
	   Mahathir has long held that the Asian economic crisis was
prompted by money speculators and that International Monetary Fund
prescriptions have failed to halt the crisis. He would like a
public endorsement of Malaysia's imposition of currency controls to
keep speculators away from its financial markets.
	   Mahathir also said that Japan should not be brow-beaten by other
APEC members into signing onto a highly debated trade pact.
	   Cabinet ministers met in the Malaysian capital this weekend to
hash out the free-trade pact, known as early voluntary sector
liberalization, that would lift trade barriers in nine key
industries representing dlrs 1.5 trillion in goods by 2002.
	   Japan has balked at lifting the barriers on fish and forestry,
infuriating the United States, which believes that opening markets
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   ``The most important thing is that this is voluntary,'' Mahathir
said. ``Early, voluntary. Those two words are very important. It
means you must make the decision yourself, if you are ready. If you
are not ready, you can wait until the time comes for you to make
the decision.''
	   Mahathir also said he was disappointed by attempts to politicize
the summit. Several countries have said their representatives
intend to meet with the wife of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim,
whom Mahathir fired as his deputy in September.
	   ``The stress is on the economy, not on politics. We we want to
debate on politics, there will be no economic issues that can be
resolved,'' he said.
	   But then, Mahathir also said he didn't expect much to come of
the summit, either way.
	   ``The APEC summit is important, but we should not place much
hope on it because there are others with a different agenda.''

World War II bomb found buried in Thai capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Workers doing excavation work for an
underground mass transit project in the Thai capital discovered a
500-pound bomb from World War II, a local newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The bomb, buried about seven meters (yards) underground, was
found near the Bangsue rail station, the Bangkok Post reported. It
was believed to still be primed and dangerous.
	   The Post quoted Air Force Secretary Air Vice Marshal Prasas
Jiamchawee as speculating that the bomb, presumably dropped by U.S.
planes sometime during the war, had been meant to destroy the
station, which was a key rail junction for the Japanese forces then
occupying Thailand.
	   Air Force personnel retrieved the bomb _ described as a model
AN-M 64-A1 _ and took it to a training base outside of Bangkok to
be destroyed.

Six police officers vanish near Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six policemen disappeared while guarding a
checkpoint along the Chechen border in Russia's volatile region of
Ingushetia, a news report said Saturday.
	   The police were gone when another group of officers came to
replace them Saturday morning, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
There were no signs of a struggle at the checkpoint.
	   The report gave no other details about the incident.
	   Ingushetia, a region torn by violence resulting from ethnic
strife with nearby North Ossetia, sits in the mountainous northern
Caucasus. It has also been hit by spill over violence and
kidnappings from breakaway Chechnya, where rebels fought a 1994-96
independence war with Russia.
	   Russian police and border guards have been kidnapped several
times by Chechen raiders.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of ousted finance
minister Anwar Ibrahim met Saturday with a top Canadian official
attending a meeting of 21 Pacific Rim nations, and expressed
concern about how Anwar has been treated in prison.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy invited Azizah Ismail,
Anwar's wife, to lunch between his meetings with other officials
attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy told reporters after the luncheon.
	   Azizah also plans to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who was to arrive in Malaysia Saturday night for meetings
ahead of the APEC summit on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Anwar, who was once the country's No. 2 government official,
claims he was beaten by police before his trial started.
	   In late September, Anwar sat in court with a clearly visible
black eye that he says he received during a police beating. The
government denies the accusation, but is investigating it.
	   Anwar is being tried for alleged abuse of power and sexual
misconduct. He denies the charges and says he's the victim of a
political vendetta orchestrated by his nemesis, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad. Anwar's arrest set off violent anti-government
protests in Malaysia, which could break out again if pro-democracy
activists carry out their plans during the APEC summit.
	   Meanwhile, Azizah, an ophthalmologist by training, has become
the de facto leader of Anwar's pro-reform movement.
	   After having lunch with Azizah, Axworthy said: ``We have been
meeting with a number of people to get a briefing on what the
situation is, (and) expressed concerns with the treatment of Anwar
and others detained.''
	   ``We want to use this opportunity to hear from you as to what
you think should be addressed'' during the APEC meetings, Axworthy
said he told Azizah. The luncheon also was attended by Canadian
International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi.
	   After their meeting, Azizah said, ``Anwar is very honored and
proud that his wife is able to meet with the Canadian officials. We
are happy and encouraged by the fact that we have been given a
positive response.''
	   Mahathir is fighting to keep the Anwar case out of the APEC
summit, but a number of leaders, including U.S. President Bill
Clinton, already have said they won't meet privately with Mahathir
during their visits to Malaysia because of what has happened.
	   Azizah's planned meeting with Mrs. Albright has infuriated the
Malaysian government.
	   ``Of course we don't expect people to interfere'' with the Anwar
situation, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said.
``If she (Mrs. Albright) sees my statement, she will understand.
She is here as a guest.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was to arrive in
Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah, too.

700 hostages remain in Chechnya, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 700 people are still held hostage in
Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya, many more than previously
reported, according to a news report Saturday.
	   Previous government and independent estimates have said just
over 100 hostages were still held in the region.
	   Among the 700 hostages are policemen, civilians and soldiers,
Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said on the television
program ``Hero of the Day,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Rushailo said many Chechens also are kidnapped, and their
relatives pay small sums for their release. The practice has
created a booming hostage-taking trade in the region, he said.
	   Rushailo's comments came after the release of Russia's special
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, who had been held for six
months.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said ``a whole system of
measures was worked out to free'' Vlasov, but no ransom was paid
for his release, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Vlasov was one of more than two dozen hostages _ including a
British couple and a number of Russian soldiers _ released over the
last few months. It is still not clear if ransoms were paid for any
of them.
	   Since a bloody 1994-96 independence war with Russia, Chechnya
has seen an outbreak of violence and kidnappings. A Turk, three
Britons, and a New Zealander, as well as many more Russians
captured in surrounding regions, are known to be held there.
	   Chechnya runs its own affairs, but no country in the world
recognizes its claims of sovereignty.

Canadian prime minister urges Singapore to address trade and
</HEADLINE>
investment imbalance

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Canadian prime minister pushed for greater
economic cooperation with Singapore on Saturday, and urged this
affluent city-state to correct a trade and investment imbalance
with his country.
	   ``We have two billion dollars (dlrs 1.2 billion) of investment
in Singapore, but I'm told there's only 180 million (dlrs 109
million) invested in Canada'' by Singapore, said Prime Minister
Jean Chretien.
	   ``The problem is here, it's not there'' in Canada, he said in
reference to the imbalance with Singapore.
	   Speaking to a gathering of Canadian businessmen on the second
day of his visit to this Southeast Asian island republic, Chretien
said his country remains committed to economic participation in the
region despite the financial crisis.
	   ``We have the same commitment that we had before,'' he said.
``We're not here for the short-term, we're here for the
long-term.''
	   In meetings with his Singapore counterpart, Goh Chok Tong,
Chretien pushed for more economic links and highlighted the growing
trade and investment imbalance.
	   ``I'm telling (Goh) that you should buy more from Canada and
invest more in Canada,'' Chretien said Friday. ``Then our relations
would be better.''
	   He noted that although the regional slowdown has hurt Canada's
economic growth, which is expected to slow to 2.8 percent this year
from earlier forecasts of 3.8 percent, ``we're still buying a lot
of goods and services from Asia.''
	   Chretien witnessed the signing of 10 agreements on Saturday
between Canadian and Singaporean companies, worth about 180 million
Canadian dollars (dlrs 109 million).
	   They included a tie-up between Singapore Telecom and Northern
Telecom, which will expand SingTel's digital mobile phone network
in a contract worth 100 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 61
million).
	   Two government pacts have also been signed, creating regional
training programs and outlining cultural and technical cooperation.
	   Chretien also attended the opening on Saturday of a Canadian
business center to promote trade and technological partnerships
between Canada and Singapore.
	   He praised the two countries' ``strong shared interest in
promoting open markets and investment'' and said that their mutual
goal of incorporating advanced technology into their businesses and
societies make Canada and Singapore ``a natural fit.''

Foreign secretary says world cannot ignore Saddam's challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Saturday that
the world cannot afford to ignore the threat of Iraqi chemical and
biological weapons, but said he hoped for a diplomatic solution to
the crisis.
	   ``I think it's a bit rich of Saddam Hussein to say he will
respond to any initiative, when all week he has been refusing to
respond to the many initiatives that have been made,'' Cook said in
a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday urged Saddam to make
``a wise decision'' and resume cooperation with weapons inspectors.
Annan earlier met at U.N. headquartesr with ambassadors of Russia,
France and China who appealed to him to intervene to find a
diplomatic solution and avert U.S. air strikes.
	   Despite the apparent split in the security council about
possible military action, Cook said the council was united in
regarding Iraq as violating its agreement on weapons inspection.
	   Cook said he would prefer Saddam coopere with the UN inspectors.
	   ``But if he won't do that, then he will be disarmed through
military action. We cannot leave him with those weapons,'' Cook
said.
	   ``If one of the consequences of any military action was for
Saddam to be toppled, that would be a bonus, a very welcome bonus,
but that is not the objective of any military action,'' he added.

Report: APEC draft communique criticizes hedge funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Subs 6th graf pvs, ``U.S. officials...'' with 1 graf to UPDATE
with U.S. official commenting on the draft communique. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Leaders of Pacific Rim countries
urge ``special urgency'' to deal with the region's worst financial
crisis in 50 years, including shining more light on the operations
of secretive hedge funds, according to a report on a draft of the
group's final statement.
	   The draft final communique adopted a somber tone with the
leaders admitting the financial turbulence which began 17 months
ago in Thailand has been more devastating than anticipated both in
its intensity in Asia and its contagion effects around the world.
	   ``The regional financial crisis had economic and social
aftershocks more severe than anticipated, and similar problems have
appeared in other parts of the world,'' according to a report
obtained Saturday by the Japanese news agency Kyodo.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and other leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum are scheduled to issue the statement at the close
of two days of discussions next Wednesday.
	   Their foreign and trade ministers were meeting Saturday and
Sunday to work out compromises in final wording. The biggest issue
left unresolved was how far to go in lowering trade barriers in
nine sectors covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that much of the work had been done to prepare the
final communique for the APEC leaders to review, except for the
``giant hole in the donute'' _ the contentious issue of lowering
trade barriers.
	   The draft communique, according to Kyodo, said the leaders'
``welcome the conclusion'' of the trade package, but it leaves out
any details of what will be in the final package.
	   On hedge funds, the draft communique says the APEC leaders see
an urgent need for the group's countries ``to examine the questions
of appropriate transparency and disclosure standards for
private-sector financial institutions involved in international
capital flows, such as investment banks, hedge funds and other
institutional investors.''
	   The draft statement calls for creation of a task force to
``develop practical proposals in these areas.''
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the chairman of this
year's APEC meetings, has been a leading critic of the actions of
hedge funds in precipitating the crisis by sparking panicked flight
of foreign investors that leveled the economies of a number of
countries in Asia and of Russia.
	   But other countries have also called for greater scrutiny of the
operations of hedge funds, largely secretive, risky investment
funds that cater primarily to the very rich.
	   Hedge funds invest in currencies and other financial
instruments. In the United States, the near collapse of a fund
based in the state of Connecticut which suffered heavy losses
following Russia's August default on debt has generated calls in
America's Congress for greater regulation.
	   The reported draft communique also gave Mahathir a victory on
another issue, the conduct of international credit rating agencies,
saying they should be reviewed because of their recent performance.
	   On Friday, Mahathir gave a speech that blasted foreign credit
agencies that have downgraded Malaysia's credit rating, as
``negative and biased.''
	   But while Mahathir has been openly critical of the International
Monetary Fund's handling of the financial crisis, the draft
communique praised the IMF and other multilateral financial
institutions for the work they had done in combating the crisis.
	   It also praised the IMF's recent move to introduce greater
flexibility in providing emergency loans to stem capital flight, an
initiative of President Clinton.
	   While the United States has been lobbying for support for other
proposals to expand credit assistance to banks burdened with bad
loans and debt-strapped corporations in crisis countries, the
communique was more vague on that issue.
	   It did call for a comprehensive program of support for efforts
to strengthen financial systems, restore trade finance and
accelerate corporate sector restructuring.
	   On another Clinton effort to expand programs to support millions
of people plunged into deep poverty by the financial crisis, the
draft communique urged expanded assistance to strengthen social
safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable.
	   The APEC leaders also reaffirmed the group's commitment to
create a free-trade area among their countries by the year 2010 for
developing countries and 2020 for all APEC members.
	   The push to slash tariffs in nine sectors ranging from chemicals
to medical devices by 2002 represented an effort to make an early
down payment on that goal, but it has been bogged down at this
meeting by insistence of Japan that they cannot participate in two
politically sensitive areas _ wood and fish.

team arrived in the capital Saturday to assess evidence of war
crimes and genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge during the
communist guerrillas' brutal four-year rule of Cambodia.
	   Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia, told
reporters at Phnom Penh's international airport that the
three-member team would work in Cambodia for seven or eight days.
He would not reveal details of the mission.
	   American Stephen Ratner, an expert on international law and war
crimes, was scheduled to arrive Saturday afternoon, and Rajsoomer
Lallah, former chief justice of Mauritius, is due in Phnom Penh on
Monday.
	   The legal team has been asked by the United Nations to assess
existing evidence for a possible trial of top Khmer Rouge leaders
held responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people by
execution, starvation and disease.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan announced the appointment of
the team in July. The trio studied documentation and attending
briefings at the United Nations prior to their trip to Cambodia.
	   The team will also hold meetings with Cambodian politicians and
religious leaders to determine how the Cambodian people would
prefer to see a trial conducted.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized control of Cambodia in 1975 as the
Vietnam War drew to a close. The Maoist rebels further devastated
their war-torn nation by forcing people out of cities and into
massive rural work camps in a failed attempt to create an agrarian
utopia.
	   An invading Vietnamese army ousted the Khmer Rouge from Phnom
Penh in 1979 and set up a weak government loyal to Hanoi.
	   Cold War politics after the invasion protected the Khmer Rouge
from prosecution as Western nations and China supported the
guerrillas in the United Nations as the legal Cambodian government.
	   The Khmer Rouge was invited to participate in a U.N.-sponsored
Cambodian election in 1993 but pulled out of the polls at the last
minute and continued its guerrilla war against Phnom Penh.
	   A spate of defections to the government in 1996, led by former
Khmer Rouge deputy prime minister Ieng Sary, dealt a crippling blow
to the rebel movement. A second round of defections this year led
to the capture the guerrillas' last major military base along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
	   The reintegration of several top Khmer Rouge into the government
is seen as a potential stumbling block to a tribunal, but
government leaders have repeatedly insisted they are in favor of a
trial and will support the U.N.'s efforts.
	   Supreme Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died of an apparent heart
attack in April as the rebels were on the run from government
forces.
	   One-legged army chief Ta Mok, nominal leader Khieu Samphan and
ideological chief Nuon Chea remain at large with a dwindling band
of supporters in the mountainous jungles of the Thai border.

U.N. trying to sustain food program after British inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations is trying to set up
``contingency arrangements'' to keep food flowing into Iraq after
British inspectors vital to the oil-for-food program were pulled
out, U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said Saturday.
	   The inspectors, withdrawn by the private British firm Lloyds
Register in fear of a U.S. military attack, verified the arrival of
food shipments in the country _ a necessary step in arranging
payments to suppliers who might otherwise not ship.
	   Falt told reporters that several proposals had been made to the
United Nations in New York and that the coordinator of U.N.
Humanitarian activities here, Hans von Sponeck, was awaiting a
decision.
	   ``We are making every effort to establish contingency
arrangements as soon as possible to ensure that humanitarian goods
can be authenticated and that vital humanitarian supplies continue
to reach Iraq,'' Falt told reporters.
	   The exact number of inspectors who left was not known. In the
past, the company kept about 42 inspectors on the ground in Iraq.
	   The Lloyds Register inspectors are a critical link in the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which since December 1996 has
allowed Iraq to sell limited quantities of crude oil to buy needed
food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   The Lloyds people inspect shipments by truck and ship as they
arrived in Iraq, and then notify the United Nations in New York.
U.N. headquarters then tells a Paris-based bank to pay the seller
of the goods.
	   Iraqi government officials fear that if vendors don't have
guarantees they'll be paid, they'll stop shipping the food that is
distributed in monthly rations to the public.
	   Falt confirmed that the Lloyds Register staff was withdrawn
without consultation with the United Nations, which he called ``a
regrettable situation.''
	   Lloyds is just one element of the multi-faceted oil-for-food
program.
	   Oil still is flowing out of the country, with monitors of the
Dutch company Saybolt overseeing the outflow.
	   But the U.N. humanitarian office's staff _ which oversees food
distribution _ has been reduced significantly by the evacuation
Wednesday and Thursday of about one-third of its 450 workers.
	   There still are 57 U.N. relief workers in the Baghdad area to
supervise the distribution of food, von Sponeck told reporters on
Friday. And about 230 remain in the northern Iraq aiding Iraqi
Kurds.
	   In addition to food, the U.N. program brings medicine, school
supplies and water and sanitation equipment into Iraq.
	   It also has been overseeing the purchase of dlrs 300 million in
badly needed spare parts for Iraq's oil industry.
	   At the United Nations, Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon warned
Friday that if the withdrawal by Lloyds slows the delivery of
humanitarian aid, Iraq is likely to cut off oil exports.
	   ``If the incoming supplies stop because of this action, there is
no reason for Iraq to keep pumping oil,'' he said. ``I believe this
is going to happen.''

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ It's fitting that the latest round of
India-Pakistan peace talks ended on Friday the 13th, a day believed
by many to be unlucky. The negotiations seemed doomed from the
beginning, and ended predictably badly.
	   How much did India and Pakistan disagree? So much they disagreed
on whether they made any progress at all.
	   While Indian officials perceived ``an inching forward,''
Pakistan said hopes of progress had been squashed, ``thanks to the
inflexibility and rigid attitude of the Indian side.''
	   ``The outcome is not a surprise,'' said Brahma Chellaney of the
independent Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. Talks had
resumed after six years and the resolution of long-standing
disputes will take time, he said.
	   In six rounds of expert-level talks over 10 days, India and
Pakistan discussed, among other things, trade, a proposal for a
cease-fire on an icy Himalayan battlefield, a maritime border
dispute, terrorism and drug trafficking, and cultural exchanges.
	   Not on the agenda was what many see as the crux of
India-Pakistan tension: Kashmir, which both claim.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since each
gained independence from Britain in 1947, and they've continue to
lob shells and fire bullets across the frontline almost daily since
then.
	   Their enmity peaked in May when the sounds became rather louder
than those of shells _ India tested a nuclear bomb under its
northern desert, and Pakistan pushed its own button under its own
desert.
	   Under international pressure following the tests, the two
countries began peace talks on Kashmir last month in the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad.
	   The follow-up talks that have just ended in New Delhi tested
India's opinion that the two sides should first make progress on
lesser issues to improve the atmosphere enough for talks on
Kashmir.
	   India's gamble failed.
	   Pakistan says nothing can move forward without a Kashmir
settlement, and that stance has overshadowed the New Delhi talks.
	   Some analysts said Pakistan may have deliberately stalled talks
on boundary issues so that the world would begin to view Kashmir as
a nuclear flash point.
	   This, the argument goes, would keep international pressure on
India to negotiate over the Himalayan territory, something Pakistan
wants.
	   But if India was looking to defuse the situation, that was not
immediately apparent this week.
	   During the talks this week, India tested a sea-skimming missile
that can deliver conventional explosives up to a range of 5 1/2
miles (8.85 kilometers).
	   Still, any kind of talking between India and Pakistan is an
improvement over the last few years when a silence as icy as the
Himalayan province they are fighting over dominated relations.
	   A second round of foreign secretary-level talks on Kashmir is
scheduled for February.
	   Meanwhile, Indians and Pakistanis can take comfort in one small
triumph from this week's talks. Passengers will be able to watch
the latest movies aboard luxury vehicles under a deal agreed this
week to start bus services between the two countries.
	   The two sides also agreed to consider more visas for each
other's nationals, as well as increased sports and cultural
exchanges and more visits by journalists.

Number of telephones up ten-fold in five years: government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The liberalization of the
telecommunications industry has increased the number of telephone
lines in the Philippines by ten-fold in the past five years, the
government reported Saturday.
	   There were 7 million phone lines this year, up from 700,000 in
1993, and the number of telephones per 100 people rose to 9.6 from
1.2, the Department of Transportation and Communication said.
	   Department undersecretary Josefina Lichauco was quoted as saying
that the rate of increase of telephones in the Philippines is the
fastest in the world, next only to China.
	   ``Our Filipino entrepreneurs, in strategic joint ventures with
foreign investors, have been aggressive in their telecommunications
ventures to catapult the country into the 21st century,'' Ms.
Lichauco told an industry group recently.
	   She said the telecommunication sector grew despite the Asian
financial crisis, but the pace of new construction was slowed.
	   Former President Fidel Ramos liberalized the economy and
dismantled monopolies, including those in telecommunications. Ramos
stepped down June 30 at the end of his six-year term.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A day after brokering a watershed
deal for a new coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen, a
triumphant King Norodom Sihanouk left Cambodia on Saturday for
routine medical treatment in Beijing.
	   In sharp contrast to the quiet arrivals and departures of
Sihanouk during the political turmoil that has swept his country
for more than a year, the ailing monarch was sent off at the
airport by an enthusiastic crowd including Hun Sen and his
rival-turned-coalition partner, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   A light rain could not dampen the jovial spirits of the king,
who lingered at the airport's VIP terminal for more than
half-an-hour chatting and joking with diplomats and politicians.
	   ``This is a great honor for our nation. We have reconciled and
become united,'' Sihanouk said of the compromise struck between Hun
Sen and Ranariddh.
	   The longtime political enemies had been locked in a
three-month-long stalemate since Hun Sen narrowly won a July
election. The prince finished a strong second in the polls and
refused to give Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to
approve a new government.
	   Sihanouk's initiatives to bring the bitter rivals to the
bargaining table bore fruit this week when Ranariddh returned to
Phnom Penh on Thursday for a hastily convened summit meeting at the
royal palace.
	   The deal concluded Friday will make Hun Sen sole premier in a
coalition government of his ruling Cambodian People's Party and
Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh served as joint premiers in a government
formed after 1993's U.N.-supervised election, but Hun Sen ousted
his rival in a violent coup d'etat last year.
	   The prince will become president of the National Assembly, even
though Hun Sen's party holds 64 of the chamber's 122 seats.
	   Ranariddh, who left Saturday afternoon for a four-day trip to
Bangkok, Thailand, told reporters at the airport that key posts in
the planned Cabinet had already been divided up.
	   The two parties will again share the top positions in the
defense and interior ministries, he said.
	   Senior FUNCINPEC official You Hockry, who served as co-interior
minister in the last government, said sharing the ministries would
help build trust between the two parties.
	   However, FUNCINPEC co-ministers were often shut out of the chain
of command in the last coalition as Hun Sen and the CPP asserted
their dominance over the civil service and military.
	   Key to Friday's compromise was an agreement for a constitutional
amendment creating a new Senate in the legislature to be led by the
president of Hun Sen's party, Chea Sim. The king will initially
appoint the Senate's members.
	   Chea Sim, the outgoing National Assembly president, will retain
in his new position his powers as acting head of state when the
king is outside the country, a privilege Hun Sen was reluctant to
give Ranariddh.
	   The breakthrough should see the rapid formation of a government
and encourage international aid donors and businesses to resume
operations in poverty-stricken Cambodia, which is in desperate need
of economic assistance.
	   It could also hasten the country's entry into the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold by the regional body last year
after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh.
	   Sihanouk flew to Beijing for a routine medical examination.
Although he said at the airport that he would return to Cambodia if
needed, it is unclear how long the monarch will remain in the
Chinese capital.
	   The 76-year-old king suffers from a variety of illnesses and
often makes extended stays in Beijing for treatment from his
Chinese doctors. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it
has since gone into remission.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern-based
opposition said Saturday its forces captured a district in northern
Baghlan province from their Taliban rivals in overnight fighting
that left scores of Taliban soldiers dead and wounded.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed and there was no
immediate comment from the Taliban.
	   Opposition forces captured the district of Burka in Baghlan
province after heavy fighting, said an opposition spokesman, who
identified himself only as Arif.
	   The area is some 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the capital
Kabul and about 40 kilometers (24 miles) east of Baghlan _ the
capital of the Baghlan province.
	   ``Scores of Taliban fighters were killed, wounded and captured.
Now our forces are advancing towards Nahrin district and fierce
fighting is going on there,'' he said.
	   Around 1,200 Taliban fighters have defected to opposition ranks
during the last three days, Arif said.
	   Sporadic fighting is also reported in Bangi district in the
northern Takhar province close to the border with Tajikistan, he
said.
	   Six Pakistan nationals, fighting alongside with the Taliban,
were also captured, he said.
	   The opposition alliance accuses Pakistan of helping the Taliban.
Pakistan denies the charge.
	   The Taliban control 90 percent of Afghanistan including Kabul,
while the opposition controls the remaining 10 percent of the
war-devastated country.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and
most Pashtun _ the majority ethnic group of Afghanistan.
	   They follow a harsh version of Islam that bars women from work
and education, forces men to grow beards and many forms of
entertainment, including music.
	   The opposition alliance comprise mainly of religious and ethnic
minorities including the Shiite Muslims, Tajiks, Uzbeks and
Hazaras.

Canadian prime minister deplores violence in Indonesia, calls for

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called
Saturday for restraint in Indonesia, where violent protests for
political reform have left at least 10 people dead.
	   ``I deplore that, and I hope everybody will show restraint and
make sure that there is no more violence,'' Chretien told reporters
in neighboring Singapore, where he is on a four-day visit.
	   Mobs burned cars and shops, looted goods and hurled stones at
police in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on Saturday after days
of deadly clashes between security forces and student protesters.
	   Thousands of anti-government students also marched toward
Parliament to press their demands for democratic reform.
	   At least 10 people, most of them students, have died this week
in the worst violence in Jakarta since unrest ousted former
President Suharto in May.
	   Chretien said he will discuss the situation with Indonesian
President Habibie when they meet next week on the sideline of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia.
	   ``I hope (the government) will show restraint and will move
quickly to have the proper institution in place to have a democracy
that will be more acceptable to the population,'' he added.
	   Asia's economic crisis has led to ``cries of the dispossessed
for change,'' Chretien said in a speech to the Canadian business
community in Singapore.
	   Without ``real commitment to good governance, openness, respect
for human rights and the rule of law, human progress is
frustrated'' in the region, he said.
	   Chretien told reporters there are no immediate plans to resume
an evacuation of Canadian citizens from Jakarta. Thousands of
foreigners, including Canadians, were ferried out of Indonesia
during the unrest in May.
	   He added that he is not concerned about his personal safety
while visiting the region, despite the escalating Indonesian
violence, political unrest in the APEC host country of Malaysia and
tension in the nearby Persian Gulf.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Saturday, the seventh
attack in as many days, security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of Sojod in
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south, the officials said.
	   The reason for the attack was not immediately known.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6:45 a.m.
(4:45 GMT) air raid. The region is about 12 kilometers (seven
miles) north of this southern market town.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the
occupied zone Israel set up in 1985 to stop cross-border attacks.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Weary delegates concluded their
global warming summit early Saturday by setting out a plan of
action to begin finding ways to scale back heat-trapping
pollutants.
	   After an all-night struggle, delegates from 160 nations united
in a pre-dawn session behind a ``Buenos Aires plan of action'' that
would map out specific strategies to fight global warming by year
2000.
	   ``This plan of action adds real momentum to the Kyoto
protocol,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, chief U.S. delegate, praising
the conference president.
	   In December 1997, the United States and 37 other industrial
nations agreed in Kyoto, Japan, to binding reductions in their
greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 _ setting a target 5 percent below
1990 levels.
	   How to get there was the challenge for some 160 nations gathered
here for the U.N. climate summit, the biggest and most important
since the Kyoto agreement.

Turkey seeking to lift death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey will move to lift death penalty in
an effort to extradite one of the country's most wanted criminal
from Italy, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu made the announcement Friday,
hours after Turkey learned Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was
arrested in Rome, daily Milliyet said. The justice ministry would
prepare a draft bill next week to be voted in Parliament, it said.
	   Ocalan is being tried in absentia in Turkey on charges of
leading a terrorist organization, threatening the country's
territorial integrity and ordering killings. Ocalan could face the
death penalty.
	   Although there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984,
Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if there is a
risk of capital punishment.
	   Turkey's action could also ease the extradition from France of
prominent Turkish mafia boss Alaattin Cakici, who also faces the
death penalty on charges of murder and leading an armed gang.
Cakici is at the center of a state-mafia ties scandal.
	   Ocalan leads the illegal Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has
been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   The issue of capital punishment has also marred Turkey's poor
human rights record, one of the major obstacles cited by European
Union members who oppose Turkey's full membership bid.

Dutch Cabinet approves plan to give gays right to adopt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Accelerating a push to expand gay
rights ahead of the new millennium, the Dutch Cabinet has approved
a plan to let homosexuals _ who already may marry here _ adopt
children.
	   The legislation, approved late Friday by top ministers of the
coalition government led by Prime Minister Wim Kok, would restrict
adoptions to Dutch children. It will go before parliament, probably
early in 1999, in a drive to have it become law by Jan. 1, 2000.
	   Under the proposal, gays and lesbians would not be allowed to
adopt children from abroad out of respect for other countries'
laws, and out of concern that international adoption agencies would
stop approving adoptions to all Dutch couples, heterosexuals
included.
	   The plan would limit the right to adopt to homosexual couples
who have lived together for at least three years and together have
cared for the child for a full year. It would not require a couple
to marry or legally register their partnership.
	   Prospective gay parents would have to demonstrate in court that
the child they wish to adopt would be better off with them, Kok
said.
	   The legislation, said to have broad backing in parliament,
revives a push that began several years ago to further expand the
rights granted under Dutch law to homosexuals.
	   A new Dutch law took effect on Jan. 1 permitting same-sex
couples to marry and giving them the same pension, social security
and inheritance rights as a married heterosexual couple.
	   There was no discernible protest over Friday's Cabinet approval
in the liberal Netherlands, which is among the few countries to
allow same-sex marriage and which has welcomed homosexuals to serve
openly in the military since the 1970s.
	   Recent public opinion surveys have shown that seven in 10 Dutch
people think homosexuals could make good parents.
	   In the past, however, Dutch bishops have been among those
opposed to homosexual adoption on moral and biblical grounds.
	   Denmark, Norway and Sweden also legally recognize gay
partnerships but have not allowed them to adopt. In the United
States, matters of marriage and adoption are overseen by states and
hashed out in the courts; some U.S. states allow homosexual
adoption and a few forbid it.
	   Germany's new center-left government indicated this week that it
intends to grant some sort of legal status to same-sex couples, but
not an outright ``gay marriage'' and not the right to adopt
children.
	   In France, a bill aimed at giving legal status to unmarried
couples has triggered fierce debate and spirited street protests
amid fears among conservatives that it could legalize homosexual
marriage and lead to gay adoption.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with riots spreading.
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deadly clashes between students and
security forces gave way to widespread rioting in the capital
Saturday as rock-throwing mobs burned cars, looted shops and
ransacked police stations.
	   While outnumbered riot officers fired warning shots and tear gas
at crowds of cheering youths, thousands of anti-government students
peacefully marched toward Parliament to press their demands for
democratic reform.
	   Palls of black smoke towered over a shopping area near one
luxury hotel only a few hundreds meters (yards) from the heavily
guarded state palace.
	   There, President B.J. Habibie called for calm and held an
emergency meeting with military chief Gen. Wiranto, the defense
minister and other Cabinet members.
	   Earlier he suggested troublemakers were trying to ``overthrow''
his six-month-old government.
	   They want ``to endanger the unity of the nation and the
people,'' he said.
	   Opposition leaders and student activists called on Habibie and
Wiranto to quit.
	   ``Habibie must step down now. We have had enough of this
government,'' said one man who identified himself by the single
name of Irwan.
	   At least 12 people, most of them students, have died this week
in the worst violence in Jakarta since riots and protests in May
ousted former President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian
rule.
	   The looting and burning on Saturday was reminiscent of the May
riots, which were fueled by discontent over Indonesia's economic
crisis and triggered when Suharto's military fatally shot four
student protesters at a rally.
	   Buildings were burning in at least four areas, including
Jakarta's Chinatown, badly hit by rioting last May, when 1,200
people were killed.
	   The Chinese minority, who are prominent in business, are often
targeted during times of civil unrest in Indonesia.
	   As in the tumultuous days before Suharto quit, police and
soldiers were again largely helpless in the face of the rioting.
	   Protests broke out this week against a government assembly on
political reform that students believe is not serious about
democratic change.
	   Suharto weighed in Saturday, saying the government should
apologize for the students' deaths and listen to protesters'
demands, according to the official Antara news agency.
	   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed. Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?'' Suharto was quoted as saying by
his half-brother, Probosutedjo, in the Antara report.
	   The violence on Saturday started when neighborhood youths set
military tents afire in the street near Parliament and burned
several vehicles, including an army truck, next to the University
of Indonesia.
	   In another area, mobs stoned a shopping center as crowds cheered
and police and soldiers stood by. In northern Jakarta, armored
personnel carriers parked amid a crowd of rioters who smashed car
showroom windows and set shops on fire. But soldiers did nothing.
	   Security forces who had used force to block hundreds of students
from marching on Parliament allowed thousands of protesters to
gather at the front gates. More students were marching on a toll
road toward the legislative building.
	   Meanwhile, about 5,000 students gathered at a cemetery for the
funeral of Sigit Prasetyo, a 20-year-old student who was shot dead
Friday. They watched as his casket, draped in a red and white
Indonesian flag and a traditional Islamic funeral cloth, was
lowered in damp red earth.
	   ``Suharto is running the government by remote control,'' said
one student mourner.
	   Mourners, arriving in buses, chanted their hatred of Indonesia's
military chief, Gen. Wiranto. On Friday, his troops unleashed an
arsenal of plastic bullets, tear gas and water cannon on
stone-throwing protesters in two days of clashes near Parliament.
	   ``Hang Wiranto,'' the students shouted, jeering at police
officers on the side of the road.
	   During the fighting Friday, a policeman accidentally shot and
wounded a navy marine in the leg.
	   At one riot Saturday, a mob beat one policeman to death and
police accidentally shot and wounded another navy marine.
	   In Medan, Indonesia's third-largest city, student protesters
blocked the airport and smashed a car belonging to an army major,
who escaped.
	   Thirty-six students and seven riot officers were injured in a
clash in the city of Bengkulu in southern Sumatra island.
	   Critics say the nation's highest legislative body stopped short
of promised democratic change, even though it backed a plan by
Habibie to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed
to name Suharto in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Members of the People's Consultative Assembly, filled with
holdovers from the Suharto era, say the decree will bolster an
ongoing investigation of wealth acquired by the 77-year-old former
president.
	   Students rejected the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto. The assembly also did not heed their demand that
the military be banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military directly appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.
	   Many of the dead in Friday's fighting were students shot with
plastic-coated bullets. Military chiefs have ordered their troops
not to carry live ammunition.
	   Habibie expressed his condolences to the families of this week's
victims, describing the dead as ``victims of the reform process.''

Islamic groups build public backing by providing social services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ There's a big paper cutout of Mickey
Mouse on the wall. Plush stuffed animals are scattered about. One
curly haired 5-year-old is tearful over a broken crayon.
	   It's a typical Palestinian preschool scene _ except for the
unusual declaration that teacher Aisha Issa feels compelled to make
to two visitors.
	   ``We're not Islamic Jihad,'' she said, taking a break from
wiping runny noses and straightening a row of pint-sized plastic
chairs. ``We're just a kindergarten.''
	   In Palestinian towns all over the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
radical groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad operate dozens of schools,
medical clinics, sports clubs and women's support groups.
	   Soccer matches and prenatal care don't quite jibe with
outsiders' images of Hamas and Islamic Jihad staging bloody suicide
bombings to try to block any peace with Israel.
	   But here, as with other Islamic movements elsewhere in the
region, providing social services is a key part of the radical
groups' strategy for building public support, especially among the
Palestinian poor.
	   This unofficial welfare network is presenting a thorny problem
for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, which has been cracking
down on militants to fulfill security promises made to Israel under
the new Mideast peace accord.
	   By shutting down the Islamic organizations, Arafat risks an
angry backlash from the Palestinian public. By allowing them to
operate, he invites accusations from Israel that he is violating
the accord by allowing terror groups' infrastructures to remain
intact.
	   So far, he is handling it as he has so many other crises: with a
delicate balancing act.
	   The preschool in the West Bank town of Bethlehem _ a few
second-floor rooms on a back street, with nearly 100 pupils drawn
from the surrounding rundown neighborhood _ is a case in point.
	   It has remained open, even though the adjacent headquarters of
its parent group, the Islamic Women's Society, was shut down by
Palestinian police in early November. A clinic run by the society
was closed as well.
	   The group believes it is being targeted because it is headed by
Etaf Eliayan, an Islamic Jihad activist who became a heroine and
symbol of resistance to many Palestinians during the uprising
against Israeli rule.
	   She served nearly 10 years in prison for trying to blow up the
Israeli prime minister's office, and spent three more months in
jail last year, during which she staged a hunger strike to protest
being held without charges.
	   ``The head of our organization has her political views,
certainly, but that doesn't change what we are trying to do here,
with the children,'' said Issa, the teacher.
	   For Arafat, a big part of the problem is that the militant
groups' welfare efforts fill needs that otherwise go unmet. Social
services have long been a weak link for the Palestinian Authority,
which is strapped for cash and plagued by organizational problems.
	   For example, there are no public kindergartens in the
Palestinian lands. Tuition at private kindergartens averages around
dlrs 500 a year, an enormous expense for many families.
	   Preschools run by the Islamic groups, by contrast, are usually
either free or very inexpensive. At the Bethlehem preschool,
parents pay only what they can afford.
	   Israel says Islamic institutions in themselves do not
necessarily pose a threat, but maintains the larger infrastructure
provides a political and recruiting base as well as a channel for
financing underground fighters.
	   ``We are saying the Palestinian Authority has the tools to cut
the linkage between the social apparatus and the terrorist wing,''
said Moshe Fogel, the Israeli government spokesman.
	   Israel also says Islamic organizations _ particularly schools
and youth clubs _ are hotbeds of incitement.
	   That is undoubtedly true of some; even in mainstream public
Palestinian schools, stridently nationalistic songs and
anti-Israeli rhetoric are common.
	   At the Bethlehem preschool, though, there are no Islamic
pictures or posters in evidence. Teachers say the children learn
verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book, but that religious
instruction is by no means the main activity.
	   ``Mostly they play together, draw pictures, learn their numbers,
things like that,'' Issa said.
	   Since the Oct. 23 signing of the latest peace accord, the
Palestinian Authority has been taking a two-track approach to
dealing with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. It has rounded up hundreds of
activists and put Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin under
house arrest, but it has also been holding consultations with the
groups' leaders.
	   Last weekend, senior Palestinian officials said that while
anyone plotting violence would be dealt with harshly, the Islamic
groups should be free to operate as political entities.
	   Those who run social service organizations say their activities
should come under that umbrella, too.
	   ``Come back for a visit next week,'' said Issa. ``If we're
open.''

Recent engine explosion on South African 747 under investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ United States and South
African civil aviation authorities are investigating an airplane
engine explosion that occurred on a South African Airways-owned
Boeing 747, according to a television report.
	   The explosion occurred three weeks ago and forced the plane en
route from Johannesburg to Maputo, Mozambique, to land with serious
structural damage, SABC-TV news reported Friday.
	   There were no injuries to the 200 people on board.
	   The plane, which may never fly again, was leased by Mozambican
airlines from South African Airways, the report said.
	   Rennie van Zyl, who heads South Africa's civil aviation
authority, told SABC-TV that the investigation focused on proper
assembly procedures mandated by the engine's manufacturer.
	   ``This is an exceptional case. It is not a known type of failure
in the industry, hence our concern and interest in establishing
exactly what has happened with a view to prevent further
occurrences,'' Van Zyl was quoted as saying.
	   SAA confirmed that investigations were taking place, SABC said.
	   The airline could not be reached for comment on Saturday.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With statements by the American and Iraqi
presidents offering no hint a U.S. military strike can be avoided,
Iraq appealed on Saturday for help from Arab nations should an
attack be launched.
	   Iraqis also took to the streets Saturday in government-organized
demonstrations backing President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   With the crisis over U.N. weapons inspectors deepening, Saddam
and U.S. President Bill Clinton laid out familiar positions on
Friday.
	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections, Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a
pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with his
decisions in August and last month to block the searches by U.N.
inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   In the Iraqi capital, fears were growing that a military strike
was imminent. Motorists jammed their cars by the hundreds into
gasoline stations, forming long lines to fill up their tanks.
Shoppers found some prices rising in crowded markets.
	   On Saturday, the editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers
pleaded with the Arab world to back Iraq.
	   Al-Qadissiya pointed out that Iraq in the past sent troops to
aid Arab countries fighting Israel and urged them to reciprocate.
	   Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense
of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples
have to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its
confrontation against American threats.''
	   Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's uneasy Gulf neighbors _
have called for a diplomatic solution to the latest crisis. But
they also have insisted that Iraq resume cooperation with U.N.
inspectors or risk the consequences.
	   The official Al-Iraq daily spoke of Iraq's ``helping hand'' to
its Arab brothers and sought help to prevent the United States from
destroying its industry and infrastructure.
	   At Friday prayers in the nation's mosques, preachers issued
similar pleas to Arabs and Muslims.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   On the streets Saturday, several hundred Iraqi workers marched
from from downtown Tahrir Square to the headquarters of the U.N.
Development Program on the River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is
staying forever.''
	   At the Baath Party demonstration at the National Theater,
hundreds of loyalists broke into applause whenever speakers
mentioned Saddam's name.
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles _
part of the government program to defend the capital _ paraded at
the National Stadium.
	   Shoppers, meanwhile, expressed little fear of a U.S. attack,
reflecting government efforts to forge a united front against the
U.N. sanctions, imposed eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait,
leading to the Persian Gulf War.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, shopping for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her four
children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting
Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards had been
dispersed around Baghdad and in provinces further north. It said
several intelligence and security departments, such as Military
Intelligence and the Special Security Organization, had been
ordered to move to the outskirts of the capital.
	   ``All their offices are empty now,'' the group said in a fax
sent to Cairo.

Musashimaru loses for 6-1 record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Ozeki (champion) Musashimaru lost his bout
against sekiwake (junior champion) Takatoriki on Saturday and
slipped to 6-1, leaving low-ranked Kotonishiki in the lead alone at
7-0.
	   Sharing second place with the Hawaiian-born wrestler were
yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana, komusubi (junior champion 2nd
class) Musoyama and No. 9 maegashira (senior wrestler) Tosanoumi.
	   Musashimaru is in contention for his fourth career title.
	   Six wrestlers bunched at 5-2 included yokozuna Takanohana, ozeki
Takanonami, Takatoriki, top-ranked maegashira Kaio and No. 4
maegashira Tamakasuga.
	   The smaller but fast-moving Takatoriki attacked Musashimaru from
the side, batting the hefty ozeki off balance and pulling him down
in a short-lived fight.
	   ``I just tried to attack in such a manner as to get the big,
powerful ozeki out-positioned,'' said a jubilant Takatoriki.
``Otherwise I would have little chance.''
	   Wakanohana overcame a fierce slapping fight launched by Toki as
he worked in for to get grip on the belt, and then shook the No. 4
maegashira off balance and finally forced him out.
	   Wakanohana is seeking his sixth title.
	   Takanohana, winner of 20 tournaments, was in control throughout
as he maneuvered to get behind Tamakasuga and shoved him out.
Takanohana is Wakanohana's younger brother.
	   Kotonishiki, a No. 12-ranked maegashira who sits near the bottom
of the 40-member top division of makuuchi, engaged in a long
arm-lock with No. 6 maegashira Tochinonada (3-4) before pushing him
out to remain undefeated at 7-0.
	   Kotonishiki, winner of one tournament, will now have to face
higher-ranked wrestlers like yokozunas, ozekis and sekiwakes in the
remaining eight days.
	   In a showdown between another two tournament contenders,
Musoyama swept in low against Kaio and pulled him down in a matter
of seconds.
	   Tosanoumi quickly rumbled forward to blast No. 13 maegashira
Gojoro out of the ring. Gojoro fell to 3-4.
	   Among foreign wresters, 12th-ranked maegashira Kyokushuzan, or
Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was shoved out by No. 7 maegashira
Aogiyama (3-4) for his fifth defeat against two victories.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
was forced down by third-ranked Kotoinazuma. Both stood at 3-4.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
beat fourth-ranked Tomonohana (3-4) to improve his mark to 4-3.

Hong Kong wants APEC to address hedge-funds transparency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hong Kong Trade and Industry
Secretary Chau Tak-hay said Saturday Pacific Rim leaders must
address the issue of greater transparency in private-sector
financial institutions, including hedge funds.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in the Malaysian capital, Chau said he hoped the leaders of
the 21-member trade bloc would send a ``strong message'' on the
need to forge an international financial architecture, including
greater transparency in the system as a whole.
	   A draft version of the statement to be issued by leaders at the
end of the summit reportedly calls for APEC nations to examine the
transparency of the international financial system, including
disclosure standards for investment banks, hedge funds and other
institutional investors.
	   Chau said Hong Kong called for the momentum of trade
liberalization in the 21-member bloc to be maintained, and said
APEC should take the lead in starting a new round of trade talks at
the World Trade Organization.
	   Chau said at a meeting earlier Saturday the ministers were
unable to reach a conclusion on a pact that would lift trade
barriers in nine key industries, known as early voluntary sectoral
liberalization. He said those talks were adjourned until Sunday.
	   Asked if he thought a deal could ultimately be reached, Chau
replied, ``I don't know.''
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the U.S.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Report: Probe of dlrs 50 million airport tunnel fraud under way
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Justice Ministry is
investigating the possibility that millions of guilders (dollars)
were siphoned off during the construction of a rail tunnel beneath
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   As much as 100 million guilders (dlrs 50 million) cannot be
accounted for after the construction of the tunnel beneath the
airport's main terminal, widely used by millions of travelers each
year, De Telegraaf said.
	   Investigators are examining records kept by the agency that
oversaw construction of the 1.2 billion guilder (dlrs 600 million)
tunnel, which was opened in 1993, the newspaper said.
	   There is evidence to suggest that billing fraud may be to blame
for the tunnel authority's failure to account for vast sums
allocated by the government and the national railway, the report
said.

Foreign secretary says world cannot ignore Saddam's challenge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS keyword &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Saturday that
the world cannot afford to ignore the threat of Iraqi chemical and
biological weapons, but said he hoped for a diplomatic solution to
the crisis.
	   ``I think it's a bit rich of Saddam Hussein to say he will
respond to any initiative, when all week he has been refusing to
respond to the many initiatives that have been made,'' Cook said in
a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday urged Saddam to make
``a wise decision'' and resume cooperation with weapons inspectors.
Annan earlier met at U.N. headquarters with ambassadors of Russia,
France and China who appealed to him to intervene to find a
diplomatic solution and avert U.S. air strikes.
	   Despite the apparent split in the security council about
possible military action, Cook said the council was united in
regarding Iraq as violating its agreement on weapons inspection.
	   Cook said he would prefer Saddam cooperate with the UN
inspectors.
	   ``But if he won't do that, then he will be disarmed through
military action. We cannot leave him with those weapons,'' Cook
said.
	   ``If one of the consequences of any military action was for
Saddam to be toppled, that would be a bonus, a very welcome bonus,
but that is not the objective of any military action,'' he added.

Singapore to release dlrs 6 billion to give boost to fund industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In a move to jump start its fledgling mutual
fund industry, Singapore said Saturday it will release another 10
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6 billion) to private fund managers
over the next three years.
	   The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the island state's de facto
central bank, said in a statement that the move will help ``build
Singapore into a world-class financial center.''
	   The sum is in addition to 25 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 15
billion) earmarked earlier this year for placement with private
managers, also over the next three years, National Development
Minister Lim Hng Kiang said late Friday.
	   ``These funds will act as seed money to encourage existing fund
management companies to continue to grow in their operations as
well as attract other fund management companies to set up offices
in Singapore,'' he said.
	   Lim, who is also the country's second finance minister, said the
money will be invested with ``qualifying fund managers of good
proven track record and who show commitment to developing the asset
management industry in Singapore.''
	   Their commitment will be measured by the amount of additional
funds they manage from Singapore, as well as their plans to build
local market expertise.
	   ``This increase in critical mass of investors here will mean
more business for the various financial services that Singapore
offers,'' said Lim.
	   The initial government placement was announced in February and
6.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4 billion) has been placed so
far with private managers, he said.

Peru says IMF bailout of Brazil would help stabilize region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Peru's foreign minister Saturday
praised the dlrs 41.5 billion bailout of Brazil organized by the
International Monetary Fund, saying it would help restore stability
to Latin America's biggest economy.
	   ``This is something we have been waiting for,'' Fernando de
Trazegnies told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. ``It is very
important for Latin America.''
	   He spoke on the sidelines of a meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, which Peru formally joined Saturday.
	   Brazil, which accounts for 40 percent of Latin American economic
output, is the latest country to be stricken by the global
contagion that began in Thailand in 1997.
	   De Trazegnies said the bailout package, which includes
contributions from the U.S. and other countries, would help
entrench economic reform introduced recently by Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   ``I am expecting President Cardoso can succeed now,'' he said.
	   The IMF unveiled the financial assistance package for Brazil on
Friday, tying the release of the funds to a government commitment
to open the economy, maintain ``firm monetary discipline'' and
retain its current exchange rate regime.

Uzbekistan denounces Tajik president's claim that it trained
</HEADLINE>
rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Uzbekistan's government denounced a
Tajik claim that it trained rebels responsible for anti-government
raids inside Tajikistan, an official said Saturday.
	   Tajikistan President Emomali Rakhmonov's claim that Uzbekistan
helped the rebels is ``an emotional and rash act which can lead to
serious complications and national confrontation,'' the Uzbek
foreign ministry said in a statement, according to Uzbekistan's
ambassador to Tajikistan.
	   Rakhmonov's allegations came in the wake of several days of
fighting in Tajikistan, which neighbors Uzbekistan in Central Asia.
The rebels were defeated and chased into northern mountainous
regions, near the two former Soviet republics' border.
	   Rakhmonov claimed the rebels had not only fled into Uzbekistan,
but had been receiving training and assistance there for this and
previous anti-government raids.
	   Ambassador Bakhtior Urdashev said the claim was ``unacceptable
and unfounded,'' and caused ``deep bewilderment among the Uzbek
government and public.''
	   Uzbekistan offered its help to Tajikistan to conduct an
investigation to ``make sure the statement of the Tajik authorities
is groundless,'' the foreign ministry statement said.
	   Tajikistan officials say that 120 people were killed during the
fighting, and more than 600 injured.
	   The former Soviet republics in Central Asia _ Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan _ generally
enjoy good relations, and the dispute marks a rare public
disagreement between regional leaders.

 &UR; Kurds protest Ocalan arrest

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - About 100 Kurds began a hunger strike in
the main square of Nicosia on Saturday to protest the detention in
Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Men and women wearing white shrouds danced to Kurdish music
blared through loudspeakers beneath the Venetian walls of the old
city. Several hundred Kurdish refugees have fled their homeland for
this Mediterranean island nations.
	   Red and gold flags of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party of
Turkey, known as the PKK, fluttered over huge cloth banners with
slogans in English and Greek calling for Ocalan's release.
	   Ocalan is the leader of the PKK which has been waging an
rebellion in southeast Turkey for the past 14 years in a demand for
autonomy. Turkey has branded him a terrorist, holding him
responsible for nearly 37,000 deaths in the conflict.
	   Italy announced that Ocalan was arrested on arrival at Rome's
airport Thursday on the basis of an outstanding Turkish warrant.
	   The protesters distributed pamphlets by the National Liberation
Front of Kurdistan, the PKK's political wing. These quoted Ocalan
as saying he flew to Rome with the knowledge of the Italian
government.
	   He was further quoted as saying that ``necessary procedures are
under way so that I can remain in this country (Italy) in my
political capacity. But it is too early to say anything positive or
negative on developments.
	   ``I call on our people, our friends and the entire international
community to watch developments closely.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians alike are
eagerly awaiting the arrival of thousands of international
observers and aid workers to Kosovo. But cash _ not peace _ is
foremost on most minds.
	   ``I doubt the outsiders can establish lasting peace in Kosovo,''
said Gani Smajli, an unemployed French language teacher applying as
a translator for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. ``But I know they'll be spending bucks and creating jobs.''
	   The OSCE is forming a 2,000-strong mission of unarmed verifiers
of a U.S.-sponsored peace deal for Kosovo reached in October. The
mission's budget is expected to be about dlrs 200 million for one
year. Much of that money will pay up to 6,000 locals as
translators, drivers, secretaries and mechanics.
	   Those wages and the additional money that foreigners are
expected to spend while on Kosovo duty means better times for the
Albanian-majority Serbian province that has always been
Yugoslavia's poorest area.
	   ``It's a great amount for this region, and the impact on the
economy is going to be huge,'' said Duncan Bullivant, an OSCE
spokesman in Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   Unemployment is hovering around 75 percent of the 1.3-million
workforce, and average monthly salaries amount to no more than dlrs
50. The past months of destruction that have made hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians homeless have made traditional hard
times worse.
	   On Friday, Serb and Albanian stood front to back in long
employment lines in front of the Pristina OSCE office. The prospect
of a job shunted aside enmities _ at least for the time being.
	   Some people hope the increasing foreign presence may boost
long-term prospects for peace.
	   ``The fresh influx of money and the creation of new jobs is
certain to lead to the improving of the economy,'' said economist
Muhamed Mustafa. ``This could eventually lead to people
concentrating more on their living standards, and not on waging
wars.''
	   Others are skeptical.
	   ``Foreigners and their money cannot make us ... forgive,'' said
a Zoran, a Serb hoping to get hired as a driver, even while
conceding that well-paying, steady jobs could help ease hatreds. He
would not give his last name.
	   Since the crackdown on separatist Albanian guerrillas started in
February, thousands of foreign diplomats, international aid workers
and foreign journalists have descended on the drab and sleepy
provincial capital.
	   Their arrival has already made a huge difference for the local
restaurant and hotel owners and made good translators and car
mechanics sought after Agencies offering private accommodation have
popped up for the first time.
	   Pristina, which before the clashes offered a choice between huge
portions of meat, Serb-style, or the more Mediterranean Albanian
cuisine, now has a handful of restaurants serving good
international cuisine. And the state-run Grand _ known among
insiders as the world's worst five-star hotel, serving the world's
worst breakfasts _ now has competition from several cozy private
hostels.
	   ``I can't argue: the clashes have brought me prosperity,'' said
Faik Morina, the owner of the Hotel Dea, a popular residence for
American diplomats, visiting U.S. senators and other public
figures.
	   Morina said that with foreigners pouring in, he plans to open a
casino and a night club in his 20-room hotel.
	   ``I may not know much about running hotels, but sure I know a
lot about gambling and prostitution,'' Morina says. ``That's where
the real money lies.''
	   Even the trademark Gypsy newspaper street vendors are trying to
cash in _ with varying success.
	   One of them, who identified himself only as Mehmet said his new
sideline, selling English, Italian and French dailies, wasn't
working out as well as he hoped.
	   He shrugged, when told his problem _ the fact that his papers
were weeks old.
	   ``I noticed there was something wrong,'' he said. ``But I
thought foreigners are big spenders, no matter what.''

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ With campaigning over and polls
ready, the only thing Burkina Faso needs now for its upcoming
presidential elections is a real opposition contender.
	   The incumbent, Blaise Compaore, faces little competition in
Sunday's polls. A coalition of opposition groups have boycotted the
election in this west African country, where they say the election
is a scam and lacks the necessary transparency to ensure a fair
chance to all candidates.
	   ``We refuse to legitimize an anti-democratic regime,'' said
opposition Party for Democracy and Progress activist Joseph Ki
Zerbo. ``We won't serve as an alibi to install a state-party in our
eyes.''
	   Although Compaore has been working to promote democratic
institutions in Burkina Faso, his opponents say he is simply going
through the motions of fair elections.
	   A former army captain, Compaore was among an elite group of
military officers who mutinied and eventually led to Capt. Thomas
Sankara's assent to power. Sankara was deposed in 1987 and
denounced by Compaore who then assumed control.
	   Compaore held presidential elections in 1991, but a similar
boycott made him the lone candidate and more than 74 percent of
eligible voters failed to cast ballots.
	   Once again, opposition groups have been canvassing voters,
urging them not to participate in the presidential poll.
	   Although they are not entering a candidate, the united
opposition have mounted a highly visible election campaign, posting
notices saying ``Do not vote'' or ``I boycott'' around the capital.
	   The boycott strategy is also partially in response to poor
showing in elections that opposition parties have participated in,
Ki Zerbo conceded.
	   ``Any time we participate in elections, we get less and less,''
he said.
	   In National Assembly elections earlier this year, opposition
candidates won only 9 of 111 seats.
	   Unlike the 1991 poll, there are alternative candidates on the
ballot. Opposition leaders, however, say they are political
unknowns believed actually to be Compaore supporters.
	   Frederic Guirma, one of the two alternative candidates, is
running on the lone campaign promise to change Burkina Faso's name
back to Upper Volta.
	   Compaore, meanwhile, was out shaking hands at a rally Thursday
at a soccer stadium in the capital, Ouagadougou. Faced with the
boycott, he said he was unconcerned.
	   ``If I were alone in 1998, I would still go to the elections
because I am more concerned for my population,'' Compaore said. ``I
would have a feeling of general discomfort if the population did
not show interest in registering to vote, but we are seeing many
people interested in participating in political life.''

Singaporean jailed for illegal use of the Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore man was sentenced to three months
in jail for unauthorized use of the Internet under the island
nation's tough new computer laws, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Daud Mohamed Saini, a 29-year old former business manager, was
found guilty of using a customer's Internet account without
permission between May and June last year, said The Straits Times.
	   Although he only incurred about 40 Singapore dollars (dlrs 24)
of charges while using the account, the court handed him a stiff
penalty under the recently amended Computer Misuse Act.
	   Singapore aims to bring Internet commerce to the heart of this
business center's operations and has passed legislation this year
to regulate electronic transactions and fight cyber-crime.
	   Amended in June, the Computer Misuse Act seeks to enhance
security, deter computer criminals with harsh penalties and broaden
powers of investigation.
	   Daud, who worked at a data and communication products company,
faced a maximum 2,000 Singapore dollar (dlrs 1,200) fine and two
years in prison.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Weary delegates concluded their
global warming summit early Saturday by setting out a plan of
action to begin finding ways to scale back heat-trapping
pollutants.
	   After an all-night struggle, delegates to the U.N. climate
summit from 160 nations united in a pre-dawn session behind a
``Buenos Aires plan of action'' that maps out specific strategies
for carrying out the 1997 Kyoto pact designed to alleviate global
warming.
	   ``This plan of action adds real momentum to the Kyoto
protocol,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the chief U.S. delegate.
	   In December 1997, the United States and 37 other industrial
nations agreed in Kyoto, Japan, to binding reductions in their
greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 _ setting a target 5 percent below
1990 levels.
	   Saturday's agreement sets out a timetable for discussing by 2000
the many issues that still need to be settled, including: whether
to assess penalties against those who don't achieve their goals;
how to transfer climate-friendly technology to developing countries
so they pollute less; and the nuts and bolts of how to measure the
pollutants.
	   ``The document we have just approved establishes a foundation
for speeding up the process of fulfilling the objectives'' of the
Kyoto accord, said Maria Julia Alsogaray, the Argentina chairwoman
and conference president.
	   At stake is one of Earth's most troubling environmental issues:
undue warming of the planet believed to be exacerbated by carbon
dioxide released from burning coal and gas, principally from power
plants and cars.
	   The United States and Europe favored 2000 as the deadline for
setting gritty details needed to flesh out the Kyoto accord; China
and India reportedly opposed a deadline at one point in the talks.
	   A key issue yet to be resolved is a U.S.-European quarrel over
the ``trading'' of emissions credits.
	   The United States seeks unfettered trading of credits with
countries that have more than met their pollution targets, helping
to blunt the cost of cleaning up at home. The European Union,
however, wants limits on trading, saying the priority should be
actual greenhouse gas reductions at home, not just on paper.
	   In a surprise move that rattled developing nations, Argentina
and Kazakstan announced they would voluntarily seek binding
emissions targets like their industrial counterparts.
	   China and India, two developing nations that could surpass the
United States as leading greenhouse gas polluters next century,
opposed even talking about voluntary participation by the emerging
world.
	   Hoping to energize the talks, the United States on Thursday
signed the Kyoto accord, the last major industrial country to do
so. But the signing was largely symbolic because Senate
ratification is not likely anytime soon. The Clinton administration
has said it won't ask the Senate to consider the treaty until
developing countries such as India and China agree to participate _
and that could take years.
	   In Washington, U.S. government scientists reported new evidence
Friday of Earth's undue warming, saying last month's global average
temperature of 58.14 degrees Fahrenheit (14.52 Celsius) fell just
short of the 58.15-degree (14.53 Celsius) record set in October
1997.

Rioting follows deadly student protests in Indonesian capital

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deadly clashes between students and
security forces gave way to widespread rioting in the capital
Saturday as rock-throwing mobs burned cars, looted shops, and
ransacked police stations.
	   While outnumbered riot officers fired warning shots and tear gas
at rampaging crowds, thousands of anti-government students attended
funerals of slain protesters and later assembled peacefully outside
of Parliament to demand democratic reform.
	   Military helicopters swooped above the chaos. Palls of black
smoke towered over a shopping area near one luxury hotel only a few
hundreds meters (yards) from the heavily guarded state palace.
	   There, President B.J. Habibie called for calm before an
emergency meeting with military chief Gen. Wiranto, the defense
minister, and other Cabinet members.
	   Earlier Habibie accused troublemakers of trying to ``overthrow''
his 6-month-old government and ``endanger the unity of the nation
and the people.''
	   Opposition leaders and student activists called on Habibie and
Wiranto to quit.
	   ``Habibie must step down now. We have had enough of this
government,'' said one man who identified himself by the single
name of Irwan at the scene of one fire.
	   Pro-democracy activists said Wiranto must resign immediately so
order can be restored within military ranks and the streets.
	   ``His policies have imperiled the nation's future,'' they said
in a statement.
	   At least 12 people, most of them students, have died this week
in the worst violence in Jakarta since riots and protests ousted
former President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian
rule.
	   Most died from plastic bullet wounds in a series of deadly
assaults on Friday night. Police chiefs denied their officers or
troops fired live ammunition at the students when they tried to
march on Parliament.
	   The protests broke out this week against a government assembly
that students claimed was not serious about democratic change.
	   The looting and burning on Saturday was reminiscent of the May
riots, which were fueled by discontent over Indonesia's economic
crisis. They also were triggered by the shooting of students by the
military.
	   Buildings were burning in several areas on Saturday, including
Jakarta's Chinatown, badly hit by rioting last May, when 1,200
people were killed.
	   The Chinese minority, prominent in business, is often targeted
during times of civil unrest in Indonesia.
	   As in the tumultuous days before Suharto quit, police and
soldiers were again largely helpless or absent in the face of the
rioting.
	   Suharto weighed in Saturday, saying the government should
apologize for the students' deaths and listen to protesters'
demands.
	   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed. Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?'' Suharto's half-brother,
Probosutedjo, quoted him as saying.
	   The comments were reported by the official Antara news agency.
	   The violence on Saturday started when neighborhood youths set
military tents afire in the street near Parliament and burned
several vehicles, including an army truck, next to the University
of Indonesia.
	   In another area, mobs stoned a shopping center as crowds cheered
and police and soldiers stood by. In northern Jakarta, armored
personnel carriers parked amid a crowd of rioters who smashed car
showroom windows and set shops on fire. But soldiers did nothing.
	   Mobs threw rocks at buses parked outside the foreign ministry.
	   Earlier about 5,000 students gathered at a cemetery for the
funeral of Sigit Prasetyo, a 20-year-old student who was shot dead
Friday. They watched as his casket, draped in a red and white
Indonesian flag and a traditional Islamic funeral cloth, was
lowered in damp red earth.
	   On Saturday morning a policeman accidentally shot and wounded a
navy marine in the leg.
	   At one riot later, a mob beat one policeman to death and police
accidentally shot and wounded a navy marine.
	   Critics say the nation's highest legislative body stopped short
of promised democratic change, even though it backed a plan by
Habibie to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed
to name Suharto in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Members of the People's Consultative Assembly, filled with
holdovers from the Suharto era, say the decree will bolster an
ongoing investigation of the wealth of the 77-year-old former
president.
	   Students reject the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto. The assembly also did not heed their demand that
the military be banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military directly appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With statements by the American and Iraqi
presidents offering no hint a U.S. military strike can be avoided,
Iraq appealed to Arab nations on Saturday for help in case of an
attack.
	   Iraqis also took part in government-organized demonstrations on
Saturday backing President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another protest
Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and Israeli flags.
	   With the crisis over U.N. weapons inspectors deepening, Saddam
and U.S. President Bill Clinton laid out familiar positions on
Friday.
	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute over
weapons inspections, Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a
pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insists he was not trying to create a crisis with his
decisions in August and last month to block the weapons searches.
He said Iraq is open to suggestions on how to end the crisis.
``Iraq will accept positively any initiative that meets these just
and balanced demands,'' he said.
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumes its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, must stay until inspectors certify Iraq has
destroyed those weapons.
	   In Baghdad, fears were growing that a military strike was
imminent. Hundreds of motorists lined up for gas and prices of some
foodstuffs rose.
	   On Saturday, editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers pleaded
with the Arab world to back Iraq.
	   Al-Qadissiya noted that Iraq has in the past sent troops to aid
Arab countries fighting Israel.
	   Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense
of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples
have to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its
confrontation against American threats.''
	   Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's Gulf neighbors _ have
called for a diplomatic solution, but they have also insisted Iraq
cooperate with U.N. inspectors or suffer the consequences.
	   The official Al-Iraq daily spoke of Iraq's ``helping hand'' to
its Arab brothers and sought help to prevent the United States from
destroying its industry and infrastructure.
	   At Friday prayers in the nation's mosques, preachers issued
similar pleas.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   On the streets Saturday, several hundred Iraqi workers marched
from downtown Tahrir Square to the headquarters of the U.N.
Development Program on the River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is
staying forever.''
	   At the Baath Party demonstration at the National Theater,
hundreds of loyalists clapped whenever speakers mentioned Saddam's
name.
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles _
part of a government program to defend the capital _ paraded at the
National Stadium.
	   Shoppers, meanwhile, appreared unafraid of a U.S. attack,
perhaps reflecting government efforts to forge a united front
against the U.N. sanctions, imposed eight years ago after Iraq
invaded Kuwait, leading to the Persian Gulf War.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, shopping for sugar and coconuts to make sweets for her four
children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved on
highways and to oil fields in the north near Kirkuk.
	   A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting
Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards had been
dispersed around Baghdad and in provinces further north. It said
several intelligence and security departments, such as military
intelligence and the Special Security Organization, had been
ordered to move to the outskirts of the capital.
	   ``All their offices are empty now,'' the group said in a fax
sent to Cairo.

Malaysia cautions U.S. against meeting sacked minister's wife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian government said
Saturday that U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright should not
meddle in Malaysia's internal affairs by meeting with the wife of
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that
Albright would be in Malaysia as a guest.
	   ``She should know what to do,'' he said.
	   Mrs. Albright will be attending the summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation. She announced earlier in the week that she
intended to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   ``Foreign officials and leaders attending the APEC meetings
should not interfere in Malaysia's affairs,'' Abdullah told the
Malaysian government news agency Bernama.
	   Many world leaders have voiced concern over Anwar's ouster from
government and his alleged beating by police after his arrest Sept.
20.
	   To Malaysia's discontent, several high-ranking foreign officials
have said they hoped to meet with Azizah Ismail while in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   ``Malaysia does not expect its guests to interfere in its
internal affairs. This (also) goes for other leaders in APEC,'' the
foreign minister added.
	   That did not stop the Canadian foreign minister from having
lunch with Azizah on Saturday.
	   Mrs. Albright was scheduled to arrive in Kuala Lumpur Saturday.
Details of her announced meeting with Azizah were not available.

Report: Thai sugar producers threaten production stoppage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For the second time this year, sugar
planters and millers are demanding that the government raise the
controlled price of the commodity, a local newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The growers and millers are threatening to stop all sugar
production from the beginning of next month if their demands are
not met, the Bangkok Post said.
	   The move could force Thailand to make large-scale imports of
sugar for the first time in decades and raise the price of sugar
for consumers from the current level of 11-15 baht a kilogram (dlrs
0.14-0.19 a pound) to as much as 20 baht a kilogram (dlrs 0.25 a
pound), the newspaper reported.
	   Growers and millers are seeking a price of 785 baht (dlrs 21.22)
per ton for sugar, with growers taking a government-mandated 70
percent share and millers 30 percent, said the report.
	   The sugar producers claim a hike is necessitated by rising
production costs, said the paper, quoting an unnamed source who
estimated they would be at least 710 baht (dlrs 19.19)per ton for
the 1998-99 season.
	   In April, the government rejected demands by sugarcane planters
to raise domestic sugar prices, a politically sensitive issue
during the current recession.
	   The Commerce Ministry ruled out a request for a price hike of 3
baht (8 cents) per kilogram, following talks with 10 planters.
	   The rejection came after the producers called off a threatened
mass demonstration the capital after the government had tentatively
worked out a compromise on the price hikes.
	   Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the House committee on
agriculture Friday, an industry official recalled the failed deal.
	   ``The government has failed to keep its promise of a fair price
that would enable the industry to continue functioning,'' Rachai
Chusilpkul, secretary general of the Federation of Sugarcane
Farmers of Thailand was quoted as saying by the Post.
	   The new protest will not include any mass rallies, the newspaper
quoted industry sources as saying.

Dutch Cabinet approves plan to give gays right to adopt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Accelerating a push to expand gay
rights ahead of the new millennium, the Dutch Cabinet has approved
a plan to let homosexuals _ who already may marry here _ adopt
children.
	   The legislation, approved late Friday by top ministers of the
coalition government led by Prime Minister Wim Kok, would restrict
adoptions to Dutch children. It will go before parliament, probably
early in 1999, in a drive to have it become law by Jan. 1, 2000.
	   Under the proposal, gays and lesbians would not be allowed to
adopt children from abroad out of respect for other countries'
laws, and out of concern that international adoption agencies would
stop approving adoptions to all Dutch couples, heterosexuals
included.
	   The plan would limit the right to adopt to homosexual couples
who have lived together for at least three years and together have
cared for the child for a full year. It would not require a couple
to marry or legally register their partnership.
	   Prospective gay parents would have to demonstrate in court that
the child they wish to adopt would be better off with them, Kok
said.
	   The legislation, said to have broad backing in parliament,
revives a push that began several years ago to further expand the
rights granted under Dutch law to homosexuals.
	   A new Dutch law took effect on Jan. 1 permitting same-sex
couples to marry and giving them the same pension, social security
and inheritance rights as a married heterosexual couple.
	   There was no discernible protest over Friday's Cabinet approval
in the liberal Netherlands, which is among the few countries to
allow same-sex marriage and which has welcomed homosexuals to serve
openly in the military since the 1970s.
	   Recent public opinion surveys have shown that seven in 10 Dutch
people think homosexuals could make good parents.
	   In the past, however, Dutch bishops have been among those
opposed to homosexual adoption on moral and biblical grounds.
	   Denmark, Norway and Sweden also legally recognize gay
partnerships but have not allowed them to adopt. In the United
States, matters of marriage and adoption are overseen by states and
hashed out in the courts; some U.S. states allow homosexual
adoption and a few forbid it.
	   Germany's new center-left government indicated this week that it
intends to grant some sort of legal status to same-sex couples, but
not an outright ``gay marriage'' and not the right to adopt
children.
	   In France, a bill aimed at giving legal status to unmarried
couples has triggered fierce debate and street protests amid fears
among conservatives that it could legalize homosexual marriage and
lead to gay adoption.

Russian nuclear energy minister to visit Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's atomic energy minister will travel to
Iran soon to check on plans for a nuclear power plant to be built
there with Russian parts, a news report said Saturday.
	   Minister Yevgeny Adamov will travel to Bushehr, where Russian
specialists are to install a VVER-1000 light water reactor in a
dlrs 800 million contract, he told the Interfax news agency.
	   The United States fears the project will help Iran advance its
suspected nuclear weapons program, and has expressed disapproval.
But Russia, desperate for hard cash, says the reactor can be used
only for civilian purposes and is anxious to press ahead.
	   Adamov also said the Russian government will guarantee to go
ahead with constructing a similar nuclear power plant in China
despite the financial crisis that hit the Russian government in
August.
	   Chinese leaders earlier voiced concern that the two-reactor
project, which would garner Russia dlrs 2.5 billion, would collapse
because of the Russian economic crisis.
	   Russia continues to rile western governments by signing deals
with volatile countries for sales of arms and nuclear technology.
It has also signed a contract for a nuclear plant in India.

Lumpur, Malaysia angry over Albright's promise to meet Anwar's
wife. No pickup.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met here Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis,
hundreds of people demonstrated against the Malaysian government.
	   Defying the 5,700 police and security officers who have been
stationed in the capital, more than 500 people rallied in downtown
Kuala Lumpur to criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Shouting slogans and carrying banners saying ``Mahathir is power
crazy,'' the protesters criticized his treatment of Anwar Ibrahim,
the deputy prime minister who was fired two months ago, then jailed
after launching a nationwide reform movement.
	   No violence was reported, and the protest didn't immediately
spread from the neighborhood where it began.
	   Mahathir is determined to prevent Anwar's struggle from becoming
a focus of this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
meeting. But as officials from the many foreign governments met
over the weekend to prepare for it, several officials went out of
their way to sympathize with Anwar.
	   Two top Canadian officials met on Saturday with his wife, Azizah
Ismail, who has become the de facto leader of his pro-reform
movement since he was jailed and put on trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and its international
trade minister, Sergio Marchi, invited Azizah to lunch between
their meetings with other APEC officials.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy said after the luncheon.
	   ``We have been meeting with a number of people to get a briefing
on what the situation is, (and) expressed concerns with the
treatment of Anwar and others detained.''
	   Anwar, also ousted as finance minister, claims that he was
beaten by police before his trial started. And pictures of him
walking into his trial with a black eye have been seen in
newspapers and television broadcasts around the world.
	   Some APEC leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have
said they won't meet privately with Mahathir during the summit
because of what has happened in Malaysia.
	   Azizah also plans to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who was to arrive in Malaysia on Saturday night and to
participate in the meetings before the APEC summit.
	   The Malaysian government said Saturday that Albright should not
meddle in Malaysia's internal affairs by meeting with Azizah.
	   Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that
Albright ``will be here as a guest and she should know what to
do.'' Speaking to Malaysia's government news agency, he also said:
``Foreign officials and leaders attending the APEC meetings should
not interfere in Malaysia's affairs.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was to arrive in
Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah, too.
	   In the meantime, APEC Cabinet ministers met Saturday to discuss
a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade, but
Japan and the United States remained deeply divided over a key
provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and
fish _ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   A Japanese news agency, which obtained a draft of the APEC
group's final statement, reported that it urges APEC to deal
urgently with the global crisis and to closely examine the
operations of the world's secretive and risky hedge funds.
	   Investments by the funds have been blamed for the some of the
wild fluctuations in Asia's currency and stock markets.
	   In the meantime, Mahathir said in an interview with a government
news agency that he will take his biggest pet complaint to APEC
leaders: currency speculators. Mahathir has made it clear that
international controls on foreign currency trading will be on the
agenda of the APEC summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' Mahathir said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Three soldiers detained for killing of civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Three soldiers, one an officer, have
been detained for killings by government troops of innocent
civilians during a military operation to hunt down rebels, the
government said Saturday.
	   A written statement said investigators were questioning the
three men about the slayings on the night of Nov. 3-4 in Mutambu
commune, 35 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the capital.
	   The army earlier this week apologized for the massacre and
announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the
attack.
	   The statement said the official death toll of those wrongly
killed was now 56.
	   But survivors said the minority Tutsi-led army killed more than
100 mostly Hutu civilians in retaliation for a Hutu rebel attack on
a nearby camp for Tutsis.
	   They said rebels attacked the Tutsi camp at Maramvya the night
of Oct. 30-31, killing five people. Four nights later, the army
killed Hutu villagers in nearby Rutovu accusing them of cooperating
with the rebels, witnesses said.
	   The killings were the deadliest since a third round of peace
talks aimed at ending ethnic and politic conflict in Burundi
concluded in October.
	   Hutu rebels are operating to topple the government of President
Pierre Buyoya, a retired Tutsi officer who took control of Burundi
in a bloodless coup in 1996.
	   The Tutsis, who make up 14 percent of the country's population
of 6 million, control the military. Hutus account for 84 percent.
	   In a statement released Friday, spokesman for U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan said he was shocked by the killings and urged
the culprits be punished.
	   ``It is imperative that all violence and attacks directed at
civilians come immediately to an end and that all parties involved
in the Burundi conflict ensure the full respect of international
humanitarian law and humanitarian principles,'' he said.
	   In Bujumbura, National Assembly president, Leonce Ngendakumana,
on Friday also called for justice.
	   He charged that killings of civilians by government forces were
taking place in other communes of Rural Bujumbura as well.
	   ``It is incredible that some soldiers of the army who must
protect civilians can do such criminal activities,'' Ngendakumana
said Friday.
	   Ethnic violence in Burundi has left more than 200,000 people
dead since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's
first democratically elected president Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.
	   Buyoya's promise to stem the bloodshed has proven fruitless to
date.

After defeating leukemia, Holan returns to the ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - After a two-year battle with
leukemia, Czech defenseman Milos Holan has returned to the ice.
	   The former Philadelphia Flyers and Anaheim Mighty Ducks
defenseman appeared Friday for HC Vitkovice, one of the top Czech
teams. It was his first game since early 1996, when he underwent
medical treatment, including chemotherapy and bone marrow
transplantation.
	   Vitkovice lost to Slavia 6-3, and Holan neither scored or
assisted. But he was happy to have been able to play at all.
	   ``I expected it would be much worse,'' Holan, 27, commented on
his performance after the match. ``I'm the happiest man on Earth
now, I have the same feelings as when I first played in the NHL.''
	   Vitkovice coach Vladimir Vujtek said Holan put on a ``very good
performance.''
	   Holan, the best Czech hockey player of 1993, played a total of
49 matches in the NHL in 1994-96.
	   He was rejected by the Mighty Ducks after pre-season camp this
summer, and returned to his native club of HC Vitkovice.

Canadian prime minister decides not to meet Malaysian dissident's
</HEADLINE>
wife
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien decided
Saturday not to meet with the wife of Malaysian dissident Anwar
Ibrahim, opting instead to press the issue of his treatment
directly with his Malaysian counterpart during a Pacific Rim summit
next week.
	   A spokesperson for the prime minister's office said Chretien
would take advantage of his seat next to Mahathir Mohamad at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to raise the issue with him
instead of meeting Azizah Ismail, who has become de facto leader of
her husband's pro-reform movement.
	   Chretien had already canceled a previously planned one-on-one
bilateral with Mahathir to protest the treatment of Anwar, who was
ousted from the number two spot in the government and later
detained under the draconian Internal Security Act.
	   Anwar was eventually charged with abuse of power and sexual
misconduct, and appeared in court soon thereafter with a blackened
eye and neck brace that he said resulted from a police beating.
	   Violent anti-government protests followed his detention, and
world attention has been focused on his continuing trial. Leaders
from around the globe have criticized the former deputy prime
minister's treatment.
	   On Saturday, Canada's Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and
International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi became the highest
ranking officials to meet Azizah Ismail since Anwar's arrest.
	   The Canadian officials were in the Malaysian capital of Kuala
Lumpur attending pre-summit gatherings.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy told reporters after the luncheon with Azizah.
	   Chretien's spokesperson said his decision not to meet Anwar's
wife was more pragmatic than symbolic. While his ministers
communicated directly with Azizah, Chretien's role in the Anwar
issue would be to speak to the man responsible for his ouster and
arrest, Mahathir.
	   Others attending the APEC meeting have expressed their desire to
confer with Anwar's wife.
	   The Malaysian government said Saturday that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright should not meddle in Malaysia's internal
affairs with her planned meeting with Azizah.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was scheduled to
arrive in Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah too.

After defeating leukemia, Holan returns to the ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After a two-year battle with
leukemia, Czech defenseman Milos Holan returned to the ice.
	   The former Philadelphia Flyers and Anaheim Mighty Ducks
defenseman appeared Friday for HC Vitkovice, one of the top Czech
teams. It was his first game since early 1996, when he underwent
medical treatment, including chemotherapy and bone marrow
transplantation.
	   Vitkovice lost to Slavia 6-3, and Holan got no points. But he
was happy to play at all.
	   ``I expected it would be much worse,'' Holan, 27, said
afterwards. ``I'm the happiest man on Earth now, I have the same
feelings as when I first played in the NHL.''
	   Vitkovice coach Vladimir Vujtek said Holan put on a ``very good
performance.''
	   Holan, the top Czech hockey player in 1993, played a 49 NHL
games from 1994-96.
	   He was cut by the Mighty Ducks after preseason camp this summer,
and returned to his native club HC Vitkovice.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to
the final of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on Saturday after
sixth-seeded Marc Rosset withdrew in the second set with a hip
injury.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, dominated through
the entire match, going ahead 6-1, 2-0 before Rosset retired.
	   A two-time Kremlin Cup winner, Rosset couldn't keep up with
Kafelnikov from the start. The only reminder of his powerful serve
was four straight aces in the sixth game _ the one time he would
hold serve.
	   After the set, a trainer came on to treat Rosset, who had
injured his left hip flexor and groin during practice in the
morning.
	   The second set was no better than the first, with Rosset, of
Switzerland, unable to make a single first serve in the first game.
Kafelnikov broke him and quickly wrapped up the second, after which
Rosset stepped down and apologizing briefly to the crowd.

Malaysian activists urge APEC leaders to discuss Anwar

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian opposition activists
denounced Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Saturday and urged
Pacific Rim leaders to address the plight of his jailed former
deputy at their upcoming summit.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy prime minister, was sacked in
September and appeared in court soon after with a black eye that he
said resulted from severe police beatings.
	   Mahathir is struggling to keep discussion of Anwar out of talks
among the 21 leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum. Activists say Anwar cannot be ignored.
	   ``The APEC summit is taking place in a nation which is in the
middle of an unprecedented, unparalleled crisis,'' said a statement
signed by 29 Malaysian political parties and non-governmental
groups.
	   The Malaysian activists read their statement at a ``People's
Summit'' that was held in Kuala Lumpur before the actual APEC
summit next Tuesday and Wednesday. The group has attracted some 700
social activists from around the Pacific Rim.
	   ``The Prime Minister should realize that the people's
disenchantment with him arises from their revulsion for
authoritarian rule and abuse of power,'' the statement said.
	   It called for an end to the harsh Internal Security Act, under
which Anwar was arrested Sept. 20. The law allows indefinite
detention without trial. The activists also demanded Mahathir hold
a general election or step down as prime minister.
	   Anwar's case, particularly his black eye, sparked concern from
leaders around the world. His trial on corruption and sexual
misconduct charges is on hold until after APEC ends.
	   ``There is no way trade can flourish if human rights concerns
are not addressed,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, whose group,
International Movement for a Just World, was a signatory on the
statement.

Rioting follows deadly student protests in Indonesian capital
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Habibie calling for action by military to restore
order, graf 5; rioting being brought under control in some areas,
still raging in others, graf 6
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deadly clashes between students and
security forces gave way to widespread rioting in the capital
Saturday as rock-throwing mobs burned cars, looted shops and
ransacked police stations.
	   While outnumbered riot officers fired warning shots and tear gas
at rampaging crowds, thousands of anti-government students attended
funerals of slain protesters and later peacefully assembled outside
of Parliament to demand democratic reform.
	   Military helicopters swooped above the chaos. Palls of black
smoke towered over a shopping area near one luxury hotel only a few
hundreds meters (yards) from the heavily guarded state palace.
	   There, President B.J. Habibie called for calm before an
emergency meeting with military chief Gen. Wiranto, the defense
minister and other Cabinet members.
	   Earlier Habibie ordered the military to take immediate action to
restore order.
	   As night fell, rioting still raged in some areas although other
trouble spots were brought under control, mostly by squads of
marines. Fire trucks were working to put out flames.
	   Habibie accused troublemakers of trying to ``overthrow'' his
6-month-old government and ``endanger the unity of the nation and
the people.''
	   Opposition leaders and student activists called on Habibie and
Wiranto to quit.
	   ``Habibie must step down now. We have had enough of this
government,'' said one man, who identified himself by the single
name of Irwan, at the scene of one fire.
	   Pro-democracy activists said Wiranto must resign immediately so
order can be restored within military ranks and the streets.
	   ``His policies have imperiled the nation's future,'' they said
in a statement.
	   At least 12 people, most of them students, have died this week
in the worst violence in Jakarta since riots and protests ousted
former President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian
rule.
	   Most died from plastic bullet wounds in a series of deadly
assaults on Friday night. Police chiefs denied their officers or
troops fired live ammunition at the students when they tried to
march on Parliament.
	   The protests broke out this week against a government assembly
that students claimed was not serious about democratic change.
	   The looting and burning on Saturday was reminiscent of the May
riots, which were fueled by discontent over Indonesia's economic
crisis. They also were triggered by the shooting of students by the
military.
	   Buildings were burning in several areas on Saturday, including
Jakarta's Chinatown, badly hit by rioting last May, when 1,200
people were killed.
	   The Chinese minority, who are prominent in business, are often
targeted during times of civil unrest in Indonesia.
	   As in the tumultuous days before Suharto quit, police and
soldiers were initially helpless or absent in the face of the
rioting. This changed with the arrival of reinforcements of
marines, who unlike other sections of the military are respected by
many ordinary Indonesians as fair and disciplined.
	   Suharto weighed in Saturday, saying the government should
apologize for the students' deaths and listen to protesters'
demands, according to the official Antara news agency.
	   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed. Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?'' Suharto was quoted as saying by
his half-brother, Probosutedjo, in the Antara report.
	   The violence on Saturday started when neighborhood youths set
military tents afire in the street near Parliament and burned
several vehicles, including an army truck, next to the University
of Indonesia.
	   In another area, mobs stoned a shopping center as crowds cheered
and police and soldiers stood by. In northern Jakarta, armored
personnel carriers parked amid a crowd of rioters who smashed car
showroom windows and set shops on fire. But soldiers did nothing.
	   Mobs threw rocks at buses parked outside the foreign ministry.
	   Earlier about 5,000 students gathered at a cemetery for the
funeral of Sigit Prasetyo, a 20-year-old student who was shot dead
Friday. They watched as his casket, draped in a red and white
Indonesian flag and a traditional Islamic funeral cloth, was
lowered in damp red earth.
	   On Saturday morning a policeman accidentally shot and wounded a
marine in the leg.
	   At one riot later, a mob beat one policeman to death and police
accidentally shot and wounded another marine.
	   Critics say the nation's highest legislative body stopped short
of promised democratic change, even though it backed a plan by
Habibie to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed
to name Suharto in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Members of the People's Consultative Assembly, filled with
holdovers from the Suharto era, say the decree will bolster an
ongoing investigation of the wealth of the 77-year-old former
president.
	   Students reject the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto. The assembly also did not heed their demand that
the military be banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military directly appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.

Cruise ship sails for North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A cruise ship chartered by South
Korea's largest conglomerate sailed for North Korea on Saturday in
a test run for sightseeing tours of the reclusive communist
country's scenic east coast.
	   The 28,700-ton Hyundai Kumkang was expected to arrive at Jang
Jon Port near the North's Diamond Mountain on Sunday morning with
840 crewmen, tourist guides and officials from the Hyundai
conglomerate, which is organizing the tours.
	   The passengers will tour the scenic mountain and check
facilities for a day before returning home Monday.
	   Although the trip was a rehearsal tour, it marked the largest
single group of South Koreans to visit rival North Korea since the
two countries were at war more than four decades ago.
	   The same vessel will carry 980 tourists and 600 crewmen
Wednesday for a four-day tour of Diamond Mountain, the first of
commercial sightseeing tours that Hyundai hopes will carry up to
2,000 tourists a week to the North.
	   The tourism project would be the first major joint venture
between the two hostile Korean states and give Pyongyang a new
source of badly needed foreign currency.
	   Also Saturday, North Korea promised to ``render all convenience
to South Korean visitors and guarantee their personal safety,''
said the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
	   The Korean states were separated into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war
after the 1950-53 Korean War ended without a permanent peace
treaty.

Germany deports Turkish juvenile delinquent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian state officials on Saturday
deported a 14-year-old Turkish juvenile delinquent born and raised
in Germany, despite critics who said the state should help the
troubled boy instead of sending him away.
	   Muhlis Ari, known in the German media as ``Mehmet'' departed on
a 12:01 p.m. (1101 GMT) Lufthansa flight for Istanbul, Turkey,
accompanied on the plane by three federal police officials and his
16-year-old girlfriend.
	   His lawyer, but not his parents, took him to the Munich airport.
Germany's highest court on Friday cleared the way for the
deportation when it rejected his lawyer's arguments that Ari's
rights were being violated.
	   ``The judges' decision ... may be legally correct, but it is
regrettable as far as promoting a policy of integration'' of
foreigners,'' said Cem Ozdemir, domestic policy spokesman for the
Greens party.
	   The Mehmet case made headlines this summer when Bavarian
officials sought to deport not only the boy, but also his parents,
who have lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
	   The case became an election-year issue, with liberals accusing
the ruling conservatives of using a family tragedy to show they
were cracking down on ``criminal foreigners.''
	   Courts have blocked the deportation of the parents, who were
accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise their son
properly even though they had never been in trouble with the law.
	   After a quick, abbreviated trial, Bavaria's highest court last
month upheld the state's decision to deny Ari a new residency
permit because of a string of violent offenses, thus clearing the
way for a deportation.
	   Ari's lawsuit seeking to have his residency permit renewed is
still pending. That appeal has yet to have a full trial, but the
high court said Friday the case could continue even with Ari in
Turkey.

Five dead, 105 injured in Iran quake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Five people were killed and 105 injured in
Friday's earthquake in southwestern Iran, Iranian radio reported
Saturday.
	   Rescue officials said they did not expect the death toll to go
much higher.
	   The quake of magnitude 5.7 shook the Khonj-e Lar area of the
Fars province for 16 seconds at 4:33 p.m. local time Friday.
	   People were killed during landslides and when their homes
collapsed due to the tremor, said an official at Tehran's National
Disaster Headquarters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The landslides had initially prevented rescuers from reaching
the area by road.
	   More than 30 people were severely injured and required
hospitalization, said the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
quoting the hospital in the town of Khonj.
	   The greatest damage appeared to be in Beyghard, a village of
3,000 that is 22 kilometers (15 miles) east of Khonj, said the
agency. Seventy percent of the town was destroyed in the tremor and
its water and electricity supplies were severed.
	   More than 850 houses were damaged in Khonj, and schools were
closed Saturday, said the agency.
	   Relief teams in the area have distributed 200 tents, as well as
food and clothing, the agency said quoting the Red Crescent
Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross.
	   Iran is frequently hit by earthquakes. In May 1997 a temblor of
7.1 magnitude killed 1,500 people in the north. In June 1990 two
quakes of magnitudes 7.3 and 7.7 destroyed a northwestern town,
killing 50,000 people.

Anti-government protest breaks out in Kuala Lumpur

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More than 1,000 people rallied in
downtown Kuala Lumpur late Saturday, voicing their displeasure with
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   ``Mahathir is power-crazy,'' said one banner. Another read
``APEC, help us'' in reference to the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit being held in the Malaysian capital next week.
	   Several protesters pounded their fists on a stopped van, after
its driver got out and started complaining about the demonstration.
He jumped back in and drove off without being hurt.
	   There were no other reports of any disturbances in the rally,
which took place in the Kampong Baru section of the capital.
	   Many of the protesters were shouting ``reforms, reforms,'' while
others screamed, ``God is great.''
	   Cars driving by honked their horns and waved in approval, as the
demonstration remained predominantly peaceful, though noisy. There
was only a minimal police presence nearby.
	   The government has flooded Kuala Lumpur with 5,700 police and
security officers, to squelch any trouble during the APEC summit on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Saturday's rally was held after prayers at the Kampong Baru
mosque, where last month the country's first violent protest in
nearly three decades erupted between anti-government demonstrators
and police.
	   Mahathir, the host of next week's Pacific Rim summit, has said
he expected pro-Anwar rallies to break out in the coming days.
	   Anwar is on trial for abuse of power, sodomy and other sexual
misconduct allegations. He has firmly denied all the charges.
	   ``The laws of Malaysia have been sodomized,'' read one of the
banner's in Saturday night's protest.

Griqualand scores 83 at lunch in 4-day West Indies match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLY, South Africa _ Making the most of a benign pitch,
Griqualand West scored 83 for the loss of one wicket on Saturday,
the start of a four-day cricket match against the touring West
Indies.
	   After a trouble-plagued start to its South African tour, the
West Indies have this match and another four-day fixture against
Free State before the first test begins Nov. 26.
	   The only wicket to fall was that of Captain Mickey Arthur, who
was bowled around his legs by a slower delivery from Courtney Walsh
for 18.
	   Arthur won the toss and elected to bat.
	   The tourists' front line of Walsh, Franklyn Rose and Mervyn
Dillon got into double figures, but only Arthur's opening partner,
Martyn Gidley, elected to bat through to lunchtime.
	   Gidley, who had a stye in his right eye lanced on Friday, was
rewarded with an unbeaten 28 at the break, having struck four fours
off 69 balls.
	   Arthur's second-wicket partner, Piet Barnard, also collected
four boundaries in his 25 not out, but had the good fortune to be
dropped by Ridley Jacobs on 13.
	   A straightforward chance popped in and out of the keeper's
gloves in offspinner Carl Hooper's opening over.
	   West Indian paceman Curtly Ambrose, who had a toenail removed
Friday, is on the bench for this match, along with wicketkeeper
Junior Murray and legspinner Dinanath Ramnarine.
	   The West Indians team includes Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Nixon
McLean, Clayton Lambert, Stuart Williams, captain Brian Lara,
Darren Ganga, Ridley Jacobs and 12th man Nixon McLean.
	   The Griquas were forced to make one late change with paceman
Garth Roe dropping out due to a back injury. Their team includes
Loots Bosman, Willie Dry, Andre Botha, Findlay Brooker, Pat Symcox,
Wendell Bossenger, Deon Kruis, Adri Swanepoel and twelfth man Zahir
Abrahim.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh stands to break the
record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcom Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test
wickets.
	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's exhibition
against a Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play
after the team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute that was the
talk of the Caribbean.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.
	   The West Indies dominated during the 1980s and 1990s until
slumping several years ago. It lost to Australia in 1995 and
1996-1997, and this year was blanked by Pakistan 3-0, though the
team beat England 3-1.

Kafelnikov advances to final of Kremlin Cup after Rosset withdraws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to
the final of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on Saturday after
sixth-seeded Marc Rosset withdrew in the second set with a hip
injury.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, dominated through
the entire match, going ahead 6-1, 2-0 before Rosset retired.
	   A two-time Kremlin Cup winner, Rosset couldn't keep up with
Kafelnikov from the start. The only reminder of his powerful serve
was four straight aces in the sixth game _ the one time he would
hold serve.
	   After the set, a trainer came on to treat Rosset, who had
injured his left hip flexor and groin during practice in the
morning.
	   The second set was no better than the first, with Rosset, of
Switzerland, unable to make a single first serve in the first game.
Kafelnikov broke him and quickly wrapped up the second, after which
Rosset stepped down and apologizing briefly to the crowd.

Woman's head found in a plastic bag on airport road
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A woman's head has been found carelessly
wrapped in a plastic bag on a main road leading to the island's
international airport, the Gulf Daily News newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Passersby spotted the head sticking out of the bag on Friday and
immediately contacted the police, the English-language newspaper
reported.
	   The head, which had a traditional Asian-style nose ring, is
believed related to the discovery of severed body parts last month
by workers sorting out refuse in a landfill, the newspaper said,
quoting unidentified sources.
	   The woman's leg and two arms were found in a garbage bag at the
Askar landfill, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) southeast of the
capital Manama.
	   Police were to conduct an autopsy Saturday on the head, which
appeared to have been refrigerated for some time before being
abandoned, the newspaper added.

Minoza surges ahead in Taiheiyo Masters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEMBA, Japan (AP) _ Frankie Minoza of the Philippines shot a
5-under-par 67 on Saturday and took a one-stroke lead after three
rounds in the 150 million yen (dlrs 1.2 million) Sumitomo VISA
Taiheiyo Masters.
	   Minoza, eighth on this year's Japan Tour money list, put on a
clinical display with his irons as he sank seven birdies against
two bogeys for an 11-under 205 total at the par-72 Taiheiyo Club
Gotemba Course near Mount Fuji.
	   Englishman Lee Westwood, seeking his third straight victory of
the tournament, also fired a 67 for 206.
	   Another stroke back at 207 were Colombia's Eduardo Herrera, and
Japanese players Hajime Meshiai and Toru Taniguchi. Herrera shot a
68, Meshiai a 65 and Taniguchi a 66.
	   Halfway leader Nobuo Serizawa of Japan struggled to a 75 that
dropped him into a tie for seventh at 210.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara, the tournament's
leading drawcard, went around in 70 to trail by 10 strokes in a tie
for 30th.
	   ``A little disappointed this week,'' said O'Meara. ''But I'm
playing on the weekend and maybe tomorrow I can shoot a low
score.''
	   Minoza, winner of the Kirin Open in April for his fifth title in
Japan, compiled four birdies on the front nine but wasn't able to
clear the dogged Westwood.
	   The Philippine star knows Westwood's talent after playing with
him at the Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand in January. ``Lee's a
world class player and he's got a big heart,'' Minoza said.
``Mentally he's very focused and I want to be like that.''
	   Westwood began the day poorly with bogeys at the first two
holes, but roared back with eight birdies, along with just one more
dropped shot.
	   ``I missed the first two fairways and I probably deserved two
bogeys,'' said the 25-year-old Westwood.
	   ``I'm excited about any tournament where I'm in contention but
it's a bit early to be thinking about three in a row. I'm just
thinking about what I'm going to have for dinner,'' he said.
	   Westwood won four times on the European Tour this year and
finished third on the money list behind Colin Montgomerie and
Darren Clarke.

U.S. reopens consular section of embassy in Nairobi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy has resumed limited
consular services in the Kenyan capital more than three months
after a powerful bomb blast ripped through the embassy and
destroyed the consular section, a spokesman said Saturday.
	   Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said the temporary consular
section resumed operations Thursday in a Nairobi suburb and dozens
of applicants have already been seen.
	   He said that until the consular section can catch up on a
three-month backlog, it will be taking in student applicants only
since they are considered the most urgent.
	   Also, visa applicants are being served on a telephone
appointment-only basis, unlike the previous practice when
applicants had to wait in long lines at the building.
	   ``So far, the process seems to be working,'' Scharf said. ``We
saw dozens of applicants on Friday and some people got appointments
right away on Thursday.''
	   An embassy statement advised friends or relatives not to
accompany the applicant because they will not be allowed to enter
the building and discouraged applicants from bringing suitcases or
packages to the facility for security reasons.
	   Parking is also not permitted at the building as a security
precaution.
	   The Aug. 7 bomb was exploded outside the embassy building in the
heart of downtown Nairobi, killing 213 people, among them 12
Americans, including Consul General Julian Bartley and his son,
Jay. Several Kenyan consular employees also died.
	   Since then, no visa services have been provided from the
diplomatic mission that serves Kenya and eight other eastern
African nations.

British movie star wife of disgraced 1960s politician dies at 81
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS in lead that Profumo affair did not bring down the
government; adds background on film career, quote from Hobson
interview &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Valerie Hobson, a film star who stood by her
disgraced husband John Profumo following Britain's greatest sex and
security scandal of the 1960s, has died at the age of 81.
	   Hobson died suddenly in a London hospital Friday, according to
death notices published in The Daily Telegraph and The Times. Press
Association, the British news agency, reported Saturday that she
died of a heart attack.
	   Her best known film roles were opposite Alec Guinness in ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' and as Estella in David Lean's version of
``Great Expectations.''
	   Born in Larne, Northern Ireland, her stage career began in
storybook fashion at age 15 when she was lunching with her mother
at Claridge's Hotel. Oscar Hammerstein spotted her, inviting her to
audition for his new show, ``Bell at the Savoy.''
	   At 18, she won a contract with Universal studios. Her Hollywood
roles included the part of the bride in ``Bride of Frankenstein''
in 1935, when she also appeared in ``Rendezvous at Midnight,''
``The Mystery of Edwin Drood,'' ``Chinatown Squad,'' ``The Great
Impersonation'' and ``Oh What a Night.'' After ``Tugboat Princess''
in 1936, all her later work was in Britain.
	   She retired as an actress in 1953, a year after her divorce from
her first husband, Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan. She then married the
wealthy Profumo, a rising star in the Conservative Party, in 1954.
	   Profumo resigned as minister for war in 1963 after the exposure
of his affair with Christine Keeler _ who was conducting a
simultaneous affair with a Soviet military attache.
	   Profumo devoted the rest of his life to quietly rebuilding his
reputation through unpaid volunteer work _ with the devoted support
of his wife.
	   In a rare interview nine years ago, she said: ``Love is the most
important thing _ I have been very happy to have had it.
	   ``Providing a shoulder to lean on has been enough for me and as
long as my husband is all right I am happy. I have also had great
energy and been able to keep going in very difficult times.''
	   Miss Hobson is survived by Profumo, their son, two sons by her
first marriage and six grandchildren.
	   A private funeral was scheduled for Nov. 23.

South Korean president calls for high-tech cooperation with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and South Korea should cooperate in
high-tech industries that will boost development in both countries,
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said Saturday.
	   Economic exchanges between the two countries should not be
limited to trade, investment and manufacturing but instead expand
to other areas such as finance, environment, energy and technology,
Kim said in a speech to Korean and Chinese business people.
	   China can gain from South Korea's technology in construction,
communications networks and nuclear power, Kim said.
	   China plans to invest heavily in developing its roads,
railroads, communications and other infrastructure in the next
three years. Kim said both countries would ``reap enormous fruit''
if South Korea takes part in China's infrastructure development.
	   ``The room for China-Korea economic cooperation is limitless,
considering the potential of the two countries and the
complementary nature of their economies,'' Kim said.
	   The South Korean president began his visit to China on Thursday
in Beijing with a delegation of 250 people, including heads of
major South Korean conglomerates.
	   Kim and Chinese President Jiang Zemin signed an agreement in
Beijing to develop closer relations and expand trade and political
and cultural exchanges.
	   Kim will go to Malaysia on Sunday to attend the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation conference.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With statements by the American and Iraqi
presidents offering no hint a U.S. military strike can be avoided,
Iraq appealed to Arab nations on Saturday for help in case of an
attack. Iraqis took part in government-organized demonstrations
backing President Saddam Hussein. In Baghdad, fears were growing
that a military strike was imminent. Hundreds of motorists lined up
for gas and prices of some foodstuffs rose. No information was
available in Baghdad about military preparedness. But the
opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a statement faxed to
Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved on highways and to oil
fields in the north near Kirkuk. A second dissident group, the
London-based Iraqi Broadcasting Corp., said brigades of the elite
Republican Guards had been dispersed around Baghdad and in
provinces further north. It said several intelligence and security
departments, such as military intelligence and the Special Security
Organization, had been ordered to move to the outskirts of the
capital. (IRAQ)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deadly clashes between Indonesian
students and security forces gave way to widespread rioting in the
capital Saturday as rock-throwing mobs burned cars, looted shops
and ransacked police stations. Outnumbered riot officers fired
warning shots and tear gas. Thousands of students attended funerals
of slain protesters and later assembled peacefully outside
Parliament to demand democratic reform. Palls of black smoke
towered over a shopping area near one luxury hotel only a few
hundreds meters (yards) from the heavily guarded state palace.
There, President B.J. Habibie called for calm before an emergency
meeting with military chief Gen. Wiranto, the defense minister and
other Cabinet members. Earlier, Habibie ordered the military to
take immediate action to restore order. (INDONESIA)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday to discuss Asia's financial
crisis, hundreds of people demonstrated against the Malaysian
government. Defying the 5,700 police and security officers
stationed in the capital, more than 500 people rallied downtown to
criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Shouting slogans and
carrying banners saying ``Mahathir is power crazy,'' the protesters
criticized his treatment of Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime
minister who was fired two months ago, then jailed after launching
a nationwide reform movement. No violence was reported, and the
protest didn't immediately spread. (APEC)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Weary delegates concluded their
global warming summit early Saturday by setting out a plan of
action to begin finding ways to scale back heat-trapping
pollutants. After an all-night struggle, delegates to the U.N.
climate summit from 160 nations united in a pre-dawn session behind
a ``Buenos Aires plan of action'' that maps out strategies for
carrying out the 1997 Kyoto pact designed to alleviate global
warming. Saturday's agreement sets out a timetable for discussing
by 2000 the many issues that still need to be settled, including:
whether to assess penalties against those who don't achieve their
goals; how to transfer climate-friendly technology to developing
countries so they pollute less; and the nuts and bolts of how to
measure the pollutants. (GLOBAL WARMING)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As he prepares to face hostile questioning in
the House impeachment inquiry, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is
coming up with a few unpleasant surprises for President Bill
Clinton. Starr obtained an indictment accusing presidential friend
Webster Hubbell of committing 15 felonies in order to conceal his
and Hillary Rodham Clinton's work on failed Arkansas land deals
that benefited Hubbell's father-in-law, businessman Seth Ward.
Starr also turned over new evidence for House investigators to
decide whether they should expand the impeachment inquiry to
include allegations against Clinton by former White House volunteer
Kathleen Willey. Democrats were furious at Friday's developments.
As the first witness in the impeachment inquiry, Starr will undergo
questioning Thursday from committee Democrats about his aggressive
pursuit of the Monica Lewinsky investigation in January before
getting formal approval from the Justice Department.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to
the final of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on Saturday after
sixth-seeded Marc Rosset withdrew in the second set with a hip
injury.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, dominated through
the entire match, going ahead 6-1, 2-0 before Rosset retired.
	   A two-time Kremlin Cup winner, Rosset couldn't keep up with
Kafelnikov from the start. The only reminder of his powerful serve
was four straight aces in the sixth game _ the one time he would
hold serve.
	   After the set, a trainer came on to treat Rosset, who had
injured his left hip flexor and groin during practice in the
morning.
	   The second set was no better than the first, with Rosset, of
Switzerland, unable to make a single first serve in the first game.
Kafelnikov broke him and quickly wrapped up the second, after which
Rosset stepped down and apologizing briefly to the crowd.

Five dead, 105 injured in Iran quake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An earthquake in southwestern Iran killed
five people and injured 105, Iranian radio reported Saturday.
	   Rescue officials said they did not expect the death toll to go
much higher.
	   The magnitude 5.7 quake shook the Khonj-e Lar area of the Fars
province Friday.
	   People were killed during landslides and when their homes
collapsed, said an official at Tehran's National Disaster
Headquarters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The landslides initially prevented rescuers from reaching the
area by road.
	   More than 30 people were severely injured and required
hospitalization, said the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
quoting the hospital in the town of Khonj.
	   The greatest damage appeared to be in Beyghard, a village of
3,000 that is 22 kilometers (15 miles) east of Khonj, said the
agency. Seventy percent of the town was destroyed and its water and
electricity supplies were severed.
	   More than 850 houses were damaged in Khonj, and schools were
closed Saturday, said the agency.
	   Relief teams distributed 200 tents, as well as food and
clothing, the agency said, quoting the Red Crescent Society, the
Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross.
	   Iran is frequently hit by earthquakes. In May 1997 a temblor of
7.1 magnitude killed 1,500 people in the north. In June 1990 two
quakes of magnitudes 7.3 and 7.7 destroyed a northwestern town,
killing 50,000 people.

Rioting follows deadly student protests in Indonesian capital

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deadly clashes between students and
security forces gave way to widespread rioting in the capital
Saturday as rock-throwing mobs burned cars, looted shops and
ransacked police stations.
	   While outnumbered riot officers fired warning shots and tear gas
at rampaging crowds, thousands of anti-government students attended
funerals of slain protesters. Later an estimated 30,000 peacefully
assembled outside of Parliament to demand democratic reform.
	   Military helicopters swooped above the chaos. Palls of black
smoke towered over a shopping area near one luxury hotel only a few
hundreds meters (yards) from the heavily guarded state palace.
	   There, President B.J. Habibie called for calm before an
emergency meeting with military chief Gen. Wiranto, the defense
minister and other Cabinet members.
	   Earlier Habibie called on the military to take immediate action
to restore order.
	   As night fell, rioting still raged in some areas although other
troublespots were brought under control, mostly by squads of
marines. Firetrucks were working to put out flames.
	   Habibie accused troublemakers of trying to ``overthrow'' his
6-month-old government and ``endanger the unity of the nation and
the people.''
	   Opposition leaders and student activists called on Habibie and
Wiranto to quit.
	   ``Habibie must step down now. We have had enough of this
government,'' said one man, who identified himself by the single
name of Irwan, at the scene of one fire.
	   Pro-democracy activists said Wiranto must resign immediately so
order can be restored within military ranks and the streets.
	   ``His policies have imperiled the nation's future,'' they said
in a statement.
	   Local media reports and diplomats say at least 14 people, most
of them students, have died this week in the worst violence in
Jakarta since riots and protests ousted former President Suharto in
May after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Most died from plastic bullet wounds in a series of deadly
assaults on Friday night. Police chiefs denied their officers or
troops fired live ammunition at the students when they tried to
march on Parliament.
	   Three security personnel were among the dead.
	   The protests broke out this week against a government assembly
that students claimed was not serious about democratic change.
	   The looting and burning on Saturday was reminiscent of the May
riots, which were fueled by discontent over Indonesia's economic
crisis. They also were triggered by the shooting of students by the
military.
	   Buildings were burning in several areas on Saturday, including
Jakarta's Chinatown, badly hit by rioting last May, when 1,200
people were killed.
	   The Chinese minority, who are prominent in business, are often
targeted during times of civil unrest in Indonesia.
	   As in the tumultuous days before Suharto quit, police and
soldiers were initially helpless or absent in the face of the
rioting. This changed with the arrival of reinforcements of
marines, who unlike other services of the military are respected by
many ordinary Indonesians as fair and disciplined.
	   Suharto weighed in Saturday, saying the government should
apologize for the students' deaths and listen to protesters'
demands, according to the official Antara news agency.
	   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed. Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?'' Suharto was quoted as saying by
his half-brother, Probosutedjo, in the Antara report.
	   The violence on Saturday started when neighborhood youths set
military tents afire in the street near Parliament and burned
several vehicles, including an army truck, next to the University
of Indonesia.
	   In another area, mobs stoned a shopping center as crowds cheered
and police and soldiers stood by. In northern Jakarta, armored
personnel carriers parked amid a crowd of rioters who smashed car
showroom windows and set shops on fire. But soldiers did nothing.
	   Mobs threw rocks at buses parked outside the foreign ministry.
	   Earlier about 5,000 students gathered at a cemetery for the
funeral of Sigit Prasetyo, a 20-year-old student who was shot dead
Friday. They watched as his casket, draped in a red and white
Indonesian flag and a traditional Islamic funeral cloth, was
lowered in damp red earth.
	   On Saturday morning a policeman accidentally shot and wounded a
marine in the leg.
	   At one riot later, a mob beat one policeman to death and police
accidentally shot and wounded another marine.
	   Critics say the nation's highest legislative body stopped short
of promised democratic change, even though it backed a plan by
Habibie to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed
to name Suharto in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Members of the People's Consultative Assembly, filled with
holdovers from the Suharto era, say the decree will bolster an
ongoing investigation of the wealth of the 77-year-old former
president.
	   Students reject the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto. The assembly also did not heed their demand that
the military be banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military directly appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met here Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis,
hundreds of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital
against the Malaysian government.
	   Defying the 5,700 police and security officers stationed in
Kuala Lumpur, more than 1,000 people rallied downtown to criticize
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Shouting slogans and carrying banners saying ``Mahathir is power
crazy,'' the protesters criticized his treatment of Anwar Ibrahim,
the deputy prime minister who was fired two months ago, then jailed
after launching a nationwide reform movement.
	   No violence was reported, and the protest didn't immediately
spread from the neighborhood where it began.
	   Mahathir is determined to prevent Anwar's struggle from becoming
a focus of this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
But as officials from the many foreign governments met over the
weekend to prepare for it, several officials went out of their way
to sympathize with Anwar.
	   Two top Canadian officials met on Saturday with his wife, Azizah
Ismail, who has become the de facto leader of his pro-reform
movement since he was jailed and put on trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and its international
trade minister, Sergio Marchi, invited Azizah to lunch between
their meetings with other APEC officials.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy said after the luncheon.
	   He said the meeting with Azizah took place at the request of
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Afterward, Axworthy said, he
told Malaysia's foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, that
Canada is concerned about the treatment of Anwar.
	   Anwar, also ousted as finance minister, has claimed that he was
beaten by police before his trial started. And pictures of him
walking into his trial with a black eye have been seen in
newspapers and television broadcasts around the world.
	   Some APEC leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have
said they won't meet privately with Mahathir during the summit
because of what has happened in Malaysia.
	   Chretien, the host of last year's APEC summit, said in Singapore
on Saturday that he would discuss Anwar's treatment directly with
Mahathir during his visit to Malaysia.
	   Azizah also plans to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who was to arrive in Malaysia on Saturday night and to
participate in the meetings before the APEC summit.
	   The Malaysian government said that Albright should not meddle in
Malaysia's internal affairs by meeting with Azizah.
	   Abdullah said that Albright ``will be here as a guest and she
should know what to do.'' Speaking to Malaysia's government news
agency, he also said: ``Foreign officials and leaders attending the
APEC meetings should not interfere in Malaysia's affairs.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was to arrive in
Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah, too.
	   In the meantime, APEC Cabinet ministers met Saturday to discuss
a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade, but
Japan and the United States remained deeply divided over a key
provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and
fish _ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   A Japanese news agency, which obtained a draft of the APEC
group's final statement, reported that it urges APEC to deal
urgently with the global crisis and to closely examine the
operations of the world's secretive and risky hedge funds.
	   Investments by the funds have been blamed for the some of the
wild fluctuations in Asia's currency and stock markets.
	   In the meantime, Mahathir said in an interview with a government
news agency that he will take his biggest pet complaint to APEC
leaders: currency speculators. Mahathir has made it clear that
international controls on foreign currency trading will be on the
agenda of the APEC summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' Mahathir said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Three soldiers detained for killing of civilians in Burundi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Three Burundian soldiers, one an
officer, have been detained in the slaying of civilians during a
hunt for rebels, the government said Saturday.
	   A written statement said investigators were questioning the
three men about the killings on the night of Nov. 3-4 in Mutambu
commune, 35 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the capital.
	   Earlier this week, the army apologized for the massacre and
announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry.
	   Saturday's statement said the official death toll was now 56.
	   But survivors said the minority Tutsi-led army killed more than
100 mostly Hutu civilians in retaliation for a Hutu rebel attack on
a nearby camp for Tutsis.
	   They said rebels attacked the Tutsi camp at Maramvya the night
of Oct. 30-31, killing five people. Four nights later, the army
killed Hutu villagers in nearby Rutovu, accusing them of
cooperating with the rebels, witnesses said.
	   The killings were the deadliest since a third round of peace
talks on ending ethnic and politic conflict in Burundi concluded in
October.
	   Hutu rebels are trying to topple the government of President
Pierre Buyoya, a retired Tutsi officer who took control of Burundi
in a bloodless coup in 1996. Buyoya's promise to stem the bloodshed
has proven fruitless to date.
	   The Tutsis, who make up 14 percent of the population of 6
million, control the military. Hutus account for 84 percent of the
population.
	   Ethnic violence in Burundi has left more than 200,000 people
dead since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's
first democratically elected president, Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.
	   In a statement released Friday, spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was shocked by the killings
and urged the culprits be punished.
	   ``It is imperative that all violence and attacks directed at
civilians come immediately to an end and that all parties involved
in the Burundi conflict ensure the full respect of international
humanitarian law and humanitarian principles,'' he said.
	   In Bujumbura, National Assembly president Leonce Ngendakumana
also called for justice.
	   He said government forces were killing civilians in other
communes of Rural Bujumbura as well.
	   ``It is incredible that some soldiers of the army who must
protect civilians can do such criminal activities,'' Ngendakumana
said Friday.

Germany deports Turkish juvenile delinquent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with quotes, plans for teen-ager on arrival in
Turkey &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian state officials on Saturday
deported a 14-year-old Turkish juvenile delinquent born and raised
in Germany, after months of controversy and legal wrangling over
whether the state should help the troubled boy instead of sending
him away.
	   Muhlis Ari, known in the German media as ``Mehmet'' left on a
12:01 p.m. (1101 GMT) Lufthansa flight for Istanbul, Turkey,
accompanied on the plane by three federal police officials and his
16-year-old girlfriend.
	   Ari's lawyer was at the airport to say good-bye to the Turkish
teen-ager, who has a long history of fights, vandalism and petty
thefts. Lawyer Alexander Eberth said the boy's parents were too
upset to be there. ``They are completely undone,'' he said.
	   Once Ari arrives in Istanbul, German diplomats there will
arrange for him to meet his Turkish relatives, with whom he is
expected to live. His girlfriend will return to Germany.
	   The ``Mehmet'' case made headlines this summer when officials in
deeply conservative Bavaria sought to deport not only the boy, but
also his parents, who have lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
The case then became an election-year issue, with liberals accusing
the ruling conservatives of using a family tragedy to show they
were cracking down on ``criminal foreigners.''
	   Courts have blocked the deportation of the parents, who were
accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise their son
properly even though they had never been in trouble with the law.
	   After a swift, abbreviated trial, Bavaria's highest court last
month upheld the state's decision to deny Ari a new residency
permit because of a string of violent offenses, thus clearing the
way for a deportation.
	   Ari's lawyer had tried block the deportation arguing the boy's
rights were being violated, but Germany's highest court rejected
the appeal Friday.
	   ``The judges' decision ... may be legally correct, but it is
regrettable as far as promoting a policy of integration'' of
foreigners,'' said Cem Ozdemir, domestic policy spokesman for the
environmentalist Greens party.
	   A lawsuit seeking to have Ari's residency permit renewed is
still pending. That appeal has yet to have a full trial, but the
high court said Friday the case could continue even with Ari in
Turkey.

APEC officials sweat over tuna, halibut and salmon

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ It could have been a mouthwatering
discussion _ about tuna, halibut and salmon.
	   But fish are giving officials at the 10th meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum a serious bellyache, said
Malaysia's International Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz Saturday.
	   ``This is not so simple as, `I offer you fish, I offer you
forests.' It is very complicated,'' she said.
	   Fisheries is one of the two issues threatening to deadlock trade
talks between 21 nations. The other is forest products.
	   The United States and Japan have refused to budge from their
positions on fisheries and forests. Washington wants Japan to open
its market, while Tokyo refuses, saying it would hurt Japanese
fishermen and timber traders.
	   Waving a huge sheaf of papers filled with figures, Rafidah said
officials had been poring over tariffs of various kinds of fish so
that countries could reach an agreement on opening their markets.
	   ``I want you to be aware of the magnitude,'' she told reporters
after she had said how tariffs for fish differed in each country
based on whether the fish was dead or alive, salted in brine or
dried -- and whether its liver and entrails had been taken out.
	   Tariffs on fish also varied on whether they were meant to be
eaten by humans or pets, said Rafidah. Duties were different if the
fish was chilled or sliced into fillets.
	   For more that five minutes, Rafidah read out the different
categories of fish from one page. Then she said: ``God knows what
they mean -- but they are all trout.''
	   She said salmon and halibut varied on the customs duties they
attracted depending on whether these had been swept up in nets in
the Pacific or the Atlantic oceans.
	   ``My God, what is this, they are in all kinds of conditions --
live, dead, salted and chilled,'' she said, looking surprised as
she read some of the tariffs variations.
	   Rafidah's comments came after ministers from the APEC nations
failed to break the impasse on tariff reductions Saturday. They
instead moved to more routine discussions, leaving fish and forest
products for Cabinet ministers to take up later.
	   Trade ministers and officials are meeting in Kuala Lumpur ahead
of the summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.

Sammy Sosa apologizes over Giuliani bat flap

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa on Saturday said
he's sorry about a controversy over a bat he presented to New York
City Mayor Rudolf Giuliani, and characterized the flap as a
``misunderstanding.''
	   Sosa gave Giuliani a bat last month inscribed ``Home-Run No.
66,'' but the Baseball Hall of Fame said that Sosa's historic bat
had already been enshrined at the baseball museum in Cooperstown,
New York, at the time he made the gift.
	   According to Giuliani, Sosa told him the bat was the one he used
to hit his famous homer, but the Hall of Fame produced videotapes
showing the real home run bat and the one given to the mayor were
of different makes.
	   On Saturday, Sosa told reporters in Tokyo that he'd sent apology
letters to Giuliani and the Hall of Fame acknowledging there had
been a mistake.
	   ``The bat belongs in Cooperstown so I couldn't have given it to
the mayor,'' Sosa said. ``I really wanted to give Giuliani the bat,
but there's a difference between my personal feelings and the
regulations.''
	   Sosa, who is on a goodwill tour of Japan with Major League
all-stars, said he had promised Giuliani the bat beforehand and
``that's probably how the misunderstanding arose.''
	   ``It's become a bit of a scandal,'' he said.
	   Sosa did not comment on whether or not he knew the bat he gave
Giuliani wasn't the one he used to whack his 66th homer, but said
he'd learned only afterward that the bat had already gone to the
Hall of Fame.
	   Hall of Fame spokesman John Ralph has said he knew that
Cooperstown had the bat from the beginning, because Sosa had handed
it to him personally after the game against Houston in which he hit
the home run.
	   Sosa gave Giuliani the controversial bat when he visited New
York for a parade in his honor. Sosa broke Roger Maris'
single-season record of 61 home runs along with Mark McGwire, who
finished the season with a record 70 homers.

Kafelnikov advances to final of Kremlin Cup after Rosset withdraws

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to
the final of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on Saturday after
sixth-seeded Marc Rosset withdrew in the second set with a hip
injury.
	   And Goran Ivanisevic, seeded third, ousted surprise contender
Arnaud Clement, 7-5, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, dominated through
his match, going ahead 6-1, 2-0 before Rosset retired.
	   A two-time Kremlin Cup winner, Rosset couldn't keep up with
Kafelnikov from the start. The only reminder of his powerful serve
was four straight aces in the sixth game _ the one time he would
hold.
	   After the first set, a trainer came on to treat Rosset, who had
injured his left hip flexor and groin during practice in the
morning.
	   The second set was no better than the first, with Rosset, of
Switzerland, unable to make a single first serve in the first game.
Kafelnikov broke him and quickly wrapped up the second, after which
Rosset stepped down and apologizing briefly to the crowd.
	   The other match saw more of a battle in the first set. The two
managed to hold on until Ivanisevic, not serving well, broke in the
twelfth.
	   But Clement eventually tired out in the second set. Unable to
keep up with Ivanisevic in a number of long rallies, he lost serve
in the second and eighth games. The final game went to deuce, and
Clement lost match point at deuce on an unforced error.
	   The Russian Kafelnikov and Ivanisevic will meet Sunday. They
faced each other in the Kremlin Cup final in 1996, a match
Ivanisevic won.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A top Serbian politician
left Bosnia Saturday on orders from NATO peacekeepers who told him
he was not welcome.
	   Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj, a radical nationalist
who espouses a harder line in the Serb conflict against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, was told to leave late Friday by NATO troops.
They were empowered to expel Seselj by the Office of the High
Representative, the top foreign authority in Bosnia overseeing the
country's postwar development.
	   Seselj was attending an inauguration party for Nikola Poplasen,
the new premier of the Bosnian Serb substate. Poplasen is also a
radical nationalist, allied to the camp of Radovan Karadzic, the
suspected war criminal and wartime Bosnian Serb leader.
	   After arguing with dozens of NATO soldiers in armored vehicles,
Seselj, a former paramilitary leader in Croatia and Bosnia, left
the hotel where the inauguration reception was being held and
returned to neighboring Serbia early Saturday.
	   There was no violence. Seselj condemned ``American occupation''
saying it was aimed at destroying the Bosnian Serb republic. He
left with a Bosnian Serb police escort.
	   Maj. Sheena Thomson, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led peace force,
said Seselj ``had his last word to say before the departure, but
went without screaming and kicking.''
	   The expulsion order was signed by Jacques Klein, the American
deputy head of the Office of the High Representative.
	   ``Seselj's activities and statements both during the war and
recently offer clear evidence that his presence in Bosnia would
constitute an activity detrimental to the implementation'' of
peace, said the order.
	   In September presidential elections Poplasen won over a moderate
Bosnian Serb who was supported by world powers involved in Bosnia.
	   Seselj was banned from Bosnia during the election campaigns. But
he and Poplasen have vowed to keep close ties nevertheless.

Nuns forced to shut convent in north Indian village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ A Christian missionary school was shut
down after village rowdies stormed the building, beat up children
and threatened two nuns, Indian police said Saturday amid
complaints of increasing attacks on the minority community.
	   ``The nuns have decided to leave the village. They do not want
any police action,'' said Arun Kumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police
of Jhajjar, a town close to the Kheri Kumhar village in Haryana
state where the alleged attack took place.
	   The nuns were offered protection by police guards after they
complained a group of men scaled the walls of the Franciscan
Clarist Institute Nov. 10, terrorized the children and tore up
their books.
	   Then they ordered the nuns to leave the village accusing them of
converting Hindus to Christianity, said the nuns, identified only
by their first names of Daisy and Litsy.
	   India's 21 million Christians, mostly Catholics, form a tiny
minority in India where more than 80 percent of the nearly 1
billion people are Hindu.
	   Christian missionaries _ including Mother Teresa's Missionaries
of Charity _ are often accused by radical Hindu groups of
converting Indians under the pretense of voluntary service.
	   Christian community leaders have in recent months alleged that
attacks on their community have registered an alarming increase
since a Hindu nationalist-led government took charge in New Delhi
this year.
	   The Rev. Alan de Lastic, Archbishop of Delhi, visited Kheri
Kumhar a day after the alleged incident, and the National
Commission for Minorities ordered police to protect the nuns, Kumar
said.
	   The nuns have found widespread support among the women of the
village but face strong opposition from women, he said.

Portuguese pig farmers stage piglet protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese pig farmers have found a new
weapon in their fight against the government's farm policy: piglets
at dawn.
	   Farmers released dozens of piglets outside the Agriculture
Ministry in downtown Lisbon at 6 a.m. Saturday, news reports said.
	   The animals scattered across the large Praca do Comercio square
and were chased by police and firemen called in to help with the
roundup, the national news agency Lusa reported.
	   The farmers want tighter restrictions on pork imports and
increased government aid.
	   Last week, they briefly halted rush-hour traffic in the capital.

Saddam reported ready to renew dealings with arms inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; CLARIFIES in 6th graf the promise
would be Annan's personal pledge; TRIMS.
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's government is expected to respond
positively to pleas from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
resume dealings with United Nations arms inspectors, a senior Iraqi
official said Saturday.
	   Such a step could defuse the crisis over arms inspections that
has led to threatened American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of
U.S. military forces in the Gulf.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
reporters he ``had information'' that the Iraqi leadership would
reply favorably to a letter sent by Annan to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Friday that Annan
was sending such a letter to Saddam.
	   He said he didn't know the contents, but Western diplomats said
it would repeat Annan's urgent appeal to Saddam on Wednesday to
resume cooperation with the inspectors immediately.
	   The Iraqi official, from the Culture and Information Ministry,
also did not reveal the letter's contents. But it was understood to
contain a personal pledge by Annan to work for the lifting of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq if the weapons inspectors were allowed to go back
to work.
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the country's economy.
	   Such a promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out of the current crisis as
an American attack on the country is appearing more and more
likely.
	   The official spoke after statements Friday by Saddam and U.S.
President Bill Clinton appeared to offer no hint of a solution that
would avert a threatened military strike.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event an attack was launched, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   The statement from the Iraqi official followed Saddam's
statement Friday that made clear that nothing less than a pledge to
lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with his
decisions in August and last month to block the searches by U.N.
inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   In the Iraqi capital, fears were growing that a military strike
was imminent. Motorists jammed their cars by the hundreds into
gasoline stations, forming long lines to fill up their tanks.
Shoppers found some prices rising in crowded markets.
	   On Saturday, the editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers
pleaded with the Arab world to back Iraq.
	   Al-Qadissiya pointed out that Iraq in the past sent troops to
aid Arab countries fighting Israel and urged them to reciprocate.
	   Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense
of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples
have to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its
confrontation against American threats.''
	   Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's uneasy Gulf neighbors _
have called for a diplomatic solution to the latest crisis. But
they also have insisted that Iraq resume cooperation with U.N.
inspectors or risk the consequences.
	   At Friday prayers in the nation's mosques, preachers issued
similar pleas to Arabs and Muslims.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   On the streets Saturday, several hundred Iraqi workers marched
from from downtown Tahrir Square to the headquarters of the U.N.
Development Program on the River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is
staying forever.''
	   At the Baath Party demonstration at the National Theater,
hundreds of loyalists broke into applause whenever speakers
mentioned Saddam's name.
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles _
part of the government program to defend the capital _ paraded at
the National Stadium.
	   Shoppers, meanwhile, expressed little fear of a U.S. attack,
reflecting government efforts to forge a united front against the
U.N. sanctions, imposed eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait,
leading to the Persian Gulf War.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, shopping for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her four
children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party and other
opposition groups abroad said Iraq had moved troops north to
protect oil installations and moved intelligence and security
officials out of their Baghdad headquarters.

Only court can grant Utah man permission to leave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - The attorney of a U.S. couple
faced with cruelty charges said on Saturday that although free on
bail, one of the pair is legally bound to stay in the Czech
republic.
	   Glenda Roach and her husband Steven, both of St. George, Utah,
were charged earlier this week with cruelty to people in their
custody and with curtailing the freedom of movement to students at
a private American school.
	   If convicted, the Roaches face up to eight years in jail.
	   The Morava Academy, located in Brno, 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southeast of Prague, is a boarding school for American teenagers
with academic and social problems.
	   On Friday, Glenda Roach, the principal of the school, told a
Utah radio station that she recently had back surgery and has been
allowed to leave the country.
	   But she said attorneys and officials at the U.S. embassy have
been unable to secure the same privilege for her husband Steven,
free on dlrs 6,000 bail.
	   Robert Bezdek, the attorney of the two Americans, said such
permission can only be granted by the prosecutor's office.
	   ``They're the ones who decide whether he can leave or not,''
Bezdek told The Associated Press. ``Of course they may consider the
reasons why (he wants to leave). But, for example, he would have to
promise he would dwell at a certain address in Utah.''
	   Bezdek said any unsanctioned attempts by Roach to leave the
country might be considered by the court as avoiding prosecution.
	   ``He has been released on bail and, as such, he had to promise
certain things, i.e. that he would fully cooperate with the
investigators and would be reachable in the country.''
	   Some students of the academy complained they were isolated, tied
up and not allowed to go to the toilet.
	   Karr Farnsworth, head of a company that represents Morava
Academy and several other teen programs around the world, has
called the charges absurd. He says they stem from disgruntled
ex-employees, who incited the students into complaining against the
staff.

Angry Kurds demonstrate to protest Italy's arrest of Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of angry Kurds demonstrated Saturday in
Rome, where Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of a 14-year-old Kurdish
insurgency, is under arrest and facing an extradition request by
Turkey.
	   ``He's a notorious assassin, the worst terrorist of our
century,'' Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, said in an
interview with Associated Press Television News on Saturday.
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday after stepping off a plane from
Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his
hideout in Syria.
	   The ANSA news agency, citing unofficial sources, said Ocalan had
also asked for political asylum in Italy. The Interior Ministry had
no comment on the report.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   Hundreds of Kurds demonstrated Saturday outside the prison in
Rome where Ocalan had been held. Scuffles broke out and at least
two Turkish journalists said they'd been beaten by PKK militants.
	   ``Italian police just looked on,'' said Abdurrahaman Keskin, a
Turkish state television reporter who appeared on the air with a
bloodied face.
	   The National Front for the Liberation of Kurdistan, an umbrella
group seen as the political wing of the PKK, said Kurds from
throughout Europe planned to converge on Rome to protest Ocalan's
arrest.
	   Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival at
Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome on a flight from Moscow because
of an outstanding Turkish warrant. He was carrying a false
passport.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the death
penalty.
	   Although there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984,
Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if there was
even a risk of capital punishment.
	   Batu, the Turkish ambassador, said Saturday that Turkey was
considering either abolishing its death penalty or assuring Italy
it would not be imposed on Ocalan in order to win his extradition.
	   The ambassador said Ocalan would undergo initial questioning by
an Italian magistrate on Tuesday.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   Leftist politicians in Italy are sympathetic to the PKK and the
leader of the Italian Communists, Armando Cossutta on Saturday
called on Italy to grant Ocalan asylum.
	   ``Ocalan is a courageous combatant who has always fought for his
people: 25 million women and men who do not have their own country,
a people fiercely repressed by national authorities,'' Cossutta
told the ANSA news agency.
	   Ocalan, a political science dropout from Ankara university,
founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group
toward armed struggle in 1984, finding fertile ground among poor
Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to
the final of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on Saturday after
sixth-seeded Marc Rosset withdrew in the second set with a hip
injury.
	   And Goran Ivanisevic, seeded third, ousted surprise contender
Arnaud Clement, 7-5, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, dominated through
his match, going ahead 6-1, 2-0 before Rosset retired.
	   A two-time Kremlin Cup winner, Rosset couldn't keep up with
Kafelnikov from the start. The only reminder of his powerful serve
was four straight aces in the sixth game _ the one time he would
hold.
	   After the first set, a trainer came on to treat Rosset, who had
injured his left hip flexor and groin during practice in the
morning.
	   The second set was no better than the first, with Rosset, of
Switzerland, unable to make a single first serve in the first game.
Kafelnikov broke him and quickly wrapped up the second, after which
Rosset stepped down and apologizing briefly to the crowd.
	   The other match saw more of a battle in the first set. The two
managed to hold on until Ivanisevic, not serving well, broke in the
twelfth.
	   But Clement eventually tired out in the second set. Unable to
keep up with Ivanisevic in a number of long rallies, he lost serve
in the second and eighth games. The final game went to deuce, and
Clement lost match point at deuce on an unforced error.
	   The Russian Kafelnikov and Ivanisevic will meet Sunday. They
faced each other in the Kremlin Cup final in 1996, a match
Ivanisevic won.

Hattori stays on top in Itoen Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHONAN, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori fired a 6-under-par 66
Saturday and extended her lead to three strokes going into the
final round of the 60 million yen (dlrs 491,800) Itoen Ladies.
	   Hattori, seeking her fifth title this season, scored seven
birdies, including three straight from the second hole, against her
only bogey so far in the tournament en route to a 13-under 131
total at the par-72 Great Island Club course.
	   She was a two-stroke leader overnight.
	   South Korean Ku Ok-hee shot her career best 9-under 63 in a
bogey-free trek over the 6,364-yard (5,791-meter), par-72 Great
Island Club course.
	   A 63 also matched the Japan LPGA Tour's single-round record on a
par-72 course, set in 1996 by Akiko Fukushima.
	   With a 36-hole total of 10-under 134 total, Ku vaulted from a
tie for 15th to second place.
	   ``I hit the ball well and putted super today,'' said Ku, in
contention for her second victory this year and 15th overall on the
Japan Tour. ``I had an 8-under on several occasions on the U.S.
Tour and also in Japan. I felt great to shoot a 9-under.''
	   Fukushima, the Japan Tour's top money winner in the last two
years, shot a 68 to share third at 138 with Kaori Higo and Fumiko
Muraguchi.

China pledges to keep yuan stable, lower tariffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ China's top trade official
reassured Pacific Rim nations Saturday that his nation is committed
to keeping its currency stable and to lowering its tariffs, even
though Asia's financial crisis has made it difficult to keep those
promises.
	   Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said China will not devalue its currency, the yuan,
``in order to maintain the region's stability and development.''
	   ``We are making tremendous sacrifice,'' he said in a speech to
trade and foreign ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   The devaluation of regional currencies has weakened China's
competitiveness because it sells many of the same products as
Southeast Asian countries.
	   A yuan devaluation could lead to another damaging round of
currency devaluation in the region.
	   Chinese officials have said its export growth rate this year
will probably be 4 percent to 5 percent, compared with an earlier
estimate of 10 percent.
	   It has agreed to accept tariff reductions in nine product
categories under a proposed APEC trade liberalization package.
	   The package remained blocked on Saturday because of Japan's
refusal to cut tariffs on two politically sensitive sectors,
forestries and fisheries.
	   After a Sino-Japanese meeting Saturday evening, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan refused to say whether China would support
Japan's position.
	   ``Japan and China are two separate sovereign nations. They have
the right to self-determination. We also have the right to
self-determination,'' he said.
	   However, according to a Japanese trade official, Tang told his
Japanese counterpart, Kaoru Komura, that China ``understood Japan's
position better than any other country.''
	   At a news conference, Taiwanese officials also said they wanted
to see more flexibility on opening up trade in fisheries and
forestry products.

Yeltsin fires military adviser
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With no warning or explanation, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin fired a deputy prime minister who was one of the
country's top military advisers on Saturday, a news report said.
	   Yeltsin, at his country home outside Moscow, dismissed Col. Gen.
Valery Mironov from his position as deputy prime minister and chief
military expert for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   Yeltsin also discharged Mironov from the military entirely,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The report gave no other information about the president's move.
	   Yeltsin has been prone to making sudden hirings and firings in
the past. He dismissed his entire government both in in March as
well as in August, and rarely gives more than a cursory explanation
for his moves.
	   Earlier in the day, Yeltsin appointed Primakov to head the
Russia-U.S. economic and technological cooperation commission, a
post that had still been held by the last prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko, who lost his job in the August reshuffle.
	   Yeltsin has stayed out of sight recently, and abruptly canceled
a dinner Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who
was in Moscow on an official visit.
	   He emerged briefly for a meeting with Obuchi earlier Thursday.
	   Before that, he had spent a week on vacation at the Black Sea
resort of Sochi to recover from what aides described as fatigue and
high blood pressure. The ailments, coming on top of the infection,
have led to renewed speculations about his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has endured an array of health problems, including
open heart surgery two years ago. Still, he and his doctors insist
he is capable of serving out his term, which expires in mid-2000.
	   The Russian leader plans to meet with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder later this month.

Saddam reported ready to renew dealings with arms inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, CLARIFIES that promise would be Annan's personal
pledge, ADDS that announcement could come in several hours. Trims.
No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's government is expected to respond
positively to pleas from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, a senior Iraqi
official said Saturday.
	   Such a step could defuse the crisis over arms inspections that
has led to threatened American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of
U.S. military forces in the Gulf.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
reporters he ``had information'' that the Iraqi leadership would
reply favorably to a letter Annan sent to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Friday that Annan
was sending such a letter. He said he didn't know the contents, but
Western diplomats said it would repeat Annan's urgent appeal to
Saddam to resume cooperation immediately.
	   The Iraqi official, from the Culture and Information Ministry,
did not reveal the letter's contents. But it was understood to
contain Annan's personal pledge to work for the lifting of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq if the weapons inspectors were allowed to go back
to work.
	   Sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which spurred the Gulf War. Under the cease-fire that ended Gulf
War in 1991, sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has been disarmed.
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the economy.
	   A promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out, as an American attack
appears more and more likely.
	   Other officials, also insisting on anonymity, said an official
government announcement could come in several hours. The comments
came after statements Friday by Saddam and U.S. President Bill
Clinton appeared to offer little way out of the crisis.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event of an attack, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration, workers trampled on and burned American and Israeli
flags.
	   The statement from the Iraqi official followed Saddam's
statement Friday making it clear that nothing less than a pledge to
lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with his
decisions in August and last month to block the U.N. inspectors'
searches for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward the end
of sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept positively any
initiative that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   But Clinton said the standoff would only end when Iraq resumed
its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   In the Iraqi capital, fears were growing that a military strike
was imminent. Motorists jammed by the hundreds into gasoline
stations, forming long lines to fill their tanks. Shoppers found
some prices rising in crowded markets.
	   Editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers Saturday pleaded with
the Arab world to back Iraq.
	   Al-Qadissiya pointed out that Iraq has sent sent troops to aid
Arab countries fighting Israel, and urged others to reciprocate.
	   Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense
of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples
have to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its
confrontation against American threats.''
	   Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's uneasy Gulf neighbors _
have called for a diplomatic solution to the latest crisis. But
they also have insisted that Iraq resume cooperation with U.N.
inspectors or risk the consequences.
	   At Friday prayers in the mosques, preachers issued similar
pleas.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   On the streets Saturday, several hundred Iraqi workers marched
from downtown Tahrir Square to the headquarters of the U.N.
Development Program on the River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is
staying forever.''
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles,
part of the government program to defend the capital, paraded at
the National Stadium.
	   Shoppers, meanwhile, expressed little fear of a U.S. attack,
reflecting government efforts to forge a united front.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, shopping for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her four
children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party and other
opposition groups abroad said Iraq had moved troops north to
protect oil installations and moved intelligence and security
officials out of their Baghdad headquarters.

<TEXT>
	   PERUGIA, Italy (AP) _ While helping his Italian team Perugia to
do well in the Serie A, Japanese soccer star Hidetoshi Nakata is
also promoting tourism in the city and in the neighboring Umbria
region.
	   Feats of the popular Japanese player in Italy is already
attracting thousands of Japanese tourists to Perugia and the
region.
	   A blowup of Nakata promoting tourism in Umbria, displayed at
Tokyo's World Travel Fair, is expected to boost the number of
Japanese visitors, regional officials said Saturday.
	   Local tour operators are offering Japanese tourists a package
including visits to cities of art and tickets for attending Serie A

Jordanians rejoice King Hussein's 63rd birthday

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanians on Saturday took a break from
the crisis over neighboring Iraq, rejoicing on King Hussein's
birthday by slaughtering sheep in thanksgiving sacrifice for his
recovery from cancer.
	   Hussein, who turned 63, said he was cured from non-Hodgkins
lymphoma in chemotherapy treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota.
	   ``Chemotherapy is over and, thank God, there is no trace of the
lymphoma,'' Hussein told the state-run Jordan Television from his
hospital bed in the United States.
	   But, he added, Mayo physicians are planning a marrow transplant
to ensure that no traces of lymphoma may recur. He did not
elaborate.
	   ``God willing, I will be amongst you in the near future,'' the
longest serving Arab ruler told his countrymen who have known no
other leader in for 43 years.
	   Hussein has been in the United States since July 14, the longest
time ever for a Jordanian king to be away from home _ activating a
largely idle constitutional clause which requires a parliamentary
debate on the absence.
	   The formality will be met at a special session by both houses of
Parliament on Thursday, but it is unlikely that the legislature
will go beyond praising the king.
	   Meanwhile, hundreds of Jordanians swarmed the streets of the
capital Amman, waving Jordanian flags, Hussein's portraits and
chanting: ``Our blood and soul we sacrifice for you, Hussein.''
	   The government declared a two-day national holiday to mark the
celebrations, which include fireworks, folklore dances and a skiing
competition.
	   Private and government offices throughout the kingdom decorated
their buildings with flashing lights, life-size portraits of
Hussein and Jordanian flags.
	   Cars decorated with Hussein's pictures and flags honked their
horns, jet fighters whizzed the skies and military helicopters
hovered over the city with banners wishing Hussein well.
	   In the bustling, narrow streets of downtown Amman, shopkeepers
offered sweets and soft drinks to passersby while crowds gathered
to chant slogans lauding the king.
	   In the suburbs, hundreds of people gathered in public parks
throughout the city where loudspeakers blare out ``Hashmi, Hashmi''
_ a popular Jordanian song honoring King Hussein's descent from
Hashmi, the grandfather of Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
	   In nearby cities, bedouin leaders pitched their tents and
brought in camels and sheep to slaughter in the streets in
traditional sacrificial gesture of thanksgiving for Hussein's
recovery.
	   The king's pictures also adorned pages of local newspapers. A
popular phone-in radio show was constantly swamped by calls from
Jordanians declaring allegiance to the king.
	   ``It's a fiesta,'' said Mohammed Kilani, while raising a flag on
the entrance of his souvenir shop in downtown Amman.
	   ``It takes us away from the puzzle of who will win the match _
Saddam or Clinton,'' he added, referring to the U.S. standoff with
Iraq over U.N. weapons inspectors.

Arafat, the U.S. peace envoy to the Middle East, called on both
Israel and the Palestinians Saturday to begin implementing the
latest peace accord which is more than a week behind schedule.
	   Dennis Ross, who arrived in the region Friday, spoke after talks
with Arafat in the northern West Bank city of Nablus.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to begin a staged troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank Monday. However, because of
several delays in getting the agreement ratified through the
Israeli Cabinet, Israeli officials have said the pullback will
likely begin towards the end of next week.
	   ``Our objective is to have the agreement implemented. Both sides
have obligations and responsibilities and we expect both sides to
carry out those responsibilities and obligations,'' Ross told
reporters after the meeting.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians also
wanted to see Israel implement several other areas of the agreement
also a week behind schedule including the opening of the
Palestinian airport in Gaza, and the release of prisoners from
Israeli jails.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians discussed their grievances with
Ross over Israeli plans for a new Jewish housing project on a
disputed Jerusalem hilltop and the confiscation of West bank land
for new roads for Jewish settlers.
	   ``The American side understands that the parties should refrain
from any unilateral action,'' Erekat said in regards to the
building.
	   Israel's government confirmed Friday that it has authorized the
paving of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
including one that will reportedly require the expropriation of
thousands of acres of Palestinian-owned land.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and are a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Ross met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday.
	   Netanyahu said last week he would permit the opening of the
Palestinian airport and begin releasing prisoners, though he has
not set dates.
	   Moving a small step forward, Israel on Friday gave the
Palestinians the names of Israeli negotiators in various committees
that are to deal with implementation of the accord or finalize some
issues, such as the opening of a Palestinian harbor.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinians held rallies and military parades in
Nablus and the West Bank city of Ramallah Saturday to commemorate
ten years since the PLO first announced it was seeking Palestinian
independence.
	   In a speech to supporters before meeting Ross in Nablus, Arafat
suggested that he was still aiming to declare a Palestinian state
in May, when the current peace accord expires.
	   ``We are going to build our state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Centimeter by centimeter, we will get the land to build our state
for May 1999,'' the Palestinian leader said.
	   Netanyahu is opposed to Palestinian statehood and said that if
Arafat unilaterally declares independence in the West Bank and
Gaza, Israel will annex the large chunks of land there still under
its control.

	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of angry Kurds demonstrated Saturday in
Rome, where Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of a 14-year-old Kurdish
insurgency, is under arrest and facing an extradition request by
Turkey.
	   ``He's a notorious assassin, the worst terrorist of our
century,'' Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, said in an
interview with Associated Press Television News on Saturday.
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday after stepping off a plane from
Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his
hideout in Syria.
	   The ANSA news agency, citing unofficial sources, said Ocalan had
also asked for political asylum in Italy. The Interior Ministry had
no comment on the report.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   Hundreds of Kurds demonstrated Saturday outside the military
hospital in Rome where Ocalan was being held. Scuffles broke out
and at least two Turkish journalists said they'd been beaten by PKK
militants.

UNICEF suggests cash-strapped governments reallocate funds from

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The head of the United Nations
Children's Fund called on Asian governments Saturday to spend less
on the military and more on helping children hurt by the region's
economic crisis.
	   Speaking at the end of the Fourth Ministerial Consultation on
Children's Welfare in Bangkok, UNICEF Executive Director Carol
Bellamy said that between 1985 and 1996 military expenditures in
the East Asia and Pacific region soared 36 percent to dlrs 76
billion.
	   Asia might have been able to afford such sums during the years
of its economic boom, she said, but now, in recession, it cannot.
	   Instead, Asian countries should explore other ways to promote
their national security _ such as easing the economic crisis'
impact on women and children, she said.
	   ``In order to keep programs for children in these tough economic
times, governments should consider transferring funds from defense
budgets,'' said Bellamy.
	   ``We are trying to be realistic because we realize there is no
money hidden behind some trees. But we understand that investing in
children, education and health will create as much ... security to
the country as investing in the military.''
	   In Indonesia, where half of the 200 million people must subsist
on less than dlrs 2 per day, the International Labor Organization
estimated that by the end of this year about 132 million people
will be living in poverty, said a UNICEF report presented at the
conference.
	   Women and children are bearing the brunt of the effects of the
economic crisis, said the report.
	   The government in Thailand, where at least 3 million people _ 80
percent of them women _ are predicted to be jobless by the end of
this year, is imposing serious cuts in welfare and education
spending since the crisis.
	   The education budget was trimmed 10.6 percent in 1997, while the
health budget was cut by 14.5 percent.
	   At the same time, an unpublished government survey indicated
that 40,000 to 50,000 first-graders dropped out of the school
system this year, three times the normal rate, the report said.
	   The crisis has also led countries such as Thailand and Malaysia
to expel large numbers of migrant workers from poorer nations such
as Indonesia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The practice
only makes the situation in these poorer countries worse, the
UNICEF report said.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's government is expected to respond
positively to pleas from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
resume dealings with United Nations arms inspectors, a senior Iraqi
official said Saturday.
	   Such a step could defuse the crisis over arms inspections that
has led to threatened American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of
U.S. military forces in the Gulf.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
reporters he ``had information'' that the Iraqi leadership would
reply favorably to a letter sent by Annan to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The official said Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who recently
met with Annan in New York, would be calling the secretary-general
with news of the Iraqi decision by 6 p.m. (1500gmt). Other
officials said a public announcement could come in several hours.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Friday that Annan
was sending a letter to Saddam. He said he didn't know the
contents, but Western diplomats said it would repeat Annan's urgent
appeal Wednesday to resume cooperation with the inspectors
immediately.
	   The Iraqi official, from the Culture and Information Ministry,
also did not reveal the letter's contents. But it was understood to
contain a personal pledge by Annan to work for the lifting of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq if the weapons inspectors were allowed to go back
to work.
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the country's economy.
	   Such a promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out of the current crisis as
an American attack on the country is appearing more and more
likely.
	   The news of a possible breakthrough in the dispute came after
statements Friday by both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton
appeared to offer little way out of the crisis.

Opposition fares well in Senate elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The main opposition party won the
first round of Senate elections and another opposition grouping
came second, exit polls showed Saturday. The results are a blow to
the governing Social Democrats
	   Candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party advanced
to the second round in 24 out of 27 districts in the two days of
voting, followed by the four-party center-right coalition led by
the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 17 candidates.
	   The ruling Social democrats came third with 13 candidates,
according to exit polls announced on Czech state radio.
	   Polling stations closed at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), and final results
were expected late Sunday.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were seats of 27 members whose
terms had run out. Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to
win the election outright or face a run-off between the two top
finishers. The run-offs are scheduled for Nov. 20-21.
	   Exit polls indicated none of the candidates gained more than 50
percent of first round vote, meaning that run-off elections will be
necessary in all districts.
	   Turnout was estimated to be 50 percent.
	   The Senate vote is considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His government survived in
Parliament thanks to a pact struck with the runner-up, the
center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   ``I expected we would fare better,'' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
commented on the election results.
	   The Senate was created as a safety mechanism to ensure the
country could function in case of a constitutional crisis. It can
pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution, should the
200-seat lower house of the parliament be dissolved.
	   Since its formation in 1996, the Senate has been criticized by
all members of the political spectrum for not being effective
enough.
	   Several parties, including the Communists and the
ultra-nationalist Republicans, have even called for its
abolishment.
	   No exit polls were done for local elections, which also took
place also Friday and Saturday.
	   More than 60,000 local posts are at stake. Independent
candidates are expected to dominate the local elections, which have
little bearing on the balance of political power in the country.
Final results are expected Tuesday.

Turkish general threatenes Greece over Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkey's second high-ranking general sent
a harsh warning to Greece and Greek Cypriots on Saturday to give up
what he called ``hostile policies'' against Turks on this divided
Mediterranean island.
	   ``Heroic Turkish sons will be able to drown in their own blood
those who want to drink Turkish blood,'' Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, deputy
chief of the Turkish general staff, was quoted as saying by the
Turkish Cypriot news agency, TAK.
	   Ozkok traveled to the northern Turkish sector of Cyprus on
Saturday to participate in Sunday's celebrations of the 15th
anniversary of the inception of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
Republic, which is only recognized by Ankara.
	   Ozkok accused Greek Cypriots of heightening tension on the
island with their plans to deploy Russian made anti-aircraft
missiles and Greece with supporting them.
	   ``All weapons that will be brought to southern Cyprus will cease
to exist when a clash breaks out,'' Ozkok said.
	   Turkey has vowed to block the missiles deployment by force if
necessary; Greece says that would mean war between the two NATO
partners.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish forces invaded the
northern third of the island to protect the Turkish minority
following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece in
1974.
	   Turkey maintains about 30,000 troops on the island.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's government is expected to respond
positively to pleas from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, a senior Iraqi
official said Saturday.
	   Such a step could defuse the crisis over arms inspections that
has led to threatened American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of
U.S. military forces in the Gulf.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
reporters he ``had information'' that the Iraqi leadership would
reply favorably to a letter Annan sent to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Friday that Annan
was sending such a letter. He said he didn't know the contents, but
Western diplomats said it would repeat Annan's urgent appeal to
Saddam to resume cooperation immediately.
	   The Iraqi official, from the Culture and Information Ministry,
did not reveal the letter's contents. But it was understood to
contain Annan's personal pledge to work for the lifting of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq if the weapons inspectors were allowed to go back
to work.
	   Sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which spurred the Gulf War. Under the cease-fire that ended Gulf
War in 1991, sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has been disarmed.
	   In Washington, David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National
Security Council, said Saturday in commenting on Annan's letter
that the U.S. position had not changed and Iraq must cooperate with
the United Nations. ``Public commitment by Iraq must be followed by
concrete and demonstrable actions.''
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the economy.
	   A promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out, as an American attack
appears more and more likely.
	   Iraqi officials in Baghdad, insisting on anonymity, said an
official government announcement could come in several hours. The
comments came after statements Friday by Saddam and U.S. President
Bill Clinton appeared to offer little way out of the crisis.
	   Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's uneasy Gulf neighbors _
have called for a diplomatic solution. But they also have insisted
that Iraq resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors or risk the
consequences.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event of an attack, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration, workers trampled on and burned American and Israeli
flags.
	   The statement from the Iraqi official followed Saddam's
statement Friday making it clear that nothing less than a pledge to
lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with his
decisions in August and last month to block the U.N. inspectors'
searches for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward the end
of sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept positively any
initiative that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   But Clinton said the standoff would only end when Iraq resumed
its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   In the Iraqi capital, fears were growing that a military strike
was imminent. Motorists jammed by the hundreds into gasoline
stations, forming long lines to fill their tanks. Shoppers found
some prices rising in crowded markets.
	   Editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers Saturday pleaded with
the Arab world to back Iraq.
	   Al-Qadissiya pointed out that Iraq has sent sent troops to aid
Arab countries fighting Israel, and urged others to reciprocate.
	   Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense
of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples
have to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its
confrontation against American threats.''
	   Several hundred Iraqi workers marched from downtown Tahrir
Square to the headquarters of the U.N. Development Program on the
River Tigris on Saturday, shouting ``Saddam is staying forever.''
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles,
part of the government program to defend the capital, paraded at
the National Stadium.
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party and other
opposition groups abroad said Iraq had moved troops north to
protect oil installations and moved intelligence and security
officials out of their Baghdad headquarters.

Report: Russia selling grain despite getting international food
</HEADLINE>
aid. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will continue to export grain grown
domestically even though it has just arranged to receive more than
a million tons of wheat in food aid from the United States, a news
report said Saturday.
	   ``You can't stop life, can you?'' Deputy Prime Minister Gennady
Kulik, who led negotiations with the West on aid, told the Moscow
Times newspaper. ``That's what I told the Americans, such
situations arise.''
	   Russian officials, saying they feared food shortages, reached a
deal with the United States for over 1.5 million tons of free wheat
last week. Officials are also negotiating to receive wheat, rice,
beef and pork in early January from the European Union.
	   But the government has already sold nearly 1.5 million tons of
wheat so far this year to markets abroad, where wheat prices are
three times as high as domestically. And it plans to keep doing so,
the Moscow Times said.
	   ``We have 2.5 million tons of grain in the Krasnodar region, and
they have sold 200,000 tons to Azerbaijan. Are we going to stop? No
we are not,'' Kulik said.
	   The food deal with the United States, which also includes
low-interest loans for another 200,000 tons of wheat, stipulates
that the American aid cannot be sold abroad.
	   American agriculture officials interviewed by the newspaper
seemed nonchalant about the news. ``We can work it out,'' one U.S.
agriculture official told the paper.
	   In an editorial, the English-language daily accused the U.S. of
not being interested in helping out those who might face food
shortages this winter, but of only wanting to help its own farmers.
	   ``If the U.S. is so worried about hunger in Russia's region, why
doesn't it give Russia loans to buy Russian wheat for a third of
the price?'' the Times wrote in an editorial.

Amnesty urges Habibie to restrain Indonesian security forces

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amnesty International urged
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Saturday to order his security
forces to show restraint in dealing with anti-government
protesters.
	   ``It is tragedy that Indonesia's new political order should be
born amid a new wave of human rights violations,'' the London-based
human rights group said in a statement released in the Malaysian
capital.
	   ``Police and security services have to be retrained,'' said John
Kellock, Amnesty's regional representative, who is in Kuala Lumpur
in connection with next week's summit of leaders from the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries.
	   Opposition leaders and student activists have called on Habibie
and Wiranto to quit.
	   Deadly clashes between students and security forces gave way to
widespread rioting in the capital Saturday as rock-throwing mobs
burned cars, looted shops and ransacked police stations.
	   Local media report and diplomats say at least 14 people, most of
them students, have died this week in the worst violence in Jakarta
since riots and protests ousted former President Suharto in May
after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie called on the military to take immediate action to
restore order. He called for calm before an emergency meeting with
military chief Gen. Wiranto, the defense minister and other Cabinet
members.
	   Demonstrators were calling on the government to introduce more
liberal reforms.
	   ``In recent months, the Indonesian army has shown great restrain
in handling demonstrations,'' the Amnesty statement said. ``But
there is a risk that the recent killings will undermine public
confidence in the professionalism and accountability of the
military.''
	   Kellock also urged APEC leaders to help by ``appealing (to
Habibie) for restraint and for freedom of expression to be
respected.''
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas Saturday denied rumors
that Habibie had canceled his visit to Kuala Lumpur because of the
violence in Jakarta.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Todd Martin rallied from a set down to
beat Tim Henman 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 Saturday to reach the final of the
Stockholm Open for the second time since 1996.
	   The American played near flawless tennis after losing the first
set to the third-seeded Briton.
	   ``I was fortunate to get back in the match after I lost the
first set,'' he said. ``I served well. He lost his rhythm.''
	   Martin, unseeded here and ranked 21st in the world, will meet
Greg Rusedski or Thomas Johansson in Sunday's final in one of the
world's oldest indoors.
	   Martin also reached the 1996 final at the Royal Tennis Hall, but
lost to Thomas Enqvist.
	   ``But I was killed in that final,'' he said. ``I hope it will be
different this time.''
	   Martin won one ATP title this year in Barcelona on clay. He also
reached the semis in Indianapolis, Vienna and Paris Indoor.
	   After dropping the opening set, Martin broke Henman twice to
level the match at one set apiece.
	   Martin got off to a perfect start in the decider, breaking
Henman's serve after two straight unforced errors by the Briton.
	   He broke Henman again to lead 4-1 and then held his serve the
rest of the way.
	   It was Martin's third win against one loss to Henman.

Social unrest erupts in Malaysia ahead of APEC summit

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis, police
fired shots into the air to disperse hundreds of people
demonstrating against the Malaysian government.
	   It was the first time that security forces have fired shots
since anti-government protests began with the dismissal of the
deputy prime minister on Sept. 2, triggering social unrest.
	   Defying thousands of police and security officers stationed in
Kuala Lumpur during the international meeting, 2,000 people rallied
downtown to criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Shouting slogans and carrying banners saying ``Mahathir is power
crazy,'' the protesters criticized his treatment of Anwar Ibrahim,
the minister who was fired, then jailed after launching a
nationwide anti-Mahathir reform movement.
	   The crowd scattered when several undercover police opened fire,
but some protesters chased the officers down a road of the
residential neighborhood of the capital, witnesses said. No
injuries were immediately reported.
	   Mahathir is determined to prevent Anwar's struggle from becoming
a focus of this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
But as officials from the many foreign governments met over the
weekend to prepare for it, several officials went out of their way
to sympathize with Anwar.
	   Two top Canadian officials met on Saturday with his wife, Azizah
Ismail, who has become the de facto leader of his pro-reform
movement since he was jailed and put on trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and its trade
minister, Sergio Marchi, invited Azizah to lunch between their
meetings with other APEC officials.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy said after the luncheon.
	   He said the meeting with Azizah took place at the request of
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Afterward, Axworthy said, he
told Malaysia's foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, that
Canada is concerned that Anwar receive a fair trial.
	   Anwar, also ousted as finance minister, has claimed that he was
beaten by police before his trial started. Pictures of him walking
into his trial with a black eye have been seen in newspapers and
television broadcasts around the world.
	   Some APEC leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have
said they won't meet privately with Mahathir during the summit
because of what has happened in Malaysia.
	   Chretien, the host of last year's APEC summit, said in Singapore
on Saturday that he would discuss Anwar's treatment directly with
Mahathir during his visit to Malaysia.
	   Azizah also plans to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who was to arrive in Malaysia Saturday night to
participate in the meetings before the APEC summit.
	   The Malaysian government said that Albright should not meddle in
Malaysia's internal affairs by meeting with Azizah.
	   Abdullah said Albright ``will be here as a guest and she should
know what to do.'' Speaking to Malaysia's government news agency,
he also said: ``Foreign officials and leaders attending the APEC
meetings should not interfere in Malaysia's affairs.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was to arrive in
Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah, too.
	   In the meantime, APEC Cabinet ministers met Saturday to discuss
a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade, but
Japan and the United States remained deeply divided over a key
provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and
fish _ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   A Japanese news agency, which obtained a draft of the APEC
group's final statement, reported Saturday that it urged APEC to
deal urgently with the global crisis and to closely examine the
operations of the world's secretive and risky hedge funds.
	   Investments by the funds have been blamed for the some of the
wild fluctuations in Asia's currency and stock markets.
	   Mahathir said in an interview with a government news agency that
he will take his biggest pet complaint to APEC leaders: currency
speculators. Mahathir has made it clear that international controls
on foreign currency trading will be on the agenda of the APEC
summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' Mahathir said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's government is expected to respond
positively to pleas from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, a senior Iraqi
official said Saturday.
	   Such a step could defuse the crisis over arms inspections that
has led to threatened American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of
U.S. military forces in the Gulf.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
reporters he ``had information'' that the Iraqi leadership would
reply favorably to a letter Annan sent to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The official said Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who recently
met with Annan in New York, would call the secretary-general with
news of the Iraqi decision later Saturday. Other officials said an
announcement could come in several hours.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Friday that Annan
was sending such a letter. He said he didn't know the contents, but
Western diplomats said it would repeat Annan's urgent appeal to
Saddam to resume cooperation immediately.
	   The Iraqi official, from the Culture and Information Ministry,
did not reveal the letter's contents. But it was understood to
contain Annan's personal pledge to work for the lifting of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq if the weapons inspectors were allowed to go back
to work.
	   Sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which spurred the Gulf War. Under the cease-fire that ended Gulf
War in 1991, sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has been disarmed.
	   In Washington, David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National
Security Council, said Saturday in commenting on Annan's letter
that the U.S. position had not changed and Iraq must cooperate with
the United Nations. ``Public commitment by Iraq must be followed by
concrete and demonstrable actions.''
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the economy.
	   A promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out, as an American attack
appears more and more likely.
	   The news of a possible breakthrough came a day after statements
Friday by Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer
little way out of the crisis.

Husband of woman killed in turbulence sues United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The husband of a Japanese woman who died after
hitting her head in turbulence on a United Airlines flight bound
for Honolulu sued the airline Saturday, a news report said.
	   Takamasa Kataura, 34, filed for unspecified damages against
United with the Federal District Court in San Francisco, claiming
the airline was responsible for the death of his wife, Konomi,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Kataura's wife hit her head against the ceiling of the aircraft
as it plunged 300 meters before stabilizing. She had not been
wearing her seat belt.
	   Kataura said he will specify how much he will demand in damages
during the course of the trial, Kyodo said.
	   More than 100 were injured over the Pacific on United Airlines
747 jumbo jet flight, which returned to Tokyo Dec. 28 instead of
continuing to its destination in Hawaii.
	   United Airlines has said the seat-belt sign was turned on after
the plane hit slight turbulence and announcements were made in
English and Japanese alerting passengers to buckle up before severe
shaking started.

Low pressure over Bay of Bengal intensifies into depression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladeshi authorities Saturday
ordered all fishing boats and trawlers in the Bay of Bengal to stay
close to the coast after a depression was reported moving toward
the arch of Bangladesh.
	   A special weather bulletin said that the western, central and
southern parts of the bay were experiencing low pressure 4 P.M.
local time (1000 GMT) Saturday about 1100 km (680 miles) from the
southeastern port city of Chittagong.
	   The depression would move to the northwest, meteorological
officials said.
	   The maximum wind speed recorded within the 44 square km (18
square miles) depression center is about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
per hour, rising to 50 kmph (31 miles) in gust or squalls.
	   The sea will remain moderate, the bulletin said.

Human rights in Bosnia improved, but many violations still occur
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Politically influenced and
incompetent police continue violating human rights across Bosnia,
despite a general improvement of the rights situation, two
influential watchdog agencies said Saturday.
	   One of the groups _ Human Rights Watch _ also faulted lack of
international pressure and unclear mandates of the NATO-led peace
force and U.N. police monitors, saying they permit top war crimes
suspects to remain at large and impede refugee returns.
	   Human Rights Watch and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights
spent past two weeks traveling across Bosnia assess the situation
since the Dayton peace accord stopped the war in 1995.
	   Holly Cartner, head of Human Rights watch said human rights in
the both the Serb and Croat-Muslim halves of the country have
improved some, particularly regarding freedom of movement and work
of new, joint institutions.
	   The arrests of several persons indicted for war crimes by the
U.N. War Crimes Tribunal, were also positive, Cartner said.
	   ``However, Human Rights Watch remains deeply concerned about
human rights violations in a number of areas,'' she told reporters.
	   Cartner and other human rights officials listed numerous cases
where local justice systems failed to apprehend of prosecute those
suspected of committing hate crimes and singled out police in some
instances.
	   ``Not only do police frequently fail to investigate ethnically
motivated crimes, but there are far too many cases ... where police
have themselves participated in criminal acts against minorities or
have stood by passively while others carried out such acts,''
Cartner said.
	   At least 20 war crimes suspects remain at large in Bosnia,
including the wartime Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and
his military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic.
	   ``And there appears to be little international pressure to
arrest them,'' she said. ``The failure to arrest the most prominent
indictees has made it impossible to implement key provisions of the
Dayton peace agreement and promises to compromise the large
(refugee) return program.''
	   In addition, Cartner said the NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N.
police monitors ``need to clarify their mandates and focus more
attention on the prevention of violence against returnees.''

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's exports brought in dlrs 342.79
million for the first half of the 1998 fiscal year, a rise of 22.4
percent over the same period last year, the Foreign Trade Ministry
said Saturday.
	   The ministry said the main exports were livestock, sesame seeds,
cotton, vegetable oils and sugar, the official Sudan News Agency
reported.
	   The ministry did not give a break down of the earnings.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ A total of 2,287 projects have been set
up since Syria passed its 1991 law to stimulate private sector
investment, the government-run Tishrin newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The capital invested, which came from local and foreign sources,
totaled about 368 billion Syrian pounds (dlrs 7.52 billion), the
paper said.
	   The projects created about 168,000 jobs, the paper added.
	   The 1991 investment law offers a number of incentives, including
tax exemptions for up to 7 years and the waiving of certain customs
duties.
	   Among the new projects were 889 foodstuff companies, 514
chemical firms and a number of textile concerns.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Gulf Bank announced Saturday it had made 22.6
million dinars (dlrs 74.83 million) in net profits in the first
three quarters of 1998, down 3.5 percent from the same period last
year.
	   In an advertisement in Al-Watan newspaper, the bank did not
explain why profits fell, but it said it had pursued a
``conservative policy in forming provisions for the third quarter
of this year.''
	   Total assets were up by 7.9 percent at the end of the third
quarter, reaching 1.85 million dinars (dlrs 6.12 million), the
advertisement said.
	   The Gulf Bank is listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange with a
paid-up capital of 82 million dinars (dlrs 271.52 million).

Fox still hopes to shoot ``Anna and the King'' in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Plans by a U.S filmmaker to film a
major movie about a 19th-century Thai king remained deadlocked
Saturday, but some progress appeared to have been made in easing
environmental concerns related to the making of another major film.
	   The country's Film Board refused last week to let 20th Century
Fox film its ``Anna and the King'' on location in Thailand,
maintaining it insults King Mongkut.
	   The board said script revisions submitted by Fox don't go far
enough in changing what it insists are historical inaccuracies
about Mongkut, also portrayed unflatteringly in the famous stage
and screen productions of ``The King and I.''
	   While the board left open the option of submitting the script
for a third time, Supinda Chakrabhand, an adviser to Fox, said last
week the company couldn't wait much longer and would soon decide
whether to shoot the location scenes in neighboring Malaysia
instead.
	   But the Thai coordinators for the film, to star Jodie Foster and
Hong Kong's Chow Yun Fat, said Saturday that Fox still hopes to
shoot the film in Thailand.
	   ``The company is now revising the final script and expected to
submit it to the Thai Film Board soon,'' said Malinee Chakrabhand,
who assists her sister Supinda.
	   The two are members of the extended royal family, and King
Mongkut was their great-great grandfather.
	   Malinee was responding to a report Saturday in the Bangkok Post
newspaper quoting Mike Moder, Fox's vice president of features, as
saying he was bidding Thailand ``good-bye.''.
	   ``That was Moder's old message from before Nov. 13,'' Malinee
told The Associated Press. ``But now Moder agrees that Fox should
wait and revise the script.''
	   She confirmed, however, that the company has begun doing
pre-production work in Malaysia.
	   ``Thailand is the best shooting site for the movie, so Fox will
take another chance to try again. But if Thailand insists on
turning down the movie in the next meeting, Malaysia is the best
bet,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, another planned Fox movie, ``The Beach,'' has made
progress in allaying the fears that it will cause environmental
damage when it is filmed on the southern island of Phi Phi, a
popular tourist destination.
	   Residents eased their opposition after Fox accepted conditions
to ensure the well-being of the island's environment both before
and after the shooting, the Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The Thai coordinating team for the movie told The Nation that
Fox has no problem with the conditions because most of them were
already in the contract the company signed with Thailand's Forestry
Department.
	   Shooting of the movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is expected
to begin in mid-January.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's atomic energy minister will travel to
Iran soon to check on plans for a nuclear power plant to be built
there with Russian parts, a news report said Saturday.
	   Minister Yevgeny Adamov will travel to Bushehr, where Russian
specialists are to install a VVER-1000 light water reactor in a
dlrs 800 million contract, he told the Interfax news agency.
	   The United States fears the project will help Iran advance its
suspected nuclear weapons program, and has expressed disapproval.
But Russia, desperate for hard cash, says the reactor can be used
only for civilian purposes and is anxious to press ahead.
	   Adamov also said the Russian government will guarantee to go
ahead with constructing a similar nuclear power plant in China
despite the financial crisis that hit the Russian government in
August.
	   Chinese leaders earlier voiced concern that the two-reactor
project, which would garner Russia dlrs 2.5 billion, would collapse
because of the Russian economic crisis.
	   Russia continues to rile western governments by signing deals
with volatile countries for sales of arms and nuclear technology.
It has also signed a contract for a nuclear plant in India.

Parents of mistaken boy seek police protection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RHODES, Greece (AP) _ The parents of a blond boy mistakenly
identified as possibly missing Briton Ben Needham have asked for
police protection, reports said Saturday.
	   Greek media said the parents of 7-year-old Savvas Skilarakis
went to police in this holiday island to seek extra surveillance
for their family. The request was apparently in fear that someone
could snatch the boy believing him to be Ben, who disappeared in
1991.
	   But the boy's identity has been confirmed by the doctor who
delivered him, reports said.
	   A British tourist took a photograph of Savvas, the youngest of
four brothers, which appeared in Britain's Sun newspaper this week.
The tourist said he believed Savvas resembled Ben. The tourist also
took a strand of the boy's hair for DNA tests in Britain.
	   Ben Needham vanished on the island of Kos, near Rhodes, when he
was 19-months-old in July 1991. He disappeared from a playground on
the island, where the family had a holiday home.
	   Police in England have issued computer-generated pictures of how
he might look today. A reward of more than dlrs 650,000 was also
offered in 1996 for information on his whereabouts.

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A top Serbian politician
left Bosnia Saturday on orders from NATO peacekeepers who told him
he was not welcome, amid a related conflict over who should head
the Bosnian Serb government
	   Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj, an ally of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and a radical nationalist who espouses
a harder line in the Serb conflict against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, was told to leave late Friday by NATO troops. They were
empowered to expel Seselj by the Office of the High Representative,
the top foreign authority in Bosnia overseeing the country's
postwar development.
	   Seselj was attending an inauguration party for Nikola Poplasen,
the new premier of the Bosnian Serb substate. Poplasen is also a
radical nationalist, allied to the camp of Radovan Karadzic, the
suspected war criminal and wartime Bosnian Serb leader.
	   After arguing with dozens of NATO soldiers in armored vehicles,
Seselj, a former paramilitary leader in Croatia and Bosnia, left
the hotel where the inauguration reception was being held and
returned to neighboring Serbia early Saturday.
	   There was no violence. Seselj condemned ``American occupation''
saying it was aimed at destroying the Bosnian Serb republic. He
left with a Bosnian Serb police escort.
	   Maj. Sheena Thomson, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led peace force,
said Seselj ``had his last word to say before the departure, but
went without screaming and kicking.''
	   The expulsion order was signed by Jacques Klein, the American
deputy head of the Office of the High Representative.
	   ``Seselj's activities and statements both during the war and
recently offer clear evidence that his presence in Bosnia would
constitute an activity detrimental to the implementation'' of
peace, said the order.
	   In September presidential elections Poplasen won over a moderate
Bosnian Serb who was supported by world powers involved in Bosnia.
	   Seselj was banned from Bosnia during the election campaigns. But
he and Poplasen have vowed to keep close ties nevertheless.
	   Later Saturday, Poplasen proposed fellow nationalist Dragan
Kalinic as new Bosnian Serb premier of the Bosnian Serb entity, to
replace Milorad Dodik, the moderate now holding the post.
	   Dodik is favored by the world powers because of his commitment
to the Dayton accords that mandate ethnic harmony, freedom of
movement and other postwar aims for Bosnia.
	   But Poplasen said Kalinic would also ``continue good cooperation
with the international community and with big Western nations, and
strictly respect the Dayton peace agreement...to the benefit of the
Serb people without infringing the rights of other ethnic
communities.
	   The two feuding Bosnian Serb factions, moderates and
nationalists, each hold 32 seats in the 83-seat Bosnian Serb
parliament. Votes from the 19 Muslim and Croat deputies will likely
decide if Kalinic will replace Dodik. But with radicals like
Kalinic opposed to ethnic coexistence, the Croats and Muslims were
likely to vote against him.
	   In Sarajevo, the High Representative's office signaled it would
not permit Kalinic to become premier, saying Dodik was the only
candidate supported by world powers involved in the peace process.
High Representative Carlos Westendorp has the power to effectively
veto any candidate deemed harmful to the peace effort.

Canada to propose task force to humanize APEC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Saying liberalized trade should
not be an end in itself, Canadian officials announced Saturday they
plan to propose a new task force to help humanize the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said APEC needs to do
more to consider the human impact of economic decisions and of its
goal of free trade.
	   He said Canada would propose the task force at a meeting Sunday
of APEC trade and foreign ministers in Kuala Lumpur. The task force
will propose ways that the 20-nation organization can work with
citizen's groups to understand their concerns, he said.
	   APEC should be aware of the ``very clear social, human impact''
from the region's currency crisis, Axworthy said.
	   Earlier Saturday, Axworthy and Canadian trade minister Sergio
Marchi visited a ``People's Summit'' organized by Malaysian and
international citizens' groups that say APEC should consider human
rights concerns.
	   They met there with Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed former
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Azizah expressed
concerns about her husband's treatment in jail, and the Canadian
officials passed on those comments to Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, they said.
	   Marchi said APEC countries ``need to engage our respective
peoples'' if they wish to achieve their goal of building an APEC
community.
	   ``Liberalized trade is not an end in itself, but a means to an
end -- to improve people's lives,'' he said.

5 injured as aircraft avoids approaching plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Five people aboard a Japan Transocean Air domestic
flight suffered light injuries Saturday after it maneuvered to
avoid an approaching aircraft, local media reported.
	   The Tokyo-bound Boeing 737 took off from Miyakojima Island, near
the southern island of Okinawa, shortly before 7:00 p.m. (10:00
GMT) and shook violently in mid-flight as it avoided another plane,
national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News Agency reported.
	   Airport police, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that the injured were taken to a hospital after the plane landed at
Tokyo's Haneda airport, but would not provide other details.
	   Airline officials were not available for comment. The transport
ministry was reportedly investigating the incident.
	   The plane was carrying 28 passengers and five crew, Kyodo said.
No other details were immediately available.

 &UR; Human rights in Bosnia improved, but many violations still occur
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Politically influenced and
incompetent police continue violating human rights across Bosnia,
despite a general improvement of the rights situation, two
influential watchdog agencies said Saturday.
	   One of the groups _ Human Rights Watch _ also faulted lack of
international pressure and unclear mandates of the NATO-led peace
force and U.N. police monitors, saying they permit top war crimes
suspects to remain at large and impede refugee returns.
	   Human Rights Watch and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights
spent two weeks traveling across Bosnia assess the situation since
the Dayton peace accord stopped the war in 1995.
	   Holly Cartner, head of Human Rights Watch, said human rights in
the both the Serb and Croat-Muslim halves of the country have
improved some, particularly regarding freedom of movement and work
of new, joint institutions.
	   The arrests of several persons indicted for war crimes by the
U.N. War Crimes Tribunal, were also positive, Cartner said.
	   ``However, Human Rights Watch remains deeply concerned about
human rights violations in a number of areas,'' she told reporters.
	   Cartner and other human rights officials listed numerous cases
where local justice systems failed to apprehend of prosecute those
suspected of committing hate crimes and singled out police in some
instances.
	   ``Not only do police frequently fail to investigate ethnically
motivated crimes, but there are far too many cases ... where police
have themselves participated in criminal acts against minorities or
have stood by passively while others carried out such acts,''
Cartner said.
	   At least 20 war crimes suspects remain at large in Bosnia,
including the wartime Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and
his military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic.
	   ``And there appears to be little international pressure to
arrest them,'' she said. ``The failure to arrest the most prominent
indictees has made it impossible to implement key provisions of the
Dayton peace agreement and promises to compromise the large
(refugee) return program.''
	   In addition, Cartner said the NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N.
police monitors ``need to clarify their mandates and focus more
attention on the prevention of violence against returnees.''

Iran, Oman to discuss closer military cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Oman's defense minister arrived in Iran on
Saturday for talks on military cooperation, Tehran radio reported.
	   Bader Alareb Al Busaidi told his Iranian counterpart, Ali
Shamkhani, that the two states could expand their defense and
political relations, the radio reported.
	   Turning to the current crisis between the United Nations and
Iraq, Shamkhani reiterated that Iran was opposed to military
strikes on Iraq but believed that the Baghdad government should
comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions on eliminating
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Oman has close ties with Iran and relations have improved since
Iran's President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate, took
office last year.
	   Tehran has often expressed an interest in military cooperation
with Gulf countries, but none has ever participated in the military
exercises that Iran holds each year.

Yeltsin to Clinton: Don't use force against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin sent a message to U.S.
President Bill Clinton restating Russia's opposition to the use of
force against Iraq, the Kremlin said Saturday.
	   In the message, Yeltsin ``spoke strongly against the use of
force,'' the presidential press service said. He also criticized
Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The message was sent Friday, the Kremlin said.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to play a mediator's role in Iraq's frequent
confrontations with the West, including the latest crisis.
	   Yeltsin told Clinton he hoped that by ``working jointly, we will
be able to ward off the worst and return Baghdad to the path of
compliance with the decisions of the international community.''

Martin beats Henman to reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Martin quotes, detail &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Todd Martin rallied from a set down to
beat Tim Henman 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 Saturday to reach the final of the
Stockholm Open for the second time since 1996.
	   The American played near flawless tennis after losing the first
set to the third-seeded Briton.
	   ``I was fortunate to get back in the match after I lost the
first set,'' he said. ``I served well. He lost his rhythm.''
	   Martin, unseeded here and ranked 21st in the world, will meet
Greg Rusedski or Thomas Johansson in Sunday's final in one of the
world's oldest indoor tournaments.
	   Martin also reached the 1996 final at the Royal Tennis Hall, but
lost to Thomas Enqvist.
	   ``But I was killed in that final,'' he said. ``I hope it will be
different this time.''
	   Martin won one ATP title this year in Barcelona on clay. He also
reached the semis in Indianapolis, Vienna and the Paris Open.
	   ``I've played really well on this (European) trip,'' he said.
``It's not something I expected at all. Before Vienna I took some
time off and had not prepared diligently. That week in Vienna gave
me a lot of confidence.''
	   After dropping the opening set, Martin broke Henman twice to
level the match at one set apiece.
	   Martin got off to a perfect start in the decider, breaking
Henman's serve after two straight unforced errors by the Briton.
	   Martin broke Henman again to lead 4-1, the fourth time the
Briton dropped his serve in his last five service games. The
American then held his serve the rest of the way.
	   It was Martin's third win against one loss to Henman.
	   Henman clinched the seventh and penultimate berth in the ATP
Tour World Championship by winning his quarterfinal Friday against
Magnus Gustafsson 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-0). The Championship will be
played Nov. 24-29 in Hanover, Germany.

Jackson ends Africa trip heaping praise on Ghana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ending his five-day trip to Africa, U.S.
Special Envoy Jesse Jackson praised the role that Ghana has played
in the region, saying it ``represents a clear, precise and strong
example of democratic and economic triumph.''
	   ``We live in the morning of a new day,'' said the civil rights
leader and special envoy to Africa, describing the roles that Ghana
has played in promoting peace and development.
	   ``We know what (Ghana) has been through; what cannot be done and
what can be done,'' he said at a late Friday night press
conference, shortly before returning to the United States.
	   Ghana, a former British colony, suffered through a series of
military coups in the 1970s before eventually becoming one of the
West Africa's more stable countries.
	   President Jerry Rawlings, who himself seized power in a bloody
coup, has moved the country toward democracy and was elected to a
second term as president in 1996.
	   Ghana has also become one of the region's economic success
stories, with a flourishing economy largely based on cocoa and gold
production.
	   Jackson, who spoke to reporters after meeting with Rawlings,
also praised the steps that Nigeria has made toward democracy and
urged the combatants in Sierra Leone's bloody civil war to end
their fighting.
	   Jackson's trip to Africa, which began on Monday, also included
stops in Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Ross calls on both sides to begin implementing Mideast accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ The U.S. envoy to the Middle East
called on both Israel and the Palestinians on Saturday to begin
implementing the latest peace accord, which is more than a week
behind schedule.
	   Dennis Ross, who arrived in the region Friday, spoke after a
two-hour meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the West
Bank city of Nablus.
	   Under the accord, Israel was to begin a staged troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank in Monday. But because of delays
in getting the agreement through the Israeli Cabinet, Israeli
officials have said the pullback will probably begin toward the end
of next week.
	   ``Our objective is to have the agreement implemented. Both sides
have obligations and responsibilities and we expect both sides to
carry out those responsibilities and obligations,'' Ross said after
meeting with Arafat.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians also
wanted to see Israel implement several other areas of the agreement
that are also a week behind schedule, including the opening of the
Palestinian airport in Gaza and the release of prisoners from
Israeli jails. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last
week that he would permit the opening of the Palestinian airport
and begin releasing prisoners, though he has not set dates. Ross
met with Netanyahu on Friday.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians discussed their grievances with
Ross over Israeli plans for a new Jewish housing project on a
disputed Jerusalem hilltop and the confiscation of West Bank land
for new roads for Jewish settlers.
	   ``The American side understands that the parties should refrain
from any unilateral action,'' Erekat said of the building.
	   Israel's government confirmed Friday that it authorized the
paving of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
including one that will reportedly require the expropriation of
thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian-owned land.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and are a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Arafat advisor Nabil Amr.
	   Also Saturday, Palestinians held rallies and military parades in
Nablus and the West Bank city of Ramallah to commemorate the 10th
anniversary of the PLO announcement that it was seeking Palestinian
independence.
	   In a speech to supporters before meeting Ross, Arafat suggested
that he still meant to declare a Palestinian state when the Oslo
peace accords expire.
	   ``We are going to build our state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Centimeter by centimeter, we will get the land to build our state
for May 1999,'' the Palestinian leader said.
	   Netanyahu is opposed to Palestinian statehood and says that if
Arafat declares independence in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel will
annex the large chunks of land there still under its control.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to
the final of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on Saturday after
sixth-seeded Marc Rosset withdrew in the second set with a hip
injury.
	   And Goran Ivanisevic, seeded third, ousted surprise contender
Arnaud Clement, 7-5, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, dominated through
his match, going ahead 6-1, 2-0 before Rosset retired.
	   A two-time Kremlin Cup winner, Rosset couldn't keep up with
Kafelnikov from the start. The only reminder of his powerful serve
was four straight aces in the sixth game _ the one time he would
hold.
	   After the first set, a trainer came on to treat Rosset, who had
injured his left hip flexor and groin during practice in the
morning.
	   The second set was no better than the first, with Rosset, of
Switzerland, unable to make a single first serve in the first game.
Kafelnikov broke him and quickly wrapped up the second, after which
Rosset stepped down and apologizing briefly to the crowd.
	   The other match saw more of a battle in the first set. The two
managed to hold on until Ivanisevic, not serving well, broke in the
twelfth.
	   But Clement eventually tired out in the second set. Unable to
keep up with Ivanisevic in a number of long rallies, he lost serve
in the second and eighth games. The final game went to deuce, and
Clement lost match point at deuce on an unforced error.
	   ``I have to play much better tomorrow if I want to win,''
Ivanisevic said afterward.
	   The Russian Kafelnikov and Ivanisevic will meet Sunday. They
faced each other in the Kremlin Cup final in 1996, a match
Ivanisevic won.

the world cannot afford to ignore the threat of Iraqi chemical and
biological weapons, but said he hoped for a diplomatic solution to
the crisis.
	   And the Foreign Office said it was unimpressed by a statement
from Iraq that it would ``respond in a positive manner'' to a
letter from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``The time is passing rapidly. We are still expecting them to
come back to full compliance and let the (inspection) team back
in,'' said a spokeswoman at the Foreign Office, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``Until a formal response is received by Annan which states
that, we won't be happy with anything less.''
	   Earlier, Cook said the onus was on Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to defuse the crisis.
	   ``I think it's a bit rich of Saddam Hussein to say he will
respond to any initiative, when all week he has been refusing to
respond to the many initiatives that have been made,'' Cook said in
a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
	   Annan on Friday urged Saddam to make ``a wise decision'' and
resume cooperation with weapons inspectors. Annan earlier met at
U.N. headquarters with ambassadors of Russia, France and China who
appealed to him to intervene to find a diplomatic solution and
avert U.S. air strikes.
	   Despite the apparent split in the security council about
possible military action, Cook said the council was united in
regarding Iraq as violating its agreement on weapons inspection.
	   Cook said he would prefer Saddam cooperate with the UN
inspectors.
	   ``But if he won't do that, then he will be disarmed through
military action. We cannot leave him with those weapons,'' Cook
said.
	   ``If one of the consequences of any military action was for
Saddam to be toppled, that would be a bonus, a very welcome bonus,
but that is not the objective of any military action,'' he added.

Opposition fares well in Senate elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Results expected late Sunday. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech Republic's main
opposition party won the first round of Senate elections and
another opposition grouping came in second, exit polls showed
Saturday, in a blow to the governing Social Democrats.
	   Candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party advanced
to the second round in 24 of 27 districts in two days of voting,
followed by the four-party center-right coalition led by the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 17 candidates.
	   The ruling Social Democrats came third with 13 candidates,
according to exit polls announced on state radio. Results were
expected late Sunday.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were 27 seats. Candidates had
to get a 50 percent majority to win the election outright or face a
runoff between the two top finishers. The runoffs are scheduled for
Nov. 20-21.
	   Exit polls indicated none of the candidates gained more than 50
percent of the first-round vote, meaning that runoffs will be
necessary in all districts. Turnout was estimated at 50 percent.
	   The Senate vote is considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, early general
election in June produced a one-party minority government of Social
Democrats led by Zeman. His government survived in Parliament
thanks to a pact struck with the runner-up, the center-right Civic
Democratic Party.
	   ``I expected we would fare better,'' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
said of the balloting.
	   No exit polls were done for local elections, which also took
place Friday and Saturday.
	   More than 60,000 local posts are at stake. Independent
candidates were expected to dominate the local elections, which
have little bearing on the balance of power in the country. Final
results were expected Tuesday.

Kafelnikov advances to final of Kremlin Cup after Rosset withdraws

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to
the final of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on Saturday after
sixth-seeded Marc Rosset withdrew in the second set with a hip
injury.
	   And Goran Ivanisevic, seeded third, ousted surprise contender
Arnaud Clement, 7-5, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, dominated through
his match, going ahead 6-1, 2-0 before Rosset retired.
	   A two-time Kremlin Cup winner, Rosset couldn't keep up with
Kafelnikov from the start. The only reminder of his powerful serve
was four straight aces in the sixth game _ the one time he would
hold.
	   After the first set, a trainer came on to treat Rosset, who had
injured his left hip flexor and groin during practice in the
morning.
	   The second set was no better than the first, with Rosset, of
Switzerland, unable to make a single first serve in the first game.
Kafelnikov broke him and quickly wrapped up the second, after which
Rosset stepped down and apologizing briefly to the crowd.
	   The other match saw more of a battle in the first set. The two
managed to hold on until Ivanisevic, not serving well, broke in the
twelfth.
	   But Clement eventually tired out in the second set. Unable to
keep up with Ivanisevic in a number of long rallies, he lost serve
in the second and eighth games. The final game went to deuce, and
Clement lost match point at deuce on an unforced error.
	   ``I have to play much better tomorrow if I want to win,''
Ivanisevic said afterward.
	   The Russian Kafelnikov and Ivanisevic will meet Sunday. They
faced each other in the Kremlin Cup final in 1996, a match
Ivanisevic won.

Griqualand posts 190 for 6 wickets at tea time against West Indies

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLY, South Africa _ Griqualand West survived a middle-order
batting crisis to post 190 for six wickets at tea time on Saturday,
the start of a four-day cricket match against the touring West
Indies.
	   After a trouble-plagued start to its South African tour, the
West Indies have this match and another four-day fixture against
Free State before the first test begins Nov. 26.
	   With temperatures soaring to 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees
Fahrenheit), the home side made hash of its 83 for one wicket lunch
time score.
	   An inexperienced top order stumbled to 121 for five wickets, and
in the end it was left to B team skipper Findlay Brooker (29 not
out), his deputy Andre Botha (20) and 38-year-old veteran Pat
Symcox (18 not out) to restore order.
	   Together Brooker and Botha put on 42 for the sixth wicket before
the latter was brilliantly caught by Clayton Lambert off a snorter
from Mervyn Dillon.
	   The West Indian frontline trio of Dillon, Courtney Walsh and
Franklyn Rose had their work cut out. Dillon excelled to take 3-53
from 14 overs, bowling out Loots Bosman and Willie Dry.
	   The loss of these two plus mainstays Martyn Gidley (28) and Piet
Barnard (58) put the skids under the innings which had been given a
41-run boost by Gidley and captain Mickey Arthur.
	   Trapped leg before by Rose's fourth ball after lunch without
having added to his score, Gidley batted for just on two hours and
struck four by fours.
	   West Indian paceman Curtly Ambrose, who had a toenail removed
Friday, is not playing this match, along with wicketkeeper Junior
Murray and legspinner Dinanath Ramnarine.
	   The West Indies team also includes Shivnarine Chanderpaul, and
Nixon McLean, Stuart Williams, captain Brian Lara, Darren Ganga and
Ridley Jacobs.
	   The Griquas team includes Wendell Bossenger, Deon Kruis, Adri
Swanepoel and twelfth man Zahir Abrahim.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh stands to break the
record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcom Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test
wickets.
	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's exhibition
against a Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play
after the team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

Balcony collapses at wedding reception, killing one, injuring 25
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A balcony laden with wedding guests in a
Nile Delta village collapsed, killing a 12-year-old boy, police
officials said Saturday.
	   Another 25 people, mainly guests, were injured by the collapse
on Friday night in Mit Antar, Dakahliya province, about 120 km (74
miles) northeast of Cairo, the officials said.
	   Four of the injured are in critical condition in hospital, the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   About 15 guests were on the balcony of the bride's house when it
fell on top of other guests and people in the street below, the
officials said.
	   The accident is being investigated. Building collapses are not
uncommon in Egypt, where many structures have been erected without
full compliance with established standards.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis, police
fired shots into the air to disperse thousands of people
demonstrating against the Malaysian government.
	   It was the first time that security forces have fired shots
since anti-government protests began with the dismissal of Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2, triggering social unrest.
	   Defying thousands of police and security officers stationed in
Kuala Lumpur during the international meeting, 3,000 people rallied
downtown to criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Shouting slogans and carrying banners saying ``Mahathir is power
crazy,'' the protesters criticized his treatment of Anwar, who was
fired and then jailed after launching a nationwide anti-Mahathir
reform movement.
	   The crowd scattered when several undercover police opened fire,
but some protesters chased the officers down a road of the
residential neighborhood, witnesses said.
	   Two bystanders were grabbed by the crowd and beaten, but were
released when the demonstrators realized they weren't the officers
who had fired their guns.
	   The neighborhood is close to where U.S. President Bill Clinton
and other leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
are to stay for their annual meetings later this week.
	   Mahathir is determined to prevent Anwar's struggle from becoming
a focus of the APEC summit. But as officials from the many foreign
governments met over the weekend to prepare for it, several
officials went out of their way to sympathize with Anwar.
	   Two top Canadian officials met Saturday with his wife, Azizah
Ismail, who has become the de facto leader of his pro-reform
movement since he was jailed and put on trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and its trade
minister, Sergio Marchi, invited Azizah to lunch between their
meetings with other APEC officials.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy said after the luncheon.
	   He said the meeting with Azizah took place at the request of
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Afterward, Axworthy said, he
told Malaysia's foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, that
Canada is concerned that Anwar receive a fair trial.
	   Anwar has claimed he was beaten by police before his trial
started. Pictures of him walking into his trial with a black eye
have been seen in newspapers and television broadcasts around the
world.
	   Some APEC leaders, including Clinton, have said they won't meet
privately with Mahathir during the summit because of what has
happened in Malaysia.
	   Chretien, the host of last year's APEC summit, said in Singapore
on Saturday that he would discuss Anwar's treatment directly with
Mahathir during his visit to Malaysia.
	   Azizah also plans to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who arrived in Malaysia Saturday night to participate in
the meetings before the APEC summit.
	   The Malaysian government said Albright should not meddle in
Malaysia's internal affairs by meeting with Azizah.
	   Abdullah said Albright ``will be here as a guest and she should
know what to do.'' Speaking to Malaysia's government news agency,
he also said: ``Foreign officials and leaders attending the APEC
meetings should not interfere in Malaysia's affairs.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was to arrive in
Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah, too.
	   In the meantime, APEC Cabinet ministers met Saturday to discuss
a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade, but
Japan and the United States remained deeply divided over a key
provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in decades.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut tariffs in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and fish
_ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   A Japanese news agency, which obtained a draft of the APEC
group's final statement, reported Saturday that it urged APEC to
deal urgently with the global crisis and to closely examine the
operations of the world's secretive and risky hedge funds.
	   Investments by the funds have been blamed for some of the wild
fluctuations in Asia's currency and stock markets.
	   Mahathir said in an interview with a government news agency that
he will take his biggest pet complaint to APEC leaders: currency
speculators. Mahathir has made it clear that international controls
on foreign currency trading will be on the agenda of the APEC
summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' Mahathir said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

NATO expels Serbia's nationalist deputy premier from Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A top Serbian politician
left Bosnia on Saturday on orders from NATO peacekeepers, who told
him he was not welcome. There was also conflict over who should
head the Bosnian Serb government.
	   Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj, an ally of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and a radical nationalist who espouses
a harder line in the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
was told to leave late Friday by NATO troops.
	   They were empowered to expel Seselj by the Office of the High
Representative, the top foreign authority in Bosnia overseeing the
country's postwar development.
	   ``Seselj's activities and statements both during the war and
recently offer clear evidence that his presence in Bosnia would
constitute an activity detrimental to the implementation'' of
peace, the order said.
	   Seselj left the country with a Bosnian Serb police escort early
Saturday after attending an inauguration party for Nikola Poplasen,
the new premier of the Bosnian Serb substate. Poplasen is also a
radical nationalist, allied to the camp of Radovan Karadzic, the
wartime Bosnian Serb leader wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
	   Poplasen won September presidential elections over a moderate
Bosnian Serb supported by world powers involved in Bosnia.
	   Later Saturday, Poplasen proposed fellow nationalist Dragan
Kalinic as premier of the Bosnian Serb entity, to replace Milorad
Dodik, the moderate now holding the post.
	   Dodik is favored by the world powers because of his commitment
to the Dayton accords mandating ethnic harmony, freedom of movement
and other similar goals.
	   But Poplasen said Kalinic would ``continue good cooperation with
the international community and with big Western nations, and
strictly respect the Dayton peace agreement ... to the benefit of
the Serb people without infringing the rights of other ethnic
communities.''
	   The two feuding Bosnian Serb factions, moderates and
nationalists, each hold 32 seats in the 83-seat Bosnian Serb
parliament. Votes from the 19 Muslim and Croat deputies will
probably decide if Kalinic will replace Dodik.
	   But with radicals like Kalinic opposed to ethnic coexistence,
the Croats and Muslims were likely to vote against him.
	   In Sarajevo, the High Representative's office signaled that it
would not permit Kalinic to become premier, saying Dodik was the
only candidate supported by world powers involved in the peace
process. High Representative Carlos Westendorp has the power to
effectively veto any candidate deemed harmful to the peace effort.

Bandits ambush tourists in game reserve, steal belongings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: no names of tourists were made available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISIOLO, Kenya (AP) _ Armed bandits held up a van of foreign
tourists at gunpoint and stole their belongings, including their
shoes, before escaping, the barefoot victims told journalists
Saturday.
	   No one was hurt in the incident.
	   The attack on the tourist van carrying two Britons, two
Canadians, two Swedes, a Chilean and the Kenyan driver occurred at
5:30 p.m. (14:30 GMT) Friday near the central Kenyan town of
Isiolo, 190 kilometers (118 miles) northeast of the capital
Nairobi.
	   The Come to Africa Safaris van was heading toward the Samburu
Game Reserve campsite when three men armed with handguns blocked
their way on the road and signalled for the van to stop, victims
told reporters at the Isiolo police station.
	   Four other robbers were waiting on the roadside.
	   ``The men who were speaking Kiswahili forced me to drive 50
meters (yards) from the main road into the bush where they frisked
us and took all our belongings,'' said driver James Karorey, who
was robbed of 25,000 Ksh (dlrs 415), his watch, clothing and shoes.
	   The tourists said their assailants took everything but two bags
which they were unable to carry.
	   The tourists returned by van to Nairobi Saturday.
	   Isiolo District in Eastern Province is plagued with armed
bandits, many of whom have crossed into Kenya from the neighboring
countries of Somalia and Ethiopia, where hostilities have led to a
proliferation of arms.
	   The tourists blamed tour operators for not warning them of the
security threat in the region, and complained they should have been
accompanied by a police escort.
	   Kenya Wildlife Service Director Richard Leakey told journalists
on Thursday that security had been restored at the parks in Isiolo
and Samburu districts.

Opposition fares well in Senate elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with context; new turnout estimate
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The main opposition party won the
first round of Senate elections and another opposition grouping
came second, exit polls showed Saturday. The results are a
disappointment to the governing Social Democrats
	   Candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party advanced
to the second round in 24 out of 27 districts in the two days of
voting, followed by the four-party center-right coalition led by
the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 17 candidates.
	   The ruling Social democrats came third with 13 candidates,
according to exit polls announced on Czech state radio.
	   Polling stations closed at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), and final results
were expected late Sunday.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were seats of 27 members whose
terms had run out. Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to
win the election outright or face a run-off between the two top
finishers. The run-offs are scheduled for Nov. 20-21.
	   Exit polls indicated none of the candidates gained more than 50
percent of first round vote, meaning that run-off elections will be
necessary in all districts.
	   Turnout was estimated at 30 percent, down from the 50 percent
first announced by elections officials.
	   The Senate vote is in part considered a test of support for
Prime Minister Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His government survived in
Parliament thanks to a pact struck with the runner-up, the
center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   ``I expected we would fare better,'' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
commented on the election results.
	   But the relatively disappointing showing for the governing party
was due less to policies than personalities. The Civic Democrats,
the former governing party, had the better-known candidates for the
seats.
	   The four-member opposition bloc _ in second place _ appeared to
get most support from center-right voters who distrust the Civic
Democrats.
	   The Senate was created as a safety mechanism to ensure the
country could function in case of a constitutional crisis. It can
pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution, should the
200-seat lower house of the parliament be dissolved.
	   Since its formation in 1996, the Senate has been criticized by
all members of the political spectrum for not being effective
enough.
	   Several parties, including the Communists and the
ultra-nationalist Republicans, have even called for its
abolishment.
	   No exit polls were done for local elections, which also took
place also Friday and Saturday.
	   More than 60,000 local posts are at stake. Independent
candidates are expected to dominate the local elections, which have
little bearing on the balance of political power in the country.
Final results are expected Tuesday.

	   The United Nations imposed crippling U.N. economic sanctions
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. Under
the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War a year later, sanctions
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq
has has been disarmed.

BAGHDAD, Iraq: to work.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the country's economy.
	   Such a promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out of the current crisis as
an American attack on the country appeared more and more likely.
	   The news of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by
both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer
little way out of the crisis.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event an attack was launched, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with his
decisions in August and last month to block the searches by U.N.
inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.

BAGHDAD, Iraq: been disarmed.

<TEXT>
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the economy.
	   Such a promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out, as an American attack
appeared more and more likely.
	   The news of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by
both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to lead to
little progress.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event of an attack, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with his
decisions in August and last month to block the U.N. inspectors'
search for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton said the the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs set buildings afire, upturned
cars, looted shops and attacked police officers across the
Indonesian capital Saturday while 20,000 protesters escalated their
pro-democracy campaign and marched peacefully on Parliament.
	   The massive protest came despite the deaths of at least 14
people during the past two days when the military opened fire on
students who repeatedly tried to reach the legislature.
	   Hundreds more were injured in the worst violence in Jakarta
since riots and protests ousted former President Suharto in May.
	   Ignoring demands that he quit, Suharto's successor and former
protege, President B.J. Habibie, went on national television and
called for calm.
	   He accused protesters of wanting to ``overthrow'' his
6-month-old government and ``endanger the unity of the nation and
the people.''
	   Police have summoned several pro-democracy activists for
questioning, legal aid lawyers said. Police could not be reached
for comment on reports that other prominent government critics,
including several retired generals, would also be questioned.
	   Jakarta military chief Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman urged the
city's 11 million residents to stay at home after 10 p.m. for the
next few nights. However, he said no formal curfew would be
imposed.
	   After a series of bloody gun battles on Friday night, troops
finally allowed the students to assemble outside the gates of
Parliament on Saturday.
	   But the focus of their protest, a 1,000-member special assembly
convened by Habibie to reform Indonesia's system of government
while maintaining a political role for the military, had ended its
work 24 hours earlier.
	   Even so, the students demanded to be let inside the empty
legislature. Rows of heavily armed soldiers and lines of razor wire
barred them from moving any closer.
	   Tension eased after Friday's carnage when thousands of marines,
regarded as more disciplined, fairer and not as corrupt as other
sections of the military, replaced many army and police units on
the streets.
	   Suharto, who now lives as a virtual recluse in Jakarta,
criticized Habibie, saying the government should apologize for the
students' deaths and listen to protesters' demands.
	   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed. Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?'' Suharto was quoted as saying by
his half-brother, Probosutedjo, in a report by the official Antara
news agency.
	   In other parts of the capital, riot officers fired warning shots
and tear gas at angry crowds.
	   Military helicopters swooped above the chaos, and armored
personnel carriers were deployed. Palls of black smoke towered over
a shopping area near one luxury hotel only a few hundred meters
(yards) from the heavily guarded state palace.
	   At an emergency Cabinet meeting there, Habibie ordered his
military chief, Gen. Wiranto, to restore order even though critics
hold him responsible for the student deaths.
	   As night fell, rioting still raged in some areas although other
troublespots were brought under control by squads of marines.
Firetrucks were working to put out flames.
	   Opposition leaders and student activists called on Habibie and
Wiranto to quit over the latest carnage, which was also condemned
by international human rights groups.
	   Most of the dead students were killed by plastic bullet wounds
in a series of deadly assaults on Friday night. Security chiefs
deny claims that their personnel fired live ammunition.
	   Three security personnel were among the dead, including one
policeman who was beaten to death by a mob on Saturday.
	   Earlier thousands of anti-government students attended funerals
of slain protesters and pledged to maintain their fight for
democratic change.
	   About 5,000 students gathered at a cemetery for the burial of
Sigit Prasetyo, a 20-year-old student who was shot dead Friday.
They watched as his casket, draped in a red and white Indonesian
flag and a traditional Islamic funeral cloth, was lowered in damp
red earth.
	   The looting and burning on Saturday was reminiscent of the May
riots, which were fueled by discontent over Indonesia's economic
crisis. They also were triggered by the shooting deaths of students
by the military.
	   Buildings were on fire in several areas on Saturday, including
Jakarta's Chinatown, badly hit by rioting last May, when 1,200
people were killed.
	   The Chinese minority, who are prominent in business, are often
targeted during times of civil unrest in Indonesia.
	   Despite the carnage and damage of the past few days, Habibie has
said he will press ahead with reforms passed by the People's
Consultative Assembly.
	   Critics and students said the nation's highest legislative body
stopped short of promised democratic change, even though it backed
a plan to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and agreed to
name Suharto in an anti-corruption decree.
	   Students reject the measure as cosmetic and want an immediate
trial of Suharto.
	   The assembly also did not heed their demand that the military be
banned from politics.
	   Instead, delegates passed a decree calling for the gradual
reduction of military representation in Parliament. At present, the
military appoints 75 lawmakers to the 500-seat Parliament.

	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - Yelena Sokolova surprised Russian
teammate and European champion Maria Butyrskaya to take the lead in
the women's event Saturday with Russians looking to take all four
events at the Nations Cup.
	   Maria Patrova and Alexei Tikhonov won the pairs event over a
weak field, the first of the finals.
	   Later Saturday the men and ice dance events finish with Russian
world champions in the lead. Alexei Yagudin is ahead in the men and
Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov are in first in the ice
dance.
	   Sokolova took the women's short program as Butyskaya faltered on
a few elements in the short program, which counts one-third of the
mark. The long program is Sunday afternoon.
	   Butyrskaya won Skate American two weeks ago and was expected to
take advantage of the absence of Olympic champion Tara Lipinksi and
world champion Michelle Kwan this season.
	   But Butyskaya fell on her opening triple lutz jump and then
barely held a double axel. Her sultry interpretation to a blues
number earned her better artistic marks up to 5.7 but technical
marks as low as 4.8 hurt her.
	   Butyskaya was angry with herself for her fall on the lutz.
	   ``Normally I can do it in my sleep and don't have to think about
it twice,'' she said.
	   The 18-year-old Sokolova, a rising star in the Russian skating
ranks, performed also to a blues number. She nailed her triple
lutz-double toe loop combination and triple loop jumps.
	   The only error was when she stumbled at the end of her footwork
and went into the boards.
	   ``I'm really embarassed about the fall,'' Sokolova said. ``After
the three succsssful jumps, I had mentally finished the program. I
just lost my concentration and suddenly my legs went out under
me.''
	   Still she won six of the nine judges. She was second in Skate
America to Butyrskaya and was seventh at the Olympics.
	   Yulia Lavrenchuk of Ukraine won two judges with a good routine
to Spanish guitars but was third overall, a slight miss on a double
axel costing her.
	   In the pairs event -- the only competition without a European,
world or even national champion -- Petrova and Tikhoonov outclassed
the other five couples although they have been skating together for
less than six months.
	   They performed a clean program which included two impressive
throw triple moves where she completed the rotations easily before
coming down.
	   German veterans Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller were second.
	   Third went to the American team of John and Tiffany Stiegler,
trained by Russian pair legend Irina Rodnina.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Lalique Trophy in Paris next week.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Train workers strike in southern France, bus drivers in the west
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Train workers in the southern port of Marseille
briefly sequestered six railway officials Saturday to dramatize
their four-day strike to demand the hiring of more employees.
	   Train service to and from Marseille was seriously disrupted
Saturday, with only one out of five regional lines running. Traffic
on long-distance routes, however, was normal.
	   The striking workers want the national rail company to hire 30
extra train conductors by the end of the year. Talks on the issue
have failed to produce a solution.
	   During negotiations that began Friday and lasted until early
Saturday, the workers prevented six railway from leaving the room
where the talks were held.
	   The officials were released unharmed Saturday afternoon and new
talks were set for Sunday morning.
	   Meanwhile, bus drivers in the western city of Rennes remained on
strike Saturday, the 11st consecutive day of their protest to
demand a reduction in their work week.

Iraq agrees to resume U.N. inspections, likely averting attack

UPDATES with fuller quotes, ADDS background, minor editing. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspections to
resume without conditions, U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah said
Saturday, likely averting a U.S. military attack.
	   Shah said the Iraqi leadership sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan allowing the work of inspectors from
the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites.
	   ``No conditions have been mentioned in this letter,'' Shah told
a news conference at the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad.
	   ``The main point of the letter ... is that the leadership of
Iraq has decided to resume working with the Special Commission and
the International Atomic Energy Agency and to allow them to perform
their normal duties,'' he said.
	   Shah spoke to reporters minutes after conveying the letter
signed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to Annan. He said all
Security Council members would receive copies of the letter.
	   The Iraqi decision will likely defuse the crisis over arms
inspections that has led to threatened American attacks on Iraq and
a buildup of U.S. military forces in the Gulf.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Friday that Annan
had sent a letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. He said he
didn't know the contents, but Western diplomats said it would
repeat Annan's urgent appeal Wednesday to resume cooperation with
the inspectors immediately.
	   It was understood in Baghdad that the letter contained a
personal pledge by Annan to work for the lifting of U.N. sanctions
on Iraq if the weapons inspectors were allowed to go back to work.
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the country's economy.
	   Such a promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council
pledge, but it could offer Iraq a way out of the current crisis as
an American attack on the country appeared more and more likely.
	   The news of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by
both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer
little way out of the crisis.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event an attack was launched, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam had insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with
his decisions in August and last month to block the searches by
U.N. inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs set buildings afire, upturned
cars, looted shops, and attacked police officers across the
Indonesian capital Saturday while 20,000 protesters escalated their
pro-democracy campaign and marched peacefully on Parliament.
	   The massive protest came despite the death of at least 14 people
during the past two days when the military opened fire on students
repeatedly trying to reach the legislature.
	   Hundreds more were injured in the worst violence in Jakarta

	   He accused protesters of wanting to ``overthrow'' his government
and ``endanger the unity of the nation and the people.''
	   At an emergency Cabinet meeting, Habibie ordered his military
chief, Gen. Wiranto, to restore order.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Habibie ``fully trusts''
Wiranto to take stern action against lawbreakers.
	   Police have summoned several pro-democracy activists for
questioning, legal aid lawyers said. Hariadi Darmawan, head of the
University of Indonesia Alumni Association, was being interrogated
Saturday, association members said.
	   Jakarta military chief Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman urged the
city's 11 million residents to stay at home after 10 p.m. for the

	   The official Antara news agency said that hundreds of troops had
been dropped into a park in central Jakarta to protect the National
Monument there as well as the adjacent state palace, the military's
headquarters and other government departments.
	   Suharto, who lives as a virtual recluse in Jakarta, criticized
Habibie, saying the government should apologize for the students'
deaths and listen to protesters' demands.
	   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed. Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?'' Suharto's half-brother,
Probosutedjo, quoted him as saying in comments reported by Antara.
	   In other parts of the capital, riot officers fired warning shots

Liberian officials apologize for U.S. Embassy shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The Liberian government has apologized
to the United States for a gunbattle that killed at least three
Liberians and injured two Americans just outside the U.S. Embassy,
Liberian officials said.
	   The Liberian statement, which Foreign Minister Monie Captan said
was forwarded to U.S. officials on Friday, described the shooting
as ``unfortunate.
	   ``The government of Liberia has assured the U.S. government that
such an incident will not reoccur,'' Captan told reporters Friday.
	   ``The government of Liberia cherishes a special relationship
with the United States government and will continue to foster the
betterment of that relationship on the basis of mutual respect,''
his statement concluded.
	   Embassy officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
	   The late September shooting occurred as fugitive former warlord
Roosevelt Johnson _ the main rival to President Charles Taylor _
tried to seek shelter at the embassy during gunbattles between his
supporters and government forces seeking to arrest him.
	   As Johnson was trying to convince embassy officials to harbor
him, Liberian commandos opened fire on his group, witnesses say,
killing at least three of his supporters and injuring two American
security officers.
	   While the shooting occurred in a small entranceway just outside
the embassy's main gate, American diplomats said the Liberian
soldiers were standing on the compound's property when they opened
fire.
	   Johnson, who dashed into the embassy during the shooting, was
eventually flown to Nigeria. In the tense days that followed the
shooting, security was significantly heightened at the embassy and
most diplomats were flown to neighboring countries.
	   The apology comes a little over a week after Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for Africa Vicki Huddleston visited Liberia,
telling a press conference that the United States wanted an
apology.
	   Liberia, a nation founded by freed American slaves, was for
years one of the largest U.S. aid recipients and hundreds of
American diplomats filled the sprawling embassy compound. Though
that aid fell off steeply with the end of the Cold War and the
beginning of the Liberian civil war, the United States earmarked
about dlrs 48 million for Liberia last year.
	   Taylor, who was also a warlord during Liberia's brutal
seven-year civil war, was elected president last year. The war
ended in 1996.

Social unrest erupts in Malaysia ahead of APEC summit

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis, police
fired shots into the air to disperse thousands of people
demonstrating against the Malaysian government.
	   It was the first time that security forces have fired shots
since anti-government protests began with the dismissal of Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2, triggering social unrest.
	   Defying thousands of police and security officers stationed in
Kuala Lumpur during the international meeting, 3,000 people rallied
downtown to criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Some of the demonstrators marched to the hotel where U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
were to stay for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
	   ``Clinton, arrest Mahathir! Clinton, save us from Mahathir!''
the crowd screamed as they marched toward the hotel.
	   Albright arrived in the Malaysian capital late Saturday, just as
demonstrators set a police motorcycle on fire in front of the
Renaissance Hotel. Clinton was not due to arrive until Monday.
	   The crowd scattered when several undercover police opened fire,
but some protesters chased the officers down a road of the
residential neighborhood where the protest began, witnesses said.
	   At least two people were beaten by the crowd protesting
Mahathir's treatment of Anwar, who was fired and then jailed after
launching a nationwide anti-Mahathir reform movement.
	   It was the first demonstration since meetings among senior
officials from APEC began meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday.
	   Mahathir had been determined to prevent Anwar's struggle from
becoming a focus of the APEC summit. But as officials from the many
foreign governments met over the weekend to prepare for it, several
officials went out of their way to sympathize with Anwar.
	   Two top Canadian officials met Saturday with his wife, Azizah
Ismail, who has become the de facto leader of his pro-reform
movement since he was jailed and put on trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and its trade
minister, Sergio Marchi, invited Azizah to lunch between their
meetings with other APEC officials.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy said after the luncheon.
	   He said the meeting with Azizah took place at the request of
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Afterward, Axworthy said, he
told Malaysia's foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, that
Canada is concerned that Anwar receive a fair trial.
	   Anwar has claimed he was beaten by police before his trial.
Pictures of him walking into his trial with a black eye have been
seen in newspapers and television broadcasts around the world.
	   Some APEC leaders, including Clinton, have said they won't meet
privately with Mahathir during the summit because of what has
happened in Malaysia.
	   Chretien, the host of last year's APEC summit, said in Singapore
on Saturday that he would discuss Anwar's treatment directly with
Mahathir during his visit to Malaysia.
	   Azizah also plans to meet with Albright.
	   The Malaysian government said Albright should not meddle in
Malaysia's internal affairs by meeting with Azizah.
	   Abdullah said Albright ``will be here as a guest and she should
know what to do.'' Speaking to Malaysia's government news agency,
he also said: ``Foreign officials and leaders attending the APEC
meetings should not interfere in Malaysia's affairs.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was to arrive in
Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah, too.
	   In the meantime, APEC Cabinet ministers met Saturday to discuss
a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade, but
Japan and the United States remained deeply divided over a key
provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in decades.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut tariffs in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and fish
_ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   A Japanese news agency, which obtained a draft of the APEC
group's final statement, reported Saturday that it urged APEC to
deal urgently with the global crisis and to closely examine the
operations of the world's secretive and risky hedge funds.
	   Investments by the funds have been blamed for some of the wild
fluctuations in Asia's currency and stock markets.
	   Mahathir said in an interview with a government news agency that
he will take his biggest pet complaint to APEC leaders: currency
speculators. Mahathir has made it clear that international controls
on foreign currency trading will be on the agenda of the APEC
summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' Mahathir said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspections to
resume without conditions, U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said Saturday,
in a move that could avert a U.S. military attack.
	   Shah said the Iraqi leadership sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan allowing the work of inspectors from
the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency at suspected weapons sites to resume.
	   ``No conditions have been mentioned in this letter,'' Shah said
at a news conference at the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. ``The
main point of the letter ... is that the leadership of Iraq has
decided to resume working with the Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency and to allow them to perform
their normal duties.''
	   Shah spoke minutes after conveying the letter signed by Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to Annan. He said all Security Council
members would receive copies.
	   In New York, Annan said he received the letter from Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, and ``I think it's positive.''
	   When the Security Council meets later Saturday, Annan said,
``they will have this letter before them. They will decide what
next to do.''
	   The Iraqi decision could defuse the crisis over arms inspections
that led to threatened American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of
U.S. military forces in the Gulf.
	   Hamdoon said Friday that Annan had sent a letter to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. He said he didn't know the contents, but
Western diplomats said it would repeat Annan's urgent appeal for
cooperation with the inspectors immediately.
	   It was understood in Baghdad that the letter contained Annan's
personal pledge to work for the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq
if the weapons inspectors were allowed to go back to work.
	   The United Nations imposed crippling U.N. economic sanctions
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. Under
the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War a year later, sanctions
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq
has has been disarmed.
	   Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the economy.
	   Such a promise would be less than a Security Council pledge, but
it could offer Iraq a way out.
	   News of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by both
Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer little
room for maneuver.
	   Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help Saturday in case of
attack, and Iraqis took to the streets in government-organized
demonstrations.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted that he was not trying to create a crisis with
his decisions in August and last month to block the U.N.
inspectors' search for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept positively any
initiative that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   But Clinton said the standoff would only end when Iraq resumed
its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.

Yeltsin to Clinton: Don't use force against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with Foreign Ministry statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed relief
Saturday that Iraq had agreed to resume U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``Moscow considers this an important step toward the settlement
of the situation around Iraq by political means,'' the ministry
said in a statement. It added that Russia maintains ``active
contacts with all concerned capitals and the U.N. secretary
general.''
	   Earlier Saturday, the Kremlin announced that President Boris
Yeltsin had sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton restating
Russia's opposition to the use of force against Iraq.
	   In the message, Yeltsin ``spoke strongly against the use of
force,'' the presidential press service said. He also criticized
Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The message was sent Friday, the Kremlin said.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to play a mediator's role in Iraq's frequent
confrontations with the West, including the latest crisis.
	   Yeltsin told Clinton he hoped that by ``working jointly, we will
be able to ward off the worst and return Baghdad to the path of
compliance with the decisions of the international community.''

	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   In Baghdad Saturday, amid fears of an attack, Iraqis showed
their support for Saddam at government-organized demonstrations.
	   Several hundred Iraqi workers marched from from downtown Tahrir
Square to the headquarters of the U.N. Development Program on the
River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is staying forever.''
	   At a demonstration of the ruling Baath Party at the National
Theater, hundreds of loyalists broke into applause whenever
speakers mentioned Saddam's name.
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles _
part of the government program to defend the capital _ paraded at
the National Stadium in Baghdad.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Religious marriages will carry legal
weight in Poland under a law starting Sunday that eliminates the
communist-era necessity for an additional service before a state
registrar.
	   The decision follows a treaty between Poland and the Vatican
that, among other provisions, called for legal status for religious
marriages.
	   Under the new law, a priest, pastor or rabbi must inform local
registrars of a wedding within five days after the ceremony.
Couples still need registrar certificates that they are free to
marry and are at least 18, the legal age.

	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A lawyer and three of her clients
were charged Friday with conspiring to dispose of property
purchased with money earned through marijuana trafficking.
	   The charges are the first under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1991.
	   Authorities charged lawyer Christine Anderson and her clients,
Indira Ramcharan, Albert Baboolal and Herbert Baboolal, on Friday
evening. They were not required to enter pleas.
	   Anderson said the charges are politically motivated. She had
been a candidate on the United National Congress ticket in 1991.
The party lost that election, but gained power in 1995. By then,
Anderson said she had become disillusioned with the party.
	   Two others _ Pamela Ramcharan and Margaret Baboolal _ are still
being sought by police in the case.

Indonesian president to travel to APEC summit despite riots and

 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie is going ahead
with a trip to the Asia-Pacific summit next week despite deadly
riots and protests in the Indonesian capital, the government said
Saturday.
	   Habibie will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Malaysia on Nov. 17-18, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said.
	   He will travel despite violence across Jakarta on Saturday in
which mobs set buildings afire, upturned cars, looted shops, and
attacked police officers.
	   At least 14 people have been killed in unrest over the last
three days. The violence erupted after clashes between students
protesting for democratic change and security forces.
	   Habibie had considered not going to the APEC summit because of
the treatment of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, who was jailed after campaigning for democratic reform.
Habibie considers Anwar a friend.
	   Habibie canceled a trip to Kuala Lumpur last month out of
concern over Anwar's treatment.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government said Saturday that it
will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume, a move that could
avert a U.S. military attack.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq will allow the work of inspectors
from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites.
	   ``To give an additional chance to achieve justice by lifting the
embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA,'' Aziz said in the letter,
which was read over Iraqi state television.

May 68 leader to head Greens list for European parliament vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Greens on Saturday formally named Daniel
Cohn-Bendit, the former leader of the May '68 student revolt, to
head the party's list of candidates for elections to the European
Parliament in 1999.
	   Cohn-Bendit, who is currently a leading member of the German
Greens, received warm applause at a general Assembly of the French
Greens to announce the party's list for the upcoming European vote.
	   The French Greens already had approved Cohn-Bendit to lead their
list in October, and Saturday's announcement was a formality.
	   Cohn-Bendit, the son of Jewish refugees from Hitler's Germany,
was born and lived in France until he was expelled during the May
'68 student upheaval. He went to live in his parents' hometown of
Frankfurt.
	   Now a partner in government with the Social Democrats, the
German Greens have been far more successful than their French
counterparts, and many French environmentalists some of
Cohn-Bendit's political savoir-faire will rub off on them.
	   The name Cohn-Bendit is a household word in France, where he is
often called Danny the Red, for his shock of unruly red hair.
Cohn-Bendit led the student movement that paralyzed France in May
1968 and ultimately led a weary Gen. de Gaulle to step down as
president the next year.
	   Since then, Cohn-Bendit has served as an aide to the mayor of
Frankfurt before he was elected as a German member of the
Europarliament. He will run as a French citizen in the upcoming
election.
	   The French Greens hope to win 8 percent of the vote in the June
Europarliament elections, compared to 2.9 percent in the previous
vote.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Petrova spelling; Updates with more details, pair

 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - Yelena Sokolova surprised Russian
teammate and European champion Maria Butyrskaya to take the lead in
the women's event Saturday with Russians looking to take all four
events at the Nations Cup.
	   Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov won the pairs event over a
weak field, the first of the finals.
	   Later Saturday the men and ice dance events finish with Russian
world champions in the lead. Alexei Yagudin is ahead in the men and
Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov are in first in the ice
dance.
	   In the pairs event -- the only competition without a European,
world or even national champion -- Petrova and Tikhonov outclassed
the other five couples although they have been skating together for
less than six months.
	   They performed a clean program which included two impressive
throw triple moves where she completed the rotations easily before
coming down.
	   Tikhonov skated in shows for nearly four years but did not give
up his eligible status.
	   ``I think professional shows helped me,'' Tikhonov said. ``But
all this time I missed competing.''
	   Petrova feels the difference between Tikhonov and former
partners.
	   ``He has a lot of experience in skating in front of the public
and he gives me a lot of confidence,'' she said.
	   German veterans Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller were second.
	   Third went to the American team of John and Tiffany Stiegler,
trained by Russian pair legend Irina Rodnina.
	   Sokolova took the women's short program as Butyskaya faltered on
a few elements in the short program, which counts one-third of the
mark. The long program is Sunday afternoon.
	   Butyrskaya won Skate American two weeks ago and was expected to
take advantage of the absence of Olympic champion Tara Lipinksi and
world champion Michelle Kwan this season.
	   But Butyskaya fell on her opening triple lutz jump and then
barely held a double axel. Her sultry interpretation to a blues
number earned her better artistic marks up to 5.7 but technical
marks as low as 4.8 hurt her.
	   Butyskaya was angry with herself for her fall on the lutz.
	   ``Normally I can do it in my sleep and don't have to think about
it twice,'' she said.
	   The 18-year-old Sokolova, a rising star in the Russian skating
ranks, performed also to a blues number. She nailed her triple
lutz-double toe loop combination and triple loop jumps.
	   The only error was when she stumbled at the end of her footwork
and went into the boards.
	   ``I'm really embarassed about the fall,'' Sokolova said. ``After
the three succsssful jumps, I had mentally finished the program. I
just lost my concentration and suddenly my legs went out under
me.''
	   Still she won six of the nine judges. She was second in Skate
America to Butyrskaya and was seventh at the Olympics.
	   Yulia Lavrenchuk of Ukraine won two judges with a good routine
to Spanish guitars but was third overall, a slight miss on a double
axel costing her.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Lalique Trophy in Paris next week.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

BAGHDAD, Iraq: the Americans.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Iraq's letter was a response to a letter from Annan Friday.
	   Hamdoon said Annan's letter appealed to Iraq to resume its
cooperation ``with a promise that Iraq's case would be looked on
favorably and the comprehensive review would be taking place in the
right time.''
	   Iraq had demanded that the Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that the review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the country's economy.
	   A promise from Annan is less than a Security Council pledge, but
offered Iraq a way out of the current crisis as an American attack
on the country appeared more and more likely.
	   The news of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by
both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer
little way out of the crisis.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event an attack was launched, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam had insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with
his decisions in August and last month to block the searches by
U.N. inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   In Baghdad Saturday, amid fears of an attack, Iraqis showed
their support for Saddam at government-organized demonstrations.
	   Several hundred Iraqi workers marched from from downtown Tahrir
Square to the headquarters of the U.N. Development Program on the
River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is staying forever.''
	   At a demonstration of the ruling Baath Party at the National
Theater, hundreds of loyalists broke into applause whenever
speakers mentioned Saddam's name.
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles _
part of the government program to defend the capital _ paraded at
the National Stadium in Baghdad.

Pantani beaming with 1999 Giro course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani, unhappy with the next Tour of
France course, was beaming Saturday at the unveiling of the 1999
edition of Giro d'Italia featuring several tough uphill stages and
two short time trials.
	   According to most cycling experts Italy's 22-stage cycling
marathon, scheduled from May 15 through June 6, fit Pantani, one of
the world's best ``climbers'' who captured both the Tours of Italy
and France this year.
	   Wins in uphill stages were the key to Pantani's double triumph
in the two most prestigious European cycling races.
	   The 28-year-old Italian cyclist joked about the six stages
ending at high altitude in the Alps, saying ``it looks overly tough
even for a climber.''
	   ``There are key stages in the Alps. I hope to be wearing the
pink jersey (of overall leader) in the very last leg,'' Pantani
said.
	   At the recent presentation of the Tour of France Pantani had
lamented the too flat course, suggesting he may skip the French
race next year.
	   Italian organizers announced at a ceremony in a downtown theater
that the 1999 ``Giro'' will start from the ``Valley of Temples'' in
Agrigento, Sicily. The traditional finish was in Milan, in northern
Italy.
	   There will be no against-the-clock prologue, and the first pink
jersey will be awarded following a 162-kilometer (100.4-mile) ride
from Agrigento to Modica.
	   Following three stages in Sicily, cyclist will pedal from the
peninsula tiptoe to the North where the toughest stages are
scheduled in the final days of the race.
	   The 20th and 21st stages include several Alpine passes and the
Giro's highest peak, Passo di Gavia at 2,621 meters.
	   A rest day is scheduled on May 28, with individual
against-the-clock tests of 31 and 45 kilometers (19.2 and 27.9
miles) at Ancona and Treviso in the 9th and 17th stage.
	   Cyclists from 20 teams are going to cover a total of 3,780
kilometers (2,343 miles).
	   Organizers said money prizes will amount to 2.5 billion lire
(dlrs 1.5 million).
	   Mario Cipollini, Italy's top sprinter, said the Giro course
offered a few chances to the sprinters.
	   ``It looks like the publicity of Italian ski resorts,''
Cipollini said smiling. ``I hope to win at Pantani's hometown in
Cesenatico, one of the few flat stages.''
	   Giro organizers did not immediately announce the names of the
top entries as teams will be invited on the basis of the updated
lists of the International Cycling Union in January.

	   The 18-year-old Sokolova, a rising star in the Russian skating
ranks, performed also to a blues number. She nailed her triple
lutz-double toe loop combination and triple loop jumps.
	   The only error was when she stumbled at the end of her footwork
and went into the boards.
	   ``I'm really embarassed about the fall,'' Sokolova said. ``After
the three succsssful jumps, I had mentally finished the program. I
just lost my concentration and suddenly my legs went out under
me.''
	   Still she won six of the nine judges. She was second in Skate
America to Butyrskaya and was seventh at the Olympics.
	   Yulia Lavrenchuk of Ukraine won two judges with a good routine
to Spanish guitars but was third overall, a slight miss on a double
axel costing her.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Lalique Trophy in Paris next week.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

BAGHDAD, Iraq: the Americans.

<TEXT>
	   The United Nations imposed crippling U.N. economic sanctions
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. Under
the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War a year later, sanctions
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq
has has been disarmed.
	   Iraq's letter was a response to a letter from Annan on Friday.
	   Hamdoon said Annan's letter appealed to Iraq to resume
cooperation ``with a promise that Iraq's case would be looked on
favorably and the comprehensive review would be taking place in the
right time.''
	   Iraq had demanded that the Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of inspections, specifically say that the
review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's free
export of oil and have devastated the economy.
	   A promise from Annan is less than a Security Council pledge, but
offered Iraq a way out.
	   News of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by both
Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer room for
maneuver.
	   Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help Saturday in case of
attack, and Iraqis took to the streets in government-organized
demonstrations.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted that he was not trying to create a crisis with
his decisions in August and last month to block the searches by
U.N. inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept positively any
initiative that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   But Clinton said the standoff would only end when Iraq resumed
its cooperation.

No end in sight as teachers continue strike in Suriname
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEO MORPURGO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Teachers rejected a proposal to end
their strike and unionized firefighters refused to turn water hoses
on protesters in the streets as labor unrest continued this week in
Suriname.
	   Umbrella organizations representing both secondary school and
university teachers rejected an offer by Education Minister Karan
Ramsundersingh to mediate the conflict if they would return to
their jobs. The groups immediately said the offer was too little.
	   ``We want tangible results,'' said Wilgo Valies, president of
the Union of College Teachers.
	   Teachers went on strike Nov. 2. Public workers in Suriname, a
former Dutch colony on the northeast coast of South America, have
launched a series of strikes to protest low wages. The average
government worker earns dlrs 78 a week, according to the unions.
	   On Tuesday, dozens of college students pushed past police and
stormed Suriname's education ministry to support teachers' demands
for raises and improvements to schools. They eventually left the
building peacefully.
	   The president of the firefighters union said Saturday that his
members would not use water cannon against demonstrators in the
streets.
	   The newspaper De Ware Tijd reported that Police Chief Carlo
Hunsel had instructed firefighters to spray protesters when
demonstrations resumed Monday.
	   ``I will not lend myself for such action,'' union president John
Seedorf said.
	   The firefighters themselves are threatening a strike in December
if the government does not implement an accord reached with the
union in July.
	   Protesters have been holding daily marches to the presidential
palace and other government buildings for the past week.

Germany deports Turkish juvenile delinquent

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian state officials on Saturday
deported a 14-year-old Turkish juvenile delinquent born and raised
in Germany, after months of legal wrangling over whether the state
should help the troubled boy instead of sending him away.
	   Muhlis Ari, known in the German media as ``Mehmet,'' flew from
Munich to Istanbul, Turkey, accompanied on the plane by three
federal police officials and his 16-year-old girlfriend.
	   The controversy over whether to deport him was a heated issue in
recent elections, with liberals accusing conservatives of using a
family tragedy to show they were cracking down on ``criminal
foreigners.''
	   More broadly, however, the case reflects Germany's angst over
its changing society and its struggle to integrate the foreigners
who make up about one-tenth of the population of 75 million.
	   Despite Ari's long history of fights, vandalism and petty
thefts, critics argued that Germany must take responsibility for
him because he has lived here since birth. Ari considers himself
German and speaks only a little Turkish, his lawyer Alexander
Eberth has said.
	   Eberth was at the Munich airport to say good-bye to the
teen-ager but said the boy's parents were too upset to be there:
``They are completely undone.'' Eberth also said the teen-ager was
calm as he boarded the flight.
	   ``I prepared him for this in recent weeks,'' the lawyer said.
``He's become more mature. He has learned to reflect.''
	   German diplomats in Istanbul will arrange for Ari to meet his
Turkish relatives _ he has an uncle there _ but it remained unclear
where he will live. He may have to live in a juvenile home if his
relatives do not take him in.
	   His girlfriend, whose presence on the flight was a surprise to
German officials, told reporters at the Istanbul airport that she
plans to stay in Turkey for a week before returning to Munich.
	   The ``Mehmet'' debate started this summer, when officials in
deeply conservative Bavaria sought to deport not only the boy but
also his parents, who have lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
	   State officials accused his parents, who have never been in
trouble with the law, of endangering public safety by failing to
raise their son properly.
	   Courts blocked the deportation of his parents, but after a
swift, abbreviated trial, Bavaria's highest court last month upheld
the state's decision to deny Ari a new residency permit, thus
clearing the way for deportation.
	   Ari's lawyer tried to argue that the boy's rights were being
violated, but Germany's highest court rejected his appeal Friday.
	   ``The judges' decision ... may be legally correct, but it is
regrettable as far as promoting a policy of integration'' of
foreigners, said Cem Ozdemir, domestic policy spokesman for the
environmentalist Greens party.
	   With unemployment at over 10 percent, some Germans blame
foreigners for taking jobs. During elections, a strident
anti-foreigner party won an unexpected victory in an eastern state.
And a Forsa poll during the peak of the ``Mehmet'' controversy
found that 52 percent of Germans said there are too many foreigners
in the country.
	   Waves of foreigners flowed into Germany after the fall of the
Iron Curtain. Many new arrivals are refugees from regional
conflicts, taken in by Germany until the situation at home settles
down. There are also ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union
with legal claims to citizenship, and, many fear, criminal gangs
from the former eastern bloc.
	   Of Germany's 7 million foreigners, 2 million are Turkish. Many
of them, like Ari's parents, were among the ``guest workers''
invited here in the 1960s and 1970s.
	   Some Turks boarding the plane with Ari were in full support of
his deportation. ``At home, he will be beaten up by our people,''
said Sedat Yildrim, 43, a shop owner in Munich.
	   A lawsuit seeking to have Ari's residency permit renewed is
still pending, but the high court said Friday the case could
continue even with Ari in Turkey.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech Republic's main
opposition party won the first round of Senate elections and
another opposition grouping came in second, exit polls showed
Saturday, in a blow to the governing Social Democrats.
	   Candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party advanced
to the second round in 24 of 27 districts in two days of voting,
followed by the four-party center-right coalition led by the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 17 candidates.
	   The ruling Social Democrats came third with 13 candidates,
according to exit polls announced on state radio. Results were
expected late Sunday.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were 27 seats. Candidates had
to get a 50 percent majority to win the election outright or face a
runoff between the two top finishers. The runoffs are scheduled for
Nov. 20-21.
	   Exit polls indicated none of the candidates gained more than 50
percent of the first-round vote, meaning that runoffs will be
necessary in all districts. Turnout was estimated at 30 percent,
down from the 50 percent first announced by elections officials.
	   The Senate vote is considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, early general
election in June produced a one-party minority government of Social
Democrats led by Zeman. His government survived in Parliament
thanks to a pact struck with the runner-up, the center-right Civic
Democratic Party.
	   ``I expected we would fare better,'' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
said of the balloting.
	   The relatively disappointing showing for the governing party was
due less to policies than personalities. The Civic Democrats, the
former governing party, had the better-known candidates. The
opposition bloc _ in second place _ appeared to get most support
from center-right voters who distrust the Civic Democrats.
	    &UR; No exit ... PICKUP 9th graf pvs.

Iraq agrees to resume U.N. inspections, likely averting attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, ADDS fuller quotes. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government said Saturday it would
allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume, a move that will likely
avert a U.S. military attack.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq would allow the work of inspectors
from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites.
	   ``To give an additional chance to achieve justice by lifting the
embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA and to allow them to carry out
their normal missions,'' Aziz said in the letter, read over Iraqi
television.
	   U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah earlier told a news conference
in Baghdad that no conditions were mentioned in the letter, which
was a response to a letter Annan sent Friday to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
	   Shah spoke to reporters minutes after conveying Aziz's letter to
Annan. He said all Security Council members would receive copies.
	   The Security Council was scheduled to meet Saturday afternoon.
	   ``They will have this letter before them,'' Annan said in New
York. ``They will decide what next to do.''
	   Asked whether the inspectors would return to Iraq, he replied:
``Once the issue is resolved, that's what I think should happen.''
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the inspectors would
be allowed to return immediately.
	   ``They will be allowed any minute they want to to go back and to
resume their normal work,'' he said in New York. ``From now on it's
up to them to decide when to go back.''
	   Iraqi officials credited Russian and Chinese diplomacy for the
decision to resume the inspections.
	   The United States had beefed up its military presence in the
Gulf in preparation for an attack to force Iraq's compliance. But
Aziz's letter to Annan said that was not a factor in the decision.
	   ``We give this opportunity, not for fear of the aggressive
American campaign and the threats of launching a new aggression on
Iraq, but to show responsibility and as a response to your call and
the call of friends,'' Aziz said.
	   Hamdoon said Annan's letter Friday appealed to Iraq to resume
its cooperation ``with a promise that Iraq's case would be looked
on favorably and the comprehensive review would be taking place in
the right time.''
	   Iraq had demanded that the Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that the review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the country's economy.
	   A promise from Annan is less than a Security Council pledge, but
offered Iraq a way out of the current crisis as an American attack
on the country appeared more and more likely.
	   The news of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by
both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer
little way out of the crisis.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event an attack was launched, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam had insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with
his decisions in August and last month to block the searches by
U.N. inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   In Baghdad Saturday, amid fears of an attack, Iraqis showed
their support for Saddam at the demonstrations.
	   Several hundred Iraqi workers marched from from downtown Tahrir
Square to the headquarters of the U.N. Development Program on the
River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is staying forever.''
	   At a demonstration of the ruling Baath Party at the National
Theater, hundreds of loyalists broke into applause whenever
speakers mentioned Saddam's name.
	   About a thousand young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles _
part of the government program to defend the capital _ paraded at
the National Stadium in Baghdad.

Yeltsin to Clinton: Don't use force against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS thruout to include background, UPDATES with statement
from Iraqi U.N. ambassador &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed relief
Saturday that Iraq had agreed to resume U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``Moscow considers this an important step toward the settlement
of the situation around Iraq by political means,'' the ministry
said in a statement. It added that Russia maintains ``active
contacts with all concerned capitals and the U.N. secretary
general.''
	   Earlier Saturday, the Kremlin announced that President Boris
Yeltsin had sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton restating
Russia's opposition to the use of force against Iraq.
	   The message was sent Friday, the Kremlin said. The day before
that, Yeltsin had written Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, urging him
to back down from his refusal to allow the weapons inspectors do
their job.
	   ``The situation now is such that the threat of using force may
become a reality unless an urgent political solution is found,''
Yeltsin wrote, according to his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to play a mediator's role in Iraq's frequent
confrontations with the West, including the latest crisis.
	   However, unlike previous crises, Russia did not send an envoy to
personally mediate this time.
	   In the letter to Clinton, Yeltsin ``spoke strongly against the
use of force,'' the presidential press service said. He also
criticized Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Yeltsin told Clinton he hoped that by ``working jointly, we will
be able to ward off the worst and return Baghdad to the path of
compliance with the decisions of the international community.''
	   In discussing Iraq's decision to cooperate with the weapons
inspectors, Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon specifically cited
Yeltsin's role ``in trying to reach out to a situation where Iraq's
point of view gets promoted.''

from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites.
	   ``To give an additional chance to achieve justice by lifting the
embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA and to allow them to carry out
their normal missions,'' Aziz said in the letter, read over Iraqi
television.
	   The United Nations imposed crippling U.N. economic sanctions
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. Under
the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War a year later, sanctions
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq
has has been disarmed.
	   U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said earlier in Baghdad that no
conditions were mentioned in the letter, which was a response to a
letter Annan sent Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Friday.
	   Shah spoke to reporters minutes after conveying Aziz's letter to
Annan. He said all Security Council members would receive copies.
	   The Security Council was scheduled to meet later Saturday.
	   ``They will have this letter before them,'' Annan said in New
York. ``They will decide what next to do.''
	   Asked whether the inspectors would return to Iraq, he replied:
``Once the issue is resolved, that's what I think should happen.''
	   Iraqi U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the inspectors could
return immediately.
	   ``They will be allowed any minute they want to to go back and to
resume their normal work,'' he said in New York. ``From now on it's
up to them to decide when to go back.''
	   Iraqi officials credited Russian and Chinese diplomacy for their
decision.
	   The United States had beefed up its military presence in the
Gulf in preparation for an attack to force Iraq's compliance. But
Aziz's letter to Annan said that was not a factor.
	   ``We give this opportunity, not for fear of the aggressive
American campaign and the threats of launching a new aggression on
Iraq, but to show responsibility and as a response to your call and
the call of friends,'' Aziz said.
	   Hamdoon said Annan's letter appealed to Iraq to resume its
cooperation ``with a promise that Iraq's case would be looked on
favorably and the comprehensive review would be taking place in the
right time.''
	   Iraq had demanded that the Security Council, in offering a
comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, specifically say
that the review was designed to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's
free export of oil and have devastated the economy.
	   A promise from Annan is less than a Security Council pledge, but
it offered Iraq a way out as an American attack on the country
appeared more and more likely.
	   The news of the breakthrough came after statements Friday by
both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer
little room for maneuver.
	   Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help Saturday in case of
attack, and Iraqis took to the streets in government-organized
demonstrations.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another
demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and
Israeli flags.
	   In his statement Friday, Saddam made it clear that nothing less
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted that he was not trying to create a crisis with
his decisions in August and last month to block the searches by
U.N. inspectors for hidden weapons.
	   Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending
U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced
demands.''
	   But Clinton said the standoff would only end when Iraq resumed
its cooperation.

Envoys try to pin down Kosovo deal, shootings continue

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. envoy worked Saturday on a
deal to bring lasting peace to Kosovo, a reported shooting
illustrated the long way to go until the end of tensions in the
Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   The Serb Media Center _ which reflects the official Serb view in
Kosovo _ reported that an ethnic Albanian loyal to Serb authorities
was shot to death late Friday by ``Albanian extremists.'' His son
was wounded in the attack, at Prekoluka village in western Kosovo.
	   The two were part of local patrols, organized by the Serbian
authorities seeking to prevent pro-independence Kosovo Albanian
guerillas from taking control of the remote area. They were shot
while at home, and it the report left unclear whether they were
armed.
	   In Pristina on Saturday, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova as part of the ongoing
efforts to mediate a lasting settlement for the province, whose
90-percent ethnic Albanian majority wants independence.
	   Hill said he saw quick movement ahead in the peace process.
	   ``We discussed a political agreement, laid out some dates and
timetables for work ahead,'' he told reporters. ```We are getting
to the point where we need to start thinking about what this
agreement is going to look like, to get all the details down
because things are going to happen very quickly in the coming
weeks.''
	   Heavy fighting in Kosovo stopped with the agreement signed Oct.
12 by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledging a pullback of
Yugoslav army and Serb police from Kosovo and allowing a
2,000-strong international team to verify the pullback.
	   Some violence has persisted, however, as the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe forms the verifying team, and
Serbs and Albanians blame each other for the bloodshed.
	   The American head of the OSCE verifier mission, William Walker,
visited a war-devastated village near Pristina, on his first field
trip in the province. He was accompanied by U.S. senators Tom
Harkin and Frank R. Lautenberg.
	   The government crackdown on the separatists in the province has
left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more. Despite the agreement, the displaced
have been reluctant to return.
	   ``Looking at the destruction I can understand why people haven't
moved back,'' Walker told The Associated Press, adding that much of
the damage was ``random destruction for no military purpose,''
apparently by vengeful Serbs.
	   The deaths of two government soldiers, killed Friday by Kosovo
guerrillas, was ``also senseless violence'' Walker said.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to the October
agreement, but it claims it is respecting a de-facto cease fire and
responding only when attacked. Authorities claim the guerrillas are
provoking fights, hoping for a massive response that would then
lead to new NATO threats of airstrikes against Yugoslav targets.
	   The draft political solution Hill is working on envisages a
broad autonomy for Kosovo Albanians. Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic, rules out full independence for Kosovo and this is also
opposed by world powers because it could only be achieved by
prolonged and spreading war.

return, giving letter to Annan, planned security council meeting &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq will allow United Nations weapons
inspectors to return to Iraq and resume inspections, Iraq's U.N.
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon told U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on
Saturday.
	   Hamdoon met with Annan at the secretary general's house in New
York to deliver a letter from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz that apparently diffused the crisis. The letter said
inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the International
Atomic Energy Agency will be allowed to resume work at suspected
weapons sites.
	   ``They will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to
resume their normal work,'' Hamdoon told reporters at Annan's
house.
	   The Security Council planned to meet at 3:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) to
discuss the situation.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had said previously that
inspections could resume only after the council agreed to start a
review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions that would lead
to the lifting of sanctions. The Security Council had offered to
hold a review once Iraq resumed cooperation, but refused to promise
that it would lead to the end of sanctions.
	   Annan had sent a letter to Iraqi leaders Friday urging them to
resume cooperation before an expected U.S. military strike. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had sent a similar message to Saddam.
	   ``The appeal of the secretary general, which we highly trust,
and the appeal also of the president of the Russian Federation has
helped in trying to reach out to a situation where Iraq's point of
view gets promoted,'' Hamdoon said Saturday. ``We think now we have
had a better hearing for our position and that the council
hopefully will be more positive on the question of the
comprehensive review that hopefully will be leading to the lifting
of the sanctions.''

Social unrest erupts in Malaysia ahead of APEC summit

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis, police
fired shots into the air to disperse thousands of people
demonstrating against the Malaysian government.
	   It was the first time that security forces have fired shots
since anti-government protests began with the dismissal of Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2, triggering social unrest.
	   Defying thousands of police and security officers stationed in
Kuala Lumpur during the international meeting, 3,000 people rallied
downtown to criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Some of the demonstrators marched toward the hotel where U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
were to stay for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
	   ``Clinton, arrest Mahathir! Clinton, save us from Mahathir!''
the crowd screamed.
	   Albright arrived in the Malaysian capital late Saturday, just as
demonstrators set a police motorcycle on fire several blocks from
the Renaissance Hotel. Clinton was due to arrive Monday.
	   The protest began in a nearby residential area, and the crowd
scattered when several undercover police opened fire, witnesses
said. Some protesters chased the officers down a road. The
demonstration ended around midnight (1600 gmt).
	   At least two people were beaten by the crowd protesting
Mahathir's treatment of Anwar, who was fired and then jailed after
launching a nationwide anti-Mahathir reform movement.
	   It was the first demonstration since meetings among senior
officials from APEC began meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday.
	   Mahathir had been determined to prevent Anwar's struggle from
becoming a focus of the APEC summit. But as officials from the many
foreign governments met over the weekend to prepare for it, several
officials went out of their way to sympathize with Anwar.
	   Two top Canadian officials met Saturday with his wife, Azizah
Ismail, who has become the de facto leader of his pro-reform
movement since he was jailed and put on trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and its trade
minister, Sergio Marchi, invited Azizah to lunch between their
meetings with other APEC officials.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes that are going on, and impact on the Malaysian people.
And it's important that APEC addresses some of these issues,''
Axworthy said after the luncheon.
	   He said the meeting with Azizah took place at the request of
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Afterward, Axworthy said, he
told Malaysia's foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, that
Canada is concerned that Anwar receive a fair trial.
	   Anwar has claimed he was beaten by police before his trial.
Pictures of him walking into his trial with a black eye have been
seen in newspapers and television broadcasts around the world.
	   Some APEC leaders, including Clinton, have said they won't meet
privately with Mahathir during the summit because of what has
happened in Malaysia.
	   Chretien, the host of last year's APEC summit, said in Singapore
on Saturday that he would discuss Anwar's treatment directly with
Mahathir during his visit to Malaysia.
	   Azizah also plans to meet with Albright.
	   The Malaysian government said Albright should not meddle in
Malaysia's internal affairs by meeting with Azizah.
	   Abdullah said Albright ``will be here as a guest and she should
know what to do.'' Speaking to Malaysia's government news agency,
he also said: ``Foreign officials and leaders attending the APEC
meetings should not interfere in Malaysia's affairs.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who was to arrive in
Malaysia on Sunday, said he may meet with Azizah, too.
	   In the meantime, APEC Cabinet ministers met Saturday to discuss
a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade, but
Japan and the United States remained deeply divided over a key
provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in decades.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut tariffs in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and fish
_ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   A Japanese news agency, which obtained a draft of the APEC
group's final statement, reported Saturday that it urged APEC to
deal urgently with the global crisis and to closely examine the
operations of the world's secretive and risky hedge funds.
	   Investments by the funds have been blamed for some of the wild
fluctuations in Asia's currency and stock markets.
	   Mahathir said in an interview with a government news agency that
he will take his biggest pet complaint to APEC leaders: currency
speculators. Mahathir has made it clear that international controls
on foreign currency trading will be on the agenda of the APEC
summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' Mahathir said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Glas in top form as France beats Argentina 34-14
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) - Stephane Glas scored two fine tries as
France made a solid but unspectacular start to its World Cup
preparations with a hard-fought 34-14 win over Argentina on
Saturday.
	   Though France's victory was not in doubt after it scored two
tries late in the first half, only two more tries in the last five
minutes set up the convincing winning margin.
	   The Five Nations champion, fielding 12 professionals to
Argentina's five, had to wait until the 26th minute for its first
try.
	   With the scores tied at 3-3, Philippe Carbonneau collected a
10-yard (meter) pass from David Aucagne and stormed 30 yards
(meters) down the touchline to score in the corner.
	   Aucagne kicked a superb conversion to make the score 10-3.
	   Glas, the 25-year-old Bourgoin center, scored the first of his
two tries in the 39th minute, when he charged through two tackles
to score between the posts.
	   But the Pumas fought back, and number eight Pablo Camerlinckx
scored a try to make it 17-8 at halftime.
	   Glas capped a brilliant five-pass French move to score a try in
the 52nd minute.
	   Though Argentina dominated second-half possession, it had few
try-scoring opportunities, and conceded another try in the 87th
minute when Philippe Bernat-Salles capped a strong run to score.
	   With the last move of the match, Franck Comba scored after an
error by the Argentine backs.
	   Aucagne kicked three conversions and a penalty for France, while
Argentine fly half Lisandro Arbizu kicked two penalties.
	   France takes on Australia next Saturday in another test match in
preparation match for the 1999 World Cup.

Norwegian aid group says Sudanese warplanes attacked their
</HEADLINE>
hospital &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norwegian People's Aid said one of their
hospitals in Sudan was bombed Saturday by Sudanese government
warplanes _ killing two and wounding 11 _ hours after the African
nation's foreign minister accused the group of aiding rebel forces.
	   The Oslo-based humanitarian group said the hospital is in the
southern Sudan town of Yei, an area held by the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army, or SPLA.
	   ``In this attack a child was killed. One of the children is
being treated at the hospital. This underscores our point that
innocent civilians are being hit, and not military targets,''
spokesman Paul Giertz said in an interview with Norway's NRK radio.
	   The group's hospitals in Sudan have repeatedly been bombed by
government aircraft.
	   Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail, in Norway as a
guest of the government Friday, accused the group of prolonging
Sudan's 15-year civil war by treating wounded rebel soldiers and
smuggling arms.
	   ``If it hadn't been for the support Norwegian People's Aid gives
to the SPLA and its leader John Garang, he would long since have
had to sit at the negotiating table and we would have had peace,''
the foreign minister was quoted as telling Norwegian reporters late
Friday.
	   Hours later, early Saturday, Sudanese government bombers
attacked the Yei hospital, Norwegian People's Aid said. The group
said it believed the attack was linked to the Sudanese minister's
accusations.
	   The group denied allegations of aiding rebels or smuggling
weapons, and said the only function of its hospitals in southern
Sudan is to help victims of the civil war.
	   Norwegian People's Aid is one of the few humanitarian groups
that openly takes sides in a conflict in principle, as well as for
practical reasons. It believes that working through official
channels, such as the government of Sudan, would hamper relief
efforts in rebel areas.
	   In a recent statement, the group's board said ``Norwegian
People's Aid remains on the side of the people of the south in
their just battle against terror and oppression and for human
dignity and freedom.''
	   Animist and Christian rebels in southern Sudan have fought a
15-year insurgency for autonomy from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north.

	   KIMBERLY, South Africa _ West Indies top bowler Courtney Walsh
limped off the field with a badly sprained ankle shortly after tea
on the start of a four-day cricket match on Saturday against
Griqualand West.
	   The injury _ the latest casualty of an ill-fated tour _ came as
part of the final push to bowl out Griqualand for 271 in 79.2
overs. West Indies had five without loss at the close.
	   The West Indies have this match and another four-day fixture
against Free State before the first test begins Nov. 26.
	   With temperatures soaring to 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees
Fahrenheit), Griqualand survived a middle-order batting crisis
after an inexperienced top order stumbled to 121 for five wickets.
	   B team skipper Findlay Brooker (46), his deputy Andre Botha (20)
and 38-year-old veteran Pat Symcox (38) picked up the pieces.
Tailenders Wendell Bossenger (17 not out) and Adri Swanepoel (18)
completed the restoration.
	   Together Brooker and Botha put on 42 for the sixth wicket before
the latter was brilliantly caught by Clayton Lambert off a snorter
from Mervyn Dillon.
	   Symcox hit five fours in his 38 off 44 balls, and with Brooker
put on another 62 for the seventh wicket off 86 deliveries.
	   Symcox was caught leg behind by part-time legspinner Shivnarine
Chanderpaul, who took over after Walsh's injury.
	   The injury added uncertainty to the West Indies' camp, already
weakened by a toenail removal that put Curtly Ambrose out of action
and severed finger tendons that sent batsman Jimmy Adams home
before play.
	   A spokesman said Walsh's left ankle was badly sprained and it
was uncertain how long he would be out of action.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh had hoped to break
the record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcom Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test

	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's exhibition
against a Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play
after the team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

Brazilian star sidelined with sore knee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A sore knee will keep Brazilian superstar
Ronaldo out of action Sunday for the sixth game in nine Serie A
rounds.
	   Doctors of first-division Internazionale said Saturday that the
young striker still is unfit and will miss Sunday's home match
against Sampdoria of Genoa.
	   ``We hope to have him back to action for the next round (against
Fiorentina on Nov. 22),'' team doctor Piero Volpi said. ``Ronaldo
will devote more to swimming than to soccer in the next few days,
to recover his form.''
	   Suffering from World Cup stress and troubled by tendinitis in
both knees Ronaldo has been often sidelined this season.
	   He suffered the latest injury, a left knee bruise, in last
Sunday's league match against AC Milan.
	   Ronaldo scored Inter's opening goal in a 2-2 draw, before
limping off the field at the end of the first half.
	   Despite his intermittent appearances Ronaldo has scored three
goals in as many league games.
	   Inter's coach Gigi Simoni said the team must learn to live
without Ronaldo, a key to last season's UEFA Cup title and second
place in the Serie A.
	   ``We have been off to an unlucky season start. But we must learn
to live with injuries, and without Ronaldo. His absence must not be
an alibi. We must win without him, while waiting for his
comeback,'' the coach said.

Iraqi ambassador says U.N. inspectors can return to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Annan quotes, background, Hamdoon
quotes, UNSCOM spokesman quote. Council meets at 2030 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspectors to
return to Iraq and resume inspections, Iraq's U.N. ambassador told
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday.
	   Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon met with Annan at the
secretary-general's house in New York to deliver a letter from
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that could diffuse a crisis
that appeared headed toward U.S. military action.
	   The letter said inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and
the International Atomic Energy Agency are free to resume work at
suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
	   ``They will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to
resume their normal work,'' Hamdoon told reporters at Annan's
house.
	   The Security Council planned to meet later Saturday. Annan said
he would present the letter, which he called ``positive,'' at the
meeting. ``They will decide what next to do,'' he said.
	   The spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission responsible for
overseeing the destruction of Iraq's weapons programs, Ewen
Buchanan, said, ``Let's see the letter and see what the council
does.''
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had said previously that
inspections could resume only after the council agreed to start a
review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions that would lead
to the lifting of sanctions. The Security Council had offered to
hold a review once Iraq resumed cooperation, but refused to promise
that it would end sanctions.
	   The United Nations imposed the economic sanctions after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. Under the
cease-fire that ended the war a year later, sanctions cannot be
lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has
abandoned its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.
	   Annan sent a letter to Iraqi leaders Friday urging them to
resume cooperation before an expected U.S. military strike. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had sent a similar message to Saddam.
	   ``The appeal of the secretary-general, which we highly trust,
and the appeal also of the president of the Russian Federation has
helped in trying to reach out to a situation where Iraq's point of
view gets promoted,'' Hamdoon said Saturday.
	   ``We think now we have had a better hearing for our position and
that the council hopefully will be more positive on the question of
the comprehensive review that hopefully will be leading to the
lifting of the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Annan's letter promised to look favorably on Iraq's request to
review sanctions, Hamdoon said.
	   ``The secretary-general was the one who raised the comprehensive
review from the beginning and I think he still believes strongly in
such a review,'' Hamdoon said.

Future of Kurdish rebel group uncertain after leader's detention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish rebel group fighting for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following
the detention in Rome of its founder and leader.
	   Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's
international airport Thursday. Turkey has asked for his
extradition and Ocalan has asked for political asylum.
	   Some believe that without Ocalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal
rebels with an iron fist, his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will
be left in disarray.
	   ``If the head is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow,''
said Cengiz Candar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency
for daily Sabah.
	   But Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a
month, and others contend that the PKK is capable of operating
without him.
	   ``Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the
end of the PKK. The PKK has already been acting like a headless
monster for too long,'' said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language
Turkish Daily News.
	   Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power
struggles within the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK was
beginning to waver.
	   Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party,
PKK, in 1978. The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, mainly
focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also
carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey.
	   Close to 37,000 people died in the conflict.
	   His presence in Europe could also be a blessing in disguise for
the group, forcing the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army
into a political movement. Ocalan seemed to be moving in this
direction before his detention. While living in Damacus, he
increased his meetings with European deputies.
	   This may be the PKK's best option. The Turkish military claims
it has made important battlefield gains and captured the PKK's
second-in-command this year.
	   The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria, which
appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened to
attack it.
	   Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border with Iraq
have also grown lukewarm. The PKK has used their bases in Syria and
Iraq to wage cross-border operations.
	   ``The PKK had two options. Either they choose to fight until
they get control of the area, regardless of what image they project
abroad, or they try to take on a political image. I believe
(Ocalan) wanted to leave the Middle East so he could become a
political figure,'' said Hikmet Tavak, managing director of the
London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV.
	   In Rome, spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully
selected Italy because he felt there was sympathy there for his
cause. They also said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan
would be arriving.
	   There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and
if the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under
more pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority
rights.
	   There are an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. They are
not recognized as an official minority and barred from using
Kurdish in education or broadcasting. Kurdish politicians have been
jailed and groups banned on charges of supporting the PKK.

Envoys try to pin down Kosovo deal, shootings continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy worked Saturday on a
deal to bring lasting peace to Kosovo, but a reported shooting
illustrated the difficulties of quieting tensions in the ethnic
Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   The Serb Media Center, which reflects the official Serb view in
Kosovo, reported that an ethnic Albanian loyal to Serb authorities
was shot to death late Friday by ``Albanian extremists.'' His son
was wounded in the attack in the village of Prekoluka.
	   The two were part of local patrols organized by Serbian
authorities seeking to prevent pro-independence Kosovo Albanian
guerrillas from taking control of the remote area. They were shot
while at home, but the report left unclear whether or not they were
armed.
	   In Pristina on Saturday, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova as part of efforts to mediate
a lasting settlement for the province, whose 90-percent ethnic
Albanian majority wants independence.
	   Hill said he saw quick movement ahead. ``We discussed a
political agreement, laid out some dates and timetables for work
ahead,'' he told reporters. ```We are getting to the point where we
need to start thinking about what this agreement is going to look
like, to get all the details down because things are going to
happen very quickly in the coming weeks.''
	   He did not go into details on the peace plan but suggested it
would involve all-round compromise, saying: ``A lot of people are
going to have to make some accommodation with the other side.''
	   Heavy fighting in Kosovo stopped with the agreement signed Oct.
12 by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who pledged a pullback
of Yugoslav army and Serb police from Kosovo and to allow a
2,000-member international team to verify the pullback.
	   Some violence has persisted, however, as the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe forms the verifying team, and
Serbs and ethnic Albanians blame each other for the bloodshed.
	   The government crackdown on the separatists in the province has
left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more. Despite the agreement, the displaced
have been reluctant to return.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to the October
agreement, but it claims it is respecting a cease-fire and
responding only when attacked. Authorities claim the guerrillas are
provoking fights, hoping for a massive response that would then
lead to new NATO threats of airstrikes on Yugoslav targets.
	   The draft political solution Hill is working on envisages a
broad autonomy for Kosovo Albanians. Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic, rules out full independence for Kosovo and this is also
opposed by world powers who fear border changes in the volatile
Balkans.

Private party for Prince Charles' 50th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Buoyed by a public tribute from his mother and an
improved standing in an opinion poll, Prince Charles celebrated his
50th birthday Saturday in private with friends and his longtime
love, Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   Some 250 guests were invited to the part at Highgrove, Charles'
home in Gloucestershire. The invitation list included the Queen
Sophia of Spain, King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway and ex-King
Constantine of Greece, according to Press Association, the British
news agency.
	   On Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a birthday party at
Buckingham Palace. Rock music mixed with classical; jugglers and
``aliens'' mingled with celebrities; street theatre collided with
harpists, a military band and an opera company. Representatives of
the 400 organizations Charles has been associated with were also in
attendance.
	   The queen toasted her son's ``vision, compassion and
leadership.''
	   ``Charles, tonight's party is a tribute to all that you have
achieved,'' said the queen, who broke tradition by publicly
addressing her son by his first name.
	   ``I can think of no better recognition of your first
half-century than this remarkable gathering.''
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles was not at the palace party, lending
substance to reports that the queen is not happy with the
relationship. Charles' late wife, Princess Diana, had blamed
Charles' continuing relationship with Mrs. Parker Bowles for
undermining their marriage.
	   An opinion poll published Saturday said that three quarters of
the British public believe the heir to the throne would be a ``very
good'' king (24 percent) or ``fairly good'' (50 percent).
	   In the telephone poll of about 1,200 people, published in the
Daily Telegraph, 61 percent of respondents said they consider the
prince a ``well-intentioned but troubled man who seems to be
looking for a role.''
	   Eighty-six percent said they believe he is proving to be a good
father to his two boys, and large majorities think he has been a
positive influence on issues ranging from the environment (86
percent) and youth (78 percent) to race relations (66 percent) and
architecture (68 percent).
	   But only 40 percent thought he should marry Mrs. Parker Bowles,
while 46 percent were opposed.

Norwegian aid group says Sudanese warplanes attacked their
</HEADLINE>
hospital &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norwegian People's Aid said one of their
hospitals in Sudan was bombed Saturday by Sudanese government
warplanes _ killing two and wounding 11 _ hours after the African
nation's foreign minister accused the group of aiding rebel forces.
	   The Oslo-based humanitarian group said the hospital is in the
southern Sudan town of Yei, an area held by the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army, or SPLA.
	   ``In this attack a child was killed. One of the children is
being treated at the hospital. This underscores our point that
innocent civilians are being hit, and not military targets,''
spokesman Paul Giertz said in an interview with Norway's NRK radio.
	   The group's hospitals in Sudan have been bombed by government
aircraft repeatedly.
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail, in Norway as a
guest of the government Friday, accused the group of prolonging
Sudan's 15-year civil war by treating wounded rebel soldiers and
smuggling arms.
	   ``If it hadn't been for the support Norwegian People's Aid gives
to the SPLA and its leader, John Garang, he would long since have
had to sit at the negotiating table and we would have had peace,''
the foreign minister was quoted as telling Norwegian reporters late
Friday.
	   Hours later, early Saturday, Sudanese government bombers
attacked the Yei hospital, Norwegian People's Aid said. The group
said it believed the attack was linked to the Sudanese minister's
accusations.
	   The group denied allegations of aiding rebels or smuggling
weapons, and said the only function of its hospitals in southern
Sudan is to help victims of the civil war.
	   Norwegian People's Aid is one of the few humanitarian groups
that openly takes sides in a conflict in principle, as well as for
practical reasons. It believes that working through official
channels, such as the government of Sudan, would hamper relief
efforts in rebel areas.
	   In a recent statement, the group's board said ``Norwegian
People's Aid remains on the side of the people of the south in
their just battle against terror and oppression and for human
dignity and freedom.''
	   Animist and Christian rebels in southern Sudan have fought a
15-year insurgency for autonomy from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north.

flyhalf Paul Grayson and veteran mid-fielder Jerry Guscott notched
individual records Saturday as England scored a record 110-0 win

	   It was England's biggest win in an international, eclipsings its
previous record total of 60 points, which it achieved against
Japan, Canada and Wales.
	   Back scored four tries, equalling the world try-scoring record
for a forward and becoming the first English forward to score three
or more tries in one international.
	   He could easily have set a new world mark for a forward but
passed to debutant Dan Luger to score in the 54th minute when both
players were unopposed.
	   Grayson smashed the existing England goal-kicking record of
eight, kicking 15 goals in the 80 minutes and missing just one
chance.
	   And center Jerry Guscott became England's second highest
try-scorer by scoring four tries, including a solo effort in the
70th minute to break the 100-point barrier.
	   Guscott, whose last try was against Wales in 1996, scored once
in the first half and three times in the second period to increase
his tally to 22 tries in 53 tests.
	   Pundits had predicted a 100 point win against the Dutch amateurs
and, with a 47-0 lead at halftime, the powerful England
professionals gave themselves every chance to reach the target.
	   The Netherlands played spoiling tactics in the first half, at
one stage restricting England to one try in 13 minutes, before
England settled into its game-plan.
	   Back scored the first try in the 4th minute after England won a
line-out and drove a rolling maul 10 meters upfield against a
powerless Dutch pack.
	   The Dutch consistently made the mistake of committing too many
players to rucks and mauls, leaving their flanks unguarded and
allowing England too many overlaps in broken play.
	   England also dominated the set pieces, particularly the scrums,
where the Netherlands had no chance of matching the strength and
prowess of its well-drilled opponents.

Private party for Prince Charles' 50th birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Retransmits to make writethru &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Buoyed by a public tribute from his mother and an
improved standing in an opinion poll, Prince Charles celebrated his
50th birthday Saturday in private with friends and his longtime
love, Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   Some 250 guests were invited to the part at Highgrove, Charles'
home in Gloucestershire. The invitation list included the Queen
Sophia of Spain, King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway and ex-King
Constantine of Greece, according to Press Association, the British
news agency.
	   On Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a birthday party at
Buckingham Palace. Rock music mixed with classical; jugglers and
``aliens'' mingled with celebrities; street theatre collided with
harpists, a military band and an opera company. Representatives of
the 400 organizations Charles has been associated with were also in
attendance.
	   The queen toasted her son's ``vision, compassion and
leadership.''
	   ``Charles, tonight's party is a tribute to all that you have
achieved,'' said the queen, who broke tradition by publicly
addressing her son by his first name.
	   ``I can think of no better recognition of your first
half-century than this remarkable gathering.''
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles was not at the palace party, lending
substance to reports that the queen is not happy with the
relationship. Charles' late wife, Princess Diana, had blamed
Charles' continuing relationship with Mrs. Parker Bowles for
undermining their marriage.
	   An opinion poll published Saturday said that three quarters of
the British public believe the heir to the throne would be a ``very
good'' king (24 percent) or ``fairly good'' (50 percent).
	   In the telephone poll of about 1,200 people, published in the
Daily Telegraph, 61 percent of respondents said they consider the
prince a ``well-intentioned but troubled man who seems to be
looking for a role.''
	   Eighty-six percent said they believe he is proving to be a good
father to his two boys, and large majorities think he has been a
positive influence on issues ranging from the environment (86
percent) and youth (78 percent) to race relations (66 percent) and
architecture (68 percent).
	   But only 40 percent thought he should marry Mrs. Parker Bowles,
while 46 percent were opposed.

South Africa wins 28-20 from 14 points down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ Andre Venter scored a matchwinning try
in injury time Saturday as South Africa overturned a 14-0 deficit
to beat Wales 28-20 and post its 15th victory in a row.
	   Expected to be overwhelmed by the world champion Springboks, the
Welsh led 20-17 with three minutes to go at Wembley when South
African center Franco Smith kicked his third penalty to tie the
match.
	   Then scrum half Joost van der Westhuizen broke through the Welsh
defense down the right and passed inside to back row forward
Venter, who charged over for his sixth try in South African colors.
	   Although Smith missed the conversion, he scored with a penalty
with the last kick of the match as the Springboks gained a victory
that looked unlikely 26 minutes into the game when the Welsh had a
14-point lead through a try by winger Gareth Thomas and three Neil
Jenkins penalties.
	   Even in defeat, the performance was a boost for a Welsh team led
for the first time by New Zealand coach Graham Henry while the
South Africans looked far short of the team which had appeated
dominant for a year.
	   With Mark Andrews becoming the first South African to make it to
50 international appearances and Gary Teichmann beating Francois
Pienaar's record of 29 games as captain, the South Africans were
expected to take early control at Wembley. Instead they were 14-0
down inside the first 26 minutes.
	   The Thomas try came 10 minutes into the game when a quick
penalty in midfield by Rob Howley had the Springboks retreating.
The ball went through four pairs of hands before the overlapping
Thomas took a pass from fullback Shane Howarth and went over in the
corner. Jenkins missed convertion but Wales led 5-0
	   Jenkins increased the lead to 8-0 in the 15th minute with a 35th
minute penalty after South African hooker James Dalton had been
penalized. And when Dalton was caught offside in the 22nd minute,
the fly half kicked his 600th point in international rugby in his
58th game to stretch the advantage to 11-0.
	   Four minutes later Jenkins made it 14-0 when Henry Honiball
collected the ball from an offside position 35 meters from the
South African line
	   Stunned by the early Welsh drive, the South Africans produced a
long spell of pressure and Andre Snyman and Venter were both held
just short of the line by the strong tackling of centers Scott
Gibbs and Mark Taylor.
	   The South African forward pressure produced a penalty try in the
33rd minute when the Welsh forwards were penalized in a scrum in
front of the posts.
	   A minute later, the Welsh defense was carved open in midfield by
a break from Snyman, who passed inside for Van der Westhuizen and
the scrum half had no one between him and the posts as he ran 30
meters for the score. Franco Smith converted both tries and it was
14-14.
	   The Springboks looked set to score another try just before the
break when they pinned the Welsh back on their own line again but a
stunning tackle by Colin Charvis stopped Johan Erasmus crossing the
line.
	   Then the Welsh broke out strongly with Daffyd James charging
through the South African line and passing out to the overlapping
Thomas, who had 70 meters to go. But South African winger Pieter
Roussow got back to grab the winger and prevent a second Welsh try.
	   Another South African offside handed Wales the lead once more
with the second half only two minutes old as Jenkins kicked his
12th point of the match to make it 17-14.
	   But the Welsh were penalized after the ball broke from a lineout
and Smith kicked the teams level from 35 meters with 30 minutes to
go.
	   Jenkins was short and right of the target from 40 meters in the
55th minute but sent a more difficult angled kick between the posts
from way out on the right to make it 20-17 with 21 minutes to go.
	   The Welsh maintained possession for long spells to protect their
lead but the South Africans looked certain to score a third try
with only seven minutes to go when Snyman and Roussow broke from
their own half, only for Howarth, who switched to Wales after four
performances for New Zealand, to foil them with a try-saving tackle
on the winger 15 meters from his own line.
	   But the Springboks drew level with three minutes to go when the
Welsh were caught offside and Smith kicked his third penalty. Then
came the Venter try to end the Welsh dream of a first ever victory
over South Africa.
	   Lineups:
	   Wales _ Shane Howarth; Gareth Thomas, Mark Taylor, Scott Gibbs,
Daffyd James; Neil Jenkins, Rob Howley; Andrew Lewis, Jonathan
Humphreys, Chris Anthony, Craig Quinnell, Chris Wyatt, Colin
Charvis, Scott Quinnell, Martin Williams.
	   South Africa _ Percy Montgomery, Stefan Terblanche, Andre
Snyman, Franco Smith, Pieter Rossouw; Henry Honiball, Joost van de
Westhuizen; Robbie Kempson, James Dalton, Adrian Garvey, Krynauw
Otto, Mark Andrews, Johan Erasmus, Gary Teichmann, Andre Venter.
	   Referee : Stuart Dickinson, Australia.

Striking museum workers shut Orsay for fifth straight day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Orsay Museum of 19th century art remained
closed Saturday for the fifth straight day, preventing visitors
from seeing a hugely popular exhibition ``Millet-Van Gogh.''
	   Striking museum workers want better working conditions and a
bonus of 1,600 francs (dlrs 290) for the extra work due to the
``Millet-Van Gogh'' exhibition.
	   Museum employees say they are abused by impatient crowds and
have complained about poor security at the museum.
	   The Orsay Museum is a renovated train station on the Left Bank
of the Seine. It houses impressionist paintings as well as special
exhibitions and is one of the city's most popular attractions.
	   The strike is the latest in a wave of social protests which have
closed major Paris attractions this fall, including the Eiffel
Tower and the National Library.

New Zealand Maoris beat Scotland 24-8

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ All Black Adrian Cashmore scored a
try and kicked five goals Saturday as the powerful New Zealand
Maoris beat Scotland 24-8 in a non-capped international at
Murrayfield.
	   Cashmore, one of five All Blacks in the Maoris touring squad,
was devastating at fullback, despite the wet conditions, as he
notched an individual tally of 19 points.
	   The Maoris, unbeated in four seasons, led 9-3 at halftime on
three Cashmore penalty goals.
	   But the Maoris increased the tempo of the game in the second
half and crossed for two tries.
	   Flanker Glen Marsh finished off a long-range attack in the 60th
minute to give the tourists a 19-3 lead and, minutes later,
Cashmore exploited a big gap in the Scottish midfield and sprinted
away for the second touch-down.
	   Scotland fullback Derrick Lee scored all the points for the home
team, kicking a penalty in the first half and a consolation try in
the corner in the closing minutes.

French actress Edwige Feuillere dies at age 91
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French actress Edwige Feuillere, whose career on
the stage and in the movies spanned more than 60 years, has died,
the Comedie Francaise said Saturday. She was 91.
	   Feuillere died Friday in Paris. The Comedie Francaise, France's
most famous theater, will pay homage to her Saturday evening in a
tribute to be read onstage.
	   Born in 1907, Feuillere spent much of her childhood in Italy
before entering the French Academy of Dramatic Art.
	   She made her stage debut at the Comedie Francaise in 1931 and
soon afterward also began to appear in films.
	   Feuillere was voted best French actress in 1946 and also was
awarded a Cesar, the French equivalent of an Oscar, for lifetime
achievement.
	   She appeared in more than 50 films and dozens of plays during
her career.
	   No cause of death or funeral plans were announced.

Graham jeered; Houllier beaten; Dublin scores hat trick
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It was a bittersweet homecoming at Arsenal for
Tottenham's George Graham, a bad beginning for Liverpool coach
Gerard Houllier, and three more goals for Dion Dublin as Aston
Villa stayed on top in England with a 4-1 win at Southampton.
	   The Saturday victory kept Villa on top of the Premier League
with 28 points and set a team record by going unbeaten in 12 games
to open the season.
	   Manchester United moved to second with 25 points with defending
champion Arsenal slipping to third (24). Chelsea, Leeds and West
Ham have 20 points.
	   At Arsenal's Highbury ground, Graham _ who led the Gunners to
six major trophies in his eight years as manager in the 1980s and
early 90s _ was greeted with cheers and jeers in his first game
there as the manager of bitter North London rival Tottenham.
	   Graham had the last laugh as Spurs managed a 0-0 draw in a game
in which the Gunners had the better scoring chances. As Leed's
manager, Graham had received generous applause at Highbury _ but
coaching Tottenham is different.
	   Getting off the team bus he was called ``Judas'' and ``Tottenham
Scum'' by several hundred screaming Arsenal fans.
	   At Anfield, Gerard Houllier's first game in charge at Liverpool
was a 3-1 loss to Leeds as Leeds scored three goals in seven
minutes _ two by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink _ against Liverpool's
abysmal defense.
	   Houllier, the former French national coach, took Thursday when
co-manager Roy Evans stepped down following awful results including
a 3-1 loss last week to Tottenham in the League Cup.
	   At Southampton, Aston Villa crushed Southampton 4-1 behind three
goals from Dion Dublin, who has now scored five in two games since
moving in a 5.75-million pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from
Coventry.
	   Manchester United beat Blackburn 3-2 as Paul Scholes scored
twice and then held off a late rally by the Rovers.
	   At Chelsea, the Blues continued their good run with a 3-0
victory over Wimbledon with goals from Gianfranco Zola, Gustavo
Poyet and Dan Petrescu. It was Poyet's seventh despite be used
mostly as a substitute.
	   In other Premier League games: Charlton 1, Middlesbrough 1;
Newcastle 1, Sheffield Wednesday 1; West Ham 3, Leicester 2.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland pushed its
league-leading point total to 40 with a 2-0 win at Port Vale.
Ipswich held second place (35 points) with a 1-0 win over Barnsley.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division, Rangers stayed on top with 24
points after a 2-1 home win over Aberdeen with goals by Giovanni
Van Bronckhorst and Andrei Kanchelskis.
	   Saturday also signaled the start of the F.A. Cup with 33
first-round matches, many pitting semi-pro teams against clubs from
England's second and third division. The big upset was probably
minnow Bedlington's 4-1 win over second-division Colchester.

Georgian finance minister resigns under fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Georgia's finance minister resigned Saturday,
apparently on orders from President Eduard Shevardnadze, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   Shevardnadze accepted the resignation of Mikhail Chkuaseli, who
had been finance minister for about one year, ITAR-Tass and
Interfax reported. Chkuaseli had been under fire from both the
opposition and the ruling party.
	   He told a news conference in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, that
he should have resigned in September, ``when it became clear that
my economic doctrine would not be implemented.''

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Canadian Pierre Lueders maintained his
supremacy as the best two-man pilot in bobsled, claiming the
season-opening World Cup event.
	   Lueders, an Olympic champion, won Friday's nights event in a
combined time of 1 minute, 52.87 seconds.
	   Germany I, driven by Christoph Langen, finished second in
1:53.12 with the Reto Goetschi-driving Switzerland I taking bronze
in 1:53.11.
	   Lueders and brakeman Ken LeBlanc had the fastest single run with
a time of 56.30 seconds.
	   ``It feels good to be back in the saddle again since Nagano,''
said the 28-year-old Lueders. ``It's been a year since Ken and I
raced together. I was a little nervous at the start, but I'm very
happy with the result.''

Government promises to crack down on roadblocks as protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Police have been instructed not to
tolerate the common practice of protesters setting up roadblocks to
gain attention, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said Friday.
	   In recent years, the practice has grown as residents disgruntled
about issues ranging from poor roads to lack of utility service to
police brutality have expressed their displeasure by disrupting
traffic. Some enhance the effect by using flaming tires to build
the roadblock, often damaging the highway in the process.
	   Police said there were 207 illegal roadblocks on the island last
year and 126 through the first 10 months of this year.
	   ``People blocking roads must be aware of the consequences of
their actions and they must be prepared to pay the consequences,''
Patterson said. ``The security forces have been told that
roadblocks can't continue.''
	   The tactic leads to tourists missing flights, patients being
unable to get to medical help, businesspeople missing appointments
and other disruptions, Patterson said.
	   Police have been tolerant of the practice in the past, but
Patterson said that would end.

Serbian Movie Wins Best Film Award at Stockholm Festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Serbian director Srjdan Dragojovic's
movie ``The Wounds,'' won the top prize at the Stockholm
International Film Festival Saturday.
	   The movie's main actors, Milan Maric and Dusan Pekic, also
shared the jury's male acting awards.
	   Dragojovic's new movie depicts two young boys living in
Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, during the early 1990's. Both
boys are strongly influenced by series they watch on TV and one of
them shoots the other.
	   It was the second time Dragojevic won the festival's Bronze
Horse. He won in 1996 with ``Pretty Village, Pretty Flame.''
	   Yuri Kinugawa was awarded the best actress award for ``Memory
and Desire,'' a New Zeeland production.
	   French director Gaspar Noe won the award for best debutant for
``Seul Contre Tous'' (Alone Against All) while Dominique Colin's
cinematography in the same movie was also commended.
	   Academy Award winner Chel White won the jury's prize for best
short film for ``Dirt,'' a weird story about a young man who loves
the earth.
	   Veteran Hollywood star Gena Rowlands, guest at the festival, was
honored with a Bronze Horse as a tribute to her career.
	   More than 150 films were screened at the festival, including
Robert Duvall's critically acclaimed ``The Apostle,'' ``Fear And
Loathing in Las Vegas'' directed by Terry Gilliam, Paul Auster's
``Lulu on the Bridge,'' and ``The Acid House'' by Paul McGuigan.
	   Since it started in 1990, the Stockholm International Film
Festival, has showcased more than 800 movies. The ten-day festival
ends Sunday.

Irish thrash Georgia 70-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Flyhalf Eric Elwood scored 20 points as
Ireland ran in 10 tries Saturday in a 70-0 drubbing of Georgia in a
World Cup qualifier at Lansdowne Road.
	   British Lions prop Paul Wallace claimed Ireland's first try in
the sixth minute as the home team set about cementing its
favoritism against the unknown quantity from Georgia.
	   At half-time the Irish led 28-0 but six tries in a 52-point
scoring spree in the second half highlighted the mis-match in the
World Cup qualifying group.
	   Pat Duignan, who was born in Canada and grew up in Australia,
scored a try on debut for Ireland, while replacement back Girvan
Dempsey scored two tries after coming on as a substitute late in
the match.
	   The Georgians seemed content to surrender the biggest match in
their rugby history by taking the unusual step of resting several
leading players, including captain Guya Rushkin.
	   The Georgians next match is Wednesday against Romania in another
qualifier. A win over the more fancied Romanians would give Georgia
a slim chance of qualifying for next year's World Cup.
	   Ireland's next big match is against reigning world champions
South Africa at Lansdowne Road on Nov. 28.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The world community set a
timetable Saturday to flesh out the Kyoto greenhouse treaty, giving
itself until 2000 to come up with real steps to combat global
warming.
	   Two weeks of negotiations dragged beyond their Friday deadline
before the 160 nations mustered sufficient resolve early Saturday
to endorse a ``Buenos Aires plan of action.''
	   In December 1997, the United States and 37 other industrialized
nations agreed in Kyoto, Japan, to binding reductions in their
greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 _ setting a target 5 percent below
1990 levels.
	   Coming 10 months afterward, the Buenos Aires plan signals
renewed political will to take up specific measures to fight global
warming.
	   At stake is one of Earth's most troubling environmental issues:
undue warming of the planet believed to be exacerbated by carbon
dioxide released from burning coal and gas, principally from power
plants and cars.
	   Saturday's agreement sets 2000 as the deadline for settling such
nuts and bolts issues as how to transfer climate-friendly
technology to developing countries and whether developed nations
can buy or trade emissions credits from countries that have more
than met their greenhouse gas reductions.
	   The plan also calls for settling issues of compliance and
whether penalties can be assessed against violators, among other
things.
	   ``Buenos Aires has not only sustained but advanced the momentum
of Kyoto,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, chief U.S. negotiator. ``Serious
hurdles remain to make this workable and complete, but this
agreement today gives us a way to move forward.''
	   ``It's not guaranteed, it's going to be very tough. But this is
a real work plan with real deadlines and a real follow-up
process,'' Eizenstat said.
	   He praised Argentina for announcing Wednesday that it would seek
similar reductions, in what he called a model for the rest of the
developing world.
	   Argentina and Kazakstan said they would voluntarily seek binding
emissions targets like their industrial counterparts.
	   China and India, two developing nations that could surpass the
United States as leading greenhouse gas polluters in the next
century, opposed even talking about voluntary participation by the
emerging world.
	   The United States became the last major industrial country to
sign the protocol on Thursday. But the move was largely symbolic
because Senate ratification is not likely any time soon.
	   The Clinton administration has said it won't ask the Senate to
consider the treaty until developing countries such as India and
China agree to participate _ and that could take years.
	   Peter Jorgensen of the European Union said the agreement was a
step forward.
	   It ``could have been a whole lot worse,'' said Jorgensen,
alluding to tense final hours of talks that capped what had been a
slow-paced summit. ``It's fair to say the outcome of Buenos Aires
is not a total success.''
	   A key issue yet to be resolved is a U.S.-European quarrel over
the trading of emissions credits.
	   The United States seeks unfettered trading of credits with
countries that have more than met their pollution targets, helping
to blunt the cost of cleaning up at home. The European Union wants
limits on trading, saying the priority should be actual greenhouse
gas reductions at home, not just on paper.
	   Environmentalist welcomed the Buenos Aires plan, but said that
the United States, the world's leading greenhouse gas polluter,
must still take more action at home.
	   ``So far, this year has been the warmest on record, and
scientists agree that human activities are affecting the climate,''
said Fred Krupp of the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund.
``Now it's time to turn that talk into action.''

Dutchman Ids Potsman sets new track record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMAR, Norway (AP) _ Dutchman Ids Potsma set a new track record
Saturday when he won the men's 1,500 meter speedskating World Cup
opener in the Viking Ship, clocking 1 minute, 48.82 seconds.
	   Adne Sondral had the previous track record, but the Norwegian
was unable to match Postma and placed second in 1:49.76. Sondral's
previous track record was 0.7 seconds slower than Postma's time.
	   Dutchman Jeroen Straathof came in third with 1:50.20.
	   Kevin Marshall of Canada placed 12th, three seconds behind
Postma in 1:51.56, while KC Boutiette from the United States was
18th in 1:52.27.
	   German skater Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann started this season as
she ended the previous when she won the women's 3,000 meters. The
32-year old timed 4:09.40, 0.32 seconds ahead of teammate Claudia
Pechstein.
	   ``I'm satisfied with the time. The ice was good, but it is
pretty cold her,'' the medal collector Niemann-Stirnemann told the
Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   Tonny de Jong from the Netherlands was third, two seconds behind
Niemann-Stirnemann in 4:11.64, while Canadian Cindy Overland and
American Catherine Raney placed 14th and 15th respectively with
4:21.18 and 4:21.17.

Serbian Movie Wins Best Film Award at Stockholm Festival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling New Zealand 5th graf, ADDS director's name

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Serbian director Srjdan Dragojovic's
movie ``The Wounds,'' won the top prize at the Stockholm
International Film Festival Saturday.
	   The movie's main actors, Milan Maric and Dusan Pekic, also
shared the jury's male acting awards.
	   Dragojovic's new movie depicts two young boys living in
Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, during the early 1990's. Both
boys are strongly influenced by series they watch on TV and one of
them shoots the other.
	   It was the second time Dragojevic won the festival's Bronze
Horse. He won in 1996 with ``Pretty Village, Pretty Flame.''
	   Yuri Kinugawa was awarded the best actress award for ``Memory
and Desire,'' a New Zealand production directed by Niki Caro.
	   French director Gaspar Noe won the award for best debutant for
``Seul Contre Tous'' (Alone Against All) while Dominique Colin's
cinematography in the same movie was also commended.
	   Academy Award winner Chel White won the jury's prize for best
short film for ``Dirt,'' a weird story about a young man who loves
the earth.
	   Veteran Hollywood star Gena Rowlands, guest at the festival, was
honored with a Bronze Horse as a tribute to her career.
	   More than 150 films were screened at the festival, including
Robert Duvall's critically acclaimed ``The Apostle,'' ``Fear And
Loathing in Las Vegas'' directed by Terry Gilliam, Paul Auster's
``Lulu on the Bridge,'' and ``The Acid House'' by Paul McGuigan.
	   Since it started in 1990, the Stockholm International Film
Festival, has showcased more than 800 movies. The ten-day festival
ends Sunday.

Austria says EU doesn't need Israeli assent for peace process role

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria, (AP) _ The European Union's role in the Middle
East peace process does not depend on Israel's agreement, Austria's
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said here Saturday.
	   ``The European Union is giving more than 70 percent of the
international support to the Palestinian people, and we want to
play a political role in the peace process,'' Schuessel said.
	   Schuessel, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating
presidency, was addressing a news conference after separate talks
with Syrian President Hafez Assad and Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa on the third leg of a Middle Eastern tour.
	   Asked if Israel had agreed to an effective EU role, Schuessel
said: ``We are playing the role. This role does not depend on the
others. It depends on our vision, on our political way and our
ability to play the role.''
	   Israel has long resisted a stronger EU role, having often
criticized positions of the EU and some member states as being
pro-Palestinian.
	   The official Syrian Arab News Agency reported Assad as telling
Schuessel that his government wants the EU to play an active role
in the peace process.
	   Schuessel, who is accompanied by the EU's Middle East envoy
Miguel Moratinos, later flew to Beirut, Lebanon. He has already
visited Israel and the Palestinian territories.
	   Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been stalled since early 1996.
Syria insists on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel says the
plateau is essential to its security.

French President Chirac calls on Iraq to cooperate ``without
</HEADLINE>
conditions'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ While Iraq was backing down in its standoff
with the United States over U.N. weapons inspectors Saturday,
French President Jacques Chirac called on Saddam Hussein to resume
``cooperation without conditions'' with the inspectors.
	   ``Only when this cooperation without conditions with the United
Nations has resumed can we say that the crisis has been resolved,''
Chirac told reporters Saturday at Mexico City's Museum of
Anthropology.
	   In a letter Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said his country would allow the
work of inspectors to resume immediately. The inspectors are trying
to verify whether Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Chirac pointed out that the Iraqi move appears to have defused
tensions and praised the work of Annan.
	   ``Once again he played a fundamental role in what I hope will be
the solution to this crisis,'' Chirac said.
	   Chirac is on the last leg of a three-day official visit to
Mexico. Later Saturday he was to head to Guatemala to survey damage
from Hurricane Mitch.

 &UR; Munich wins easily, but Bundesliga rivals also impressive &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga's frontrunner,
coasted again Saturday as Brazilian striker Giovane Elber set up
both scores in a 2-0 victory against VfB Stuttgart.
	   Munich, the Bundesliga's dominant club this season, remained
five points clear by strolling to victory over its southern rival
in front of 63,000 at Olympiastadium.
	   But almost all of Munich's rivals, shaking off early season
slumps, showed again they have returned to form.
	   Second-place Leverkusen blasted FC Nuremberg 3-0 to remain
unbeaten in 10 matches and sixth-place Borussia Dortmund swept to a
3-0 triumph against local rival Schalke to move to seven matches
without a loss.
	   Defending champion and third-place FC Kaiserslautern, patching
up a leaky defense that threatened to sabatoge its season, captured
its fourth straight win Friday by edging Werder Bremen 1-0.
	   Elber, who usually scores the goals, assisted for Stefan
Effenberg in the 48th minute and Iranian Ali Daei in the 90th
against Stuttgart in a match more one-sided than the score
indicated.
	   ``We controlled the match, but we didn't use our chances to
score early,'' said Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
	   Leverkusen was even more impressive, jumping to a 3-0 lead by
the 21st minute on a shot from German national team player Carsten
Ramelow. Afterwards, the team toyed with injury-depleted Nuremberg.
	   Bulky Dutch striker Erik Meijer played a role in all the goals,
including Emerson's 15th minute score, while setting the rout in
motion by connecting himself in the fifth minute.
	   ``Having played so well the last matches, my team was out to
score some goals. But after the quick 3-0, they were more
interested in entertaining the public,'' said coach Christoph Daum.
	   In other contests, Wolfsburg continued its impressive play of
late by edging Hertha Berlin 2-1, Eintracht Frankfurt edged
Hamburger SV 1-0 and MSV Duisburg beat VfL Bochum 2-0.
	   On Friday, Rainer Bonhoff's debut as coach of Borussia
Moenchengladbach ended in a 1-1 draw against Rostock.
	   Dortmund's Thomas Haessler, the veteran German national player,
may finally have escaped the bench as he again played well for his
new team against Schalke.
	   In the 111th version of the Ruhr Valley Derby, Haessler
converted a penalty to close the first half. Defender Alfred
Nijhuis put Dortmund ahead 1-0 in the 14th minute and Andreas
Moeller capped the scoring with seven minutes left.
	   Schalke, despite flashing some good combination play, fell
victim again to its inability to find the net. The side has
generated just 11 goals _ easily a league low.
	   Wolfsburg, climbing from 16th to fifth in just over a month,
captured its fifth straight match against Berlin behind goals by
Andrzei Juskoviak and Krzysztof Novak.
	   Eintracht Frankfurt, which spent last season in the second
division, won an away Bundesliga match for the first time in 25
tries as Thomas Sobotzik scored in the 33rd minute against Hamburg.

Hundreds of Kurds protest Italy's arrest of Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ More than 2,000 Kurds around western
Germany rallied Saturday to protest Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan's arrest in Italy and possible extradition to Turkey.
	   About 1,000 protesters gathered in Sauerbruch and 900 in
Wiesbaden. In Cologne, 400 Kurds protested in the square around the
city's 14th-century cathedral, many of them carrying signs
emblazoned with PKK, the initials of Ocalan's outlawed rebel group,
the Kurdistan Workers Party.
	   Police said the protests were peaceful.
	   Ocalan was arrested on Thursday after stepping off a plane from
Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his
hideout in Syria. His group has been fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. Nearly 37,000 people have died in
the conflict.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.

Future of Kurdish rebel group uncertain after leader's detention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds Italian government denying prior contact in 15 graf
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish rebel group fighting for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following
the detention in Rome of its founder and leader.
	   Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's
international airport Thursday. Turkey has asked for his
extradition and Ocalan has asked for political asylum.
	   Some believe that without Ocalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal
rebels with an iron fist, his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will
be left in disarray.
	   ``If the head is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow,''
said Cengiz Candar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency
for daily Sabah.
	   But Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a
month, and others contend that the PKK is capable of operating
without him.
	   ``Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the
end of the PKK. The PKK has already been acting like a headless
monster for too long,'' said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language
Turkish Daily News.
	   Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power
struggles within the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK was
beginning to waver.
	   Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party,
PKK, in 1978. The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, mainly
focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also
carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey.
	   Close to 37,000 people died in the conflict.
	   His presence in Europe could also be a blessing in disguise for
the group, forcing the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army
into a political movement. Ocalan seemed to be moving in this
direction before his detention. While living in Damacus, he
increased his meetings with European deputies.
	   This may be the PKK's best option. The Turkish military claims
it has made important battlefield gains and captured the PKK's
second-in-command this year.
	   The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria, which
appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened to
attack it.
	   Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border with Iraq
have also grown lukewarm. The PKK has used their bases in Syria and
Iraq to wage cross-border operations.
	   ``The PKK had two options. Either they choose to fight until
they get control of the area, regardless of what image they project
abroad, or they try to take on a political image. I believe
(Ocalan) wanted to leave the Middle East so he could become a
political figure,'' said Hikmet Tavak, managing director of the
London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV.
	   In Rome, spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully
selected Italy because he felt there was sympathy there for his
cause. They also said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan
would be arriving. The Italian government, however, denied having
any prior contact.
	   There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and
if the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under
more pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority
rights.
	   There are an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. They are
not recognized as an official minority and barred from using
Kurdish in education or broadcasting. Kurdish politicians have been
jailed and groups banned on charges of supporting the PKK.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani, unhappy with the next Tour of
France course, was beaming Saturday at the unveiling of the 1999
Giro d'Italia featuring several tough uphill stages and two short
time trials.
	   According to most cycling experts, Italy's 22-stage cycling
marathon, scheduled from May 15 through June 6, is optimimum for
Pantani, one of the world's best climbers who captured both the
Italian and French tours this year.
	   The mountain stages were the key to Pantani's double victory in
two of Europe's three most prestigious races.
	   The 28-year-old Italian joked about the six stages ending in the
Alps, saying ``it looks overly tough even for a climber.''
	   ``There are key stages in the Alps. I hope to be wearing the
pink jersey in the very last leg,'' Pantani said.
	   At the recent presentation of the Tour de France route, Pantani
lamented that it was too flat, suggesting he may skip the French
race next year.
	   Italian organizers announced at a ceremony in a downtown theater
that the 1999 Giro will start from the ``Valley of Temples'' in
Agrigento, Sicily. The traditional finish will be in Milan, in
northern Italy.
	   There will be no prologue, and the first pink jersey will be
awarded following a 162-kilometer (100.4-mile) ride from Agrigento
to Modica.
	   Following three stages in Sicily, the cyclists will pedal north
from the toe in the boot of Italy and face the toughest stages in
the final days of the race.
	   The 20th and 21st stages include several Alpine passes and the
Giro's highest peak, the 2,621-meter (8,593-foot) Passo di Gavia.
	   A rest day is scheduled for May 28, with individual time trials
of 31 and 45 kilometers (19.2 and 27.9 miles) at Ancona and Treviso
in the ninth and 17th stages.
	   Cyclists from 20 teams will cover of 3,780 kilometers (2,343
miles).
	   Organizers said the race's total purse will equal 2.5 billion
lire (dlrs 1.5 million).
	   Mario Cipollini, Italy's top sprinter, said the Giro course
offered a few chances to the sprinters.
	   ``It looks like the publicity of Italian ski resorts,''
Cipollini said smiling. ``I hope to win at Pantani's hometown in
Cesenatico, one of the few flat stages.''
	   Giro organizers did not immediately announce the names of the
top entries, since teams will be invited on the basis of the
updated lists of the International Cycling Union in January.

Russia welcomes Iraqi decision
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS thruout to UPDATE with deputy foreign minister
statement, raise background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian officials expressed relief Saturday that
Iraq had agreed to resume U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We believe that Baghdad has taken an extremely important step,
which has provided an opportunity for a speedy settlement of the
crisis by political methods, excluding the use of force,'' Deputy
Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk said on the Echo Moscow radio
station.
	   He said he hoped the United Nations Security Council will
``respond adequately to this message.'' The Foreign Ministry issued
a statement expressing similar sentiments.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to play a mediator's role in Iraq's frequent
confrontations with the West, including the latest crisis.
	   However, unlike previous crises, Russia did not send an envoy to
personally mediate this time.
	   Earlier Saturday, the Kremlin said President Boris Yeltsin had
sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton restating Russia's
opposition to the use of force against Iraq.
	   The message was sent Friday, the Kremlin said. The day before
that, Yeltsin had written Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, urging him
to back down from his refusal to allow the weapons inspectors do
their job.
	   ``The situation now is such that the threat of using force may
become a reality unless an urgent political solution is found,''
Yeltsin wrote, according to his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   In the letter to Clinton, Yeltsin ``spoke strongly against the
use of force,'' the presidential press service said. He also
criticized Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Yeltsin told Clinton he hoped that by ``working jointly, we will
be able to ward off the worst and return Baghdad to the path of
compliance with the decisions of the international community.''
	   In discussing Iraq's decision to cooperate with the weapons
inspectors, Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon specifically cited
Yeltsin's role ``in trying to reach out to a situation where Iraq's
point of view gets promoted.''

Iraq agrees to resume U.N. inspections, likely averting attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 6-10 to include questions of annex to Aziz
letter. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government said Saturday it would
allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume, a move that will likely
avert a U.S. military attack.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq would allow the work of inspectors
from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites.
	   ``To give an additional chance to achieve justice by lifting the
embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA and to allow them to carry out
their normal missions,'' Aziz said in the letter, read over Iraqi
television.
	   U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah earlier told a news conference
in Baghdad that no conditions were mentioned in the letter, which
was a response to a letter Annan sent Friday to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
	   Shah spoke to reporters minutes after conveying Aziz's letter to
Annan. He said all Security Council members would receive copies.
	   The Security Council was scheduled to meet Saturday afternoon.
One issue that will come up is if an annex that accompanied Aziz's
letter amounts to conditions, which would run counter to the U.N.
requirement that inspections be resumed unconditionally.
	   In New York, a U.S. diplomatic source said he had no assessment
yet on whether the annex amounted to conditions and said the Aziz
document was ``very complicated.'' He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The annex merely states that these are Iraq's positions. In
Aziz's letter he urged that Annan include Iraq's points in a
comprehensive review of arms inspection in Iraq expected once the
inspectors return.
	   The annex says the comprehensive review be carried out within a
short time, ``seven days for example.'' In some cases, Iraq's
positions are watered-down versions of past demands.
	   For example, its insistence that UNSCOM chairman Richard be
fired is reduced to saying Butler and the structure of UNSCOM are
``important matters'' and Iraq hopes the Security Council will
discuss them seriously and ``as soon as possible.''
	   Annan said in New York that next step would be up to the
council. Asked whether the inspectors would return to Iraq, he
replied: ``Once the issue is resolved, that's what I think should
happen.''

Kurdish rebel leader seeks political asylum in Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: for AMS. UPDATES throughout with new material &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hoping to find sympathy for his cause, the leader of
a 14-year Kurdish insurgency in Turkey on Saturday asked for
political asylum in Italy.
	   Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
was arrested when he arrived in Rome from Moscow. He is wanted as a
terrorist in Turkey, which has asked Italy for his extradition.
	   Hundreds of his supporters demonstrated Saturday in Rome, urging
the Italian government to give him asylum. Several leftist
lawmakers are urging the government to grant his request and a
deputy from the Green Party went on a hunger strike in Ocalan's
support.
	   The PKK's political wing, the National Front for the Liberation
of Kurdistan, said Ocalan had chosen Italy as his destination
because he felt he would be treated there with sympathy. Ocalan's
Italian lawyer, Giuliano Pisapia, told the ANSA news agency that
his client had willingly turned himself in when he arrived in Rome.
	   Italian authorities said Ocalan was traveling under a false
passport when he arrived Thursday at the Leonardo da Vinci Airport.
He was picked up on an outstanding Turkish warrant.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   Several factors may have contributed to his choice of Italy.
	   The PKK is a Marxist-inspired movement and may have figured that
Italy's new justice minister, a Communist, would be sympathetic.
And the so-called Kurdish parliament in exile was recently invited
by Italian deputies to meet in Rome.
	   In addition, Italy does not have a death penalty and does not
extradite people to countries where they might face execution.
	   Turkey has a death penalty and is trying Ocalan in absentia for
capital crimes: leading a terrorist organization, threatening the
country's territorial integrity and ordering killings. But Ocalan
is Turkey's most wanted fugitive and Ankara desperately wants his
extradition.
	   Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, said Saturday that
Turkey is ready to assure Italy that Ocalan will not face the death
penalty if he is sent back, and is even considering abolishing
capital punishment if it will expedite the rebel leader's
extradition.
	   ``He's a notorious assassin, the worst terrorist of our
century,'' Batu said in an interview with Associated Press
Television News on Saturday.
	   Ocalan appeared to be running out of places to go when he
arrived in Rome Thursday.
	   He had been living in Damascus before he sought refuge in
Russia. But Turkey apparently forced Syria to oust him by
threatening military action along the Turkish-Syrian border. It
then started pressuring Russia, which never officially admitted
Ocalan was on its territory.
	   Hundreds of Kurds demonstrated Saturday outside the military
hospital in Rome where Ocalan was believed to be in custody. The
National Front for the Liberation of Kurdistan said Kurds from
elsewhere in Europe planned to converge on Rome in the coming days
in a show of support for the rebel leader.
	   Ocalan founded the PKK in 1978 and it turned to armed struggle
in 1984, finding fertile ground among poor Kurds in the
underdeveloped southeast. The Turkish army claims it all but wiped
out the PKK within Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran,
Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani, unhappy with the next Tour of
France course, was beaming Saturday at the unveiling of the 1999
Giro d'Italia featuring several tough uphill stages and two short
time trials.
	   According to most cycling experts, Italy's 22-stage cycling
marathon, scheduled from May 15 through June 6, is optimimum for
Pantani, one of the world's best climbers who captured both the
Italian and French tours this year.
	   The mountain stages were the key to Pantani's double victory in
two of Europe's three most prestigious races.
	   The 28-year-old Italian joked about the six stages ending in the
Alps, saying ``it looks overly tough even for a climber.''
	   ``There are key stages in the Alps. I hope to be wearing the
pink jersey in the very last leg,'' Pantani said.
	   At the recent presentation of the Tour de France route, Pantani
lamented that it was too flat, suggesting he may skip the French
race next year.
	   Italian organizers announced at a ceremony in a downtown theater
that the 1999 Giro will start from the ``Valley of Temples'' in
Agrigento, Sicily. The traditional finish will be in Milan, in
northern Italy.
	   There will be no prologue, and the first pink jersey will be
awarded following a 162-kilometer (100.4-mile) ride from Agrigento
to Modica.
	   Following three stages in Sicily, the cyclists will pedal north
from the toe in the boot of Italy and face the toughest stages in
the final days of the race.
	   The 20th and 21st stages include several Alpine passes and the
Giro's highest peak, the 2,621-meter (8,593-foot) Passo di Gavia.
	   A rest day is scheduled for May 28, with individual time trials
of 31 and 45 kilometers (19.2 and 27.9 miles) at Ancona and Treviso
in the ninth and 18th stages.
	   Cyclists from 20 teams will cover of 3,780 kilometers (2,343
miles).
	   Organizers said the race's total purse will equal 2.5 billion
lire (dlrs 1.5 million).
	   Mario Cipollini, Italy's top sprinter, said the Giro course
offered a few chances to the sprinters.
	   ``It looks like the publicity of Italian ski resorts,''
Cipollini said smiling. ``I hope to win at Pantani's hometown in
Cesenatico, one of the few flat stages.''
	   Giro organizers did not immediately announce the names of the
top entries, since teams will be invited on the basis of the
updated lists of the International Cycling Union in January.

Iraq agrees to resume U.N. inspections, likely averting attack

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government said Saturday that it
will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume, a move that could
avert a U.S. military attack.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq will allow the work of inspectors
from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites.
	   ``To give an additional chance to achieve justice by lifting the
embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA and to allow them to carry out
their normal missions,'' Aziz said in the letter, read over Iraqi
television.
	   The United Nations imposed crippling U.N. economic sanctions
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. Under
the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War a year later, sanctions
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq
has has been disarmed.
	   U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said earlier in Baghdad that no
conditions were mentioned in the letter, which was a response to a
letter Annan sent Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Friday.
	   Shah spoke to reporters minutes after conveying Aziz's letter to
Annan. He said all Security Council members would receive copies.
	   The Security Council was scheduled to meet later Saturday. One
issue likely to arise was the attachment accompanying Aziz's
letter.
	   While the letter itself contained no conditions, the two-page
note reiterates Iraq's terms for a comprehensive review of its
compliance with U.N. resolutions. It wasn't clear whether these
were Baghdad's hopes _ or its demands.
	   The so-called annex merely states that these are Iraq's
positions, saying, for example, that a review of Iraq's compliance
should be carried out within a short time, ``seven days for
example.''
	   And there is a watered-down version of Iraq's call for the
firing of UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler. Iraq now says Butler and
the structure of UNSCOM are ``important matters'' and Iraq hopes
the Security Council will discuss them seriously and ``as soon as
possible.''
	   In New York, a U.S. diplomatic source said he had no assessment
yet on whether the annex amounted to conditions and said the
document was very complicated. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Annan, also in New York, said that the next step was up to the
council. Asked whether the inspectors would return to Iraq, he
replied: ``Once the issue is resolved, that's what I think should
happen.''

Defender Julio Cesar returns to Dortmund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund Saturday signed Julio
Cesar, a former club mainstay, after the defender spent the summer
playing for a Brazilian club.
	   Cesar, 35, was a key defender on the Dortmund teams that played
a prominent role in Europe's international competitions, capped by
the Champions Cup win two years ago.
	   Cesar played from 1994 to last summer for Dortmund, competing in
75 matches and scoring seven goals. His club, Botafogo Rio de
Janeiro, recently was knocked out of the Brazilian championships.
	   Dortmund went into a tailspin after the Champions Cup win,
falling out of international competition, but has bounced back with
a seven-match unbeaten streak in the Bundesliga.

Martin and Johansson gain final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Johansson beating Rusedski. &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Unseeded Todd Martin and Thomas
Johansson tamed Britain's best Saturday to reach the singles final
of the Stockholm Open.
	   Martin rallied from a set down to beat third-seeded Tim Henman
4-6, 6-1, 6-2 in the first semifinal, reaching the championship
match in one of the world's oldest indoor tournaments for the
second time since 1996.
	   Johansson, the highest ranked Swede (No. 18), edged
fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski 7-5, 7-6 (9-7) before a boisterous
sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall.
	   Henman had clinched the seventh berth to the ATP Tour World
Championship in Hanover, Germany, later this month by winning
Friday's quarterfinals. Rusedski needed a victory to clinch the
eighth and last spot.
	   ``It's disappointing, but at least I gave it a shot,'' Rusedski
said. ``It will not be fun sitting as an alternate in Hanover. I
don't see (Yevgeny) Kafelnikov losing in Moscow.''
	   Kafelnikov needs to beat Goran Ivanisevic in front of his
Russian fans in Moscow's ATP Tour event Sunday to secure the eighth
berth in Hanover.
	   Rusedski is the world's leading indoor player this year with 32
victories and he beat top-ranked Pete Sampras to win the Paris Open
last week.
	   But Rusedski, one of the biggest servers in the game, faced a
Swede playing perhaps the best tennis of his life in his favorite
indoor tournament.
	   ``His serve is huge and it's very difficult to return it,''
Johansson said. ``I gambled a little bit today and it paid off. But
I was lucky in the tiebreak.''
	   The Swede, also a big server, broke Rusedski twice in the first
set, the last time for 6-5, and then held to love to close out the
set.
	   Both players held serve throughout the second set, but Johansson
had to claw back from triple break point in the second game.
	   In the tiebreak, Johansson committed a rare double-fault to give
Rusedski a set point at 6-5. The Swede saved it with a forehand
passing shot into the corner. Another forehand winner gave him the
tiebreak 9-7 and the match.
	   Martin, ranked 21st on the ATP Tour, played near flawless tennis
after losing the first set to Henman.
	   ``I was fortunate to get back in the match after I lost the
first set,'' he said. ``I served well. He lost his rhythm.''
	   Martin lost the 1996 final to Thomas Enqvist, another Swede.
	   ``I was killed in that final,'' he said. ``I hope it will be
different this time.''
	   Martin won one ATP Tour event this year in Barcelona on clay. He
also reached the semis in Indianapolis, Vienna and the Paris Open.
	   ``I've played really well on this (European) trip,'' he said.
``It's not something I expected at all. Before Vienna I took some
time off and had not prepared diligently. That week in Vienna gave
me a lot of confidence.''
	   After dropping the opening set, Martin broke Henman twice to
level the match at one set apiece.
	   Martin got off to a perfect start in the decider, breaking
Henman's serve after two straight unforced errors by the Briton.
	   Martin broke Henman again to lead 4-1, the fourth time the
Briton dropped his serve in his last five service games. The
American then held his serve the rest of the way.
	   It was Martin's third victory in four matches against Henman.

Israel, Palestinians welcome diplomatic efforts to end crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Both Israel and the Palestinians Saturday
welcomed signs that a possible military strike against Iraq over
United Nations weapons inspections had been averted.
	   For Israel, any attack against Iraq could have resulted in a
retaliatory attack by Iraq on the Jewish state, as was the case in
the 1991 Gulf War. The Palestinians feared that the Mideast peace
process would suffer in the wake of a United States strike on a
fellow Arab nation.
	   The Iraqi government said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Saturday that it would allow weapons inspectors to
return to their work. The U.N. Security Council was to discuss the
letter later Saturday in New York.
	   ``We are very happy that the crisis has ended in a peaceful
way,'' said senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had urged the United States to
exhaust diplomatic efforts and avoid military action. Palestinians
feared that wide-spread popular support for Saddam Hussein in the
event of U.S. military action, could put Arafat in a difficult
position with the United States, the sponsor of Mideast peace.
	   ``We were apprehensive that it may have a negative impact on the
peace process and the implementation of the (peace) agreement,''
Erekat said. Erekat called on the U.N. to lift seven years of
sanctions on Iraq.
	   Israel had tried to stay-out of the current crisis but urged the
U.N. not to back-down over weapons inspections.
	   ``We welcome any resolution of the conflict without bloodshed,''
said David Bar-Illan, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Since Thursday the Israeli army has been distributing gas masks
to civilians as a precaution against a possible non-conventional
weapons attack by Iraq. Israeli TVs said gas mask centers would
open again Sunday.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads into Israeli cities.
	   Bar-Illan hoped the U.N. inspectors would be able to prevent
Saddam Hussein from acquiring ballistic missiles with
non-conventional warheads.
	   ``We hope that the inspection will proceed, so that the region
will be safe from non-conventional weapons and the means of their
delivery,'' he told The Associated Press.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cast into the political wilderness by President
Boris Yeltsin, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin found
himself under fire Saturday from within his own political
organization.
	   At a meeting of the leadership of the Our Home is Russia party,
Saratov regional Gov. Dmitry Ayatskov criticized Chernomyrdin and
suggested finding a new leader for the party, Interfax reported.
	   It was the latest insult suffered by Chernomyrdin, once the
country's second most powerful man. Yeltsin jettisoned him as prime
minister last spring, then briefly renominated him and cast him
aside again in August.
	   Yevgeny Primakov ultimately became prime minister. Chernomyrdin
set out to mount a presidential campaign for the 2000 election, but
his ratings in polls have not been encouraging, staying well below
10 percent.
	   Ayatskov criticized Chernomyrdin for his presidential quest, and
said Our Home is Russia has suffered from its leader's neglect.
	   ``We need a solution to this problem rather than a display of
presidential ambitions,'' he said.
	   At a news conference following his party's meeting Saturday,
Chernomydin said Primakov stood a good chance of becoming Russia's
next president. However, he was mildly critical of Primakov's
performance so far, saying, ``We want to see a precise program and
results.''
	   Chernomyrdin said Our Home is Russia is ready to join a
right-wing coalition in the 1999 parliamentary elections. While
critical of Yeltsin, he said he hoped the president would not
resign before his term is up in 2000.
	   ``Yeltsin's resignation before his term would play into the
hands of the leftists,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Our Home is Russia is considered a pro-government party that
supports market-oriented economic reforms.

 &UR; Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan: Turkey's number one enemy &QL; 
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey _ Abdullah Ocalan, now in custody in Italy, is
Turkey's most wanted man: the leader of a deadly, 14-year guerrilla
war for Kurdish autonomy that killed thousands of people.
	   Supporters appeared ready to die for this man who ruled through
charisma and an iron fist. Ocalan, 49, was never in the Turkish
battlefield. Instead, he commanded the Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, from outside Turkey.
	   After Ocalan was forced to leave his longtime home in Syria last
month because of Turkey's pressure on Damascus, a dozen Kurdish
militants set themselves ablaze in Turkish prisons and PKK suicide
bombers carried out a series of attacks.
	   Ocalan recruited thousands of young Kurdish men and women. They
lived on rice and water in snow-covered mountains and fought for
him. Over 20,000 died in the battlefield.
	   A college dropout and one of seven children in a poor farm
family, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK in 1978 and
turned to guerrilla warfare in 1984.
	   He schooled his fighters in Marxism and the art of war in camps
in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon and in northern
Iraq. He said the Kurds, ``humiliated for centuries,'' needed to
regain their ``self-esteem.''
	   Ocalan also ordered his rebels to kill Turkish teachers so that
Kurds in the southeast would not have to learn Turkish. But Ocalan
himself reportedly knows little Kurdish and spoke Turkish.
	   Turkish reports have portrayed him as a loutish, mentally
unstable man who uses his power to seduce female followers. A
Turkish TV broadcast showed the mustachioed Ocalan telling a group
of women guerrilla fighters: ``Being with me is an honor.''
	   He separated from his wife Kesire, who joined an opposition
group in 1990s. Ocalan is said to be childless.
	   The Turkish army only recently gained the upper hand in the
struggle against the rebels. But the war has cost thousands of
casualties and billions of dollars.

Lutherans hesitate over accord with Vatican on faith dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Lutheran Federation decided Saturday it
needs further talks with the Vatican before it can sign an accord
aimed at ending a centuries-old dispute with the Roman Catholic
church.
	   ``We want to be sure we understand that we mean the same
thing,'' Bishop Christian Krause, president of the federation's
executive committee, said at the end of a two-day meeting of the
church body.
	   The executive committee instructed the federation's general
secretary, Ishmael Noko, to consult further with the Catholics to
find a way for both churches to sign a 19-page joint declaration
``without reservations.''
	   The committee suggested that ``a brief supplementary statement
might be agreed on,'' Noko said.
	   The federation regards as a central issue the Vatican's position
on the Catholic condemnation of the Lutherans issued more than 400
years ago by the Council of Trent, said Krause. ``That needs to be
clarified.''
	   ``The response from the Roman Catholic church did not make it
possible for us to be aware of what we are signing,'' said Noko.
``So we are seeking that clarity.''
	   Krause, bishop of the regional church based in Brunswick,
Germany, said the Lutherans were as eager as the Catholics that the
declaration be signed soon, but that the Vatican's target for this
year might not be met.
	   ``It is a matter of what we sign,'' he said. ``The truth does
not tolerate any maneuvering. We want to be very sure.''
	   Krause said it was crucial that the 124 member churches of the
federation support the declaration and be kept involved in
discussions.
	   The declaration has been endorsed by the federation's two
largest churches _ the 5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America and the Church of Sweden
	   Krause said he remained optimistic that the document will be
signed.
	   ``Don't rush it. We are in the last phase of a 30-year dialogue,
so what's another six months.''
	   The draft declaration centers on ``justification'' by works or
faith, or how humans achieve salvation.
	   Lutherans maintain salvation depends on the grace of God, but
Catholics say the individuals good deeds also play a role.
	   The declaration says both churches agree that everyone depends
``completely on the saving grace of God for their salvation'' and
that good works flow from that.

	   Text of the letter from Iraqi government to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan regarding agreement to allow
resumption of weapons inspections:
 &UR; H.E. Mr. Kofi A. Annan,
 &UR; The Secretary General of The United Nations
 &UR; New York
	   Excellency:
	   Your letter dated 13/11/1998 addressed to President Saddam
Hussein was presented to a joint meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council and the National Command of the Arab Ba'ath
Socialist Party presided over by His Excellency the President. I
was entrusted with the task of conveying to you the following:
	   1. The goal sought by Iraq from its decisions of 5 August and 31
October was not to sever the realationship with UNSCOM and the IAEA
and to cease the implementation of its obligations ... under
section C of SCR 687. The objective of Iraq is to end the suffering
of its embargoed people and to see the implemenatation of paragraph
22 of SCR 687 as a first step for lifting the other sanctions.
	   2. Due to its trust in you and your good faith, the Government
of Iraq has dealt with your initiative regarding the comprehensive
review. But unfortunately, the deliberations of the Council on the
procedures for carrying out the review did not result in a clear
picture which ensures fairness and objectivity in reaching the
implemention of Paragraph (22) of resolution 687, which represents
the declared objective of the comprehensive review according to
your proposal. It is well known that the main reason for that was
the American position, which does not represent the prevailing
opinion of the Council. That position, contrary to your initiative,
objected continuously to the presentation of any clarity in regard
to the objective of the comprehensive review.
	   3. Despite the assurances that we have received from you and
from many members of the Council that supported the main objective
of the comprehensive review, and despite the confidence we have in
you and in the majority of the Council members and our belief in
your good faith and sincerity, those assurances were not
satisfactory because they did not meet the basics from our point
(of) view.
	   On the basis of what was stated in your letter, and in
appreciation of the content of the letter of President Boris
Yeltsin the President of the Russian Federation and Mr. Yevgeny
Primakov the prime minister of the Russian Federation, and the
positive positions expressed and conveyed to us by China, France,
Brazil, and other States, and in order to give a further chance to
achieve justice by lifting sanctions commencing with the
implementation of paragragh (22) of resolution 687 (1991), the
Leadership of Iraq decided to resume working with the Special
Commission and the IAEA and to allow them to perform their normal
duties in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security
Council and on the basis of the principles which were agreed upon
in the Memorandumn of Understanding signed with you on 23 Febuary
1998.
	   We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive American
campaign and the threat to commit a new aggression against Iraq,
but as an expression of our feeling of responsibility, and in
response to your appeal and those of our friends. We affirm that
the people of Iraq would not relinquish their legitimate right in
having the inequitous embargo lifted and to live normally like
other nations of the world. We will be looking forward to seeing
the outcome of your efforts and the review.
	   Excellency, we rightly believe that if the comprehensive review
were not to be a mere formality and to be free from the influences
of the tendentious purposes, the adoption of the points we conveyed
yesterday, 13/11/1998, to the Ambassadors of Russia, France, and
China, a copy of which I enclose herewith, will render the review
serious, fair and fruitful.
	   We expect that you will continue with your efforts to lay down
the basis and the correct procedures for the review and so as to
commence with as soon as possible.
	   Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest
consideration.
	   (signed)
	   Tariq Aziz
	   Baghdad, 14 November 1998

	   Details of Premier League games:
 &UR; Arsenal 0, Tottenham 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Arsenal had the better chances but couldn't break through a
defense getting stronger each week under the defense-oriented
Graham. Steffen Iversen, Darren Anderton and Chris Armstrong played
well up front and Spurs' defense was led by Swiss Ramon Vega.
Arsenal missed a certain goal when Ray Parlour was shocked by a
tough tackle, and Christopher Wreh missed another late chance for
the Gunners. Graham, the subject of taunts and shouts of ``traitor,
traitor,'' showed little emotion in winning a well-deserved point.
 &UR; Charlton 1, Middlesbrough 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Substitute Phil Stamp got the tying goal for Middlesbrough in
the 74th on a header. Clive Mendonca scored for Charlton in the
37th on a penalty after Paul Gascoigne was called for the foul in
the area.
 &UR; Chelsea 3, Wimbledon 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Gianfranco Zola got Chelsea off on the right foot with a goal in
the 32nd. He immediately raced over to the Chelsea bench and
grabbed a shirt with No. 10 on the back and held it up in tribute
to injured countryman Pierluigi Casiraghi. Casiraghi is likely to
miss the rest of the season with a serious knee injury picked up
last week against West Ham. Gustavo Poyet made it 2-0 for Chelsea
in the 55th and Dan Petrescu got the final goal in the 70th.
 &UR; Liverpool 1, Leeds 3 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Gerard Houllier's debut alone on the bench for Liverpool was a
disappointment as Leeds scored three goals in seven minutes after
Liverpool held a 1-0 lead following Robbie Fowler's penalty in the
68th. Houllier said afterwards his team was ``too frail mentally''
and added that ``all their nightmares had been reawakened.'' Alan
Smith tied for Leeds in the 79th followed by two goals from Jimmy
Floyd Hasselbaink (81st and 86th).
 &UR; Manchester United 3, Blackburn 2 (2-0) &QC; 
	   United ran off to a 2-0 lead on goals by Paul Scholes (32nd) and
Dwight Yorke (44th) and pushed it to 3-0 when Scholes scored his
second (58th). Blackburn rallied to make it close on goals by Dario
Marcolin (65th) and Nathan Blake (74th). Blackburn played with 10
men after Tim Sherwood was sent off on red card in the 48th for
violent conduct.
 &UR; Newcastle 1, Sheffield Wednesday 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Paul Dalglish, the son of fired Newcastle manager Kenny
Dalglish, gave Newcastle a 1-0 lead in the fourth, but Wednesday
equalized in the 80th on Petter Rudi's goal. Newcastle lost a
precious two points at home, and also may have lost striker Alan
Shearer, who went off after the first half with a hamstring injury.
 &UR; Southampton 1, Aston Villa 4 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Dion Dublin scored three and now has five in two matches for
league-leading Villa. Paul Merson got Villa's other goal with
Matthew Le Tissier scoring the other goal for last-place
Southampton. Dublin got his hat trick in the 85th with a tap-in off
a corner kick from Lee Hendrie.
 &UR; West Ham 3, Leicester 2 (1-1) &QC; 
	   Frank Lampard scored twice _ once for his West Ham club and
later on an own goal that made it close for losing Leicester. Muzzy
Izzet gave Leicester a 1-0 lead in the 28th, but Paul Kitson
equalized in the 37th. West Ham went ahead 2-1 on a goal by Steve
Lomas in the 56th. Lampard made it 3-1 in the 76th, and then scored
into his own net in the 87th to give Leicester brief hope.

	   SORIA, Spain (AP) _ An elderly woman who worried relatives by
refusing to answer the telephone or open her front door was found
to be living with about 80 cats.
	   Acting at the request of the woman's niece, Civil Guard officers
in the central Spanish village of San Esteban de Gormaz obtained a
court order and forced their way into the 83-year-old recluse's
home on Saturday.
	   They said they found her in the kitchen surrounded by felines,
Europa Press reported.
	   The woman refused to answer the officers' questions. They took
her away to a hospital.

	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Bermuda's new premier is known for her
autocratic style _ the iron fist and sharp tongue she uses to keep
the more radical elements in her Progressive Labor Party in check.
	   This week, the iron fist grabbed control of Bermuda.
	   On Monday, Jennifer Smith, 51, a former journalist and modern
dance teacher, led her party in crushing one of the longest-serving
democratic governments in the world. Laborites won 26 seats to 14
for the more conservative United Bermuda Party, ending its 30-year
hold on the island's government.
	   Smith's biggest success was in convincing voters that her party,
traditionally seen as lacking economic expertise, could run the
country without running the economy into the ground.
	   Her promise of ``a new Bermuda'' mixed social concern with a
hard-headed approach to business that captured independent black
middle-class voters, who had generally backed the United Bermuda
Party.
	   Smith also cashed in on resentment, particularly among blacks,
of the 7,000 expatriate workers on the island. Bermuda, with 60,000
people and about 60 percent black, is Britain's biggest remaining
colony. Most foreigners work in the booming offshore business
sector and tourism, the twin pillars of the economy.
	   The United Bermuda Party pushed the success of the economy in
its campaign _ but most voters preferred Labor's concentration on
social issues, such as the cost of housing on the 22-square-mile
(57-square-kilometer) island and the emergence of a young black
underclass in a country with one of the highest per capita incomes
in the world, around dlrs 36,000.
	   Outgoing premier Pamela Gordon, an outgoing 42-year-old whose
personal popularity far outstripped Smith's, had put a new emphasis
on social issues during her 18 months in power, but it was seen as
too little, too late.
	   Although Gordon is black, along with most of her Cabinet, her
party failed to overcome the perception that its real concern was
for the island's wealthy, white-dominated business class.
	   Gordon took over from caretaker Premier David Saul, who served
two years following the downfall of 14-year incumbent Sir John
Swan. He fell after staking his political future on a 1995
independence referendum _ an option that was overwhelmingly
rejected by black and white Bermudians alike.
	   Smith took over leadership in 1996 of the Labor Party, which was
founded by activists in 1963 to mobilize the black, working-class
vote in a country that did not remove the last traces of
segregation until the late 1960s.
	   At the party's first victory, Smith thanked Bermuda's young
people, first-time and second-time voters she credited with turning
an expected victory into a landslide.
	   ``Your vote is an endorsement of the vision embraced in our
platform for a new Bermuda,'' she said.
	   Business leaders congratulated the party on its sweeping
victory.
	   ``It's our intention to work as diligently and closely with the
new government as we did with the last one,'' said David Ezekiel,
chairman of the powerful international business division of the
Chamber of Commerce.
	   A key problem facing the new government is a crackdown on tax
havens by the multinational Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, which is backed by powerful drug-fighting nations
that say the offshore industry is being used by drug barons. The
organization is compiling a blacklist of questionable jurisdictions
and Gordon's government had to fight hard to stay off it.

England thrashes Netherlands 110-0; South Africa edges Wales
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England thrashed the Netherlands 110-0 and Ireland
scored 10 tries to beat Georgia 70-0 in World Cup qualifiers
Saturday, but world champion South Africa just edged Wales in
come-from-behind thriller.
	   England set a team record for most points in a match and most in
a half (63).
	   The Springboks overcame a 14-point deficit in the first half
against Wales and then scored a late try to clinch the Wembley test
28-20.
	   In other rugby union internationals Saturday, France toned down
its flamboyant style to ensure a 34-14 win over Argentina at
Nantes, and the New Zealand Maoris beat Scotland 24-8 at
Murrayfield.
	   After losing 96-13 at Pretoria in June, the Welsh were expected
to be easy pickings for a South African team kicking off a possible
record Grand Slam.
	   But new Welsh coach Graham Henry, once touted as a future All
Blacks coach, can take heart from the performance of his new
charges.
	   Wales opened a surprise 14-0 lead in the first half before South
Africa fought back to level the score at halftime.
	   Goalkickers Neil Jenkins and Franco Smith traded penalties in
the second period and Wales was on the verge of a major upset with
a 20-17 lead just minutes from full time.
	   But Springboks lock Andre Venter scored the match winner in
injury time and Smith added a penalty in the final seconds to put
the result beyond doubt.
	   South Africa increased its unbeaten run in internationals to 15.
	   The Springboks are now on track to become the most successful
Test team in history, needing to beat Ireland, Scotland and England
to take the grand slam and a record 18 consecutive wins.
	   At Lansdowne Road, Ireland scored a 70-0 win over the unknown
quantity from Georgia.
	   The Georgians took the unusual step of resting key players to
focus on Wednesday's World Cup qualifier against Romania and were
made to pay the price by a committed Irish unit.
	   Ireland scored 10 tries, with substitute Garvin Dempsey crossing
for two and flyhalf Eric Ellwood kicking 10 goals, but coach Warren
Gatland said the Irish still had plenty of room for improvement.
	   As expected, a professional England team was too powerful for
the Dutch amateurs at Huddersfield in the other World Cup
qualifying mismatch.
	   The English raced to a 47-0 halftime lead, then added 63 points
in the second half to eclipse its previous record total of 60.
	   England flanker Neil Back scored four tries to equal the world
record for the most number of tries in one match by a forward.
	   Paul Grayson almost doubled the England goal-kicking record by
converting 15 goals from 16 attempts, while veteran center Jeremy
Guscott became England's second highest try scorer by crossing for
four tries to lift his career tally to 22.
	   The touring New Zealand Maoris were too strong for the Scots at
at Murrayfield.
	   The Maoris, featuring four All Blacks in the starting team and
one on the bench, wore Scotland's defenses down in wet conditions
and extended a 9-3 halftime lead to a 24-8 win.
	   All Black fullback Adrian Cashmore scored 19 points, through one
try, a penalty and four conversions, to take man-of-the-match
honors.
	   His opposite man, Derrick Lee, scored all Scotland's points via
a first half penalty and a late consolation try.
	   At Nantes, Five Nations champions France scored two tries at the
end of each half to guarantee a win over Argentina.
	   The Tri-Colors scored the opening try in the 26th minute,
through Phillipe Carbonneau, to take a 10-3 lead.
	   Stephane Glas scored his first try in the 39th minute to give
France a 17-3 lead at the break but the Pumas fought back to 17-8
and were dominating the game until Glas scored again in the 52nd
minute.
	   The French crossed for two more tries in the last five minutes,
scored by Philippe Bernat-Salles and Franck Comba, to seal the
result.
	   France plays Australia next Saturday at the Stade de France.

<TEXT>
	   Text of the annex attached to a letter from the Iraqi government
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan regarding agreement to allow
resumption of weapons inspections:
	   First, the goal sought by Iraq from its decisions of 5 August
and 31 October was not to sever the relationship with UNSCOM and
the IAEA and to cease the implementation of its obligations under
section C of SCR's 687 and 715.
	   Second, the objective of Iraq is to end the suffering of its
embargoed people and to see the implementation of paragraph (22) of
SCR 687 as a first step for lifting the other sanctions.
	   Third, Iraq expressed its readiness to engage in the
comprehensive review which had been proposed by the Secretary
General. But, as a result of American pressure, the results brought
about by the consultations of the Council do not ensure an honest
and objective review with the aim of implementing paragraph (22).
	   Fourth, the position of Iraq on the comprehensive review is:
	   1. The comprehensive review be carried out within a very short
time, (seven days for example), after the resumption of UNSCOM and
the IAEA of their normal duties. This is to be without conditions,
(like those mentioned formerly in regard to what is called the
confirmation of Iraq's cooperation).
	   2. The comprehensive review fundamentally concentrates on
paragraph (3) of the concept paper of the Secretary General of 5
October (the three Iraqi questions of 3 August) and emphasizes the
question of evidence.
	   3. The Council be ready to implement paragraph (22) if the
fulfillment of the requirements of section C of SCR 687 is
estabished.
	   4. If the Council sees, through an objective study, that there
are matters which need to be done, a short period be determined for
their completion. Until that completion is reached, the Council
implements measures for lifting or reducing sanctions in proportion
to what has been fulfilled of the requirements of paragraph (22).
Thereafter, the commencement with the implementation of paragraph
(22) immediately upon the completion of the required work.
	   5. The Council assures the legal interpretation of section C of
SCR 687 and that none of its members should impose additional
conditions or restrictions on the implementation of paragraph (22).
	   Fifth, the second phase of the review commences after completing
the conclusions of the first phase.
	   Sixth, the second phase of the review only encompasses the
obligations determined by clear provisions of the resolutions and
no matters be raised contrary to the legal interpretation of the
resolutions.
	   Seventh, the members of the Council and specially the permanent
members abide by international law and the relevant resolutions of
the Council in respect of all matters pertaining to Iraq.
	   Eighth, the question of Butler and the structure of UNSCOM and
its practices are important matters. The Council is to consider
them seriously in order to ensure a good relationship in the
future. We hope that this will be done as soon as possible.
	   Ninth, it is necessary that these assurances be communicated
directly to the leadership in Baghdad either by the Secretary
General or by a delegation from the Council.

Italian expert challenges authenticity of Van Gogh in upcoming

Sotheby auction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian art expert is challenging the
authenticity of a painting by Vincent Van Gogh that could fetch
million of dollars when it goes on auction at Sotheby's in New York
on Monday.
	   The challenge comes in an article in the Nov. 18 issue of the
Italian art magazine ``Quadri e Sculture'' (Paintings &AMP; Sculpture).
The magazine provided an advance copy of the article by Antonio De
Robertis, an expert on Van Gogh and one of several who have
recently begun to question the authenticity of some of the works
attributed to the Dutch painter.
	   De Robertis is among those who have challenged the authenticity
of the ``Sunflowers'' painting bought by the Yasuda Marine and Fire
Insurance Co. for dlrs 39.9 million for in 1987.
	   In the ``Quadri e Sculture'' article, De Robertis says the
painting in the Sotheby's auction, known as ``Les Chaumieres de
Jorgus'' or ``Les Chaumieres a Auvers,'' is a forgery.
	   The painting is part of the Reader's Digest collection, one of
the most valuable corporate collections in the world.
	   Monday's auction of the collection is one of the art world's
most highly anticipated sales.
	   De Robertis said ``Les Chaumieres de Jorgus'' was actually
painted by Dr. Paul Gachet and his son, Paul Jr., from whose
collection it came.
	   Gachet cared for the troubled painter before his suicide in 1890
and Van Gogh gave him a number of paintings. One, a portrait of Dr.
Gachet, sold in 1990 to a Japanese paper magnate for dlrs 82.5
million.
	   De Robertis questions ``Les Chaumieres de Jorgus'' on several
fronts.
	   First, he maintains it does not depict the scent the title
suggests: the farmhouse of a man named Jorgus. Instead, De Robertis
says, it is a scene about 2 kilometers (a mile) away.
	   He goes on to say that the painting is an assemblage of details
from other Van Gogh paintings. The left side, he says, is taken
from the painting ``Vue de Village a Auvers,'' while a figure on
the right side is taken from ``La Ferme en Ete.''
	   De Robertis also says that Van Gogh never mentions the painting
in his own copious letters.
	   Finally, he cites the younger Gachet's own memoirs to point out
what he says is a fatal discrepancy. Gachet himself claimed the
painting was finished on June 9, 1890. But in his memoirs, he says
Van Gogh first saw the farmhouse on July 4.
	   De Robertis urged Sotheby's to postpone the auction until
scholars at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam pass judgment on it.
Francesco Ravel, editor-in-chief of ``Quadri e Sculture,'' said
Saturday that Sotheby's has assured De Robertis that it would
refund the purchase price to the buyer if the museum eventually
rules against the painting.
	   Reader's Digest and Sotheby's were both closed over the weekend
and it was not possible to get comment. Ravel provided AP with a
response to De Robertis which laid out in detail its reasons for
believing the painting is authentic.
	   The French art expert, Benoit Landais, has also cast doubt on
the authenticity of the painting, Ravel said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least four policemen disappeared while guarding
a checkpoint along the Chechen border in Russia's volatile region
of Ingushetia, Russian news agencies said Saturday.
	   Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said he believed the officers
were kidnapped so they could be exchanged for four suspects
arrested recently in an unspecified criminal case, Interfax
reported.
	   Aushev added that authorities were baffled by some aspects of
the case, such as the fact that the officers apparently did not
resist.
	   ``Everything will be clarified in the next few days and our
policemen will be returned,'' he said.
	   Interfax said four officers had been abducted. ITAR-Tass, citing
the Ingush Interior Ministry, put the number at six.
	   The police were on duty Friday night and were gone when another
group of officers came to replace them Saturday morning, ITAR-Tass
said. There were no signs of a struggle at the checkpoint.
	   Ingushetia, a region torn by violence resulting from ethnic
strife with nearby North Ossetia, sits in the mountainous northern
Caucasus. It has also been hit by spill over violence and
kidnappings from breakaway Chechnya, where rebels fought a 1994-96
independence war with Russia.
	   Russian police and border guards have been kidnapped several
times by Chechen raiders.

Iraq backs down over U.N. inspections, likely averts attack

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Faced with the threat of an American
attack, Iraq declared Saturday that U.N. weapons inspections could
go back to work immediately, a move that could defuse the third
crisis in less than a year over arms inspections.
	   Iraq insisted that the threat was not a factor, saying in a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that ``we offer this
chance not out of fear of the aggressive American campaign.''
	   Instead, the letter from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
repeated Iraq's goal that renewed cooperation would ``give a
further chance to achieve justice by lifting sanctions'' imposed on
Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
	   U.S. President Clinton's national security team met Saturday in
Washington to assess the Iraqi promise, and the U.N. Security
Council prepared to meet to decide whether Iraq's stand meets its
demands for unconditionally allowing the inspectors to work.
	   Aziz's letter Saturday capped a flurry of diplomatic activity
over 24 hours _ a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
and the Russian ambassador to Baghdad, public statements by Saddam
and Clinton and crucial letters from Annan and Aziz.
	   In the end, it may have been Annan's personality at the center
of Iraq's reversal. Aziz's letter repeatedly referred to Iraq's
trust in the secretary-general and his ``good faith and
sincerity.''
	   It was Annan who had defused the previous crisis in February
when Iraq blocked the inspectors _ who are responsible for
searching for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _ from visiting
Saddam's palaces.
	   Aziz's message to Annan, however, may still pose a problem.
	   U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah earlier told a news conference
in Baghdad that Aziz's letter put no conditions on the return to
Baghdad of the inspectors, who left Iraq on Wednesday.
	   But a two-page annex reiterated Iraq's previous terms for a
comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N. resolutions. It
wasn't clear whether the Security Council and the United States
would interpret the annex as Baghdad's hopes _ or its demands.
	   In the letter, Aziz urged Annan to ensure that a comprehensive
review would include the points in the annex, which he said ``will
render the review serious, fair and fruitful.''
	   The annex says the comprehensive review be carried out within a
short time, ``seven days for example.'' In some cases, Iraq's
positions are watered-down versions of past demands.
	   For example, its insistence that UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler
be fired is reduced to saying Butler and the structure of UNSCOM
are ``important matters'' and Iraq hopes the Security Council will
discuss them seriously and ``as soon as possible.''
	   Iraq said the points in the annex had been presented in a
meeting Friday with the ambassadors of Russia, France and China _
the three members of the Security Council that have endorsed an
easing of sanctions.
	   The Americans and British are the other permanent members, and
they have been uncompromising in insisting on no easing of the
sanctions unless Iraq fulfills requirements to eliminate its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that all such weapons have been destroyed.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations said inspectors would be
allowed to return to Iraq immediately.
	   ``They will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to
resume their normal work,'' Nizar Hamdoon said in New York.
	   Hamdoon also said that Annan's letter on Friday had promised
``that Iraq's case would be looked on favorably and the
comprehensive review would be taking place in the right time.''
	   Annan called the response from Aziz ``positive.''
	   The United States and Britain had amassed a force in the Gulf to
force Iraq into compliance, and the Iraqi decision seemed to
reflect in part the scant support it received abroad.
	   That was particularly evident in the Arab world, where many
countries had been vociferous in their opposition to an attack
during the last crisis over inspections in February.
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of six Gulf nations joined
Egypt and Syria in issuing a communique warning that ``the Iraqi
government is held responsible for any consequences that might
arise form its refusal to back down'' on weapons inspections.
	   Russia, China and France, as well, were less vocal this time,
although Iraq credited their diplomacy for ending the standoff.
	   Still, Iraq once again brought attention to the U.N. sanctions,
which limit the sale of oil, have devastated Iraq's economy and
made its 22 million people dependent on a U.N. relief program.
Their end has long been the government's priority.
	   Saturday's decision ended a week that witnessed what seemed to
be preparations for an imminent attack.
	   A total of 103 U.N. inspectors were withdrawn to Bahrain amid
fears of a U.S. weapons strike. And about one-third of 450 U.N.
humanitarian workers were evacuated to the Jordanian capital Amman.
	   The evacuations raised concern that U.N. relief operations would
collapse, creating shortages of food and medicine.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event an attack was launched, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations backing Saddam.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party. At another protest Iraqi
workers trampled on and burned American and Israeli flags.

Ross calls on both sides to begin implementing Mideast accord

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ After a two-hour meeting with Yasser
Arafat, the U.S. peace envoy to the Middle East, called on both
Israel and the Palestinians Saturday to begin implementing the
latest peace accord which is more than a week behind schedule.
	   Dennis Ross, who arrived in the region Friday, spoke after talks
with Arafat in the northern West Bank city of Nablus.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to begin a staged troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank Monday. However, because of
several delays in getting the agreement ratified through the
Israeli Cabinet, Israeli officials have said the pullback will
likely begin towards the end of next week.
	   ``Our objective is to have the agreement implemented. Both sides
have obligations and responsibilities and we expect both sides to
carry out those responsibilities and obligations,'' Ross told
reporters after the meeting.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians also
wanted to see Israel implement several other areas of the agreement
also a week behind schedule including the opening of the
Palestinian airport in Gaza, and the release of prisoners from
Israeli jails.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians discussed their grievances with
Ross over Israeli plans for a new Jewish housing project on a
disputed Jerusalem hilltop and the confiscation of West bank land
for new roads for Jewish settlers.
	   ``The American side understands that the parties should refrain
from any unilateral action,'' Erekat said in regards to the
building.
	   Israel's government confirmed Friday that it has authorized the
paving of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
including one that will reportedly require the expropriation of
thousands of acres of Palestinian-owned land.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and are a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Ross met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday
and again on Saturday.
	   Netanyahu said last week he would permit the opening of the
Palestinian airport and begin releasing prisoners, though he has
not set dates.
	   Moving a small step forward, Israel on Friday gave the
Palestinians the names of Israeli negotiators in various committees
that are to deal with implementation of the accord or finalize some
issues, such as the opening of a Palestinian harbor.
	   Erekat was to meet with Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh
Sunday to discuss the committees.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinians held rallies and military parades in
Nablus and the West Bank city of Ramallah Saturday to commemorate
ten years since the PLO first announced it was seeking Palestinian
independence. At the Ramallah rally, a group of Palestinians burned
Israeli and American flags to protest against the latest Mideast
peace accord.
	   In a speech to supporters before meeting Ross in Nablus, Arafat
suggested that he was still aiming to declare a Palestinian state
in May, when the current peace accord expires.
	   ``We are going to build our state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Centimeter by centimeter, we will get the land to build our state
for May 1999,'' the Palestinian leader said.
	   Netanyahu is opposed to Palestinian statehood and said that if
Arafat unilaterally declares independence in the West Bank and
Gaza, Israel will annex the large chunks of land there still under
its control.
	   In a press statement, Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said
Arafat's comments Saturday were harmful to the spirit of the new
peace deal.
	   ``Continuation of statements of this kind place the Oslo
agreement in general and the Wye agreement in particular in
doubt,'' the statement read.

Israel, Palestinians, welcome signs of end to Gulf crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian support rally for Iraq graf 6, Arab
League reaction final graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab League
Saturday welcomed signs that a possible military strike against
Iraq over United Nations weapons inspections had been averted.
	   For Israel, any attack against Iraq could have resulted in a
retaliatory attack by Iraq on the Jewish state, as was the case in
the 1991 Gulf War. The Palestinians feared that the Mideast peace
process would suffer in the wake of a United States strike on a
fellow Arab nation.
	   The Iraqi government said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Saturday that it would allow weapons inspectors to
return to their work. The U.N. Security Council was to discuss the
letter later Saturday in New York.
	   ``We are very happy that the crisis has ended in a peaceful
way,'' said senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had urged the United States to
exhaust diplomatic efforts and avoid military action. Palestinians
feared that wide-spread popular support for Saddam Hussein in the
event of U.S. military action, could put Arafat in a difficult
position with the United States, the sponsor of Mideast peace.
	   In the West Bank city of Jenin Saturday, some 200 Palestinians
held a support rally for Iraq. Carrying Iraqi flags, the crowds
shouted ``Saddam, destroy Tel Aviv.'' It was the first such show of
street support for Iraq since the current crisis began.
	   ``We were apprehensive that it may have a negative impact on the
peace process and the implementation of the (peace) agreement,''
Erekat said. Erekat called on the U.N. to lift seven years of
sanctions on Iraq.
	   Israel had tried to stay-out of the current crisis but urged the
U.N. not to back-down over weapons inspections.
	   ``We welcome any resolution of the conflict without bloodshed,''
said David Bar-Illan, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Since Thursday the Israeli army has been distributing gas masks
to civilians as a precaution against a possible non-conventional
weapons attack by Iraq. Israeli TVs said gas mask centers would
open again Sunday.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads into Israeli cities.
	   Bar-Illan hoped the U.N. inspectors would be able to prevent
Saddam Hussein from acquiring ballistic missiles with
non-conventional warheads.
	   ``We hope that the inspection will proceed, so that the region
will be safe from non-conventional weapons and the means of their
delivery,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In Cairo, the secretary general of the Arab League, Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, praised Iraq's move to resume cooperation with
weapons inspectors as ``an important step to defuse tension in the
region and open the way for a diplomatic solution to contain the
crisis.'' His comments were carried by Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency.

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council meets Saturday
to consider Iraq's offer to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to return
to Iraq, but questions were immediately raised about whether it was
unconditional.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said his government had
decided ``to resume full, complete cooperation'' with the
inspectors. Asked whether this was unconditional, he replied
``yes.''
	   A letter from Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, which
Hamdoon delivered to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday
morning, said the inspectors would be allowed to perform their
``normal duties.''
	   And Hamdoon told reporters outside Annan's residence that the
inspectors ``will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to
resume their normal work.''
	   Iraq's decision came as speculation mounted that U.S. airstrikes
against the country were imminent.
	   Annan said he would present the letter, which he called
``positive,'' at the Security Council meeting. ``They will decide
what next to do.''
	   But a two-page annex attached to Aziz's letter reiterated Iraq's
previous terms for a comprehensive review of its compliance with
U.N. resolutions _ several of which the United States had already
rejected.
	   It wasn't clear whether these were Baghdad's hopes for a review
_ or its conditions.
	   ``That's the issue, and we don't have an assessment of that,''
said a U.S. diplomatic source, who called the letter ``very
complicated.''
	   The council meeting had been scheduled to start at 3:30 p.m. EST
(2030 GMT) but was delayed until 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) so council
members could have more time to review the letter and the annex,
said a U.S. official. The United States holds the council's
rotating presidency this month.
	   U. N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told CNN that the annex contains
longstanding Iraqi positions and ``does not constitute
conditionality.''
	   ``This is what the Iraqis would like the council to consider _
but we don't say that they're saying that they will have to
consider these things or respond to them before the cooperation can
resume,'' he said.
	   The secretary-general's reading of the letter, Eckhard said, is
that it ``does not have any conditionality attached to it. And it's
our understanding that is what the Security Council was demanding _
compliance no conditions.''
	   ``So now we just have to wait to see whether that's the
council's reading of the same letter,'' he said.
	   Like the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, other Security
Council members would not comment on the letter except to say it
was being studied carefully.
	   ``Let's see the letter and see what the council does,'' said
Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which is responsible for overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's weapons programs.
	   In the letter, Aziz didn't use the word condition or demand, but
he said the Security Council should adopt the points in the annex
to ensure that a comprehensive review is not ``a mere formality''
and constitutes a ``serious, fair and fruitful'' review.
	   He told Annan that the points in the annex had been conveyed
Friday to the ambassadors of Russia, France and China, who have
been sympathetic to Iraq's demand to have economic sanctions
lifted.
	   The annex, for example, says a comprehensive review should
initially focus on Iraq's compliance with resolutions calling for
its disarmament _ and conclude with an assessment of its
compliance.
	   The Iraqis want an assessment on their disarmament because
crippling oil sanctions cannot be lifted until weapons inspectors
certify that its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have been
eliminated along with the missiles to deliver them.
	   But the United States has previously said the purpose of the
review is to establish what steps Iraq needs to take to comply with
U.N. resolutions _ and not to assess whether they have or not.
	   And the United States wants Iraq to comply not just with
disarmament resolutions but other U.N. resolutions on such issues
as human rights and accounting for Kuwaitis taken prisoner during
the 1991 Gulf war.
	   The annex also presses Baghdad's attack on chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler and the structure of UNSCOM.
	   Iraq previously called for Butler's ouster and a new structure
for UNSCOM, which it claims is controlled by the United States. In
the annex, Aziz suggested that these two issues were important for
Iraq's future cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   Hamdoon was asked whether Iraq had withdrawn its demand for the
restructuring of UNSCOM and the firing of Butler. ``That's not in
the deal,'' he replied.
	   In a letter sent to the Iraqi leader Friday night, Annan
reiterated that a comprehensive review by the Security Council
offered the best way for Baghdad to achieve its goal of lifting
sanctions.
	   ``The comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps,
provided Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the
end of the tunnel,'' Annan said in the letter, which was released
on Saturday.
	   Aziz said in his reply that the Iraqi leadership, led by Saddam,
had decided ``to resume working with the Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency and to allow them to perform
their normal duties.''
	   ``We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive
American campaign and the threat to commit a new aggression against
Iraq, but as an expression of our feeling of responsibility, and in
response to your appeal and those of our friends,'' Aziz said.
	   He singled out appeals from Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the governments of China,
France and Brazil.

Iraq backs down over U.N. inspections

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Faced with the threat of an American
attack, Iraq declared Saturday that U.N. weapons inspectors could
go back to work immediately, a move that could defuse the third
arms-inspection crisis in less than a year.
	   Iraq insisted that the threat was not a factor, saying in a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that ``we offer this
chance not out of fear of the aggressive American campaign.''
	   Instead, the letter from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
repeated Iraq's goal that renewed cooperation would ``give a
further chance to achieve justice by lifting sanctions'' imposed on
Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait, an invasion that sparked
the Gulf War.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security team met
Saturday in Washington to assess the Iraqi promise, and the U.N.
Security Council prepared to meet to discuss whether Iraq had met
its demand that the inspectors be allowed back to work without
conditions.
	   Aziz's letter capped a flurry of diplomatic activity over 24
hours _ a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the
Russian ambassador to Baghdad, public statements by Saddam and
Clinton and crucial letters from Annan and Aziz.
	   In the end, it may have been Annan's personality at the center
of Iraq's reversal. Aziz's letter repeatedly referred to Iraq's
trust in the secretary-general and his ``good faith and
sincerity.''
	   It was Annan who defused the previous crisis, in February, when
Iraq blocked the inspectors _ who are responsible for searching for
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _ from visiting Saddam's
palaces.
	   It is the inspectors who must certify that Iraq has done away
with its weapons programs before the Security Council will consider
lifting sanctions.
	   Aziz's message to Annan, however, may still pose a problem.
	   U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said at a news conference in Baghdad on
Saturday that Aziz's letter put no conditions on the return to
Baghdad of the inspectors, who left Iraq on Wednesday.
	   But a two-page addendum to Aziz's letter reiterated Iraq's terms
for a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N. resolutions.
It wasn't clear whether these were Baghdad's hopes _ or its
demands.
	   In the letter, Aziz urged Annan to ensure that a comprehensive
review would include the points in the so-called annex, which he
said ``will render the review serious, fair and fruitful.''
	   The annex says the review should be carried out within a short
time, ``seven days, for example.'' In some cases, Iraq's positions
are watered-down versions of past demands.
	   For example, its insistence that UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler
be fired is reduced to saying that Butler and the structure of
UNSCOM are ``important matters'' and Iraq hopes that the Security
Council will discuss them seriously and ``as soon as possible.''
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told CNN that the annex contains
longstanding Iraqi positions, not conditions. The
secretary-general's reading of the letter, Eckhard said, is that it
``does not have any conditionality attached to it. And it's our
understanding that is what the Security Council was demanding _
compliance not conditions.
	   ``So now we just have to wait to see whether that's the
council's reading of the same letter,'' he said.
	   Iraq said the points in the annex were presented in a meeting
Friday with the ambassadors of Russia, France and China _ the three
members of the Security Council that have endorsed an easing of
sanctions.
	   The Americans and British are the other permanent members, and
they have been uncompromising in insisting on no easing of the
sanctions unless Iraq fulfills requirements to eliminate its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations said inspectors would be
allowed to return to Iraq immediately.
	   ``They will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to
resume their normal work,'' Nizar Hamdoon said in New York.
	   Hamdoon also said that Annan's letter promised ``that Iraq's
case would be looked on favorably and the comprehensive review
would be taking place in the right time.''
	   Annan called the letter from Aziz ``positive.''
	   The United States and Britain had amassed a force in the Gulf to
force Iraq into compliance, and the Iraqi decision seemed to
reflect in part the scant support that President Saddam Hussein
received abroad.
	   That was particularly evident in the Arab world, where many
countries had been vociferous in their opposition to an attack
during the last crisis over inspections in February.
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of six Gulf nations joined
Egypt and Syria in issuing a communique warning that ``the Iraqi
government is held responsible for any consequences that might
arise form its refusal to back down'' on weapons inspections.
	   Russia, China and France were also less vocal this time,
although Iraq credited their diplomacy for ending the standoff.
	   Still, Iraq once again brought attention to the U.N. sanctions,
which limit the sale of oil, have devastated Iraq's economy and
made its 22 million people dependent on a U.N. relief program.
Their end has long been the government's priority.
	   Saturday's decision ended a week that witnessed what seemed to
be preparations for an imminent attack.
	   A total of 103 U.N. inspectors were withdrawn to Bahrain amid
fears of a U.S. weapons strike. And about one-third of 450 U.N.
humanitarian workers were evacuated to the Jordanian capital,
Amman.
	   The evacuations raised concern that U.N. relief operations would
collapse, creating shortages of food and medicine.
	   On Saturday, Iraqi newspapers appealed for Arab help in the
event an attack was launched, and Iraqis took to the streets in
government-organized demonstrations.
	   ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,''
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party. At another protest Iraqi
workers trampled on and burned American and Israeli flags.

Top economic official says Russian economy could grow next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One of Russia's top economic officials cast a rosy
glow on the country's economic crisis Saturday, saying the downturn
should end in 1999 and the economy could even begin to grow in the
second half.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov also predicted that
inflation would be no higher than 6 percent this year, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported from Samara, where he was visiting.
	   ``I am an optimist by nature, and this trip to Samara has added
to my optimism,'' Maslyukov said after meeting with directors of
the region's industrial enterprises.
	   He said the government's economic plans were the key to a
revival, and assured industrial leaders that the plans included
support for manufacturers, lower taxes and measures to encourage
domestic demand.
	   Maslyukov, a Communist, is a former Soviet central planner who
has been one of the stronger voices for state intervention in the
economy.
	   He said the government would submit more than 20 draft laws
encompassing the heart of its economic plan to the State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, in a week.
	   If the government is able to restructure its foreign debt, he
said, it would be able to spend roughly dlrs 9 billion on social
welfare and reviving industry, Interfax reported. He said the
government hoped to avoid having to pay dlrs 8 billion in debt.
	   Even with that savings, he said, ``Expenditures will have to be
cut as much as possible. Unpopular steps will have to be taken.''
	   Maslyukov predicted that the economy will contract by a modest 2
to 3 percent in the first half of 1999. After that, he said, the
second half could see the return of some economic growth.
	   Russia's economy grew slightly last year for the first time
since the Soviet collapse, but was declining this year even before
the worst of the economic crisis sent it into a tailspin in August.

Brazilian star sidelined with sore knee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A sore knee will keep Brazilian superstar
Ronaldo out of Internazionale's Sunday Serie A match against
Sampdoria, the sixth league league game in nine rounds he has
missed.
	   Doctors for Internazionale said Saturday that the young striker
still is unfit and will miss Sunday's home match.
	   ``We hope to have him back to action for the next round (against
Fiorentina on Nov. 22),'' Dr. Piero Volpi said. ``Ronaldo will
devote more to swimming than to soccer in the next few days, to
recover his form.''
	   Seemingly unable to recover his form since Brazil's loss in the
World Cup final _ and troubled by tendinitis in both knees _
Ronaldo has played little and sporadically this season.
	   He suffered the latest injury, a bruised left knee, in last
Sunday's league match against AC Milan.
	   Ronaldo scored Inter's opening goal in a 2-2 draw before limping
off the field at the end of the first half.
	   Despite his infrequent appearances, Ronaldo has scored three
goals in as many league games.
	   Inter coach Gigi Simoni said the team must learn to live without
Ronaldo, a key to last season's UEFA Cup title and second place in
the Serie A.
	   ``We have been off to an unlucky season start. But we must learn
to live with injuries, and without Ronaldo. His absence must not be
an alibi. We must win without him, while waiting for his
comeback,'' Simoni said.

Armenia postpones census for lack of funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Armenia has postponed conducting a national census
next year, saying it can't afford it.
	   Instead, the census will be taken in 2001, Minister of
Statistics Stepan Mnatsakyan told the ITAR-Tass news agency
Saturday.
	   Mnatsakyan estimated that the census would cost dlr 1 for every
person counted. According to official statistics, Armenia's
population is 3.8 million, but that figure is believed to be badly
out of date. An estimated 700,000 people have left the former
Soviet republic in recent years.
	   The report did not say when the last complete census was
undertaken.

implementing the latest peace accord, which is more than a week
behind schedule.
	   Dennis Ross, who arrived in the region Friday, spoke after a
two-hour meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the West
Bank city of Nablus.
	   Under the accord, Israel was to begin a staged troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank in Monday. But because of delays
in getting the agreement through the Israeli Cabinet, Israeli
officials have said the pullback will probably begin toward the end
of next week.
	   ``Our objective is to have the agreement implemented. Both sides
have obligations and responsibilities and we expect both sides to
carry out those responsibilities and obligations,'' Ross said after
meeting with Arafat.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians also
wanted to see Israel implement several other areas of the agreement
that are also a week behind schedule, including the opening of the
Palestinian airport in Gaza and the release of prisoners from
Israeli jails. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last
week that he would permit the opening of the Palestinian airport
and begin releasing prisoners, though he has not set dates.
	   Ross met with Netanyahu on Friday and again on Saturday.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians discussed their grievances with
Ross over Israeli plans for a new Jewish housing project on a
disputed Jerusalem hilltop and the confiscation of West Bank land
for new roads for Jewish settlers.
	   ``The American side understands that the parties should refrain
from any unilateral action,'' Erekat said of the building.
	   Israel's government confirmed Friday that it authorized the
paving of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
including one that will reportedly require the expropriation of
thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian-owned land.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and are a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' Arafat advisor Nabil Amr said.
	   Also Saturday, Palestinians held rallies and military parades in
Nablus and the West Bank city of Ramallah to commemorate the 10th
anniversary of the Palestine Liberation Organization announcement
that it was seeking Palestinian independence. At the Ramallah
rally, a group of Palestinians burned Israeli and American flags to
protest against the latest Mideast peace accord.
	   In a speech to supporters before meeting Ross, Arafat suggested
that he still meant to declare a Palestinian state when the Oslo
peace accords expire.
	   ``We are going to build our state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Centimeter by centimeter, we will get the land to build our state
for May 1999,'' the Palestinian leader said.
	   Netanyahu is opposed to Palestinian statehood and says that if
Arafat declares independence in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel will
annex the large chunks of land there still under its control.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said in a statement that
Arafat's comments Saturday were harmful to the spirit of the new
peace deal.
	   ``Continuation of statements of this kind place the Oslo
agreement in general and the Wye agreement in particular in
doubt,'' the statement read.

Famed coach of NBA champ Knicks dead at 78
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Red Holzman was a Basketball Hall of Fame coach
with simple philosophies: play aggressive defense, move without the
ball and hit the open man.
	   Holzman, who molded a collection of individual stars into a
cohesive unit that helped the New York Knicks win their only two
American National Basketball Association championships, died Friday
night. He was 78.
	   ``Red represented the best of our game,'' NBA commissioner David
Stern said. ``He was a fan-friendly player and coach but most of
all, a gentleman who treated his players with dignity and respect
and received their loyalty and love in return.''
	   That respect was felt by members of the Knicks.
	   ``He had a game plan and he let you execute it,'' said Earl
``The Pearl'' Monroe, a member of the 1973 championship team. ``He
made it very easy to play for him. He was a straight-forward guy.
You respected him.''
	   ``He was a good friend and a great coach,'' said Dave
DeBusschere, who played on both the 1970 and '73 title teams, and
later became general manager of the Nets, commissioner of the
American Basketball Association and executive vice president of the
Knicks.
	   ``He also was a teacher, a pioneer and he made playing the game
fun.''
	   The Knicks' current executives also were saddened by Holzman's
death.
	   ``This is a great loss to the Knicks' family, the New York area,
the game of basketball and to me personally,'' president and
general manager Ernie Grunfeld said. ``Red was not only a great
coach and a player in his day, he also was a great person and a
friend.''
	   Holzman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital, one day after being
admitted. Cause of death was not immediately known, but Holzman had
been hospitalized earlier this year with leukemia.
	   Holzman retired from basketball in 1982 after his second stint
as coach of the Knicks. His teams won 696 regular-season victories
in 18 years, including 613 in 14 seasons with the Knicks.
	   In five of Holzman's years as coach, the Knicks won 50 or more
games and had a club-record 60 victories in the 1969-70 season.
	   Holzman took stars such as DeBusschere, Monroe, Willis Reed,
Bill Bradley, Walt Frazier, Dick Barnett and Jerry Lucas and
blended them into a group that became appreciated for its unselfish
play and tight defense.
	   Phil Jackson, who played for Holzman before carving his own
coaching niche with the Chicago Bulls by winning six NBA titles,
said he ``learned about putting energy into the team aspect of what
we did as a New York Knick team _ what we took pride in. We'd come
back to the huddle and we'd talk about defense for 30-35 seconds.
As it was winding down, he'd say `What kind of offense do you want
to do?'
	   ``He'd always let us have a large share of the reins and the
praise, and I think that influence was tremendous for a club that
had tremendous egos _ Lucas, DeBusschere, Bradley, Reed, Pearl,
Frazier. He gave them a lot of latitude as leaders and it made the
team a leader itself.''
	   Holzman's wife, Selma, died in July. He is survived by a
daughter, Gail, and one grandchild.
	   A private funeral service will be held Sunday at Parkside
Funeral Home in New York City.

Britain salvage draw with last second field goal.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WATFORD, England (AP) _ Tony Smith scored a try and a field goal
in the final two minutes Saturday as Britain salvaged a 23-23 draw
with New Zealand in a dramatic third Test at Watford.
	   Smith's five-point haul also denied the Kiwis of their first
series 3-0 cleansweep on British soil.
	   New Zealand already had a 2-0 series lead and, with two minutes
remaining, it looked as if Stacey Jones had engineered New
Zealand's second come-from-behind win in as many weeks.
	   The 22-year-old halfback created two tries for five-eighth
Robbie Paul and kicked a crucial field goal in the second half to
give New Zealand what appeared to be a match-winning lead.
	   Henry Paul scored the Kiwis first try in the 43rd minute, his
brother added a pair and Daryl Halligan kicked four goals as New
Zealand fought back from 10-2 down to lead 22-10.
	   Britain five-eighth Sean Long started Britain's revivial with a
solo try in the 66th minute, which was converted by captain Andy
Farrell to make the score 22-16.
	   Jones' 71st minute fieldgoal gave New Zealand a 23-16 lead and
should have wrapped-up the game and a 3-0 series whitewash.
	   But Britain fought back to salvage some pride from a 2-0 series
defeat when Smith scored a try two minutes from time to reduce New
Zealand's margin to one point.
	   Britain went back on the attack, missing one chance to draw
level when a fieldgoal was charged down, before Smith converted his
fieldgoal from 20 meters out and on the left of the uprights.
	   With the Kiwis in a commanding position late in the game, one
British pundit had described the match as a ``repeat of last week's
horror show.''
	   But his obvious shame was replaced by awe as Smith's equalizer
sailed over the cross-bar.
	   After winning the first Test, New Zealand trailed 16-8 at
halftime in the second Test before scoring 28 points in a second
half blitz to wrap-up its first series win in Britain since 1971.
	   Britain again dominated the scoring early in the third Test,
with three goals to captain Andy Farrell and a try to winger Jason
Robinson in the 23rd minute against one first-half penalty goal
from Daryl Halligan.
	   For the second successive week, New Zealand coach Frank
Endacott's halftime speech inspired a fight back but this time it
was nullified by the British.
	   The match, which deterioted into a brawl just before halftime
which resulted in two players being sin-binned, will now go down as
a classic.

After Mitch, Central Americans look north

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Rosa Lidia Lazo was fed up with her
dead-end life, so one day she got on a bus headed north in search
of the American dream.
	   She followed a well-worn trail: a midnight walk across the
Mexican border, a string of clandestine, underpaid jobs washing
dishes or waiting tables, the constant terror of discovery by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
	   ``When hunger squeezes, you go,'' said Lazo, a short, sturdy
woman of 43.
	   But she got tired of living in fear. She gave herself up for
deportation three years ago and adapted well to a new life in her
homeland.
	   Until Hurricane Mitch struck.
	   Like thousands of Central Americans, she's now thinking of
taking another chance in the land of opportunity.
	   ``There are no options here,'' she said.
	   Her three-year-old daughter, Carla, now stands in the middle of
a bare, muddy floor. The flood waters reached the roof and carried
away the toddler's toys, bed, clothes and everything else in the
three-room brick house. Big cracks run through the walls, and it's
uncertain how safe it is to stay.
	   ``Everything is gone, everything, everything,'' said Lazo, as
workers and students dug through tons of mud clogging the street
outside. ``Now I must go back.''
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores has warned that a new wave of
migrants will go ``walking, swimming and running up north'' unless
other countries _ especially the United States _ help Central
America get back on its feet. When Mitch pummeled the region last
month, it left some 10,000 people dead and economies in shambles.
	   Hondurans take the outflow of people for granted.
	   ``It is as certain as night follows day,'' said Jose Ramirez
Ramos, a taxi driver. ``The destruction was so terrible, there are
no jobs. And the dollar is the dollar.''
	   Honduras was especially hard hit by Mitch. The coffee harvest
was hurt badly, and many of the roads and bridges needed to get it
to market were wiped out. The banana crop was decimated. Some 7,000
people lost their lives.
	   Heading north has always been an option for Central Americans,
and governments are reluctant to stop it. The money expatriates
send home from abroad _ about dlrs 400 million a year _ is the
third largest source of foreign revenue in Honduras. In El
Salvador, it's No. 1.
	   Honduras has always had a strong bond with the United States,
especially on its Atlantic coast where much of the population
speaks English as well as Spanish. As of December, 1995, nearly
100,000 Hondurans were living in the United States. Last year,
3,732 were deported.
	   In other Central American countries, civil wars in the 1980s
sent waves of refugees heading north.
	   Honduran officials say the solution is to create jobs at home.
That's why Central American countries have asked the U.S.
government to grant them equal status with Mexico as partners in
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
	   Because of the hurricane, the Clinton administration is putting
off until the end of the year deportations of citizens of
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua who are illegally in
the United States.
	   Sooner or later, though, the deportations are bound to continue.
	   Nicaraguan refugees, with support from a strong anti-communist
Cuban lobby, won an amnesty from deportation if they can prove they
were in the United States by 1996. Honduras wants the same
privileges but started lobbying too late, and the U.S. Congress
never got around to voting on it last session.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy is keeping a tight lid on visas.
Applicants for a tourist visa have to convince interviewers in 30
seconds that they don't plan to stay. Single men under 25 often
have little chance.
	   That was one reason Michael Albray went through the back door.
In 1990, he hitchhiked to Tijuana, Mexico, and found a ``coyote'' _
or guide for illegal immigrants _ who slipped him through a hole in
the fence on the border.
	   Sacramento, California, was a land of opportunities for the
20-year-old. He sold papers, clipped hedges, painted houses. The
dlrs 50 he earned a day was a fortune.
	   ``I had a car, and money and friends,'' said Albray, a nose ring
and wraparound shades mementos of his American life.
	   But he got caught and deported. Back in Tegucigalpa, washing
cars for a few lempiras, the local currency, he dreams of going
back.
	   ``They said I can't go back for five years, but I'm going. I
don't know how, but I have to go. There's nothing for me here. I
want to change my future.''

	   LAHTIS, Finland (AP) _ Igor Razoryonov of Ukraine hoisted 232.5
kilos on his last clean-and-jerk attempt and took the 105-kilo
category title at the World weightlifting Championships Saturday.
	   Razoryonov lifted a total of 422.5 kilos, exceeding last year's

teammate, Denys Gottfried. Cui finished second with 420 kilos while
Gottfried was third with 415 kilos.
	   In the 94-kilo category, Olympic champion Akakias Kakiasvilis of
Greece, the dominating lifter at 99 kilos the last years, lifted
400.0 kilos to claim the title. He also won the clean-and-jerk
gold.
	   Oliver Caruso of Germany prevented a Greek sweep with a 395-kilo
total for the silver, 2 1-2 more than Leonidas Kokkas, who took the
overall bronze.
	   A record 71 countries and 391 lifters are competing in the
championships: 253 men and 138 women. The event will finish Sunday.

collection. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian art expert is challenging the
authenticity of a painting by Vincent Van Gogh that could fetch
million of dollars when it goes on auction at Sotheby's in New York
on Monday.
	   The challenge comes in an article in the Nov. 18 issue of the
Italian art magazine ``Quadri e Sculture'' (Paintings &AMP; Sculpture).
The magazine provided an advance copy of the article by Antonio De
Robertis, an expert on Van Gogh and one of several who have
recently begun to question the authenticity of some of the works
attributed to the Dutch painter.
	   De Robertis was among those who have challenged the authenticity
of the ``Sunflowers'' painting bought by the Yasuda Marine and Fire
Insurance Co. for dlrs 39.9 million for in 1987.
	   In the ``Quadri e Sculture'' article, De Robertis says the
painting in the Sotheby's auction, known as ``Les Chaumieres de
Jorgus'' or ``Les Chaumieres a Auvers,'' is a forgery.
	   The painting is part of the Reader's Digest collection, one of
the most valuable corporate collections in the world.
	   Monday's auction of the collection is one of the art world's
most highly anticipated sales.
	   De Robertis said ``Les Chaumieres de Jorgus'' was actually
painted by Dr. Paul Gachet and his son, Paul Jr., from whose
collection it came.
	   Gachet cared for the troubled painter before his suicide in 1890
and Van Gogh gave him a number of paintings. A portrait of Dr.
Gachet, not part of the family collection, sold in 1990 to a
Japanese paper magnate for dlrs 82.5 million, a price that stunned
the art world.

<TEXT>
	   Text of the annex attached to a letter from the Iraqi government
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan regarding agreement to allow
resumption of weapons inspections:
	   First, the goal sought by Iraq from its decisions of 5 August
and 31 October was not to sever the relationship with UNSCOM and
the IAEA and to cease the implementation of its obligations under
section C of SCR's 687 and 715.
	   Second, the objective of Iraq is to end the suffering of its
embargoed people and to see the implementation of paragraph (22) of
SCR 687 as a first step for lifting the other sanctions.
	   Third, Iraq expressed its readiness to engage in the
comprehensive review which had been proposed by the Secretary
General. But, as a result of American pressure, the results brought
about by the consultations of the Council do not ensure an honest
and objective review with the aim of implementing paragraph (22).
	   Fourth, the position of Iraq on the comprehensive review is:
	   1. The comprehensive review be carried out within a very short
time, (seven days for example), after the resumption of UNSCOM and
the IAEA of their normal duties. This is to be without conditions,
(like those mentioned formerly in regard to what is called the
confirmation of Iraq's cooperation).
	   2. The comprehensive review fundamentally concentrates on
paragraph (3) of the concept paper of the Secretary General of 5
October (the three Iraqi questions of 3 August) and emphasizes the
question of evidence.
	   3. The Council be ready to implement paragraph (22) if the
fulfillment of the requirements of section C of SCR 687 is
established.
	   4. If the Council sees, through an objective study, that there
are matters which need to be done, a short period be determined for
their completion. Until that completion is reached, the Council
implements measures for lifting or reducing sanctions in proportion
to what has been fulfilled of the requirements of paragraph (22).
Thereafter, the commencement with the implementation of paragraph
(22) immediately upon the completion of the required work.
	   5. The Council assures the legal interpretation of section C of
SCR 687 and that none of its members should impose additional
conditions or restrictions on the implementation of paragraph (22).
	   Fifth, the second phase of the review commences after completing
the conclusions of the first phase.
	   Sixth, the second phase of the review only encompasses the
obligations determined by clear provisions of the resolutions and
no matters be raised contrary to the legal interpretation of the
resolutions.
	   Seventh, the members of the Council and specially the permanent
members abide by international law and the relevant resolutions of
the Council in respect of all matters pertaining to Iraq.
	   Eighth, the question of Butler and the structure of UNSCOM and
its practices are important matters. The Council is to consider
them seriously in order to ensure a good relationship in the
future. We hope that this will be done as soon as possible.
	   Ninth, it is necessary that these assurances be communicated
directly to the leadership in Baghdad either by the Secretary
General or by a delegation from the Council.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Francisco Clavet of Spain and Younes El
Eynaoui of Morroco both scored straight-set victories Saturday and
advanced to the final of the 320,000 dollar Chevrolet Cup.
	   El Eynaoui defeated Felix Mantilla of Spain 6-4, 6-4 in a match
played under a scorching sun at the San Carlos stadium in the
Santiago's Andes foothills.
	   Later, Clavet rode the cheers of the local fans over Juan
Antonio Marin of Costa Rica 6-2, 7-5.
	   The crowd was clearly partisan for Clavet after Marin upset
local hero Marcelo Rios in the quarterinals Friday.
	   The defeat not only eliminated Rios from his hometown tournament
for the first time, but also detrailed his hopes of recovering the
No. 1 ATP Tour ranking this week.

<TEXT>
	   Text of the letter from Iraqi government to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan regarding agreement to allow
resumption of weapons inspections:
	   H.E. Mr. Kofi A. Annan
	   The Secretary General of The United Nations
	   New York
	   Excellency:
	   Your letter dated 13/11/1998 addressed to President Saddam
Hussein was presented to a joint meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council and the National Command of the Arab Ba'ath
Socialist Party presided over by His Excellency the President. I
was entrusted with the task of conveying to you the following:
	   1. The goal sought by Iraq from its decisions of 5 August and 31
October was not to sever the relationship with UNSCOM and the IAEA
and to cease the implementation of its obligations ... under
section C of SCR 687. The objective of Iraq is to end the suffering
of its embargoed people and to see the implementation of paragraph
22 of SCR 687 as a first step for lifting the other sanctions.
	   2. Due to its trust in you and your good faith, the Government
of Iraq has dealt with your initiative regarding the comprehensive
review. But unfortunately, the deliberations of the Council on the
procedures for carrying out the review did not result in a clear
picture which ensures fairness and objectivity in reaching the
implementation of Paragraph (22) of resolution 687, which
represents the declared objective of the comprehensive review
according to your proposal. It is well known that the main reason
for that was the American position, which does not represent the
prevailing opinion of the Council. That position, contrary to your
initiative, objected continuously to the presentation of any
clarity in regard to the objective of the comprehensive review.
	   3. Despite the assurances that we have received from you and
from many members of the Council that supported the main objective
of the comprehensive review, and despite the confidence we have in
you and in the majority of the Council members and our belief in
your good faith and sincerity, those assurances were not
satisfactory because they did not meet the basics from our point
(of) view.
	   On the basis of what was stated in your letter, and in
appreciation of the content of the letter of President Boris
Yeltsin the President of the Russian Federation and Mr. Yevgeny
Primakov the prime minister of the Russian Federation, and the
positive positions expressed and conveyed to us by China, France,
Brazil, and other States, and in order to give a further chance to
achieve justice by lifting sanctions commencing with the
implementation of paragraph (22) of resolution 687 (1991), the
Leadership of Iraq decided to resume working with the Special
Commission and the IAEA and to allow them to perform their normal
duties in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security
Council and on the basis of the principles which were agreed upon
in the Memorandum of Understanding signed with you on 23 February
1998.
	   We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive American
campaign and the threat to commit a new aggression against Iraq,
but as an expression of our feeling of responsibility, and in
response to your appeal and those of our friends. We affirm that
the people of Iraq would not relinquish their legitimate right in
having the iniquitous embargo lifted and to live normally like
other nations of the world. We will be looking forward to seeing
the outcome of your efforts and the review.
	   Excellency, we rightly believe that if the comprehensive review
were not to be a mere formality and to be free from the influences
of the tendentious purposes, the adoption of the points we conveyed
yesterday, 13/11/1998, to the Ambassadors of Russia, France, and
China, a copy of which I enclose herewith, will render the review
serious, fair and fruitful.
	   We expect that you will continue with your efforts to lay down
the basis and the correct procedures for the review and so as to
commence with as soon as possible.
	   Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest
consideration.
	   (signed)
	   Tariq Aziz
	   Baghdad, 14 November 1998

Iraqi opposition accuses government of hundreds of executions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A son and a cousin of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein have executed 150 people during the past two weeks, an
Iraqi opposition group said Saturday.
	   The president's younger son, Qusai, and Ali Hassan al-Majid, a
cousin and former defense minister, ``have carried out new violent
acts against the citizens of al-Amara province, by directly
executing 150 people arrested during the past two weeks,'' the
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said.
	   The allegation could not be independently verified and the Iraqi
government usually does not respond to such accusations.
	   The Iranian-based dissident group said the Iraqi armed forces
have been attacking villages where rebels were thought to be hiding
in the southern provinces of Basra and al-Amara.
	   Qusai, who heads the president's special security unit, has been
moving around southern Iraq and has met with al-Majid several
times, the council said in a statement faxed to Cairo.
	   Al-Majid had ordered three persons to be hanged from a bridge in
al-Amara, the statement said.
	   The former defense minister also executed dozens of army
defectors in Basra province, the dissidents said.
	   Southern Iraq is a hotbed of opposition to Saddam's government.
Immediately after the 1991 Gulf War, the residents of Basra city
staged an uprising that was put down by government forces.

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan saying Iraqis reiterate decision is
unconditional and there are no conditions in the annex, British
prime minister demanding clarification; Council now scheduled to
meet at 2200 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council meets Saturday
to consider Iraq's offer to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to return
to Iraq, but questions were immediately raised on whether it was
unconditional.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz assured him that Iraq's decision was
unconditional _ and that a controversial annex attached to the
letter ``was for our consideration and there were no conditions.''
	   But British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in London that Iraq
must state categorically that the nine points in the annex, which
are also mentioned in the letter, are not conditions.
	   ``They cannot be conditions _ and what we all must be very sure
of is that the Iraqi position has to be unconditional, not
hedged,'' Blair said. ``The compliance must be immediate and it
must be unconditional.''
	   Other Security Council members would not comment on the letter
except to say it was being studied carefully.
	   ``Let's see the letter and see what the council does,'' said
Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which is responsible for overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's weapons programs.
	   The two-page annex attached to Aziz's letter reiterated Iraq's
previous terms for a comprehensive review of its compliance with
U.N. resolutions _ several of which the United States had already
rejected.
	   It wasn't clear from the texts whether the nine points were
Baghdad's hopes for a review _ or its conditions.
	   ``That's the issue, and we don't have an assessment of that,''
said a U.S. diplomatic source, who called the letter ``very
complicated.''
	   The Security Council meeting, scheduled to start at 3:30 p.m.
EST (2030 GMT), was delayed until 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) so council
members could have more time to review the letter and the annex,
said a U.S. official. The United States holds the council's
rotating presidency this month.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon delivered the letter to
Annan at the U.N. chief's residence Saturday morning. During the
visit, Annan spoke to Aziz on the phone and got him ``to confirm
that their decision was unconditional'' and that U.N. weapons could
resume their normal work ``which should mean inspections and
monitoring,'' Annan told reporters as he left his residence.
	   Hamdoon said afterwards that his government had decided ``to
resume full, complete cooperation'' with the inspectors. Asked
whether this was unconditional, he replied ``yes.''
	   The letter said the inspectors would be allowed to perform their
``normal duties.'' And Hamdoon told reporters that the inspectors
``will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to resume
their normal work.''
	   Annan said he would present the letter, which he called
``positive,'' at the Security Council meeting. ``They will decide
what next to do.''
	   ``The indications are good but we have to wait for the council
action,'' Annan said.
 &UR; In the letter, Aziz, pick up 17th graf pvs.

Opposition fares well in Senate elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first official results; division of the Senate
before the vote. Adds quotes
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The main opposition party is on
the road to victory in the first round of Senate elections and
another opposition grouping is likely to finish second, preliminary
results showed Saturday,
	   With all or nearly all results counted in 17 out of 27
districts, candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party
advanced to the second round in 16 regions in the two days of
voting.
	   They were followed by the four-party center-right coalition led
by the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 10
candidates through to the next round.
	   The ruling Social democrats are third with 7 candidates, which
is seen as a dissapointment by the party leaders.
	   Polling stations closed at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), and final results
were expected late Sunday.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were seats of 27 members whose
terms had run out. Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to
win the election outright or face a run-off between the two top
finishers. The run-offs are scheduled for Nov. 20-21.
	   None of the candidates gained more than 50 percent of first
round vote, meaning that run-off elections will be necessary in all
districts.
	   Turnout was estimated at 30 percent, the lowest number of voters
ever taking part in any Czech elections. Election fatigue after a
relatively recent national election could have contributed to the
lack of voter enthusiasm.
	   ``I'm worried by the low turnout,'' Premier Milos Zeman said.
	   Before the vote Friday and Saturday, the Civic Democratic Party
controlled 29 seats in the Senate. Twelve of those seats were up
for grabs in the current vote.
	   The Social Democrats had 26 senators, with six being contested.
The rest of the seats were controlled by four other smaller
parties, including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and the
Communists.
	   The Senate vote is in part considered a test of support for
Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His government survived in
Parliament thanks to a pact struck with the runner-up, the
center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   ``I expected we would fare better,'' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
commented on the election results.
	   But the relatively disappointing showing for the governing party
was due less to policies than personalities. The Civic Democrats,
the former governing party, had the better-known candidates for the
seats.
	   The four-member opposition bloc _ in second place _ appeared to
get most support from center-right voters who distrust the Civic
Democrats.
	   The Senate was created as a safety mechanism to ensure the
country could function in case of a constitutional crisis. It can
pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution, should the
200-seat lower house of the parliament be dissolved.
	   Since its formation in 1996, the Senate has been criticized by
all members of the political spectrum for not being effective
enough.
	   Several parties, including the Communists and the
ultra-nationalist Republicans, have even called for its
abolishment.
	   No exit polls were done for local elections, which also took
place also Friday and Saturday.
	   More than 60,000 local posts are at stake. Independent
candidates are expected to dominate the local elections, which have
little bearing on the balance of political power in the country.
Final results are expected Tuesday.

Blair says Iraq crisis not over yet, letter ambiguous

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday that the
crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq is ``by no means over
yet,'' saying it is unclear whether Iraq's offer to allow weapons
inspections to resume their work is unconditional.
	   Forces remain on alert, poised for military action without
further warning, he said.
	   Blair spoke after assessing a letter that Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz wrote to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
saying Iraq would allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their
work at suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
	   The letter ``appears to promise'' resumption of weapons
inspections, Blair said, adding that the letter is ambiguous as to
whether the inspectors can return without conditions.
	   Referring to nine ``points'' included with the letter, Blair
said ``any conditions of this nature are unnaceptable.''
	   ``We are not even in the position yet that we can be sure from
this letter that the inspectors are to be allowed back in
unconditionally,'' he said. ``They cannot be conditions.''
	   ``The Iraqi position has to be unconditional, not hedged about,
not confused, not subject to this point or that point _
unconditional,'' he said. ``Compliance with the agreement must be
absolute.''
	   There can be no negotiation, no further deals, no more
amendments to what they have agreed, Blair said.
	   ``We can't have a situation where there is confusion as to the
terms upon which the inspectors do their work,'' he said. ``In the
meantime, our forces remain on alert to the possibility of military
action without further warning.''
	   A spokeswoman for Blair, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said Britain will be looking to Iraq to clarify whether
the nine points are conditions.
	   A Blair spokesman said the prime minister had held four
telephone conversations with U.S. President Bill Clinton in the
past 24 hours, the final one to discuss Iraq's latest offer lasting
an hour.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Buoyed by a public tribute from his mother and an
improved standing in an opinion poll, Prince Charles celebrated his
50th birthday Saturday in private with friends and his longtime
love, Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   Some 250 guests were invited to the party at Highgrove, Charles'
home in Gloucestershire. The invitation list included Queen Sophia
of Spain, King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway and ex-King
Constantine of Greece, according to Press Association, the British
news agency.
	   The hostess, Mrs. Parker Bowles, arrived in an emerald green
velvet dress with jeweled necklace and earrings and gave waiting
cameramen a beaming smile as her car came up the drive.
	   Prince William arrived later, wearing a cap and a combat jacket.
	   Guesthouses and hotels for miles around Charles' country retreat
were reportedly fully booked for the night.
	   Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was not expected to attend
the party.
	   She hosted a birthday party for her son at Buckingham Palace on
Friday night. Rock music mixed with classical; jugglers and
``aliens'' mingled with celebrities; street theater collided with
harpists, a military band and an opera company. Representatives of
the 400 organizations Charles has been associated with were also in
attendance.

Iraqi opposition accuses government of hundreds of executions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition group alleged Saturday
that a son and a cousin of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein have
executed 150 people during the past two weeks.
	   The president's younger son, Qusai, and Ali Hassan al-Majid, a
cousin and former defense minister, ``have carried out new violent
acts against the citizens of al-Amara province, by directly
executing 150 people arrested during the past two weeks,'' the
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said.
	   The allegation could not be independently verified and the Iraqi
government usually does not respond to such accusations.
	   It was not clear if the report was in any way linked the
atmosphere of crisis in Iraq due to Baghdad's defiance of U.N.
efforts to monitor its weapons programs and the threat of U.S.
military strikes to compel Baghdad to comply. Iraq announced
Saturday that it would allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume
their work, which could defuse that crisis.
	   The Iranian-based dissident group said the Iraqi armed forces
have been attacking villages where rebels were thought to be hiding
in the southern provinces of Basra and al-Amara.
	   Qusai, who heads the president's special security unit, has been
moving around southern Iraq and has met with al-Majid several
times, the council said in a statement faxed to Cairo.
	   Al-Majid had ordered three persons to be hanged from a bridge in
al-Amara, the statement said.
	   The former defense minister also executed dozens of army
defectors in Basra province, the dissidents said.
	   Southern Iraq is a hotbed of opposition to Saddam's government.
Immediately after the 1991 Gulf War, the residents of Basra city
staged an uprising that was put down by government forces.

U.S official urges Egypt to expand trade with Israel and others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley urged
Egyptian business executives Saturday to expand their trade with
other Middle Eastern states, including Israel, despite political
difficulties.
	   Daley said he was asking Middle Eastern governments to reconvene
a meeting of Arab and Israeli trade ministers -- the so-called Taba
group -- and perhaps even a Middle East and North Africa economic
conference next year.
	   ``We would hope that in 1999 we could see both a Taba ministers
meeting and a MENA conference, at some point,'' Daley said. ``After
all the efforts to bring peace, Egypt and its neighbors cannot
afford to let economic cooperation go by the wayside.''
	   The commerce secretary was speaking to officials and business
executives in Cairo on the Egyptian leg of a regional tour. He held
talks with President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday.
	   The Taba group -- which includes the trade ministers of Egypt,
Israel, the Palestinian National Authority, Jordan and the U.S. --
was set up in the wake of the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement to remove barriers to trade in the Middle East.
	   Daley said the group has not met in more than two years as a
result of political tension between Arab nations and Israel.
	   The MENA conference series, designed to build economic ties
between Arabs and Israelis, is also on hold after a number of Arab
countries boycotted last year's conference in Qatar to protest what
they saw as Israel's failure to implement the peace accords.
	   Daley warned that Middle Eastern nations, whose trade with each
other amounts to just 7 percent of their total trade, were missing
out on opportunities for growth.
	   ``That's a situation that's got to be changed in order to
strengthen the economies of each of the countries in this region,''
he said.
	   Daley said effective regional cooperation would have to include
Israel.
	   ``Israel's a rather large piece of the economy, when you take
the entire Middle East, and to have a regional pact that just
denies Israel wouldn't accomplish what I would imagine a number of
the Arab countries would want, which is a bigger piece of the
pie.''
	   Israel's trade with Arab countries is extremely limited. Israel
said in May that its trade with Egypt grew to just dlrs 85 million
in 1997 from dlrs 83 million in 1996, against total Israeli trade
of dlrs 51.5 billion in 1997 and dlrs 50.5 billion in 1996.
	   Israeli trade with Jordan grew to dlrs 33 million in 1997 from
dlrs 14 million in 1996.

	   Developments Saturday in the crisis with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspectors:
	   ___
	   Iraq backs down from its freeze of cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz sends a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan saying the inspectors can resume their
work immediately.
	   In an annex to his letter, Aziz spells out what Iraq expects the
United Nations to do, including conduct a comprehensive review of
the country's progress in dismantling its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ____
	   U.N. special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, says the Aziz letter
grants an unconditional go-ahead for U.N. weapons inspections to
resume. But the tone of the annex raises fears that the U.N.
Security Council might regard the Iraqi reversal as insufficient.
	   ____
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair says the crisis is ``by no
means over yet,'' and that U.S. and British forces remain poised
for action. The prime minister says Aziz's letter ``appears to
promise'' a resumption of weapons inspections, but was ambiguous as
to whether the inspectors can return without conditions.
	   ____
	   U.N. Security Council meets to consider the Iraqi statements.

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - World champion Alexei Yagudin beat
teammate Alexander Abt in a battle of quads to take the men's event
at the Nations Cup Saturday with Russians on the verge of a sweep
of all the events.
	   In the ice dance, two more world champions, Angelika Krylova and
Oleg Ovsiannikov, used a controversial routine entirely to drums
and percussion instruments to win.
	   Earlier Saturday Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov won the pairs
event over a weak field, the first of three finals during the day.
	   Russians are 1-2 after the women's short program with Yelena
Sokolova ahead of European champion Maria Butyrskaya. The long
program is Sunday.
	   World champion Yagudin landed six triples and a quadruple toe
loop to score all 5.8s and 5.9s in another impressive routine to
the music from ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' At his Skate America victory
two weeks ago he landed nine triples, one more than allowed.
	   Abt started with a triple axel-triple loop then tried his quad,
slightly two-footing it. He scaled down one triple and turned out
of his second triple axel which hurt his chances. He also had
Arabian music and an Arabian costume with billowing pants.
	   Third was Andreas Vlascenko of Germany.
	   Krylova and Ovsiannikov performed a very untraditional dance
program with no music, just different rhythms of drums.
	   Although the steps were quick and the positions sometimes
unique, it is sure to provoke controversy.
	   ``I think this programs has a lot of risks. Before we were very
dramatic, like with `Carmen,'' Krylova said. ``But we are world
champions and I think we can take risks and try something new.''
	   However the judges scored only moderate marks for a world
champions of mostly 5.6 and 5.7 with only one 5.8 for technical
merit. The presentaion marks were mostly 5.8s and 5.9s.
	   Bourne and Kraatz showed more dance movements to the driving
beat of techo-rock beat.
	   ``It's quite a work-out from beginning to end,'' Bourne said.
``It's 90s music, music of today.''
	   But she agreed with Krylova that change is needed in the sport.
	   ``The main objective of a dancer is to be versatile and show
something different every year,'' Bourne said. ``And I think that's
why all of us are doing something different.''
	   Petrova and Tikhonov outclassed the other five pairs in their
event although they have been skating together for less than six
months.
	   Tikhonov skated in shows for nearly four years but did not give
up his eligible status.
	   ``I think professional shows helped me,'' Tikhonov said. ``But
all this time I missed competing.''
	   German veterans Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller were second.
	   Third went to the American team of John and Tiffany Stiegler,
trained by Russian pair legend Irina Rodnina.
	   Sokolova took the women's short program as Butyskaya fell and
barely held another jump.
	   Butyrskaya won Skate American two weeks ago and was expected to
take advantage of the absence of Olympic champion Tara Lipinksi and
world champion Michelle Kwan this season.
	   The 18-year-old Sokolova nailed her triple lutz-double toe loop
combination and triple loop jumps.
	   The only error was when she stumbled at the end of her footwork
and went into the boards.
	   ``After the three succsssful jumps, I had mentally finished the
program. I just lost my concentration and suddenly my legs went out
under me,'' Sokolova said.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The main opposition party is on
the road for victory in the first round of Senate elections and
another opposition grouping is likely to finish second, preliminary
results showed Saturday,
	   With all or nearly all results counted in 20 out of 27
districts, candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party
advanced to the second round in 17 regions in the two days of
voting.
	   They were followed by the four-party center-right coalition led
by the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 12
candidates through to the next round.
	   The ruling Social democrats were third with 9 candidates, which
is seen as a dissapointment by the party leaders.

Famed coach of NBA champ Knicks dead at 78
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS 10th graf with cause of death confirmed as leukemia. &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Red Holzman was a Basketball Hall of Fame coach
with simple philosophies: play aggressive defense, move without the
ball and hit the open man.
	   Holzman, who molded a collection of individual stars into a
cohesive unit that helped the New York Knicks win their only two
American National Basketball Association championships, died Friday
night. He was 78.
	   ``Red represented the best of our game,'' NBA commissioner David
Stern said. ``He was a fan-friendly player and coach but most of
all, a gentleman who treated his players with dignity and respect
and received their loyalty and love in return.''
	   That respect was felt by members of the Knicks.
	   ``He had a game plan and he let you execute it,'' said Earl
``The Pearl'' Monroe, a member of the 1973 championship team. ``He
made it very easy to play for him. He was a straight-forward guy.
You respected him.''
	   ``He was a good friend and a great coach,'' said Dave
DeBusschere, who played on both the 1970 and '73 title teams, and
later became general manager of the Nets, commissioner of the
American Basketball Association and executive vice president of the
Knicks.
	   ``He also was a teacher, a pioneer and he made playing the game
fun.''
	   The Knicks' current executives also were saddened by Holzman's
death.
	   ``This is a great loss to the Knicks' family, the New York area,
the game of basketball and to me personally,'' president and
general manager Ernie Grunfeld said. ``Red was not only a great
coach and a player in his day, he also was a great person and a
friend.''
	   Holzman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital, one day after being
admitted. Knicks spokesman Chris Weiller said Holzman died after a
year-long struggle with leukemia.
	   Holzman retired from basketball in 1982 after his second stint
as coach of the Knicks. His teams won 696 regular-season victories
in 18 years, including 613 in 14 seasons with the Knicks.
	   In five of Holzman's years as coach, the Knicks won 50 or more
games and had a club-record 60 victories in the 1969-70 season.
	   Holzman took stars such as DeBusschere, Monroe, Willis Reed,
Bill Bradley, Walt Frazier, Dick Barnett and Jerry Lucas and
blended them into a group that became appreciated for its unselfish
play and tight defense.
	   Phil Jackson, who played for Holzman before carving his own
coaching niche with the Chicago Bulls by winning six NBA titles,
said he ``learned about putting energy into the team aspect of what
we did as a New York Knick team _ what we took pride in. We'd come
back to the huddle and we'd talk about defense for 30-35 seconds.
As it was winding down, he'd say `What kind of offense do you want
to do?'
	   ``He'd always let us have a large share of the reins and the
praise, and I think that influence was tremendous for a club that
had tremendous egos _ Lucas, DeBusschere, Bradley, Reed, Pearl,
Frazier. He gave them a lot of latitude as leaders and it made the
team a leader itself.''
	   Holzman's wife, Selma, died in July. He is survived by a
daughter, Gail, and one grandchild.
	   A private funeral service will be held Sunday at Parkside
Funeral Home in New York City.

Text of Annan letter to Saddam Hussein on Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   His Execellency
	   Mr. Saddam Hussein
	   President of the Republic of Iraq
	   Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council
	   Baghdad
	   Excellency,
	   As you may know already, I interrupted an official visit to
North Africa yesterday and returned to New York in view of the
worsening crisis with regard to Iraq. This afternoon and evening
(Nov. 13), I met with the members of the Security Council for four
hours in order to review the situation. I can report to you that
without exception, all the members of the Security Council express
preference for a diplomatic solution of the crisis. As you are
aware, I have made continuous efforts myself over the past three
months to bring about such a solution.
	   The Security Council also unanimously endorsed the press
statement I issued in Marrakech on 11 November in which I addressed
a personal appeal to you, Mr. President, to take the necessary
steps for a diplomatic solution to become possible. For ease of
reference, I am reproducing below the text of this statement.
	   ``I am saddened and burdened by the Iraqi decision of 5 August
and 31 October to not cooperate with UNSCOM.
	   I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
Government to rescind its decision and resume immediate cooperation
with UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors.
	   Iraq has maintained for a long time that it wants to see light
at the end of the tunnel. I also want to see the lifting of
sanctions, so that Iraq can regain its place among the community of
nations. As I have said repeatedly, the only way to achieve this is
for Iraq to fully cooperate with UN Security Council. The Security
Council had agreed a way forward on a comprehensive review. I
firmly believe that this offers Iraq genuine opportunity. The
comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps, provided
Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the end of the
tunnel.
	   The Iraqi leadership's decision not to cooperate with UNSCOM at
a time when the Council was undertaking these efforts came as a
surprise to me and, I suspect, to all Council members.
	   I, therefore, appeal once again to President Saddam Hussein and
the Iraqi leadership to take this opportunity to resume cooperation
with UNSCOM and the IAEA. This would be good for the Iraqi people,
for the region and for the world.''
	   The Security Council remains actively seized of this matter. I
should, therefore, be grateful for an early response to my appeal.
	   Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest
consideration,
	   Kofi A. Annan.

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi ambassador saying offer is unconditional
and annex contains Iraq's preferences; secretary-general saying the
Security Council may want further clarification from Iraq; Council
now scheduled to meet at 2230 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council meets Saturday
to consider Iraq's offer to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to return
to Iraq, but questions were immediately raised on whether it was
unconditional.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz assured him that Iraq's decision was
unconditional _ and that a controversial annex attached to the
letter ``was for our consideration and there were no conditions.''
	   And Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon reiterated Saturday
evening that Iraq had unconditionally decided to allow the
immediate resumption of work by the U.N. Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Hamdoon said the annex to the letter only contained Iraq's
points of view and preferences, ``but they are by no means
conditions.''
	   ``Our unequivocal statement has been that Iraq is restoring its
ties with UNSCOM and they are welcome to go anytime they want from
now on to Iraq. And that's very much unconditional,'' he said
earlier as he left his New York residence.
	   But British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in London that Iraq
must state categorically that the nine points in the annex, which
are also mentioned in the letter, are not conditions.
	   ``They cannot be conditions _ and what we all must be very sure
of is that the Iraqi position has to be unconditional, not
hedged,'' Blair said. ``The compliance must be immediate and it
must be unconditional.''
	   Later, when Annan arrived at the United Nations, he was somewhat
more cautious.
	   ``I think at least they've made a step in the right direction,
and as I indicated this morning, it's a positive development. But
the council may want further clarifications.''

Celta upsets Real Madrid 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Celta de Vigo stunned Real Madrid Saturday
with a 2-1 win that was doubly sweet, giving it the league lead for
at least a day and its first victory in Santiago Bernabeu Stadium
in 50 years.
	   Celta ran up a 2-0 lead and held on for dear life as a resurgent
Real Madrid cut the lead to one and threatened to tie but
ultimately failed despite having plenty of chances to score in the
second half.
	   At least for a day, Celta, one of several mice that have roared
this season in Spain's top soccer division, controls first place
with 20 points, one ahead of the other big upstart, Mallorca.
	   Real Madrid drops from second to third place with 18 points. The
last time it lost at home to Celta was in 1948 with a 0-4 drubbing.
	   On Saturday, Celta's first goal came in the 22nd minute on a
penalty kick by Lubo Penev after Brazil's Roberto Carlos was called
for fouling Claude Makelele.
	   A diving Makelele punched in a header in the 54th minute on a
pass from Valery Karpin to make it 2-0.
	   Eight minutes later Real Madrid fought back to 2-1 on a rocket
of a free kick by Carlos. The ball split the Celta defense wall and
was still rising when it sailed past goalkeeper Richard Dutruel.
	   Madrid had multiple chances to tie the game but Fernando
Morientes and Croat Davor Suker both missed golden opportunities to
score.
	   In the 76th minute Suker missed again, this time on a penalty
kick that hit the right upright. This came after Michel Salgado had
fouled Savio Bortolini.
	   In Sunday's matches, all eyes will be on Mallorca as it travels
to mid-ranked Valladolid.
	   In other games fourth-place Barcelona hosts humble Tenerife,
Deportivo La Coruna welcomes division newcomer Alaves, Athletic de
Bilbao hosts Oviedo, Betis takes on Real Sociedad and Zaragoza
welcomes Espanyol.
	   Salamanca travels to play Racing de Santander, Valencia plays
away against Extremadura and lowly Villareal takes on Atletico de
Madrid.

Tiozzo knocks out Paixao in second round

<TEXT>
	   MONT-DE-MARSAN, France (AP) _ Frenchman Fabrice Tiozzo had no
problems defending his WBA cruizerweight title Saturday, knocking
out Brazilian Ezequiel Paixao in the second round.
	   After putting his opponent on his knees with a strong right in
the final seconds of the first round, a second-round combination
from the 29-year-old from Lyon was enough to finish the fight.
	   It was Tiozzo's second defense of the title that he won in
November 1997 by beating American Nate Miller in Las Vegas.

Opposition fares well in Senate elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first official results, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech Republic's main
opposition party won the first round of Senate elections and
another opposition grouping came in second, preliminary results
showed Saturday, in a blow to the governing Social Democrats.
	   With all or nearly all results counted in 20 out of 27
districts, candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party
advanced to the second round in 17 regions in the two days of
voting.
	   They were followed by the four-party center-right coalition led
by the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 12
candidates through to the next round, according to the preliminary
results.
	   The ruling Social democrats were third with 9 candidates, which
was a disappointment to party leaders.
	   Polling stations closed at 1300 GMT, and final results were
expected late Sunday.
	   Exit polls indicated that none of the candidates gained more
than 50 percent of first round vote, meaning that run-off elections
would be necessary in all districts
	   The 81-member Senate, often criticized as ineffective, was
created in 1996 mainly as a safety mechanism to allow the country
to function in the event of a constitutional crisis. It can pass
some laws if the more powerful upper house is dissolved.
	   At stake in the elections were the seats of 27 Senate members
whose terms had run out. Candidates had to get a 50 percent
majority to win the election outright or face a run-off between the
two top finishers. The run-offs were scheduled for Nov. 20-21.
	   The Senate vote was in part considered a test of support for the
government of Premier Milos Zeman.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His government survived in
Parliament thanks to a pact struck with the runner-up, the
center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   ``I expected we would fare better,'' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
commented on the election results.
	   Turnout was estimated at 30 percent, the lowest number of voters
ever taking part in any Czech elections. Election fatigue after a
relatively recent national election could have contributed to the
lack of voter enthusiasm.
	   ``I'm worried by the low turnout,'' Zeman said.
	   Before the vote Friday and Saturday, the Civic Democratic Party
controlled 29 seats in the Senate. Twelve of those seats were up
for grabs in the current vote.
	   The Social Democrats had 26 senators, with six being contested.
The rest of the seats were controlled by four other smaller
parties, including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and the
Communists.
	   The relatively disappointing showing for the governing party may
have more to do with personalities than policies. The Civic
Democrats, the former governing party, had the better-known
candidates for the seats.
	   The four-member opposition bloc that was in second place
appeared to get most support from center-right voters who distrust
the Civic Democrats.

Blair says Iraq crisis not over yet, letter ambiguous
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of newspaper article by defense secretary

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday that the
crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq is ``by no means over
yet,'' saying it is unclear whether Iraq's offer to allow weapons
inspections to resume their work is unconditional.
	   Forces remain on alert, poised for military action without
further warning, he said.
	   Blair spoke after assessing a letter that Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz wrote to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
saying Iraq would allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their
work at suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
	   The letter ``appears to promise'' resumption of weapons
inspections, Blair said, adding that the letter is ambiguous as to
whether the inspectors can return without conditions.
	   Referring to nine ``points'' included with the letter, Blair
said ``any conditions of this nature are unacceptable.''
	   ``We are not even in the position yet that we can be sure from
this letter that the inspectors are to be allowed back in
unconditionally,'' he said. ``They cannot be conditions.''
	   ``The Iraqi position has to be unconditional, not hedged about,
not confused, not subject to this point or that point _
unconditional,'' he said. ``Compliance with the agreement must be
absolute.''
	   There can be no negotiation, no further deals, no more
amendments to what they have agreed, Blair said.
	   ``We can't have a situation where there is confusion as to the
terms upon which the inspectors do their work,'' he said. ``In the
meantime, our forces remain on alert to the possibility of military
action without further warning.''
	   A spokeswoman for Blair, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said Britain will be looking to Iraq to clarify whether
the nine points are conditions.
	   A Blair spokesman said the prime minister had held four
telephone conversations with U.S. President Bill Clinton in the
past 24 hours, the final one to discuss Iraq's latest offer lasting
an hour.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson wrote in an article for the
News of the World tabloid newspaper Sunday that Britain and the
United States were determined to bring Saddam Hussein's ``constant
cat and mouse game'' to an end and that ``Arab countries are now
behind the move to bring him to heel.''
	   ``With no one holding him back, he could produce germ warfare
weapons within a week, and it would take him only a few more weeks
to produce chemical weapons,'' Robertson wrote. ``And do not
believe he would not use them to further his ambitions. He has done
it before.''

Text of Annan letter to Saddam Hussein on Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS letter heading, 1st graf to fix typos. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   His Excellency
	   Mr. Saddam Hussein
	   President of the Republic of Iraq
	   Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council
	   Baghdad
	   Excellency,
	   As you may know already, I interrupted an official visit to
North Africa yesterday and returned to New York in view of the
worsening crisis with regard to Iraq. This afternoon and evening
(Nov. 13), I met with the members of the Security Council for four
hours in order to review the situation. I can report to you that
without exception, all the members of the Security Council
expressed preference for a diplomatic solution of the crisis. As
you are aware, I have made continuous efforts myself over the past
three months to bring about such a solution.
	   The Security Council also unanimously endorsed the press
statement I issued in Marrakech on 11 November in which I addressed
a personal appeal to you, Mr. President, to take the necessary
steps for a diplomatic solution to become possible. For ease of
reference, I am reproducing below the text of this statement.
	   ``I am saddened and burdened by the Iraqi decision of 5 August
and 31 October to not cooperate with UNSCOM.
	   I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi
Government to rescind its decision and resume immediate cooperation
with UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors.
	   Iraq has maintained for a long time that it wants to see light
at the end of the tunnel. I also want to see the lifting of
sanctions, so that Iraq can regain its place among the community of
nations. As I have said repeatedly, the only way to achieve this is
for Iraq to fully cooperate with UN Security Council. The Security
Council had agreed a way forward on a comprehensive review. I
firmly believe that this offers Iraq genuine opportunity. The
comprehensive review will map out the remaining steps, provided
Iraq cooperates, thus allowing them to see light at the end of the
tunnel.
	   The Iraqi leadership's decision not to cooperate with UNSCOM at
a time when the Council was undertaking these efforts came as a
surprise to me and, I suspect, to all Council members.
	   I, therefore, appeal once again to President Saddam Hussein and
the Iraqi leadership to take this opportunity to resume cooperation
with UNSCOM and the IAEA. This would be good for the Iraqi people,
for the region and for the world.''
	   The Security Council remains actively seized of this matter. I
should, therefore, be grateful for an early response to my appeal.
	   Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest
consideration,
	   Kofi A. Annan.

McEnroe rallies past Borg in glimpse of past
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ John McEnroe restored the old days for a
moment, tantrums and all, rallying from a first-set loss to beat
former nemesis Bjorn Borg 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 10-3 at an ATP Senior
tour event Saturday.
	   As in their days on the regular ATP Tour, the two old foes
entertained the audience and McEnroe reverted to his ranting ways,
throwing a racket, shouting and arguing with the umpire, protesting
a serve ruled an ace.
	   At one point, he even appealed to Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman, who as a tennis fan sat in the audience, for a close line
call.
	   Borg jumped out to a 4-1 lead before McEnroe rallied to even the
first set. Borg again jumped ahead 6-3 in the tiebreak and won the
set.
	   McEnroe recovered in the second set and then won the ``super
tiebreak,'' winning the first eight points before cruising to
victory.
	   In the other Group A match in the round-robin competition, Mats
Wilander had unexpectedly tough time before overcoming Iranian
Mansour Bahrami, 5-7, 6-4, 10-6.
	   In Group B, Guy Forget of France defeated Guillermo Vilas of
Argentina, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Henri Leconte and Croatian Goran Prpic fought a tough match
before the Frenchman prevailed 7-6 (7-5), 7-5.
	   Wilander faces McEnroe on Sunday, while Borg plays against
Bahrami. Leconte will face Vilas and Prpic will play against
Forget.
	   Winners of Sunday's matches will play in the finals on Monday.

Marseille extends lead at top to four points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ League leader Marseille continued its impressive
start to the season with a 1-0 win against last year's champion
Lens, to move four points clear at the top.
	   Second-placed Bordeaux was surprisingly held to a goalless draw
by lowly Sochaux, while Rennes also faltered, with a 0-0 draw at
home to Lyon.
	   The results leave Marseille with 36 points, Bordeaux on 32 and
Rennes with 27.
	   At Marseille, a 30th minute goal by Christophe Dugarry was
enough to win a closely-contested battle, watched by more than
50,000 spectators.
	   The result preserves Marseille's unbeaten start to the season.
	   Bordeaux piled on the pressure against Sochaux, but despite good
attempts from striker Sylvain Wiltord and midfielder Johan Micoud,
the second-placed club had to settle for a single point.
	   Lyon, which has struggled of late after a good start, deserved
its point at Rennes, and stays in fifth place.
	   The challenge of 1997 Monaco took a knock, when Jean Tigana's
team lost 3-1 at Bastia.
	   Monaco conceded an early goal to Piotr Swierczewski, but
equalized with a Ludovic Giuly strike in the 57th minute.
	   Goals in the 65th minute from Pierre-Yves Andre and 73rd minute
by Frederic Nee gave the Corsican side three points.
	   In other games Saturday: Metz 1, Nantes 0; Montpellier 3,
Auxerre 0; Toulouse 1, Nancy 1.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis, police
fired shots into the air to disperse thousands of people
demonstrating against the Malaysian government.
	   It was the first time that security forces have fired shots
since anti-government protests began with the dismissal of Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2, triggering social unrest.
	   Defying thousands of police and security officers stationed in
Kuala Lumpur during the international meeting, 3,000 people rallied
downtown to criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Some of the demonstrators marched toward the hotel where U.S.
officials were to stay for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit.
	   The crowd called on the United States to ``save us from
Mahathir!''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was due to arrive at the summit
Monday, canceled those plans so that he could focus attention on
the crisis in Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections. Vice President Al
Gore was to attend the summit in Clinton's place.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in the
Malaysian capital late Saturday, just as demonstrators set a police
motorcycle on fire several blocks from the Renaissance Hotel.

	   Developments Saturday in the crisis with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspectors:
	   ___
	   Iraq backs down from its freeze of cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz sends a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan saying the inspectors can resume their
work immediately.
	   In an annex to his letter, Aziz spells out what Iraq expects the
United Nations to do, including conduct a comprehensive review of
the country's progress in dismantling its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ___
	   The U.N. special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, says the Aziz
letter grants an unconditional go-ahead for U.N. weapons
inspections to resume. But the tone of the annex raises fears that
the U.N. Security Council might regard the Iraqi reversal as
insufficient.
	   ___
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair says the crisis is ``by no
means over yet,'' and that U.S. and British forces remain poised
for action. The prime minister says Aziz's letter ``appears to
promise'' a resumption of weapons inspections, but was ambiguous as
to whether the inspectors can return without conditions.
	   ___
	   U.S. military planners said the more than 130 aircraft and
21,500 troops ordered to the Gulf last week would continue on their
way. Already in the Gulf area are 23,500 troops and 23 warships
including eight vessels armed with long-range Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   ___
	   Saturday evening, the United States rejects Iraq's proposal.
``It is unacceptable,'' national security adviser Sandy Berger
says. The ongoing crisis prompts U.S. President Bill Clinton to
cancel a trip to Malaysia for an Asian-Pacific economic summit.
Berger says Clinton would consult with the allies on the next
steps. He says the administration remains poised to take military
action against Iraq.

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - World champion Alexei Yagudin beat
teammate Alexander Abt in a battle of quads to take the men's event
at the Nations Cup Saturday with Russians on the verge of a sweep
of all the events.
	   In the ice dance, two more world champions, Angelika Krylova and
Oleg Ovsiannikov, used a controversial routine entirely to drums
and percussion instruments to win.
	   Earlier Saturday, Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov won the
pairs event over a weak field, the first of three finals during the
day.
	   Russians are 1-2 after the women's short program with Yelena
Sokolova ahead of European champion Maria Butyrskaya. The long
program is Sunday.
	   Yagudin landed six triples and a quadruple toe loop to score all
5.8s and 5.9s in another impressive routine to the music from
``Lawrence of Arabia.'' At his Skate America victory two weeks ago
he landed nine triples, one more than allowed.
	   ``In four weeks I have won four competetions but it was really
hard to skate,'' Yagudin said. ``At this moment I can say I am
ready for the rest of the season.''
	   Abt started with a triple axel-triple loop then tried his quad,
slightly two-footing it. He scaled down one triple and turned out
of his second triple axel which hurt his chances. He also had
Arabian music and an Arabian costume with billowing pants.
	   He says he must do better to hope to gain a spot on the Russian
team, where at least five skaters who have done quads will battle
for three spots for the European and world championships.
	   ``By the end of the season I hope to be doing another quad in
the program, maybe in combination or another type of quad.'' Abt
said.
	   Third was Andreas Vlascenko of Germany.
	   Krylova and Ovsiannikov performed a very untraditional dance
program with no music, just different rhythms of drums.
	   Although the steps were quick and the positions sometimes
unique, it is sure to provoke controversy.
	   ``I think this programs has a lot of risks. Before we were very
dramatic, like with `Carmen,'' Krylova said. ``But we are world
champions and I think we can take risks and try something new.''
	   However the judges scored only moderate marks for a world
champions of mostly 5.6 and 5.7 with only one 5.8 for technical
merit. The presentaion marks were mostly 5.8s and 5.9s.
	   Bourne and Kraatz showed more dance movements to the driving
beat of techo-rock beat.
	   ``It's quite a work-out from beginning to end,'' Bourne said.
``It's 90s music, music of today.''
	   But she agreed with Krylova that change is needed in the sport.
	   ``The main objective of a dancer is to be versatile and show
something different every year,'' Bourne said. ``And I think that's
why all of us are doing something different.''
	   Petrova and Tikhonov outclassed the other five pairs in their
event although they have been skating together for less than six
months.
	   Tikhonov skated in shows for nearly four years but did not give
up his eligible status.
	   ``I think professional shows helped me,'' Tikhonov said. ``But
all this time I missed competing.''
	   German veterans Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller were second.
	   Third went to the American team of John and Tiffany Stiegler,
trained by Russian pair legend Irina Rodnina.
	   Sokolova took the women's short program as Butyskaya fell and
barely held another jump.
	   Butyrskaya won Skate American two weeks ago and was expected to
take advantage of the absence of Olympic champion Tara Lipinksi and
world champion Michelle Kwan this season.
	   The 18-year-old Sokolova nailed her triple lutz-double toe loop
combination and triple loop jumps.
	   The only error was when she stumbled at the end of her footwork
and went into the boards.
	   ``After the three succsssful jumps, I had mentally finished the
program. I just lost my concentration and suddenly my legs went out
under me,'' Sokolova said.

Celta upsets Real Madrid 2-1

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Celta ended a half-century losing streak at
famed Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on Saturday, getting goals from
Luboslav Penev and Claude Makelele to shock Real Madrid 2-1 and
take over the Spanish league lead at least for a day.
	   Penev's first-half penalty and Makelele's second-half header
staked Celta to a 2-0 lead and it hung on despite repeated Madrid
chances forays _ including a penalty that hit the post _ for its
first victory on Real's home field since a 4-0 victory in 1948.
	   It also improved Celta to 10-5-5 and 20 points, one more than
Mallorca, which plays on Sunday, and two more than Madrid, which
fell to third.
	   Penev converted his penalty in the 22nd minute after Madrid's
Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos was called for fouling Makelele.
	   Makelele dived to get his head to a cross from Valery Karpin and
knocked it in the 54th minute.
	   Real Madrid got within a goal eight minutes later on a trademark
free kick Roberto Carlos. The ball split the Celta defense wall and
was still rising when it sailed past goalkeeper Richard Dutruel.
	   Madrid had multiple chances to equalize but Fernando Morientes
and Croat Davor Suker both failed to finish opportunities.
	   Suker also blew a penalty attempt, putting if off the right post
after Michel Salgado had fouled Savio Bortolini.
	   Mallorca can retake the lead Sunday as it travels to mid-ranked
Valladolid.
	   In other games, fourth-place Barcelona hosts Tenerife, Deportivo
La Coruna welcomes division newcomer Alaves, Athletic de Bilbao
hosts Oviedo, Betis takes on Real Sociedad and Zaragoza welcomes
Espanyol.
	   Salamanca travels to play Racing Santander, Valencia plays at
Extremadura and lowly Villareal takes on Atletico Madrid.

	   THOUSAND OAKS, California (AP) _ Greg Norman and partner Steve
Elkington birdied the final three holes of the second-round's
best-ball format Saturday and remained in contention in the
Australian's Shark Shootout exhibition tournament.
	   Americans Davis Love III and Brad Faxon played the first 11
holes in 9-under and finished with a 10-under 62 to lead at 130,
but Norman and his compatriot along with four other teams were only
one stroke behind. Sunday's final round is a scramble format at
Sherwood Country Club.
	   ``Now we've got a true shootout,'' Norman said after he and
Elkington finished with a 64. ``It's going to be an interesting day
tomorrow.''
	   Americans John Daly and Fuzzy Zoeller, who led after the first
round of alternate shots, had a 66 and were joined at 131 by the
teams of Scott Hoch-Costantino Rocca, Billy Andrade-Jay Haas and
Tom Kite-Billy Mayfair.
	   The three teams at 134 included Fred Couples-Justin Leonard,
whose round of 65 was marred when neither managed better than a
double-bogey 6 at the seventh hole.
	   Norman, who was sidelined for seven months after shoulder
surgery, was far from perfect, and still not ready for a tournament
that counts. But he appeared to be making great progress with each
day, each swing and each shot that requires some touch.
	   He hit a lob wedge from a mound and over an oak tree within 4
1-2 meters (15 feet) at No. 1 for a birdie and continued to play
most bunker shots well _ one that set up a birdie at the par-5
13th. He gave his team another birdie by hitting to about 4 1-2
meters (15 feet) at the 537-yard (483-mete) 16th hole and
two-putting.
	   ``I was pretty much in every hole, which was good,'' Norman
said. ``The big deal today was I started hitting more feel shots. I
was chipping good and had good visualization from that aspect. And
I drove the ball great, which was a big plus.
	   ``All in all, the same steady improvement. It's coming along
nicely.''
	   Norman is the host of the event, which is celebrating its
10-year anniversary, but he has never won it.
	   ``Do we care? I think we care,'' Norman said. ``I'm glad to be
back, and glad to be back with a chance to win. Both Steve and I
are in sync. It's a matter of playing the scramble well.''
	   Love carried the load early for his team, starting with a
birdie, eagle and a birdie. Faxon finally pitched in to help them
make the turn in 29 and they added two more birdies on the back
nine.
	   ``I think we're going into our best format tomorrow,'' Love
said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Deforestation along Rio de Janeiro
state's Atlantic coast is raging out of control because of farmers
clearing land to plant new crops, according to a report Saturday.
	   Between 1995 and 1997, some 38,739 acres (15,684 hectares) of
rain forest were destroyed _ or four times the area of Belgium _
the environmental group SOS Atlantic Forest said, according to the
O Globo newspaper.
	   Brazil's Atlantic coast forest is disappearing 2 1-2 times
faster than the Amazon jungle. The forest, which once blanketed
Brazil's 4,500-mile (7,200-kilometer) eastern coast, has been
reduced to just 3 percent of its original area.
	   The forest is still home to 10,000 types of plants and trees,
400 species of birds and 171 endangered species, including 20
primates.
	   State officials have asked Governor-elect Anthony Garotinho to
create a commission to stop the deforestation.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso is expected to sign legislation next week authorizing
alternative punishments that could ease prison overcrowding.
	   The legislation would permit judges to sentence nonviolent
offenders facing short prison terms to house arrest or a mandatory
drug treatment. They could also order them to pay an indemnity to
victims, sign over their assets to a national penitentiary fund or
restrict their movements.
	   ``It's an important first step in addressing the problem of
severe overcrowding,'' James Cavallaro, the director of the Brazil
office of Human Rights Watch told The Associated Press by telephone
Saturday.
	   Late last year, the former Justice Minister estimated that
30,000 inmates or nearly 20 percent of the nation's prison
population would be eligible for alternative service if Congress
approved the law.
	   The legislation is also expected to alleviate a slow justice
system that keeps many inmates waiting years to stand trial.
	   Nationwide, an estimated 170,000 prisoners are crammed into a
system designed to accommodate less than half that number. Inmates
often sleep on floors or are forced to share the same bed by
sleeping in shifts. Substandard food, hygiene and medical care is
also common.
	   Prison officials concede that overcrowding is the principal
reason for violent rebellions that have become almost a daily
occurrence. In fact, the majority who revolt demand nothing more
than to be transferred to a penitentiary.

Spanish Crown Prince, French President survey hurricane damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Spanish Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon
began a tour of storm-ravaged Central America on Saturday, while
Spain announced it was donating dlrs 15 million in aid and supplies
for recovery efforts.
	   Earlier in the day, Felipe de Borbon toured the northern
Nicaraguan towns of Tititapa and Sebaco, which had been hard hit by
Hurricane Mitch last month. The prince also was to visit a shelter
in Managua for residents of communities around Lake Nicaragua.
	   In San Salvador, El Salvador, Spanish Ambassador Andres Collado
said his government and several non-government organizations would
soon send dlrs 15 million in aid to Central America. It was not
immediately clear how much of that would come from the government.
	   ``The emergency aid consists of medicine, supplies and
clothes,'' Collado told reporters.
	   Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people throughout Central
America. Countries from around the world have promised millions of
dollars in grants and debt relief, but many Central Americans have
expressed frustration at the slow pace of foreign aid.
	   French President Jacques Chirac arrived Saturday in Guatemala,
beginning a tour of Central America to survey damage from Mitch. He
had spent the past three days in Mexico.
	   On Monday, U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton is scheduled to
arrive in Managua.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq insisted Saturday that its proposal to
let U.N. arms inspectors resume work was genuine and free of
conditions, despite the offer's rejection by the United States.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz assured him that Iraq's decision _ conveyed to
him in a letter _ was unconditional and that a controversial
addition to the letter ``was for our consideration and there were
no conditions.''
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said the letter's annex
only contained Iraq's points of view and preferences, ``but they
are by no means conditions.''
	   But U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger spurned the
letter as ``unacceptable,'' saying it was ``neither unequivocable
nor unconditional,'' and said Washington remained poised to take
military action against Baghdad.
	   The negative U.S. reaction came within hours of an initially
promising response from the United Nations to the Iraqi letter, in
which Baghdad stepped back from its earlier refusal to let U.N.
arms inspectors contiunue working. Iraq hoped the letter would
defuse the current crisis over arms inspections and avert a
possible U.S. military strike.
	   Iraq insisted that the threat of force was not a factor in its
decision. ``We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive
American campaign,'' the Iraqi government said.
	   Instead, Aziz's letter repeated Iraq's goal that renewed
cooperation would ``give a further chance to achieve justice by
lifting sanctions'' imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council met Saturday night to decide whether
Iraq's stand meets its demands for unconditionally allowing the
inspectors to work.
	   ``I think at least they've made a step in the right direction,''
Annan said Saturday.
	   But British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Saturday that the
crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq is ``by no means over
yet,'' saying it is unclear whether Iraq's offer is unconditional.
	   Berger said military action still remained an option for U.S.
President Bill Clinton and suggested that it could be taken at any
time.
	   ``We have every reason to be skeptical. We've seen this before,
broken and unfulfilled promises,'' he said in Washington. ``The
Iraqi letter is neither unequivocable nor unconditional. ... It's
unacceptable.''
	   Berger spoke after Clinton cancelled his trip to an economic
summit this week in Malaysia.
	   Aziz's letter Saturday capped a flurry of diplomatic activity
over 24 hours, including a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and the Russian ambassador to Baghdad and a crucial letter
from Annan.
	   In the end, it may have been Annan's personality at the center
of Iraq's reversal. Aziz's letter repeatedly referred to Iraq's
trust in the secretary-general and his ``good faith and
sincerity.''
	   It was Annan who had defused the previous crisis in February
when Iraq blocked the inspectors _ who are responsible for
searching for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _ from visiting
Saddam's palaces.
	   The United States and Britain have amassed a force in the Gulf
to pressure Iraq into compliance in the latest showdown.
	   Iraq credited Security Council members Russia, China and France
for helping to defuse the standoff. The three countries have
endorsed an easing of sanctions, but they have been less vocal in
the current crisis. Russia, for example, did not send an envoy to
personally mediate this time.
	   Aziz's message to Annan, however, continued to pose a problem.
	   U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah earlier told a news conference
in Baghdad that Aziz's letter put no conditions on the return to
Baghdad of the inspectors, who left Iraq on Wednesday.
	   But the two-page annex reiterated Iraq's previous terms for a
comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N. resolutions. It
wasn't clear whether the Security Council would interpret the annex
in the way that Baghdad hopes.
	   Annan's reading of the letter, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard,
is that it ``does not have any conditionality attached to it.''
	   In the letter, Aziz urged Annan to ensure that a comprehensive
review will be ``serious, fair and fruitful.'' The annex urged that
the comprehensive review be carried out within a short time,
``seven days for example.'' In some cases, Iraq's positions are
watered-down versions of past demands.
	   The United States and Britain have been adamant that there be no
easing of sanctions unless Iraq fulfills requirements to eliminate
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council has said sanctions will not be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that all such weapons have been destroyed.
	   Hamdoon said in New York that inspectors would be allowed to
return to Iraq immediately. He added that Annan's letter on Friday
had promised ``that Iraq's case would be looked on favorably and
the comprehensive review would be taking place in the right time.''
	   Elsewhere, both Israel and the Palestinians welcomed signs that
a possible military strike against Iraq had been averted. Iraq
fired 39 Scud missiles into Israeli cities during the Gulf War.
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of six Gulf nations joined
Egypt and Syria in issuing a communique warning that they would
hold the Iraqi government responsible for any consequences for its
refusal to back down.
	   Still, Iraq once again brought attention to the U.N. sanctions,
which limit the sale of oil, have devastated Iraq's economy and
made its 22 million people dependent on a U.N. relief program.

	   Between 1995 and 1997, some 38,739 acres (15,684 hectares) of
rain forest were destroyed _ or four times the area of Belgium _
the environmental group SOS Atlantic Forest said, according to the
O Globo newspaper.
	   Brazil's Atlantic coast forest is disappearing 2 1-2 times
faster than the Amazon jungle. The forest, which once blanketed
Brazil's 4,500-mile (7,200-kilometer) eastern coast, has been
reduced to just 3 percent of its original area.
	   The forest is still home to 10,000 types of plants and trees,
400 species of birds and 171 endangered species, including 20
primates.
	   State officials have asked Governor-elect Anthony Garotinho to
create a commission to stop the deforestation.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso is expected to sign legislation next week authorizing
alternative punishments that could ease prison overcrowding.
	   The legislation would permit judges to sentence nonviolent
offenders facing short prison terms to house arrest or a mandatory
drug treatment. They could also order them to pay an indemnity to
victims, sign over their assets to a national penitentiary fund or
restrict their movements.
	   ``It's an important first step in addressing the problem of
severe overcrowding,'' James Cavallaro, the director of the Brazil
office of Human Rights Watch told The Associated Press by telephone
Saturday.
	   Late last year, the former Justice Minister estimated that
30,000 inmates or nearly 20 percent of the nation's prison
population would be eligible for alternative service if Congress
approved the law.
	   The legislation is also expected to alleviate a slow justice
system that keeps many inmates waiting years to stand trial.
	   Nationwide, an estimated 170,000 prisoners are crammed into a
system designed to accommodate less than half that number. Inmates
often sleep on floors or are forced to share the same bed by
sleeping in shifts. Substandard food, hygiene and medical care is
also common.
	   Prison officials concede that overcrowding is the principal
reason for violent rebellions that have become almost a daily
occurrence. In fact, the majority who revolt demand nothing more
than to be transferred to a penitentiary.

 &UR; TRINIDAD: Lawyer, three clients arrested under drug law &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A lawyer and three of her clients
were charged Friday with conspiring to dispose of property
purchased with money earned through marijuana trafficking.
	   The charges are the first under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1991.
	   Authorities charged lawyer Christine Anderson and her clients,
Indira Ramcharan, Albert Baboolal and Herbert Baboolal, on Friday
evening. They were not required to enter pleas.
	   Anderson said the charges are politically motivated. She had
been a candidate on the United National Congress ticket in 1991.
The party lost that election, but gained power in 1995. By then,
Anderson said she had become disillusioned with the party.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Police to crack down on roadblocks as protests
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Police have been instructed not to
tolerate the common practice of protesters setting up roadblocks to
gain attention, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said Friday.
	   In recent years, the practice has grown as residents disgruntled
about issues ranging from poor roads to lack of utility service to
police brutality have expressed their displeasure by disrupting
traffic. Some enhance the effect by using flaming tires to build
the roadblock, often damaging the highway in the process.
	   Police said there were 207 illegal roadblocks on the island last
year and 126 through the first 10 months of this year.
	   ``People blocking roads must be aware of the consequences of
their actions and they must be prepared to pay the consequences,''
Patterson said. ``The security forces have been told that
roadblocks can't continue.''
 &UR; SURINAME: Teachers reject offer as strikes continue
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Teachers rejected a proposal to end
their strike and unionized firefighters refused to turn water hoses
on protesters in the streets as labor unrest continued this week in
Suriname.
	   Umbrella organizations representing both secondary school and
university teachers rejected an offer by Education Minister Karan
Ramsundersingh to mediate the conflict if they would return to
their jobs. The groups immediately said the offer was too little.
	   ``We want tangible results,'' said Wilgo Valies, president of
the Union of College Teachers.
	   Meanwhile, the president of the firefighters union said Saturday
his members would not use the department's water cannon against
demonstrators in the streets.
	   The newspaper De Ware Tijd reported that Police Chief Carlo
Hunsel had instructed firefighters to spray protesters with their
equipment when demonstrations resume Monday morning.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq insisted Saturday that its proposal to
let U.N. arms inspectors resume work was genuine and free of
conditions, despite the offer's rejection by the United States.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz assured him that Iraq's decision _ conveyed to him in a
letter _ was unconditional and that a controversial addition to the
letter ``was for our consideration and there were no conditions.''
Iraq's U.N. ambassador said the letter's annex only contained
Iraq's points of view and preferences, ``but they are by no means
conditions.'' However, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
spurned the letter as ``unacceptable,'' saying it was ``neither
unequivocable nor unconditional,'' and said Washington remained
poised to take military action against Baghdad. The negative U.S.
reaction came within hours of an initially promising response from
the United Nations to the Iraqi letter, in which Baghdad stepped
back from its earlier refusal to let U.N. arms inspectors contiunue
working. Iraq hoped the letter would defuse the current crisis over
arms inspections and avert a possible U.S. military strike. (IRAQ)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs set buildings afire, upturned
cars, looted shops, and attacked police officers across the
Indonesian capital Saturday while 20,000 protesters escalated their
pro-democracy campaign and marched peacefully on Parliament. The
massive protest came despite the death of at least 14 people during
the past two days when the military opened fire on students
repeatedly trying to reach the legislature. Hundreds more were
injured in the worst violence in Jakarta since riots and protests
ousted then-President Suharto in May. Ignoring demands that he
quit, Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J.
Habibie, went on national television and called for calm.
(INDONESIA)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials from 20 Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss Asia's financial crisis, police
fired shots into the air to disperse thousands of people
demonstrating against the Malaysian government. It was the first
time that security forces have fired shots since anti-government
protests began with the dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Sept. 2, triggering social unrest. Defying thousands of
police and security officers stationed in Kuala Lumpur during the
international meeting, 3,000 people rallied downtown to criticize
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Some of the demonstrators marched
toward the hotel where U.S. officials were to stay for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The crowd called on the
United States to ``save us from Mahathir!'' (APEC)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Nations set a timetable Saturday
to flesh out the Kyoto greenhouse treaty, giving themselves until
2000 to come up with real steps to combat global warming. Two weeks
of negotiations dragged beyond their Friday deadline before the 160
nations mustered sufficient resolve early Saturday to endorse a
``Buenos Aires plan of action.'' In December 1997, the United
States and 37 other industrialized nations agreed in Kyoto, Japan,
to binding reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 _
setting a target 5 percent below 1990 levels. Coming 10 months
afterward, the Buenos Aires plan signals renewed political will to
take up specific measures to fight global warming. At stake is one
of Earth's most troubling environmental issues: undue warming of
the planet believed to be exacerbated by carbon dioxide released
from burning coal and gas, principally from power plants and cars.
(GLOBAL WARMING)
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech Republic's main
opposition party won the first round of Senate elections and
another opposition grouping came in second, preliminary results
showed Saturday, in a blow to the governing Social Democrats. With
all or nearly all results counted in 20 out of 27 districts,
candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party advanced to
the second round in 17 regions in the two days of voting. They were
followed by the four-party center-right coalition led by the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, with 12 candidates
through to the next round, according to the preliminary results.
The ruling Social democrats were third with 9 candidates, which was
a disappointment to party leaders. The Senate vote was in part
considered a test of support for the government of Premier Milos
Zeman. (CZECH ELECTIONS)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on a pig protest in Portugal, Sean `Puffy'
Combs, Larry Clark, Joaquin Phoenix, Greg Kinnear, Jessica Biel. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese pig farmers forced police to
bring home the bacon Saturday, releasing dozens of piglets in a
central square to demand an increase in government aid.
	   Farmers set the squealing pigs loose outside the Agriculture
Ministry at dawn. Police chased them across the large Praca do
Comercio square, local media reports said. Firefighters were called
in to assist.
	   Local people joined the chase, loading the squirming animals
into their cars. Roast piglet is a popular, but expensive dish in
Portugal.
	   The farmers want tighter restrictions on pork imports and
increased government assistance.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When someone called a jeweler to order up dlrs
104,000 worth of gold and diamonds on the credit card of Sean
``Puffy'' Combs, the store smelled a rat.
	   But what arrived were New Jersey police officers.
	   Suspicious clerks at Manny's jeweler's called New York police
when the order was placed a few days ago, the New York Post
reported Saturday. Undercover officers arrived and waited, and were
astounded when three Newark, New Jersey, police officers pulled up
in a police truck.
	   When they tried to collect the gems, they were arrested. One of
the officers said he knew nothing about the scam and claimed he was
doing a favor for his cousin.
	   The cousin is being sought by police.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Director Larry Clark has checked himself into
a Los Angeles hospital.
	   The man who directed ``Kids,'' the 1995 controversial look at
the lives of privileged teens immersed in drugs and sex, is seeking
treatment for substance abuse, the New York Post reported Saturday.
	   The setback comes as the 59-year-old director appears poised for
mainstream success with his latest film, ``Another Day in
Paradise,'' which stars James Woods and Melanie Griffith.
	   The film, due out next month, was well-received at the Sundance
Film Festival.
	   Woods said he was ``terribly saddened'' by the news.
	   ``Larry is a truly unique artist and individual, and sometimes
that kind of artistry can have a rather tragic tradeoff with his
personal life,'' Woods said.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Joaquin Phoenix won't be serving drumsticks
at his Thanksgiving dinner table.
	   Phoenix, a strict vegetarian, appears in a new TV commercial for
the activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
trying to convince Americans that eating turkey is murder.
	   In the commercial, Phoenix, whose latest film is ``Clay
Pigeons,'' is shown on a supermarket shopping spree and the sight
of a frozen turkey display prompts him to call PETA for vegetarian
recipes.
	   ``I would love to stop the murder of turkeys,'' Phoenix said in
a PETA press statement. ``This commercial lets people know they can
enjoy the tradition of Thanksgiving without the cruelty.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Greg Kinnear says his hair helped get him his
first movie role but may have prevented him from landing a spot on
MTV.
	   The Oscar-nominated actor for ``As Good As It Gets'' tells
Redbook magazine in its December issue he caught the eye of
director Sydney Pollack while hosting the cable television program
``Talk Soup.''
	   Pollack apparently liked the way Kinnear made fun of his own
hair and invited him to audition for ``Sabrina.'' Kinnear won the
role, starring opposite Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond.
	   ``I've been lucky as far as my career goes,'' said Kinnear, who
stars with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in the upcoming film ``You've Got
Mail.''
	   ``I'm proof that good accidents happen sometimes.''
	   But his hair may also have cost him an MTV veejay slot.
	   ``This was back in the '80s, so let's just say there might have
been a little neon and maybe just a dollop of gel,'' Kinnear said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Actress Jessica Biel may be 16, but her reaction
to co-star Peter Fonda's film ``Easy Rider'' was hardly sweet. She
told him the hipster classic bored her.
	   The sassy young star of the WB television series ``7th Heaven''
played Fonda's rebellious granddaughter in last year's ``Ulee's
Gold.''
	   ``I didn't know much about him,'' she told Parade magazine of
her Oscar-nominated co-star. ``But when I got the role, my mom
rented `Easy Rider.'''
	   After 45 minutes, ``I said, `I can't take this anymore.' I was
so bored. It was like watching aerobics class.''
	   The high school junior said Fonda did not mind.
	   ``He's so cool. He just laughed and said, `Yeah, you're probably
right.'''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters flooded
the streets of the Malaysian capital demanding an end to the
17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, even as the United
States and other Pacific Rim countries rejected his recipe for
dealing with the global financial crisis.
	   In a day of setbacks for Asia's longest serving ruler, officials
finishing a statement from APEC's leaders' hewed closely to a
package of proposals from President Bill Clinton rather than
endorse Mahathir's calls for currency controls.
	   The draft of a final communique for the leaders of the 21-member
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit supported Clinton's
proposals to increase social programs to help millions of Asians
who were plunged into poverty by the steep economic downturns.
	   It also endorsed Clinton's call for new ways to get financial
assistance to debt-strapped corporations and banks in crisis
countries.
	   Clinton was scheduled to leave late Saturday night for the APEC
summit, but was sending Vice President Al Gore in his place so he
could deal with the Iraq crisis at home.
	   Protesters have been calling for Mahathir's ouster falling his
firing and subsequent jailing of his one-time protege and now
political rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   On Saturday, 3,000 anti-government demonstrators marched close
to the downtown hotel where the White House delegation will stay.
	   Shots were fired over the heads of the demonstrators at one
point during the night. The government has brought 5,700 security
officers into Kuala Lumpur to keep order during the APEC meetings.
	   A defiant Mahathir has defended the sacking of Anwar, who is now
on trial for what he and his supporters contend are trumped up
charges of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   But Clinton and a number of other leaders have refused the
customary courtesy calls on the host of the APEC summit, and
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy invited Anwar's wife to
lunch on Saturday.
	   ``It's important that these meetings take into account seriously
the changes going on, and impact on the Malaysian people,''
Axworthy told reporters after the luncheon.
	   Mahathir has blamed Asia's troubles on foreign currency
speculators and incompetent policies by the International Monetary
Fund. In September, he banned trading of the Malaysian currency
outside the country and imposed controls on foreigners trying to
pull investments out of Malaysia.
	   ``We cannot miss even one international forum and let it go
without our bringing to their attention the problem raised by
currency speculation,'' he said in an interview Saturday with the
Malaysian government news agency, Bernama.
	   The draft APEC statement, however, praised the IMF's handling of
the crisis that has leveled a number of Asian economies and Russia,
although the statement conceded that the APEC leaders had not
accurately foreseen the severity of the financial turmoil.
	   ``The challenge before us is to support an early and sustained
recovery of the region, to contain the risks of contagion and
prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, which will be issued at the conclusion of the leaders'
talks on Wednesday.
	   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
the only section of the document where serious disagreement
remained was the portion dealing with free trade.
	   Foreign and trade ministers of APEC countries hoped to wrap up
discussions in this area on Sunday with a deal slashing tariffs in
nine key industries covering dlrs 1.5 trillion of global trade. But
Japan remained adamant that it could not lower barriers in the
politically sensitive areas of fish and forestry products.
	   Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters Saturday
that she remained optimistic that a compromise could be reached by
Sunday afternoon.
	   But a Japanese official complained that a ``gang of four'' _ the
United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand _ were refusing to
yield while other APEC countries were more sympathetic to Japan's
problems of trying to lower trade protections for domestic
industries at a time the country is in a deep recession.

As crisis built, Iraq found apathy and ambiguity in Arab world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CAI101 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ When war seemed imminent with the United
States, the Iraqi government reached out to fellow Arabs who stood
by it in the past, declaring that now was the time for Arab
countries to stand together again in Iraq's moment of need.
	   But even Arab states friendly to Iraq in earlier confrontations
gave replies that were lukewarm at best, and hostile at worst.
Others, like Kuwait _ the memory of his 1990 invasion still vivid _
even quietly rooted for Saddam Hussein's fall.
	   Across the world, Iraq's standing seemed to be diminished this
time around _ the third crisis in less than a year. Fewer envoys
visited Baghdad and even traditional allies in the U.N. Security
Council like Russia, China and France seemed less vocal.
	   But the lack of Arab support, many believe, proved crucial and
was felt most acutely by the Iraqi leadership _ perhaps forcing
Iraq into a quicker retreat and making Washington's job far easier
than last time in gaining acquiescence for an attack.
	   ``The proof that the Iraqi regime is behind the times is that it
still believes in an Arab rebellion from the Mediterranean to the
Gulf that will strike at everything that is American, including
American interests,'' said Al-Riyadh, an official Saudi newspaper.
	   No Arab country, at least publicly, wanted a U.S. strike, and
anger remains pitched at the destruction wrought by U.N. sanctions:
One in 3 children are believed to be malnourished and drinking
water mixes with sewage in a country that was once one of the Arab
world's richest.
	   Saddam himself still enjoys a vein of popular support among
Arabs resentful of America's support of Israel.
	   But many seemed to have grown apathetic, even bored, by a drama
that again brought the Gulf to the brink of war. As the crisis
peaked, Kuwaitis took to the streets _ not over Iraq, but to
celebrate their soccer team's victory in the Gulf Cup.
	   ``The problem is between America and Iraq, and we don't have
anything to do with it,'' said Amr Tawfiq, a 20-year-old vendor
selling cigarettes and candy in downtown Cairo.
	   Since the latest crisis began, Iraq made a concerted effort to
court its Arab neighbors. The first interview by an Iraqi official
was granted to the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera, one of the Arab world's
most prominent stations. And Iraqi officials repeatedly warned that
Arabs would not stand by as a fellow Arab nation was attacked.
	   The pleas Saturday were more desperate _ a sign that even the
government realized its campaign had found little success.
	   ``Arab governments and peoples have to assume their role now by
effectively backing Iraq in its confrontation with American
threats,'' urged Al-Qadisiyya, an Iraqi government newspaper.
	   ``Iraq has greatly and generously sacrificed the blood of its
sons and its money for the sake of Arab nations,'' it said.
	   In the end, Iraq credited Russian, Chinese and French diplomacy
for its decision to allow the inspectors to return _ and it
pointedly did not mention any Arab country. On Saturday, it was the
Russian Foreign Ministry that was among the first to offer praise.
	   If Iraq's call for unity resonated anywhere in the Arab world,
it was in the street, particularly among Islamic activists.
	   To many, the United States remains the greatest enemy, a
perception heightened by its missile attacks on Sudan and
Afghanistan in August and Washington's steadfast support for
Israel. To them, the choice between Iraq and America was no choice
at all.
	   ``We should support our brothers, the Iraqis, against the
American aggression with all the power we have and with weapons, if
necessary,'' said Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, the grand sheik of
al-Azhar, one of the Muslim world's leading religious and
educational institutions.
	   But crucially, no Arab leader, not even American foes like
Sudan, came close to making a similar statement.

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with counci members divided over
conditionality of offer. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Security Council members were divided
over Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, which has been rejected by the United States but
welcomed by France, Russia and China.
	   Before the council met, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon,
asked to meet the council president _ who this month happens to be
Acting U.S. Ambasssador Peter Burleigh _ to reiterate that the
Iraqi offer was unconditional and unequivocal and that the
inspectors could return to work immediately.
	   The United States was the only Security Council member to
totally reject the Iraqi offer when the meeting got under way
Saturday evening. Britain said it remained skeptical and was
keeping its options open.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said his government was
looking for ``a very immediate and unconditional statement'' that
Iraq was going to resume full, unfettered cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   But most of the council, along with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, reacted positively to a letter from the Iraqi leadership
announcing that its ban on dealing with the inspectors had been
rescinded.
	   ``I think at least they've made a step in the right direction
... it's a positive development,'' Annan said. ``But the council
may want further clarifications.''
	   What raised serious questions in the United States and Britain
was a two-page annex to the letter reiterating Iraq's previous
terms for a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N.
resolutions. The United States, which has already rejected many of
these terms, said Baghdad was attaching conditions.
	   But the French, Russians and Chinese, who have been sympathetic
to Iraq's demand to lift sanctions, disagreed.
	   Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said the Iraqis had
clearly explained that the annex was just Baghdad's views _ and the
letter unconditionally and unequivocally agreed that UNSCOM could
resume work.
	   In the past week there has been much speculation over whether
Annan should go to Iraq to mediate. When Lavrov was asked if the
secretary-general should leave for Baghdad on Saturday, he replied,
``UNSCOM should go to Baghdad. This is not a crisis any more.''
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet insisted that the annex did not
impose any conditions.
	   And China's Ambassador Qin Huasun said: ``We welcome Iraq's
decision.''
	   Hamdoon met Burleigh Saturday evening, shortly after U.S.
President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
rejected the Iraqi letter, saying it was ``neither unequivocal nor
unconditional. ... It is unacceptable.'' He said the letter, and
especially the annex, had ``more holes than Swiss cheese.''
	   Hamdoon said he told Burleigh that the annex ``contains the
views and the preferences of the government of Iraq'' on a
comprehensive review but had nothing to do with Baghdad's decision
to resume relations UNSCOM or with the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
	   ``It's not linked to the unconditional, unequivocal statement
that was contained in the letter about our resumption of our
relations with UNSCOM and the IAEA,'' Hamdoon said.
	   He told reporters that Burleigh promised to convey his
statement, which he said was the official view of the Iraqi
government.
	   ``I told him that because of the confusion that I am seeing here
with the American media at large, and also from the statements that
are emanating from Washington, I wanted to make it clear and end
all that confusion,'' he said.
	   ``He did ask about a written letter. I told him that my
statement to you is on behalf of the government of Iraq and it is
as binding as any other written statement,'' Hamdoon said.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Fed up with her dead-end life in
Honduras, Rosa Lidia Lazo got on a bus and headed north in search
of the American dream.
	   After a string of clandestine, underpaid jobs washing dishes or
waiting tables, she got tired of living in fear of discovery by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and returned home.
	   But after Hurricane Mitch, she and thousands of Central
Americans are thinking of taking another chance in the land of
opportunity.
	   ``There are no options here,'' said Lazo, a short, sturdy woman
of 43.
	   Her 3-year-old daughter, Carla, stands in the middle of a bare,
muddy floor. Floodwaters that reached the roof carried away her
toys, bed and clothes as well as everything else in the three-room
brick house. Huge cracks run through the walls, and it's uncertain
how safe the structure is.
	   ``Everything is gone, everything, everything,'' Lazo said as
workers and students dug through tons of mud clogging the street
outside. ``Now I must go back.''
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse has warned that a new
wave of migrants will go ``walking, swimming and running up north''
unless other countries _ especially the United States _ help
Central America get back on its feet. When Mitch pummeled the
region last month, it left about 10,000 people dead and devastated
the nations' economies.
	   Hondurans take the outflow of people for granted.
	   ``It is as certain as night follows day,'' said taxi driver Jose
Ramirez Ramos. ``The destruction was so terrible, there are no
jobs. And the dollar is the dollar.''
	   The storm hit Honduras especially hard. The coffee harvest was
severely damaged, and many of the roads and bridges needed to get
it to market were wiped out. The banana crop was decimated. Some
7,000 people lost their lives.
	   Heading north has always been an option for Central Americans,
and governments are reluctant to stop it. The money expatriates
send home _ about dlrs 400 million a year _ is the third largest
source of foreign revenue in Honduras. In El Salvador, it's No. 1.
	   Honduras has always had a strong bond with the United States,
especially on its Atlantic coast where much of the population
speaks English as well as Spanish. As of December 1995, nearly
100,000 Hondurans were living in the United States. More than 3,700
were deported last year.
	   Waves of refugees headed north from other Central American
countries during the 1980s to escape civil war.
	   Honduran officials say the solution is to create jobs at home.
That's why Central American countries have asked the U.S.
government to grant them equal status with Mexico as partners in
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
	   Because of the hurricane, the Clinton administration has put off
until the end of the year deportations of illegal immigrants from
citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
	   Sooner or later, though, the deportations are bound to resume.
	   Nicaraguan refugees, with support from anti-communist Cuban
exiles, won amnesty from deportation if they can prove they were in
the United States by 1996. Honduras wants the same privileges but
began lobbying too late, and Congress never got around to voting on
it last session.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy is keeping a tight lid on visas.
Applicants for a tourist visa have to convince interviewers in 30
seconds that they don't plan to stay. Single men under 25 often
have little chance.
	   That was one reason Michael Albray went through the back door.
In 1990, he hitchhiked to Tijuana, Mexico, and found a ``coyote'' _
or guide for illegal immigrants _ who slipped him into the United
States through a hole in the border fence.
	   Sacramento, California, was full of opportunities for a
20-year-old. He sold papers, clipped hedges, painted houses. The
dlrs 50 he earned each day was a fortune.
	   ``I had a car, and money and friends,'' said Albray, whose nose
ring and wraparound shades recall his American life.
	   But he got caught and was deported. Back in Honduras, washing
cars for meager earnings, he dreams of returning to the United
States.
	   ``They said I can't go back for five years, but I'm going,'' he
said. ``I don't know how, but I have to go. There's nothing for me
here. I want to change my future.''

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS White House dismissing Iraq's distancing of annex at
end. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Security Council members were divided
over Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, which has been rejected by the United States but
welcomed by France, Russia and China.
	   Before the council met, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon,
asked to meet the council president _ who this month happens to be
Acting U.S. Ambasssador Peter Burleigh _ to reiterate that the
Iraqi offer was unconditional and unequivocal and that the
inspectors could return to work immediately.
	   The United States was the only Security Council member to
totally reject the Iraqi offer when the meeting got under way
Saturday evening. Britain said it remained skeptical and was
keeping its options open.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said his government was
looking for ``a very immediate and unconditional statement'' that
Iraq was going to resume full, unfettered cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   But most of the council, along with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, reacted positively to a letter from the Iraqi leadership
announcing that its ban on dealing with the inspectors had been
rescinded.
	   ``I think at least they've made a step in the right direction
... it's a positive development,'' Annan said. ``But the council
may want further clarifications.''
	   What raised serious questions in the United States and Britain
was a two-page annex to the letter reiterating Iraq's previous
terms for a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N.
resolutions. The United States, which has already rejected many of
these terms, said Baghdad was attaching conditions.
	   But the French, Russians and Chinese, who have been sympathetic
to Iraq's demand to lift sanctions, disagreed.
	   Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said the Iraqis had
clearly explained that the annex was just Baghdad's views _ and the
letter unconditionally and unequivocally agreed that UNSCOM could
resume work.
	   In the past week there has been much speculation over whether
Annan should go to Iraq to mediate. When Lavrov was asked if the
secretary-general should leave for Baghdad on Saturday, he replied,
``UNSCOM should go to Baghdad. This is not a crisis any more.''
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet insisted that the annex did not
impose any conditions.
	   And China's Ambassador Qin Huasun said: ``We welcome Iraq's
decision.''
	   Hamdoon met Burleigh Saturday evening, shortly after U.S.
President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
rejected the Iraqi letter, saying it was ``neither unequivocal nor
unconditional. ... It is unacceptable.'' He said the letter, and
especially the annex, had ``more holes than Swiss cheese.''
	   Hamdoon said he told Burleigh that the annex ``contains the
views and the preferences of the government of Iraq'' on a
comprehensive review but had nothing to do with Baghdad's decision
to resume relations UNSCOM or with the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
	   ``It's not linked to the unconditional, unequivocal statement
that was contained in the letter about our resumption of our
relations with UNSCOM and the IAEA,'' Hamdoon said.
	   Hamdoon told reporters that Burleigh promised to convey his
statement, which he said was the official view of the Iraqi
government.
	   ``I told him that because of the confusion that I am seeing here
with the American media at large, and also from the statements that
are emanating from Washington, I wanted to make it clear and end
all that confusion,'' he said.
	   ``He did ask about a written letter. I told him that my
statement to you is on behalf of the government of Iraq and it is
as binding as any other written statement,'' Hamdoon said.
	   White House officials all but snickered in dismissing Hamdoon's
gesture to de-link the letter from the annex, saying the Iraqi
ambassador had no credibility.

<TEXT>
	   PIEDMONT, California (AP) _ Jonestown survivor Deborah Layton
grew up in a house of secrets.
	   She was 16 before she found out she was Jewish, 24 before she
learned her grandmother had committed suicide.
	   As a trusted financial lieutenant for cult leader Jim Jones, she
kept secrets for him _ and later from him as she plotted her escape
months before he ordered 912 of his followers to drink
cyanide-poisoned punch in the Guyana jungle.
	   But when her own child started asking questions, Layton broke
family tradition.
	   First, she told her daughter.
	   Then, she wrote ``Seductive Poison,'' her account of events
leading up to the mass murder-suicide that shocked the world 20
years ago this month.
	   Along the way, she exorcised the family ghosts.
	   ``I understand what these well-meaning secrets were for,''
Layton says. ``But at the same time, it's because of those secrets
that I think my mother and my brother and I were sort of pushed
onto the path of looking for answers _ and that Jim Jones seemed to
have them for us.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Layton was 17 when her already converted brother, Larry,
introduced her to Jones at the first Peoples Temple in far Northern
California, where he believed he could best survive the atomic
apocalypse he expected. It was 1970, and she was on summer vacation
from the British boarding school where her worried parents had sent
her to curb adolescent rebellion.
	   (The night before she'd left for the school, her father had
stunned her by announcing her mother was Jewish. It turned out to
be a sort of family rite of passage; Larry had been told years
earlier. Even later, she learned another secret, that her mother
had fled Nazi Germany.)
	   Young and unanchored, Layton was charmed as Jones fixed his
penetrating brown eyes on her and warmly invited her to ``join me
and my family of all races,'' hundreds of followers working to feed
the hungry, house the homeless and help addicts get clean.
	   Soon, her mother would also join the Temple.
	   ``The people that joined Peoples Temple were really good people.
They were innocent. They were naive,'' Layton said in a recent
interview in her home in the hills ringing San Francisco Bay.
	   ``They were looking for something larger than themselves to be
involved in. ... Nobody joined thinking their lives would be
taken.''
	   With the dark glasses he wore indoors and out, his glossy black
hair and sweeping robes, Jones, known as Father to his flock, soon
became a San Francisco fixture. He was feted by politicians. He was
appointed to the San Francisco Housing Authority; he became
chairman in 1976.
	   There was a scary side to the Peoples Temple _ beatings of
fractious members, fake healings. But doubts were eased by Jones'
reassuring ``You are the only one I can really trust,'' or by the
knowledge that failure meant punishment, physical and spiritual.
	   ``I saw things and I didn't stand up and say, `Stop!' because I
was too afraid. These are things that haunt me still,'' Layton
says.
	   ___
	   The moment Layton and her mother, Lisa, arrived at Jonestown, a
jungle encampment about 250 miles (400 kilometers) from the Guyana
capital of Georgetown, ``I knew we'd entered a prison camp and I
knew I wanted out. But how? I had no idea.''
	   (The night before the trip in December 1977, another secret: The
grandmother Layton thought had died of a heart attack in Hamburg
actually jumped out a New York apartment window before Layton was
born.)
	   In Jonestown, the able-bodied among the 1,000 or so residents
worked the fields, subsisting mostly on rice, Layton writes.
	   Dissent was unthinkable. Offenders sweltered in ``The Box,'' a
6-by-4-foot (1.8-by-1.2-meter) underground enclosure. Misbehaving
children were dangled head-first into the well late at night,
Layton writes. Loudspeakers broadcast Jones' voice at all hours.
	   Escape came in May 1978 when Jones sent Layton to Georgetown as
chaperone of a youth group. There she contacted her sister and U.S.
consulate officials.
	   Once out, Layton sounded the alarm: Jones planned to force his
followers into mass suicide. Few heeded.
	   That Nov. 17, a delegation of reporters and relatives arrived in
Guyana, led by U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan, who was working with San
Francisco area residents worried about family members in the cult.
He was met with mostly beaming declarations of contentment.
	   The next day, preparing to leave with about 20 defectors, Ryan's
party was ambushed at the airstrip. He and four others were killed.
	   Larry Layton, who had posed as a defector and wounded two
people, is serving a life sentence in federal prison.
	   Back in the compound, Jones was choreographing one last,
grotesque dance of death.
	   First the children; poison was squirted into babies' mouths with
a syringe. Then the adults. Most were poisoned, some forcibly. Some
were shot by security guards. Jones was found shot through the
head.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   After Jonestown, Layton retreated to secrets again _ ``I was so
ashamed. I didn't want people to know who I was.''
	   She got a job in investment banking, married, had a child,
divorced.
	   Then daughter Lauren started asking questions.
	   Answering wasn't easy _ ``How do you tell a child that hundreds
of children died drinking juice?''
	   When she tried to write about abandoning her mother, who would
die 10 days before the murder-suicide, she hit an emotional wall.
For seven weeks, she couldn't write. Instead, she grabbed her
daughter's acrylic paints and worked her way from front yard to
back painting benches, the mailbox, even the doorbell in a frenzy
of bright stripes and squiggles.
	   One midsummer day, she stopped.
	   ``It was a warm day and all of a sudden a breeze came up and the
back door blew open,'' she says. ``All the hair on my arm and my
neck came up. I just sat there. It felt as though my mother was
standing there and she was saying, 'It's time to come in and say,
`Goodbye.' ''

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Twenty years ago this month, Tim Stoen was
holed up in hell.
	   He and his wife had gone to Guyana with U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan in
one last attempt to retrieve their son, who had been claimed by
cult leader Jim Jones as his own.
	   Waiting in Georgetown, their hope died as they heard that Ryan
and four others had been shot to death in an ambush at the
Jonestown airstrip.
	   They knew it was only a matter of time before Jones followed
through his long-threatened mass murder-suicide.
	   ``It was really a horrific night ... knowing at any moment that
our son was going to be dead. It was utterly hopeless. If anything
could remind you of hell, it would be that moment, that feeling,''
Stoen says.
	   More than 900 people died after Jones ordered his followers to
drink cyanide-poisoned punch. Nearly one-third were children. Among
them _ John Victor Stoen, age 6.
	   ``The lesson for me is that every group ... has to make sure
that they hold their leader to a set of standards, constantly hold
that leader accountable,'' Stoen says.
	   Stoen, a former San Francisco prosecutor, had represented Jones
in California and became a trusted member of the Peoples Temple.
	   Now in private practice in Colorado, Stoen remembers letting his
enthusiasm over the good things, like seeing hard-core heroin
addicts go straight, overwhelm his misgivings about the bad _
corporal punishment and thought control.
	   ``I said, `Look how altruistic, how socialistic the people are
becoming. Yes, Jones is heavy-handed and he's idiosyncratic, but
it's working.' ''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Jynona Norwood was hiding in a San Francisco suburb 20 years
ago. She had gone there with her young son, Ed, afraid Jones would
sweep him off to Jonestown.
	   Her lesson from Jonestown: Beware of false prophets.
	   ``I never believed that Jim ... was a minister from his heart,''
Norwood says. She was one of the few in her family to resist Jones'
charm. Twenty-seven of her relatives, including her mother, died in
Jonestown.
	   She believes that Jones, son of a Klansman but adopted father of
a rainbow family, used interracial tolerance as a powerful
recruiting tool for the poor blacks and privileged whites who
flocked to his services.
	   ``He knew that was the door into black folks' hearts and
idealistic, altruistic white people who wanted to see the end of
racism.''
	   Norwood, now a Los Angeles pastor, helps organize yearly
memorial services at the mass grave in Oakland where about 400
Jonestown victims are buried.
	   She is trying to raise funds for a wall to memorialize the dead
and warn the living.
	   ``They deserve to be remembered,'' she says. ``They were our
neighbors. They were our loved ones. They were our friends.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Twenty years ago, Jackie Speier was lying on a Guyana airstrip
with five bullet wounds. An aide to U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan, she had
gone with him to investigate Jonestown.
	   She would go on to become a state assemblywoman. This month, she
was elected to the state Senate.
	   If there is a lesson in Jonestown, it's that ``the menace of
cults still lingers; it's as real today as it was 20 years ago,''
Speier recently told the San Francisco Examiner. ``No one should
ever be so arrogant as to believe it couldn't happen again.''

Former Canadian prime minister Joe Clark back as party leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Joe Clark, who in 1979 served 10 months as
Canada's youngest prime minister, completed the first step of a
comeback attempt Saturday by winning the leadership of the
struggling Progressive Conservative Party.
	   Clark, who also served eight years as Canada's foreign minister,
had finished first Oct. 24 in a five-way first round of voting for
the party leadership but fell just short of the 50 percent needed
for outright victory.
	   In Saturday's two-candidate second round, he easily defeated
David Orchard by more than a 3-1 margin in balloting open to 90,000
party members.
	   Clark, 59, inherits a badly indebted party that was routed from
power in 1993 and now holds only 19 of the 201 seats in the House
of Commons, behind four other parties.
	   Nationwide, polls show it holds support of about 17 percent of
the voters, just ahead of the right-wing Reform Party but well
behind the governing Liberal Party.
	   Reform's leader, Preston Manning, has urged the Progressive
Conservatives to merge with his party to create a united
alternative to the centrist Liberals, but Clark has opposed the
plan.
	   The Progressive Conservative leadership post was vacated earlier
this year when Jean Charest, one of Canada's most popular
politicians, left federal politics to run for the premiership of
Quebec in a challenge against that province's separatist
government. That election takes place Nov. 30.
	   The next federal election is not expected until 2001.

New York becomes a habit for Spanish dancer

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Spanish dancing takes Pilar Rioja all over the
world. But there's one place she keeps coming back to: The
Repertorio Espanol's 203-seat Gramercy Arts Theater.
	   This is her 26th year in New York. It also is the 100th
anniversary of the birth of Federico Garcia Lorca, the
poet-playwright to whom Ms. Rioja dedicates dedicated her work.
Through an interpreter, she repeats the word ``duende,'' or spirit,
which he used in an essay.
	   ``When you're very involved in what you're doing personally and,
at the same time able to communicate it to the audience, it's
'duende','' she says.
	   More than that, she says, it is the inspiration that boils up in
a performer who takes chances on stage, instead of performing by
rote. ``It can only come if you can really fall flat on your
face,'' she says. ``Without that possibility of having a disaster,
it is not going to come around.''
	   Ms. Rioja would rather make misstep than to mistake the mood.
``On stage,'' she says, ``you have to forget about technique and
feel the emotion.''
	   Sometimes, she says, Spanish dance recounts tragedy. But
``flamenco should just be very happy.'' Audiences adore flamenco,
she finds. ``They like the happiness.''
	   At the Gramercy Arts Theater, when the master of ceremonies asks
for first-time visitors, few hands go up.
	   The soloist responds with ``duende,'' repeating and embellishing
steps that started years ago.
	   ``When I was a little girl,'' she recalls, '' I decided I wanted
to create dances. Dance, dance, dance, only dances.''

	   LEXINGTON, Kentucky (AP) _ Margaret Garner stepped off the ice
of the frozen Ohio River and onto the shore to start a new life.
	   She clutched her infant daughter, Cilla, to her chest. Her
husband Robert carried 2-year-old Mary, while their two sons, Tom
and Sam, and Robert's parents hurried alongside.
	   It was before dawn on Jan. 28, 1856, and the 22-year-old Garner
and her family were fleeing the northern Kentucky plantations where
they had been enslaved to the soil of a free state, Ohio.
	   But Archibald Gaines, who owned the plantation where Margaret
Garner had been kept in bondage, had discovered the family's flight
and was just hours behind. Determined to recapture the escapees, he
rounded up an armed posse.
	   The slave-catchers caught up to Garner and her family later that
morning, but not before she had slit Mary's throat with a butcher's
knife to make sure her daughter would never have to suffer the
nightmares of slavery.
	   And she was about to kill her other children as well when the
posse burst into the Cincinnati cabin where the Garner family had
hidden. Among those confronted with the bloody scene was Gaines,
who may have fathered Mary.
	   The January 1856 murder transformed what otherwise would have
been a run-of-the-mill runaway slave case into a polarizing flash
point for pro- and antislavery activists. Garner's case drew the
attention of a nation rushing toward war over slavery, among other
issues, and, decades later, the tragedy provided the starting point
for Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison's novel, ``Beloved.''
	   But Garner, who died in slavery two years later, was largely
forgotten. She became ``literally a footnote or an endnote,''
Steven Weisenburger, a professor of American literature, said
during a recent interview. ``She was little more than a kind of
cliche or legend for about 130 years.''
	   Morrison won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for ``Beloved.'' She has
said that the novel's central character, a haunted former slave
named Sethe, was inspired by Garner.
	   That small historical fact moved Weisenburger, who teaches at
the University of Kentucky, to begin an investigation into Garner's
life. Almost from the start, he said, ``I felt a very abiding moral
obligation to tell Margaret's story.''
	   Now, Garner has returned to the pages of history in
Weisenburger's new book, ``Modern Medea: A Family Story of Slavery
and Child-Murder From the Old South.''
	   The book took the 49-year-old Weisenburger a decade to research
and write, and arrived in stores at the same time as the release of
the Oprah Winfrey-produced film version of ``Beloved.''
	   Weisenburger thought of researching the Garner case after seeing
Morrison's novel and a 1988 retrospective of the work of Kentucky
artist Thomas Satterwhite Noble. The exhibit included Noble's
lithograph of the murder, ``The Modern Medea,'' a work that gave
Weisenburger's book its title and cover art.
	   ``Modern Medea'' was the title given Garner by slavery's
supporters _ a reference to the child-murdering mother of Greek
tragedy. Garner also became a symbol for abolitionists, who saw her
as a victim of what one called the ``seething hell of American
slavery.''
	   Wading into the political turmoil of pre-Civil War America
forced Weisenburger, the author of previous books on Thomas Pynchon
and satire in the American novel, to retrain himself as a
historian.
	   ``I realized that I didn't know enough about slavery, about the
history of abolitionism and American politics in the antebellum
years,'' he said. So he enlisted the aid of colleagues in his
university's history department in building book lists and plowing
through them.
	   That background allowed Weisenburger to mine case records, the
archives of the slaveholder Gaines family and contemporary
newspaper accounts for lost details and color about a case that
polarized Cincinnati and the nation. Among his findings: the fact
that Maplewood, the northern Kentucky plantation where Margaret
Garner was enslaved, still exists, a short distance from Interstate
75 in the city of Richwood.
	   Though different from Morrison's psychological drama,
Weisenburger's historical account is no less gripping.
	   Its centerpiece is the dramatic fugitive slave trial of the
Garners, which divided Cincinnati. Slavery supporters and
abolitionists argued over whether the federal Fugitive Slave Act of
1850, which demanded the return of Garner and her family to their
Kentucky slavers, should take precedence over state murder charges
that could have kept the family in Ohio.
	   Cincinnati came under near-martial law, as federal officials
sworn to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act armed their supporters
against local officials dedicated to perpetuating Ohio's status as
a free state.
	   ``It turns out, in terms of legal history, it's a trial that
involves all the key issues of states rights and conflict of
laws,'' Weisenburger said. They were issues that would lead to
civil war five years later.

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi ambassador delivering letter to council
repeating that Iraq's offer to resume cooperation is unconditional &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Security Council members were divided
Saturday over Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors, which has been rejected by the United States
but welcomed by France, Russia and China.
	   Before the council met, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon,
asked to meet the council president, who this month happens to be
Acting U.S. Ambasssador Peter Burleigh, to reiterate that the Iraqi
offer was unconditional and unequivocal and that the inspectors
could return to work immediately.
	   At Burleigh's request, Hamdoon delivered a letter to the council
Saturday night confirming that the government's decision to resume
cooperation with the inspectors was ``clear and unconditional'' _
and not connected to Iraq's preferences for a comprehensive review
of its compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   What raised serious questions in the United States and Britain
was a two-page annex to the letter from Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz announcing the resumption of cooperation with
the weapons inspectors.
	   The annex reiterated Iraq's previous terms for a comprehensive
review, many of which have already been rejected by the United
States. The Clinton administration, in rejecting Baghdad's offer,
said Iraq was attaching conditions.
	   ``I think this letter assures the majority of the Security
Council, and this letter should really put to an end the confusion
that was created'' by the letter from Aziz, Hamdoon said.
	   Clinton advisers said they would wait to see the written
statement before making any judgment on whether it altered the
crisis situation.
	   The United States was the only Security Council member to
totally reject the Iraqi offer when the council meeting got under
way Saturday evening. Britain said it remained skeptical and was
keeping its options open.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said his government was
looking for ``a very immediate and unconditional statement'' that
Iraq was going to resume full, unfettered cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   But most of the council, along with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, reacted positively to a letter from the Iraqi leadership
announcing that its ban on dealing with the inspectors had been
rescinded.
	   ``I think at least they've made a step in the right direction
... it's a positive development,'' Annan said. ``But the council
may want further clarifications.''

Deana Carter: Talkin' about her generation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JIM PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The topic has turned to sex and
Deana Carter is giggling like a school girl.
	   Deana Carter giggling about sex?
	   Is this the woman who made her name with ``Strawberry Wine,'' a
song about a teen-age girl losing her virginity? The singer who has
revived the suggestive 1971 hit ``Brand New Key''? The woman who
sings, ``I want to love you like a freight train. ... Chuggin' up
and down again?''
	   Yes, it's her.
	   She howls with laughter, during a recent interview, before she
puts her right hand in the air as if she's swearing to tell the
truth.
	   ``OK, I'll admit it,'' she says with mock solemnity. ``I'm
human. I think about sex a lot ... . It makes up a huge part of our
existence, and people try to act like it doesn't. So musically,
it's fun to talk about it.''
	   Carter, 32, was relaxed and confident as she talked in her
manager's office about her second album, ``Everything's Gonna Be
Alright'' _ the follow-up to ``Did I Shave My Legs for This?''
	   The success of the first album _ it sold more than 4 million
copies _ means the pressure is on. A bad showing the second time
around and Carter's career could fade away just as quickly as it
blossomed. But she doesn't seem worried.
	   ``I don't want to re-create `Strawberry Wine,''' Carter said of
the hit from her first album that was named best single and song in
1997 by the Country Music Association. ``But I do want to make sure
to reach the young people _ all the people that we reached the
first time.''
	   Carter is betting it was her sound _ pop-leaning country that
makes traditionalists grumble _ that made her a hit, not just the
talents of ``Strawberry Wine'' writers Matraca Berg and Gary
Harrison.
	   ``This record is more about a generation than a genre,'' Carter
said. ``I was born in 1966, so there's elements of the music I
listened to growing up.''
	   Indeed, the current hit single ``Absence of the Heart'' briefly
mimics Gary Wright's ``Dream Weaver.'' ``You Still Shake Me'' cops
a ZZ Top groove and features backup vocals recalling latter Beatles
records. The still-rocking Lynyrd Skynyrd sing backup on ``The
Train Song.''
	   Carter, married to songwriter Chris DiCroce since 1996, grew up
in Nashville, the daughter of respected guitarist Fred Carter Jr.
	   She was an avid and wide-ranging music fan. Of course, she heard
the albums her dad played on _ Simon and Garfunkel, Elvis Presley,
Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, James
Taylor, Bobby Gentry, Joan Baez and many others.
	   ``I didn't have traditional country albums growing up,'' Carter
said. ``I just didn't. I just don't ever want to lie about that.
But what I had was Olivia Newton-John, James Taylor and Dolly. I
loved Dolly Parton.''
	   Carter took her first stab at a singing career as a teen-ager,
with the help of her father. She wasn't successful and went off to
college at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
	   At 23, she quit a job as a rehabilitation therapist helping
stroke and head-injury victims to give Nashville another shot.
Family friend Willie Nelson gave her a break by having her sing at
Farm Aid VII in New Orleans, and she finally was signed to Liberty
(now Capitol) in 1991.
	   But ``Did I Shave My Legs for This?'' was delayed for five years
because of corporate changes at Capitol Nashville. When the album
was finally released, ``Strawberry Wine'' became a huge hit and
Carter was on her way.
	   ``It's a miracle that the song ever made it to the airwaves,''
Carter said. ``It's a miracle. The label didn't want it as a single
_ initially.''
	   Executives at Capitol advised Carter to edit out a portion of
the song to make it shorter, and were nervous about its subject
matter. Demand from radio programmers changed their minds, and the
full-length song was released.
	   ``Everything's Gonna Be Alright'' is more musically
adventuresome than the first album and displays Carter's
confidence. And Capitol executives think ``Brand New Key,'' to be
released next year, will be a can't-miss single.
	   The song is a ringer for Carter, who employs the same
``little-girl'' phrasing as Melanie Safka did in the original 1971
hit with the sly, suggestive: ``I've got a brand new pair of roller
skates. You got a brand new key. I think that we should get
together and try them out, ya see.''
	   ``It's like tongue-in-cheek, wink-wink, nudge-nudge, know what I
mean?'' Carter said, giggling.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Randy Newman admits his songs are hardly
the stuff of hit records, and to prove his point he recounts the
working titles for his first pop album in 10 years.
	   ``I'm Dead But I Don't Know It'' is a semi-autobiographical
farce about an old rock 'n' roller (with a chorus of girls
chanting, ``He's dead. He's dead''). There's a song about Karl Marx
called ``The World Isn't Fair.'' Another, ``Great Nations of
Europe,'' describes how Europe has been successful in transplanting
its culture.
	   ``Sounds like a smash, right?'' says Newman, laughing.
	   Newman, 54, points out he also has a sentimental side, so he
wrote ``I Miss You,'' a song devoted to, of all people, his first
wife. And just what will she think of such flattery?
	   ``She'll probably love it,'' Newman says. ``It's what my second
wife thinks that will matter.''
	   Of course, Newman has never played it straight during a career
that's being celebrated next month with the release of the
retrospective box set ``Guilty: 30 Years of Randy Newman'' (Rhino,
dlrs 59.98).
	   The 105-track collection includes the bespectacled
singer-songwriter's first single, ``Golden Gridiron Boy,'' produced
by Pat Boone. It also features a disc showcasing his film scores,
compositions and arrangements from ``Ragtime,'' ``The Natural,''
``Parenthood,'' ``Avalon'' and ``Toy Story,'' among others.
	   The bulk of the selections are from Newman's 10 studio albums,
including his one big hit, ``Short People,'' written from the
perspective of a man ranting about the vertically challenged. The
song offended countless people in the mid-1970s and even prompted a
death threat while Newman was performing in Memphis, Tenn.
	   ``There were people who were generally angry and still are,''
Newman says. ``I underestimated people's sensitivity to it. It's so
clear to me the guy is nuts that I just didn't think anyone would
really take it seriously.''
	   Newman thinks more of his songs would have outraged people _ if
anyone had heard them.
	   ``Rednecks,'' a single from the 1974 album ``Good Old Boys,''
sounds as inflammatory as any song ever recorded but actually is a
diatribe against hypocritical northern states that are just as
bigoted as some parts of the South.
	   Newman may have been misunderstood, as the box set demonstrates,
because his pop songs are like short stories _ first person
narratives with that person generally being a drunk, pervert or
other social outcast.
	   ``I reached a point where I was writing relatively conventional
songs,'' Newman says. ``Musically, they were all right, but it
wasn't what I was responding to in literature and television and
comedy.
	   ``I love not being able to trust necessarily what the person's
telling you. You have to figure out by his diction or something
what the truth is. And since I'm not Faulkner, it's a little more
basic and simple.''
	   The other revelation is that many of his songs deal with
Southern themes and locations _ ``Louisiana 1927,'' ``Birmingham,''
``Kingfish.'' This, from a Southern California resident who
recorded the unofficial theme song of Los Angeles, ``I Love L.A.''
	   It turns out Newman's mother was from New Orleans, and he lived
the first three years of his life there.
	   By the early 1980s, Newman began composing movie scores. It was
not much of a stretch considering his uncle, Alfred Newman, was an
accomplished composer who also created the Twentieth Century Fox
march. Two other uncles, Emil and Lionel Newman, also composed and
conducted film scores.
	   Now, having never been a huge star, Newman's music is heard by
millions of moviegoers even if they don't know he's responsible. He
has been nominated for 10 Academy awards, but has never won.
	   Newman's latest project was providing the music for ``A Bug's
Life,'' the new Disney/Pixar computer animated film. He also wrote
``That'll Do,'' a song performed by Peter Gabriel for the upcoming
``Babe'' sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the City.''
	   Scoring movies has been the hardest thing he has done, he says.
	   ``I want what's happening up there to be enhanced by the
music,'' Newman says. ``A chase without music is nothing. The
'X-Files' without that brooding music is just two people sitting in
a chair for two minutes. Add the music and it's tension.''
	   He considers composing music for films his full-time job,
although he says it's the right time to venture back into pop
music. And he's not worried if the album isn't a hit.
	   ``It's sort of like I missed the point about what the whole pop
thing is,'' he says. ``'I love you. You love me. Why don't you love
me any more.' I just stopped doing that 30 years ago and, if I
hadn't stopped doing it, right now I'd probably be painting in Bora
Bora.''

Stage legend becoming a busy Hollywood actor

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ian McKellen is looking toward Hollywood more
than ever for fresh challenges after years of little ambition and
limited success in film.
	   While the theater will always be his first and abiding love, one
of the foremost classical stage actors of his generation is
embracing the 20th century's highest-profile acting medium, with
two movies now playing and another in the can.
	   ``At a time perhaps I ought to be winding down, I've suddenly
got a new career here,'' says the gaunt, six-footer with electric
blue eyes. ``I've never rested on my laurels; I've never wanted to
be known as a Shakespeare actor, or classical actor, or indeed an
English actor. Now I'm not thought of, hopefully, just as a theater
actor.''
	   McKellen is playing James Whale, the director of
``Frankenstein,'' in ``Gods and Monsters,'' based on a 1995 novel
about the aging filmmaker's relationship with his male gardener.
And he's co-starring in ``Apt Pupil,'' based on a Stephen King
novella about an ex-Nazi discovered by a California high school kid
who wants to learn everything about the old man's past. Next, he's
in ``Swept From the Sea'' as a doctor in love with a male patient.
	   If his new movies succeed, he jokes: ``Maybe I'll come to Woody
Allen's attention, Robert Altman's attention, or Tim Robbins, or
Tim Burton ... ''
	   The 59-year-old McKellen, who was knighted in 1991, captured a
lot of cinemaphiles' attention three years ago in the inspired
update of Shakespeare's ``Richard III,'' set in an unnamed 1930s
fascist country. He co-wrote and co-produced the film and played
Richard.
	   Since then he has revved up his film work, making at least a
half-dozen movies. Before that, McKellen averaged a film a year or
less _ and, he says, ``none of them ever clicked.''
	   ``So I didn't think of myself as a film actor because nobody
else thought of me as a film actor.''
	   He played D.H. Lawrence in ``Priest of Love'' in 1981, but the
movie failed. McKellen goes so far as to suggest that if the movie
had succeeded, his career might have gone differently. But that
same year, he won a Tony for playing Salieri in ``Amadeus'' on
Broadway.
	   At this point, though, he hopes to work in both film and theater
and says he can be happy just about anywhere _ as long as he's
acting.
	   ``My only ambition is to play wonderful parts that are very
well-written. There aren't many of those.''
	   He's currently working in regional theater, at the West
Yorkshire Playhouse, and says he'd be just as happy returning to
his roots: to the industrial north of England and to repertory _
``doing three plays on the trot (with the) same actors.''
	   ``I find just as much satisfaction in that as playing on
Broadway, or playing `Enemy of the People' in Los Angeles, which
I've just been doing, or being on the National Theater stage, or in
the West End,'' he says. ``Now I've also got this option of doing
films.''
	   But he admittedly wouldn't miss movies as much as the theater.
	   ``If tomorrow a law was passed saying Ian McKellen wasn't
allowed to be in films anymore, he wouldn't be distressed, because
there's always the theater. Now if they passed a law saying I
couldn't act there, either,'' he pauses, then says: ``I'm quite a
phlegmatic person, you know. I'd say, `Thank God I don't have to
learn all those lines anymore. But what is it I'm going to do?!'
I'm sure I'd have to find something to do. Maybe I'd become a
journalist. Or write a book or something.''
	   McKellen, who dabbled in newspaper work by contributing to a
``chitchat'' column as a teen-ager in Bolton, England, has written
about what he knows: acting, the theater and homosexual issues.
	   He came out a decade ago, and has gone on record as making
little distinction between acting and activism. A co-founder of the
Actors' Company, a London-based, democratically run touring company
of performers, McKellen also co-founded the Stonewall Group, which
lobbies for legal and social equality for homosexuals in the United
Kingdom.
	   So it's not exactly a coincidence that three of his four recent
movie roles were homosexual characters _ besides Whale and his
upcoming film, he had a cameo in last year's ``Bent.''
	   ``If I can be in those sorts of movies and make the point about
being gay, then that may on occasion lead me to do more gay parts
than straight parts,'' he says.
	   Because he's openly homosexual, people will come to him with a
gay character thinking he'll want to play it, McKellen says.
	   ``And maybe they're the sort of filmmakers who don't want Tom
Hanks playing all the gay parts, on some point of principle _ a
principle I don't share, I must say. I don't want only gays to play
gay parts and only straights to play straights. I want to go on
playing Macbeth and Hamlet and Richard III, which I wouldn't
categorize as being gay at all.''
	   Born the son of a civil engineer, McKellen grew up with an older
sister and his parents in Wigan until age 12 when his mother died
of breast cancer. His father, who remarried and moved with young
Ian to Bolton, died in a car crash in 1964 _ a week after seeing
McKellen's West End debut.
	   McKellen went into acting, in part, because he was a shy child.
	   ``Most kids become actors because they like showing off. I found
it rather painful to show off. I've developed an aptitude for
that,'' he says, smiling with an ironically arched eyebrow. ``I've
matured into it.''
	   He wasn't a kid who felt there was anything special about
himself. And, he says, it also had ``something to do with growing
up gay. You feel a misfit.''
	   On stage, he fit in _ and stood out.
	   ``I could draw attention to myself and be confident, because the
thing was controlled _ I knew what I was doing, it was rehearsed,
there was a script. I could be confident that not much could go
wrong, whereas in life, of course, the whole point of life is that
it's always going wrong.''

Brad Pitt wrestles with the glory _ and pain _ of fame
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For Brad Pitt, it's all about ``the search.''
	   ``The search for why you're here, what you're doing and who you
are,'' he says.
	   And part of this search for self, he says, is that he refuses to
make any excuses for his foibles and past mistakes, or blame anyone
else, even the star-maker machinery that put him where he is, or
the media hordes that dog him constantly, looking to spin the
complexities of his life into simplistic sound bites.
	   ``It's hard not to believe the hype, the good and the bad,''
Pitt says, gently tugging scruffy chin whiskers. ``It's hard not to
get sucked into it, and if you get sucked into the good it means
you're going to get sucked into the bad.''
	   In town for the premiere of ``Meet Joe Black'' _ an engrossing
remake of ``Death Takes a Holiday'' _ the actor who vaulted to
superstardom as the scene-stealing hitchhiker in ``Thelma and
Louise'' remains baffled by his celebrity.
	   ``I don't know what fame is, first of all. I have no idea,''
Pitt says, casually dressed in blue jeans, a T-shirt and a
steel-gray pullover. ``I could never have been prepared for it, for
the mind games that come with it.''
	   When lightning struck, he was blinded.
	   ``It was just a confusing, confusing time. And it's still
confusing,'' he says. ``People are telling you that you're much
better than you certainly feel and people are saying you're much
worse than you certainly are. And you're just trying to find out
who ... you are.''
	   Playing Death in the Martin Brest film opposite Anthony Hopkins,
Pitt gives a subtle, restrained performance of an omnipotent spirit
suddenly curious about the intricacies of the human lives he has
ended for millennia.
	   ``My stuff to this stage has been very hit and miss,'' Pitt
says. ``I want to keep zeroing in on the bull's-eye. I certainly
have my moments, but there's a giving up completely to the part
which I've only felt a few times. There's a focus I lack, at
times.''
	   Shunning the ease of playing stereotypical matinee heroes,
Pitt's work has ranged from the lovable but doomed fly fisherman of
``A River Runs Through It'' to the psychotic killer of
``Kalifornia.'' He was the reluctant creature of the night in
``Interview With the Vampire,'' the babbling maniac of ``12
Monkeys,'' for which he received an Academy Award nomination, and
the Austrian mountaineer of ``Seven Years in Tibet.''
	   But his resume isn't always what people want to talk _ or read _
about. It's his love life that lures readers.
	   Pitt is reluctant to discuss his personal life, fearing a repeat
of what he went through with ex-fiancee Gwyneth Paltrow. A
worldwide audience followed the couple's every move, at first
sighing over their storybook romance, then clucking and wagging
fingers over their sad breakup.
	   Now he's dating actress Jennifer Aniston, and being scolded by
gossip columnists for not posing for pictures with her at the
premiere of ``Meet Joe Black.''
	   ``Hollywood is a minefield,'' is all Pitt has to say on the
subject, cradling a Marlboro Light between his fingertips, watching
blue smoke rise toward the ceiling.
	   While accepting the reality of his fame, such a reality doesn't
always sit right with the corn-fed son of Middle America who spent
nearly four years studying in the journalism school at the
University of Missouri.
	   ``The main thing I remember is the code _ the code that
journalists are bound to write unbiased accounts of people, places
and events,'' he says. ``That's always stuck with me. It's a lofty
code. It's tough to be unbiased, I mean who could actually be
unbiased? But as a goal, that's what always kept popping up in my
head when the crazy gossip that spins out of control would come out
about me. ``Too often, it comes from what I believe to be petty
people. I mean, I just can't see someone as a kid going, `When I
grow up I'm going to write terrible things about people and print
them.'''
	   After experiencing the best and the worst of society's
infatuation with celebrities, Pitt is philosophical about how it
can affect humanity as a whole.
	   ``The real evil of it is just that it brings us down little by
little, where we don't notice, but it just brings us down a
notch,'' he says, paraphrasing a tract from the movie ``Broadcast
News.''
	   ``I think a line must be drawn in the press between what's
rumored and what's opinion and what's fact. Most things are just
opinion and they're printed up as fact. Unfortunately, people don't
look that far. They just take what comes in little quotation marks
as gospel.
	   ``Innocents become scapegoats all the time,'' he says. ``I feel
what's personal relationship-wise should be kept that way.''
	   On a somewhat lighter note, Pitt admits hearing the ticking of a
personal clock as he approaches his 35th birthday in mid-December.
	   ``It's hard, very hard. But with years come wisdom, a little
more every year,'' he says, seeing a bright side to the ravages of
time. ``I like not being a kid anymore, there's less confusion.
	   ``There's a great line in 'Fight Club,''' he says, referring to
the boxing film he's making with Edward Norton. ```This is your
life and it's ending one day at a time.' Nothing lasts. I think
about it in terms about not wasting a day. More now, and more every
day.''

Cane carver lived in shadows, but his work endures

	   SYKESVILLE, Maryland (AP) _ In a kinder world, Frank Feather's
grave would be marked with a sturdy chunk of walnut boldly carved
with his name, his dates and a four-petaled flower.
	   Instead, he rests anonymously with others whose unclaimed bodies
were dissected, cremated and buried in a grave for research
cadavers on the grounds of the Springfield State Hospital near
Sykesville.
	   All Feather wanted as he restlessly roamed the
Maryland-Pennsylvania border in the early 1900s was a meal and a
barn in which to sleep _ and carve. Forty-seven years after his
death, his fanciful woodwork fetches big bucks _ up to dlrs 5,000
for the distinctive canes, spoons and other household items he sold
for a few dollars or offered his hosts as payment.
	   His pieces, rarely signed, feature precise, raised symbols _
flowers, horse heads, acorns and letters _ that are strikingly
large, some two inches high. The letters, spiraling down the shafts
of his walking sticks, form recurring words and phrases: victory,
love, peace, hope.
	   ``His carving was kind of big and it was bold and it was
exact,'' said Baltimore auctioneer Richard Opfer, who has sold
Feather canes to buyers from as far away as Texas.
	   In contrast with his work, Feather was shy, even reclusive. He
wandered in and out of the lives of farm families in north-central
Maryland and south-central Pennsylvania, dropping so few clues
about his past that he has become a folklore figure.
	   According to Shawn Meyers, a Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, lawyer
who has studied Feather, he told one farmer he had killed a man in
Italy and another that he had been stabbed in a fight and couldn't
do physical work. He claimed to have hiked to the West Coast and
back. He was reputedly a drinker but no one recalls seeing him
drink. He was volatile enough to destroy his work for spite, yet
thoughtful enough to voluntarily hand his matches to his host to
prevent a barn fire.
	   ``He told lies about himself,'' Meyers said. ``He was probably
someone who had a talent, who chose this nomadic lifestyle and who
battled alcohol.''
	   Mary Bready, a distant Feather relative, put it more gently: ``I
think he decorated his life the way he decorated his carvings.''
	   According to her research, Feather was born in 1877 in England,
the eighth of nine children of Joseph and Mary Feather, who
emigrated to Jamestown, New York, around 1885. His brothers worked
in textile mills but Frank became a wood and stone carver,
according to an 1896 Jamestown city directory.
	   Then he disappears from the public record until his death in
1951 from a stroke in Frederick, Maryland. He shows up in a family
history only as a drifting presence without a regular job.
	   ``I think he didn't want his family to find him because every
time one of his brothers found him, they tried to put him straight
and he didn't want to go straight,'' Mrs. Bready said.
	   Feather stayed frequently at the Silas Petre farm near
Maugansville, according to Gail Petre, 62, who has a cane Feather
carved for her father. The family's Church of the Brethren faith
stressed charity to strangers.
	   ``It would not have been acceptable to say, `No, we won't feed
you. No, we won't give you a place,' even though he was not invited
to come in the house,'' she said.
	   She remembers Feather's heavy coat, its pockets bulging with
carving tools and newspaper-wrapped carvings.
	   He made the family several canes and spoons, a wooden sword and
an acorn-shape pin dish, sometimes adding details on successive
visits, Miss Petre said.
	   The items are worth thousands to collectors but she said she
won't sell them.
	   ``It seems like it's a piece of Americana that ought to be
preserved for people to see. If it's hidden away in a closet or
owned by a collector, that can't happen,'' she said.
	   The carvings are considered folk art, which also includes
samplers, quilts, weather vanes and hand-painted furniture. Some
pieces of folk art are sold for tens of thousands of dollars.
	   Doug Bast, owner of the Boonsborough Museum of History in
Boonsboro, Md., said Feather is a regional artist poised for
national fame.
	   ``He's unknown but eventually he's probably going to be a really
big collectible,'' said Bast, who has about a dozen Feather pieces.
	   Mrs. Bready, who has a Feather cane, said that when she learned
10 years ago of the demand for his work, she was shocked.
	   ``I'm dumbfounded to discover this man whose family just wrote
him off as the lost sheep of the family should be doing something
that is now so popular and so valuable,'' she said.

Hit novel in Canada imagines life as an elephant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY300 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Her name is Mud, an orphan and a visionary, the
heroine of one of the most acclaimed Canadian novels of the year.
Like all the central characters, she is an elephant.
	   Barbara Gowdy's ``The White Bone,'' a nationwide bestseller and
finalist for Canada's two foremost fiction prizes, follows Mud and
her adopted family through a world beset by drought and made
perilous by ivory-hunting poachers.
	   Many books have depicted animal characters in quest of a refuge.
But Gowdy's book is distinctive in its rigorous effort to reflect
elephants' real-life elephant behavior while venturing into their
consciousness.
	   ``I tried to imagine what it would be like to be that big, to
have senses that sharp, to have that prodigious a memory, to know
that you are imperiled,'' Gowdy said in an interview.
	   The elephants' world, an expanse of East Africa that they call
the Domain, is not prettified. The book is full of nitty-gritty
imagery _ the smell of dung and urine, impulsive sexual matings,
vultures feasting on rotting carcasses, poachers severing tusks
with chainsaws.
	   Gowdy conducted extensive research for the book and visited the
Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya. Her characters are seeking a
legendary white bone they hope will guide them to such a sanctuary,
where humans _ instead of killing elephants _ simply stare at them
from vehicles.
	   The inspiration for the book came from a National Geographic
Society TV documentary, which included footage of group of
elephants discovering the skeleton of one of their former
matriarchs and tenderly fondling the bones.
	   To Gowdy, this display of the awareness of the death suggested
that elephants had a broader consciousness of life and some of its
abstractions.
	   ``We don't know how to measure them _ a lot of their
capabilities are beyond our understanding anyway,'' she said.
``That's why I gave the elephants telepathy and visionary powers.
We don't have them.''
	   Even with all her research, she expects some of the animal
experts whose works she studied might find a few technical flaws in
the book.
	   ``I felt that errors in small factual matters didn't matter as
much as getting the moral truths right,'' she said. ``It's a novel,
not a Ph.D thesis.''
	   Gowdy, 48, hit the bestseller lists with her previous novel,
``Mister Sandman,'' whose characters included an autistic dwarf.
The title piece in her 1992 short-story collection, ``We So Seldom
Look on Love,'' features a young woman sexually attracted to the
corpses at the mortuary where she works.
	   ``I've always written about people on the margins,'' Gowdy said.
``When you walk around the edges you tend to fall, and I just fell
out of my species.''
	   Rather than trying make her elephants seem human, Gowdy tries to
make her readers imagine what it would be like to be an elephant.
She creates a complex family structure for them, a religion, hymns
and a vocabulary _ humans are ``hindleggers.''
	   The reader has to work to keep the characters straight. The
adult females of a given family all have names beginning with the
same letter, so there can be a tongue-twister effect as one reads
about She-Screams, She-Sees, She-Soothes.
	   But Gowdy tries to help out her readers with five family trees
at the beginning of the book, a glossary of elephant vocabulary,
and a map of the region criss-crossed by Mud and her companions.
	   So far the book has appeared only in Canada, but rights have
been sold in several European countries and in the United States,
where Metropolitan Holt, in a six-figure deal, will publish ``The
White Bone'' in May.

Master English woodcarver changed the life of an American
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Life changed for David Esterly when his girlfriend
dragged him into a London church to see the wood carvings.
	   ``I was in English literature, so I always assumed I was going
to have a sort of academic career and would never work with my
hands,'' Esterly recalls. ``But that moment changed my life. I was
overwhelmed.''
	   What captured him was the carving called a reredos, of flowers,
garlands and a pelican, in St. James's Church, crafted by Grinling
Gibbons, the master woodcarver of 17th-century England.
	   Gibbons also carved the figures on top of the organ case and
sculpted the white marble font in the church, designed by Sir
Christopher Wren.
	   ``From the time I saw his work in the church, I didn't want to
do anything but carve wood,'' says Esterly, who lives in rural
upstate New York, north of Utica, and was studying at England's
Cambridge University at the time.
	   ``I married my girlfriend and we spent the next eight years in
England in poverty in Sussex. We ate spaghetti and I taught myself
how to carve. Since then, it's been my life,'' he says.
	   Esterly, 54, persuaded the Victoria and Albert Museum to mount
the first exhibition about Gibbons, marking the carver's 350th
birthday. To accompany it, he wrote a book, ``Grinling Gibbons and
the Art of Carving.''
	   The exhibition, which runs until Jan. 24, won't travel because
most of the carvings are considered too fragile and their owners
don't want to be out of sight of them for long.
	   Carving in England before Gibbons was done in oak, but Gibbons
used limewood, as Esterly does ``and which I import from Britain at
huge expense,'' he says.
	   The wood comes from a tree of the linden family. U.S. carvers
use the American subspecies called basswood, particularly for
making duck decoys, but Esterly says it isn't as fine or as dense
as the European variety.
	   Gibbons lived from 1648 to 1721 and was famous in his time for
his carvings in high relief giving illusions of reality.
	   His cascades of flowers, fruits, foliage, birds and fishes on
walls, ceilings and furniture are in palaces, churches and wealthy
homes, among them Windsor Castle, Hampton Court Palace, St. Paul's
Cathedral and country houses such as Burghley, Petworth and
Badminton, home of the dukes of Beaufort.
	   The exhibition explains that limewood's special qualities are
due to the fineness and uniformity of its cell structure, making it
feel crisp under the chisel. It's comparatively soft, but strong
enough to be thinly cut across and even against the grain.
	   Carving naturalistic foliage may require more than 100 chisels.
Wood is sliced through, leaving a form that mirrors the cutting
blade, so complex shapes demand a variety of blades and sizes.
	   A marvelous work in the show is a man's cravat in limewood, so
light and airy that it resembles lace. The writer Horace Walpole
had it whitewashed in 1769 and wore it to a reception, where it was
mistaken by a foreign guest as the typical dress of an English
country gentleman.
	   One work that has traveled, loaned by the Pitti Palace in
Florence, Italy, is the Cosimo Panel, a framed mass of carved
fruit, flowers, leaves and objects representing the arts and the
state.
	   King Charles II commissioned it from Gibbons as a gift in 1682
to the Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo III of the Medici banking dynasty.
	   The panel is regarded as Gibbons' supreme masterpiece and has
survived partial burial in mud during the Florence flood of 1966
and being singed by from a fireball in a gas explosion at the Pitti
in 1984.
	   Esterly's skills have grown so much that he was commissioned to
replace a Gibbons carving lost in the Hampton Court Palace fire of
1986.
	   ``I thought at first that I'd write a book on Gibbons and I did
start it,'' he says. ``But then I realized I couldn't unless I
understood what he did, so I bought some limewood and chisels and
began, just like that.''
	   An Esterly carving in Gibbons' style in the exhibition _ an
overmantel drop of flowers, fruit and leaves _ shows just how well
he learned.
	   ``He was the greatest British woodcarver, the greatest of all
decorative carvers and the inventor of a style that came to
dominate one of the great periods of British building, the age of
Wren in the last quarter of the 17th century,'' Easterly says of
Gibbons.
	   ``My patrons often don't know about Gibbons, but they like his
form of carving. And that's what I try to do.''

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Al Hirschfeld abhors the spotlight, a strange
aversion for a man who has spent more nights at the theater than he
has at home during his 95 years.
	   Then again, his best work is done in the dark.
	   For nearly three-quarters of a century, the artist has captured
Broadway's most famous faces and the drama and humor of the theater
from his seat in the audience.
	   His influence stretches far beyond Times Square. In the pages of
newspapers and magazines, on posters and billboards Hirschfeld has
chronicled the celebrity culture of the 20th century; from Artur
Rubenstein to Leonard Bernstein; W.C. Fields to Jerry Seinfeld;
Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson to Bob Dylan.
	   It began in 1926 with a doodle. A press agent noticed Hirschfeld
scribbling while watching the French actor Sacha Guitry perform.
The agent told the artist he'd try to place the drawing in a
newspaper if Hirschfeld would put it on clean paper.
	   The image appeared the next day in the New York Herald Tribune.
The following year he was assigned by The New York Times to draw
the comedian Harry Lauder ``in one of his interminable farewell
performances,'' recalls Hirschfeld, who would find his permanent
home in the Times' Arts and Leisure section 17 years later.
	   Constance Rosenblum, the section editor, calls Hirschfeld's
decades of work inspiring. ``His imagination is always vivid, his
hand steady and he always has a sense of humor,'' she says.
	   Inspired by the work of Charles Dana Gibson, whose ``Gibson
Girl'' defined the Edwardian era, and of John Held, who dreamed up
the Flapper, Hirschfeld created his distinctive niche at a time
when mass circulation publications and the art of caricature were
in their heyday.
	   ``You look at him and you think he sprung from the brow of
Zeus,'' said Wendy Wick Reaves, curator of prints and drawings at
the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. ``Actually, it was a
vibrant tradition of which Hirschfeld was a part.''
	   ``He stood out because there was an Art Deco elegance to his
work,'' said Reaves, who assembled a recent exhibit on the
caricature art of the 1920s and 30s, including eight works by
Hirschfeld. ``There was the quality of black playing against white,
and that was quintessentially his own, a sense of movement. He
understands motion. That set him apart.''
	   Hirschfeld's drawings seem to leap from the page: Carol
Channing's toothy grin. The Marx Brothers hamming it up. The cast
of ``Rent'' performing a frenetic ensemble number.
	   ``I just try to find someone's little idiosyncrasies, the ones
that define their character,'' the artist said.
	   He resists the term caricature to define his drawings. ``It's
become demeaning. I never thought a big nose or a big head on a
small body was funny,'' he said, adding that he does not
editorialize. ``I simply put down visually what the playwright
intended. If it captures that, then it's successful.''
	   A trademark is the presence of Hirschfeld's ``Ninas.'' Since the
birth of his daughter Nina 53 years ago, he has woven her name at
least once into every one of his 7,000-plus drawings.
	   ``I did it to herald her arrival on this earth, and I haven't
been able to stop,'' he said. Finding the Nina in a Hirschfeld in
the Times has become a popular Sunday pastime and at one time was
used as a Defense Department training tool. ``The Pentagon used it
to teach pilots how to read maps and spot targets. It's gotten
crazy,'' he said.
	   Reminiscing in the fourth-floor studio of his Upper East Side
townhouse, Hirschfeld says he can't remember a time when he didn't
have a pen in hand.
	   Growing up in St. Louis, he was influenced by an artist who
supported himself drawing price tags for a department store. The
two would sit and sketch the landscape from a levee on the
Mississippi River. ``He told my mother if I didn't get out of St.
Louis I'd be drawing price tags for the rest of my life, too,''
Hirschfeld said.
	   When he was 12, his mother packed up the family and moved them
to New York. ``We had dlrs 5 when we arrived at Grand Central
station and took the Amsterdam Avenue train to the end of the line.
Then we started walking back down (Manhattan island) until we found
a place to rent for dlrs 4 a month,'' he said.
	   His mother, Rebecca, worked in a department store and was the
family's principal breadwinner. His father, Isaac, was a nurturing
parent, he said, but was unable to hold a steady job. He sometimes
picked up day work firing the starting gun for a harness race track
or umpiring baseball games.
	   During his teen-age years, Hirschfeld studied painting and
sculpture at the Art Students League and got his first taste of the
theater at vaudeville shows. He worked in the art department at
Goldwyn Pictures before being named art director at Selznick
Pictures at age 18. Later, he spent a few years at Warner Bros.
	   In 1924, with a dlrs 500 gift from an uncle, he sailed for
Paris, joining the American expatriate colony there where literary
luminaries held forth in the cafes.

	   Gertrude Stein, he recalls, was warm and always offered a good
meal, but Ernest Hemingway ``was a bully. He loved to fight but he
always picked on people half his size.''
	   ``It was a great time to decide what to do with your life,
whether you settle on this,'' he said, gesturing at his cluttered
studio, ``or whether you wanted or open a delicatessen.''
	   His snow-white hair and beard frame deep-set eyes that convey
both the wisdom of a near centenarian and a young man's sense of
wonder. He shared his stories from a vintage barber chair mounted
behind his well-worn oak drafting table. Scattered across the table
are his Venus pencil, India ink, erasers and brushes _ tools to
solve, as he puts it, the problems the blank paper creates.
	   ``This is where I enjoy myself,'' he says. ``I don't play golf.
I don't exercise. I sit here and I draw. That's what I do.''
	   In the just-completed stack of drawings: several private
commissions, including one of the Seinfeld gang.
	   The price for a Hirschfeld piece begins at dlrs 750 for a
limited edition lithograph, according to Nancy Dann of Margo Feiden
Gallery in Manhattan, which represents the artist. Private
commissions start at dlrs 7,500, plus dlrs 1,500 for each
additional person, she said.
	   Hirschfeld goes to the theater three or four times a week,
motoring downtown in his Cadillac with his wife, Louise Kerz, for
opening nights. He married the 61-year-old theater historian in
1996, two years after the death of Dolly Haas Hirschfeld, an
actress and his wife of 51 years. A brief first marriage ended in
divorce.
	   A 1996 feature-length documentary, ``The Line King,'' told about
his life, but in person Hirschfeld does not dwell on the past.
``I'm not interested in what comes next or what was before,'' he
says. ``I'm interested in the here and now.''

	   Dear Mr. President,
	   As I informed the members of the Security Council at the
conclusion of yesterday's meeting, I had decided to address a
letter to President Saddam Hussein. A copy of that letter is
attached.
	   When transmitting my letter through the Permanent Representative

rescind its decisions of 5 August and 31 October and resume full
cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA.
	   I am glad to inform the Council that this morning I received a
positive response to my appeal from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz. I attach an unofficial translation of this response which I
hope the members of the Council will have an opportunity to study
before this afternoon's meeting.
	   I should appreciate it if you would share this letter and its

At The Movies: `Living Out Loud'

 &UR; Eds: film opened in the United States Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Every once in a while, Holly Hunter creates a
stunning performance that reminds a forgetful Hollywood what a
brilliant actress she is.
	   First came ``Broadcast News,'' which brought her an Academy
Award nomination as best actress of 1987. ``The Piano'' in 1993 won
her the big prize. Now there's ``Living Out Loud,'' a refreshingly
original comedy that should find her once more in Oscar contention.
	   Richard LaGravenese, known as adapter of well-known novels
(``Beloved,'' ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``The Bridges of Madison
County''), directs his own script for the first time, and the
result proves the value of ace writers interpreting their own
material. The dialogue is crisp and funny. The plot turns are truly
surprising.
	   ``Living Out Loud'' is a romantic comedy seen through a
jaundiced eye. Before the main titles, Judith Nelson (Hunter) and
her neurosurgeon husband (Martin Donovan) are arguing in a posh
restaurant over his repeated philandering. He finally admits he is
in love with another woman and wants to end the 16-year marriage.
	   Judith, who gave up her medical studies after their wedding,
finds herself in an expensive Manhattan apartment without a clue as
to her future. She works as a visiting nurse, dines out dismally
alone. She drinks too much, goes to a nightclub and tries to be
friendly with a blues singer (Queen Latifah), who rebuffs her and
later becomes a friend and confidante.
	   Pat Francato (Danny DeVito) has his own set of concerns. His
daughter has died, his wife has left him after 25 years, and the
loan sharks are circling with demands for repayment. He is reduced
to running the night elevator at Judith's apartment.
	   At first the pair ignore each other. Slowly they become
acquainted, and they sympathize with each other's problems. Pat
wants to carry the relationship a step farther, but Judith resists
any commitment.
	   The conclusion is not what you'd expect, but that is true of
most of ``Living Out Loud.'' Example: One of the loan sharks'
agents calling on Pat for payment is not a ``dees-and-dem'' hood,
but a well-spoken young man in a tuxedo.
	   The actors seem to be taking delight in such an inspired script.
Miss Hunter wins the audience from the start. DeVito, whose Jersey
Films produced the film, shows what a versatile actor he is. Miss
Latifah, playing a character named Liz Bailey and displaying the
warmth of the late Pearl Bailey, sings and acts equally well.
	   The New Line Cinema Films release was produced by DeVito,
Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher. Running time: 93 minutes.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Virgin Queen is back, but you may not
recognize her, because the new film ``Elizabeth'' cuts a
revisionist historical swath through a well-worn patch of Britain's
past.
	   Part modern woman ahead of her time, part a sleepy-eyed and not
always willing sovereign, Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth I isn't quite
like any queen yet to be put on screen.
	   As it happens, she's the first of two Elizabeth Tudors filmgoers
will encounter this season, with the ginger-haired Blanchett's
spindly, parched ruler existing at a mighty remove from the
matronly, aspish monarch played by Judi Dench in ``Shakespeare in
Love.''
	   It could be argued that it's both the strength and liability of
the British-made ``Elizabeth'' to wear its desire-to-be-different
on its sleeve.
	   The movie is never without interest as it traces one cunning and
violent intrigue after another in a court rank with malice and
sweat. But it's also too self-conscious in its desire to leave most
English costume dramas, well, in the closet.
	   Certainly, few doublet-and-hose movies feature such an
international spread. The director, Shekhar Kapur, was born and
raised in India, and was a Hindi cinema mainstay before making his
name in the West four years ago with the controversial ``Bandit
Queen.''
	   Blanchett and co-star Geoffrey Rush (an Academy Award-winner for
``Shine'') are Australian, while the supporting cast includes such
disparate figures as former French soccer star Eric Cantona, French
screen actress Fanny Ardant and England's own Sir John Gielgud, in
a wry cameo as the pope.
	   A multinational cast working for a multiethnic creative team is,
of course, laudable, and just one of the ways in which the
modernity of ``Elizabeth'' cannot be impugned. The problem is that
it co-exists with a showy, highly resistible artiness that may put
off as many moviegoers as it attracts.
	   One minute the screen blurs and bleeds to white; the next Kapur
indulges in a horror movie technique or two that suggest a corseted
equivalent of ``Halloween.''
	   The fact is, there's already enough inherent drama in the story
of Henry VIII's daughter who, in 1554 England, has seen Catholicism
die along with her father.
	   Half-sister Mary (a tremulous Kathy Burke, from ``Nil by
Mouth'') is on the throne _ however briefly _ and Elizabeth is
taken to the Tower, accused of treason despite her supposed
allegiance to the faith.
	   Soon Mary is dead, and Elizabeth, at age 25, accedes to power,
surrounded by various intimates, cronies and traitors _ Rush's cool
and disdainful confidant, Sir Francis Walsingham, among them.
	   ``I do not like wars; they have uncertain outcomes,'' says
Elizabeth, but they forever rage around her, whether as internecine
squabbles within the court or sizable rebellions from the French
and Spanish camp.
	   As Michael Hirst's script sees it, Elizabeth's story is a
journey toward confidence _ from the so-called ``bastard queen''
spat upon near the start to the celebrated Virgin Queen who gives
up her lover (Joseph Fiennes' bland Robert Dudley, Earl of
Leicester) and even her hair on the way to projecting a new self as
the Gloriana of legend.
	   The movie seems intended as a star-making role for Blanchett,
who co-starred with Ralph Fiennes in last year's little-seen
``Oscar and Lucinda.''
	   Like its star, ``Elizabeth'' is smart and savvy and more than a
shade too knowing. If it weren't so determined to be cool, it might
even generate some heat.
	   ``Elizabeth'' is produced by Alison Owen, Eric Fellner and Tim
Bevan, the last of whom gets a mention in the credits for playing
``handsome man.'' Running time: 124 minutes.

Yoko Ono opens the vaults for a peek into how John Lennon worked

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Yoko Ono's office in the Dakota, a landmark
apartment building, resembles a well-stocked library.
	   File cabinets, carefully labeled to mark career phases for her
and John Lennon, are stacked to the ceiling. The top ones can only
be reached by ladder. Correspondence is sorted into boxes _ one
with simple fan mail, another with requests for items to be
auctioned for charity.
	   Ono is nothing if not meticulous, and she sits on a treasure
trove of musical and historical memorabilia. Confronted with the
sudden loss of a spouse, many people angrily throw away reminders.
That never entered Ono's mind after Lennon was shot and killed
outside the Dakota in December 1980.
	   ``I would feel very bad if someone had done that,'' she says.
``Being an artist and a musician myself, I would not like to have
seen that happen to my work.''
	   If anything, she worries that people think she hoards her
husband's work. For fans, though, her decisions made possible ``The
John Lennon Anthology,'' a four-CD, 94-track compilation of
outtakes and curios from the former Beatle's solo career. It was
released this month, along with a single-CD distillation.
	   The project does for Lennon's solo career what the three-volume
set of ``Beatles Anthology'' discs did for the band.
	   Seven floors up from the office, the 65-year-old Ono sits in the
kitchen of the apartment she shared with Lennon. Her hair is teased
into a punk rocker's fashionable disarray. She's a few days away
from a European trip to attend a display of the provocative art
that first intrigued Lennon.
	   Newspaper clippings from son Sean's musical career are taped to
the wall.
	   She talks about the difficult job of putting the box set
together, emotional work that sometimes left her in tears.
	   ``I really think this has more justification to come out than
the Beatles anthology,'' she says, ``because John was a
communicator on the level of influencing the direction of society.
Of course, the Beatles did that, too, with John's leadership. John
went a step forward with that in his solo career. Instead of
thinking of entertaining people, he was thinking of awakening
people.''
	   The material includes different versions of songs that appeared
on Lennon albums, home recordings that showed the evolution of his
work, some live cuts and oddities. Toddler Sean sings ``With a
Little Help From My Friends'' on one home recording, and his dad
briefly fumbles to name the song he wrote with Paul McCartney.
	   Some of the material had been heard on the radio program, ``The
Lost Lennon Tapes,'' but until now none was officially released on
disc.
	   Many of Lennon's most inspired recordings came on first takes,
even though he knew they weren't polished enough to release, Ono
says. Several of those versions, such as ``Working Class Hero,''
are in the anthology.
	   ``I almost feel that the takes in this box are even better than
the Capitol takes,'' she says. ``It really shows John and his
intensity.''
	   Ono's collaborator, Rob Stevens, presented her with 100 hours of
prospective material that had to be whittled to five. She wanted
each CD to reflect a specific time in Lennon's life and how his
mind was working, so each has its own theme.
	   ``Ascot'' is material mostly recorded in England when Lennon
made his first two solo albums; ``New York City'' spans Lennon and
Ono's years as political radicals; ``The Lost Weekend'' is from
their brief separation; and ``Dakota'' came when he emerged from
being a house husband to make his final recordings.
	   Ono says her first criterion in deciding what to release was
``would John be ashamed of this track?'' Stevens was better able to
hear the songs as a fan, and persuaded Ono to include things she
might have overlooked, like recordings Lennon made for two songs he
wrote for Ringo Starr, ``I'm the Greatest'' and ``Goodnight
Vienna.''
	   One hilarious inclusion is a tape of Lennon's dialogue with the
eccentric producer Phil Spector while they were recording an album
of rock 'n' roll remakes. The hyper Spector talks nonsense
throughout the sessions. Lennon takes it politely at first, grows
increasingly irritated and finally explodes in expletive-laced
frustration. ``Shut up!'' he shouts.
	   ``John was not a very easy person to deal with at that point,''
Ono says. ``He had broken up with me and was going on a binge. I
thought it was important to put that out because it was a precious
piece of history _ two geniuses trying to work together, and
they're not particularly good at working together.''
	   Lennon subjects old friends like McCartney and Bob Dylan to some
musical mockery. During a pause in recording, he starts singing his
old partner's song. ``Yesterday, I'm not half the man I used to
be,'' he sings. ``'Cause I'm an amputee.''

	   He also takes on Dylan, then in his Christian phrase, with a
satirical response to ``Gotta Serve Somebody.'' Lennon's advice:
``Serve Yourself.''
	   Lennon adopts Dylan's wheeze for a wordy political parody: ``The
official Soviet newspaper said the temple members had protested the
mindless arms race and the filthy war in Vietnam and were
persecuted and finally forced to seek refuge in another country.
	   ``Oh wow,'' Lennon sings, ``sounds like a ballad to me.''
	   Ono expects to be criticized for releasing the parodies, but
says she was trying to illustrate Lennon's dark British sense of
humor.
	   ``I wanted to show John in a three-dimensional manner, rather
than just as a flat goody-goody John, because he was human,'' she
said. ``If it was just tacky, I wouldn't have put it out.''
	   Essays Ono wrote for the anthology are as revealing as the
music. She recounts a painful episode from a dinner party in the
early 1970s, when a drunken Lennon pulled a woman into a bedroom
for sex. Ono and other guests could hear them from the next room.
	   She discusses her almost businesslike breakup from Lennon, the
trigger for his infamous ``Lost Weekend,'' and tells how they
reunited after a friend brought her _ against her wishes _ to an
Elton John concert where Lennon performed.
	   It's clear she's still hurt by the ``Yoko broke up the Beatles''
school of thought among some fans. She met Lennon in 1966, married
him in 1969, and the Beatles broke up within a year. The passage of
time, and her devotion to her husband's legacy, haven't wiped away
the bitterness.
	   She writes that ``even now, I think there are people who still
cannot reconcile themselves to the idea that I had been in John's
life. To those people, I'd like to say, I'm sorry that we had hurt
you. But that's what happened.''
	   Her radar is tuned to any potential slight. She gently chides a
reporter for asking if she believes John would have been happy to
see this material made public. Such a question, she says, is
``another Yoko special'' that wasn't put to the other Beatles when
John's songs were released on those anthologies.
	   ``The Beatles can do anything, they're not going to question
it,'' she says. ``But anything I do, they're going to question.''
	   For the record, she thinks he'd like it.
	   ``I don't feel that I did something that John would not have
approved of,'' she says. ``I sincerely believe that one day I'm
going to meet him, and then what am I going to say?''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Slasher movies seemed to be entering a new
golden age. ``Scream'' was crisp and witty, self-referential and
terrifying. ``Scream 2'' was even better. ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer'' was a textured tale of lost innocence and the
consequences of lying, masquerading as a slice-and-dice film.
	   Then things derailed this fall with the awful ``Urban Legend.''
Now, quality's death knell sounds in ``I Still Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' less a sequel than a pasty-pale imitation of the
original with the action moved to a tropical island.
	   Where ``I Know'' was filled with echoes of post-adolescent
broken dreams and recriminations, ``I Still Know'' is a parade of
dismemberments, disembowelments and eviscerations, bound by the
thinnest of plots _ and the dubious tension of wondering whether
the two young stars will survive to jiggle another day.
	   Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who at the end of the first
movie seemed to be poised to die at the hands of murderous
fisherman Ben Willis (Muse Watson), is inexplicably back at college
a year later, studying at summer school and still haunted by the
memory of the previous two July Fourths. On the first, she and
three friends, speeding on a mountain road over a beach,
accidentally hit a fisherman. They thought they had killed him. But
as they dumped him into the sea to hide the deed, he awoke.
	   Exactly a year later, the fisherman, Willis, came back and,
armed with an ice pick and dressed like the Gorton's fisherman,
started killing people in the small fishing town of Southport,
North Carolina. (Why are they ALWAYS small towns? Don't the hapless
urban teens of, say, New York or Chicago deserve their share of
getting picked off violently?) He almost got Julie and her sometime
boyfriend, Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr., eerily reminiscent of a
Norman Bates-era Tony Perkins), but they managed to do him in. Or
did they?
	   ``I Still Know'' finds Julie heading _ thanks to a radio contest
_ to a remote island of the Bahamas with her new bestest friend,
Karla Wilson (Brandy), Karla's boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) and
Julie's wannabe boyfriend Will Benson (Matthew Settle). The
vacation is for ... THE JULY FOURTH WEEKEND. Hello!
	   Brief wrap-up: They get there, odd characters abound, a storm
comes, the island gets cut off, mayhem ensues, blood spills, the
dark figure in the rain slicker reappears, heroines crawl around in
increasingly revealing poses. Is it Ben Willis, back from the
grave? Or somebody else _ a mimic of the original killer? Hmmm.
That would be innovative.
	   With obligatory killer's-eye-view shots and quasi-Hitchcockian
oblique angles, ``I Still Know'' is a technically sound, if
unoriginal, movie. There's nothing really wrong with it except that
it isn't very good. It is, though, somewhat muddled if you haven't
seen the first film.
	   Hewitt is the archetypal horror-movie stalkee _ vivacious,
vulnerable, tough and resourceful when threatened. She's not bad,
given her material, though at times the contorted dialogue handed
her is laughable. Same story for Brandy and Settle. Only Phifer's
wisecracks crackle, and it's mostly in the delivery.
	   Estes (Bill Cobbs), the mysterious, Scatman Crothers-like
bellman, is a fun addition whose character seems to develop, then
abruptly stops. It's hard to evolve creatively when your blood is
spilling all over the proscenium.
	   The shrouded killer is simply the latest in a line that includes
Michael Myers of ``Halloween,'' Jason Voorhees of ``Friday the
13th'' and Freddy Krueger of ``Nightmare on Elm Street.'' What
these guys need is a therapy group; Jason could benefit from
exploring Freddy's inner psycho.
	   When ``I Still Know'' winds down, we're left with questions: How
does the fisherman guy see to kill when his face is covered by a
slicker hat? Why does Julie, terrified that a murderer is on the
deserted island, don blinders and headphones and get into a tanning
bed? And the perennial: Why do people keep leaving each other
alone?
	   Finally, movie ends. Sun comes out. Some people are dead, some
aren't. Save your dlrs 8. Rent ``Scream,'' ``Scream 2'' and the
pre-''Still'' ``I Know What.'' And pray that someone else doesn't
find out what they did last summer; it might mean another movie.
	   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' a Columbia
Pictures/Mandalay Entertainment release, is directed by Danny
Cannon from a Trey Callaway script.

At the Movies: `Meet Joe Black'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Movie opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Media mogul Bill Parrish, a full life behind him
and his 65th birthday just ahead, finds himself in an odd
situation: He's staring Death in the eye. And when Death stares
back, it bears an uncanny resemblance to Brad Pitt.
	   That, in a nutshell, is ``Meet Joe Black,'' a sweet, whimsical
tearjerker of a modern fable that makes an admirable dash for
excellence but falters just short of the cinematic finish line. Yet
that takes nothing away from its capacity to make you think.
	   Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is alone in his Manhattan office when
he is seized by chest pains (an unexpectedly terrifying scene). He
hears a voice _ a voice he soon learns is that of Death (Pitt), who
has knocked off an earnest young lawyer and taken over his body.
Seems he wants to experience life; Bill, he believes, is his best
bet. Parrish names him Joe _ Joe Black.
	   ``You're not death,'' Parrish scoffs at first. ``You're a kid in
a suit.''
	   But he's quickly convinced, and Bill and Joe's excellent
adventure begins. Joe follows Bill everywhere _ to family meals, to
board meetings, to everywhere but the bathroom. Parrish, though,
has a tough time taking orders from anyone but has little choice.
As long as Death is entertained, Parrish stays alive. There's
nothing evil or extorting about this; Death is simply doing his
job.
	   There's another catch. Joe begins to fall for Bill's daughter,
Susan (Claire Forlani). Bill doesn't much like this; sure, he's
been lecturing Susan on the importance of passion and being carried
away, but the prospect of her dating Death is, well, a little much
even for him.
	   Pitt, in an uneven but ultimately satisfying performance,
effectively neuters Death by turning it into an earthly male
ingenue. His Joe Black is alternately loving and callous,
benevolent and poised on the edge of tantrum. He has existed
forever, yet in our world he is a child. Because of the way he
soaks up the humanness of those around him, this movie, loosely
based on the old play and film ``Death Takes a Holiday,'' might
well be titled ``Death Tastes Peanut Butter'' or ``Death Learns to
Tie a Tie.''
	   Hopkins specializes in making distant men human
(``Shadowlands,'' ``Remains of the Day,'' ``The Edge''), and this
film is no exception. Parrish is a good man who has lived well, but
he still has something to learn: being more expressive. Under his
impending death sentence, he finds out how.
	   Through no fault of Hopkins, however, his character suffers from
lack of conflict. Bill Parrish is _ it's hammered home repeatedly _
a benevolent, wonderful human being. He's fighting to preserve his
legacy and say his good-byes, but beyond that the script leaves
little room for self-examination and progress.
	   Attention to human mannerism and meticulous pacing that mirrors
life itself help this movie. But while the message may be that life
is too short, ``Meet Joe Black'' certainly isn't. It's nearly three
hours _ much of it replete with meandering hyper-Mametian dialogue.
	   A competent supporting cast helps. Forlani, an expressive young
actress, seems forever trapped in the heartbreaking limbo between
happiness and tears. Jeffrey Tambor (HBO's ``The Larry Sanders
Show''), as Bill's son-in-law Quince, perfects his sad-sackery with
a deeper, more interesting version of his usual ne'er-do-well.
Marcia Gay Harden as Allison, Bill's other daughter, provides an
interesting contrast to Susan. And Jake Weber is appropriately oily
as Drew, Bill's business associate.
	   An actress named Lois Kelly-Miller almost steals the film with a
cameo as an elderly Jamaican woman who desperately wants Death to
take her. In the process, she offers Joe a glimpse into life's real
meaning. ``We're lonely here mostly, too,'' she says. ``If we're
lucky, maybe, we got some nice pictures to take with us.''
	   That's a good message for what is an exceptional movie in many
ways. But in the end, ``Meet Joe Black'' needed just a bit more
tension and conflict to be truly extraordinary.
	   ``Meet Joe Black,'' a Universal Pictures release, is directed
and produced by Martin Brest (``Midnight Run,'' ``Scent of a
Woman'') from a screenplay by Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno and Kevin
Wade and Bo Goldman.

Where have all the new plays gone? Off-Broadway, of course
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY328 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL KUCHWARA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Drama Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It has been a barren fall on Broadway for new
plays, but off-Broadway has blossomed with new and diverse work.
	   Among the subjects: trailer-trash killers; a bittersweet
May-December romance; a cancer-stricken college professor; faded
high school heroes; a goofy Hollywood-inspired courtship.
	   In the last two months, at least five new plays have attracted
enthusiastic audiences off-Broadway, creating a theater jam as
producers scramble to extend runs or transfer their shows to larger
houses.
	   On Broadway, only ``Side Man,'' a jazz memory play now starring
Christian Slater, has managed to open and survive _ after its
success last spring off-Broadway and a summer run at the Roundabout
Theater Company.
	   ``It's no surprise that the venue for new American plays has
changed,'' says Darren Cole, producer of ``Killer Joe,'' one of the
season's biggest hits. ``Off-Broadway is cheaper.''
	   Look at the costs. ``Killer Joe,'' a violently funny black
comedy by Tracy Letts starring Scott Glenn and Amanda Plummer,
opened in October at the 200-seat Soho Playhouse for dlrs 300,000.
On Broadway, the same show would cost between dlrs 1 million and
dlrs 1.5 million.
	   The play, featuring Glenn as a laconic hired gun, is sold out
through Jan. 2, with an extension likely into March _ and possibly
a bigger theater if Cole can find one.
	   The sold-out sign also is up at ``Wit,'' a first play by
Margaret Edson about an acerbic English professor dying of ovarian
cancer. The unlikely drama and its star, Kathleen Chalfant, have
received some of the best reviews of the season. A five-week run at
Manhattan Class Company's tiny 99-seat theater was extended once,
twice, then indefinitely. Now the group's executive director,
Bernard Telsey, is eyeing a Broadway transfer.
	   ``It's been an explosion, despite the difficult subject
matter,'' Telsey says. ``Our phones ring from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. But
it has been more than good reviews. We have terrific word-of-mouth
and audiences get a chance to see a new star.''
	   A Broadway move also could be in the cards for ``This Is Our
Youth,'' Kenneth Lonergan's drama about three wealthy yet drifting
teen-agers on New York's Upper West Side.
	   Producer Barry Weissler, responsible for the huge success of
``Chicago,'' has nurtured ``This Is Our Youth'' for two years since
its off-off-Broadway premiere by the New Group. He was waiting for
the pieces to fall into place.
	   ``It took so long because parts of the whole were irreplaceable
_ cast members were off making films, the right theater wasn't
available, the director was doing something else,'' Weissler says.
``We finally accepted a much smaller space, just to get the ball
rolling.''
	   ``This Is Our Youth'' is now on view at the nonprofit Second
Stage, where, according to Weissler, it can remain indefinitely,
although he wants a Broadway theater in an effort to broaden the
audience for the play.
	   ``The Old Settler,'' by John Henry Redwood, has all the
ingredients of what used to be called an audience show.
Theatergoers cheer this touching tale of 1940s Harlem and its two
heroines, middle-aged sisters played by Leslie Uggams and Lynda
Gravatt. One falls for a naive young man and the results are
anything but happy. A run at the 99-seat Primary Stages has been
extended through Jan. 2, and producers Eric Krebs and Anne Squadron
are scouting for a new home after that.
	   ``Duet,'' a product of the minuscule Adobe Theater Company, has
been the quirkiest hit to emerge this fall. A two-week smash last
season off-off-Broadway, the play attracted the high-profile
Dodgers producing team from Broadway to help finance its dlrs
200,000 move to the Actors Playhouse for a commercial run.
	   The comedy, concocted by company members Gregory Jackson and
Erin Quinn Purcell, bills itself as a romantic fable. It is a geeky
love story, done up _ on a shoestring _ and filtered through a
giddy movie-romance sensibility.
	   ``We felt we had to grab the brass ring and get more
visibility,'' says Adobe's producing director Christopher Roberts.
``Besides, the Actors Playhouse is a little gem. We are an
interactive theater, and the space allows us to interact with the
audience.
	   ``Adobe is not trying to become a commercial theater,'' he says.
``It is hard to make a buck on a play like this, although right now
we running at least until January _ and maybe after that. We are
just trying to be the best 175-seat theater we can be.''

	   ``Bruce Springsteen: Tracks'' (Columbia) _ Bruce Springsteen
	   I have seen rock 'n' roll past, and its name is ``Bruce
Springsteen: Tracks.''
	   Springsteen, on the cusp of his induction to the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, unleashes a four-CD collection of unreleased and
obscure material _ 66 songs that stretch from his 1972 Columbia
audition to an August 1998 home studio recording.
	   It's an impressive legacy, chronicling The Boss' evolution into
arguably the best songwriter of the last 25 years. ``Tracks'' also
cements the E Street Band in rock's pantheon of great bands, and
gives anxious fans more material in one shot _ 56 unreleased songs,
10 B-sides _ than Springsteen has released in the last decade.
	   The set opens with Springsteen, accompanied only by his guitar,
playing four songs at his audition. That convinced legendary talent
scout John Hammond that Springsteen was something special.
	   The first two discs confirm his opinion as Springsteen hones his
craft. Lyrics appear, disappear, reappear; ideas float from song to
song, many of them showing up later on Springsteen classics like
``Backstreets,'' ``Night'' and ``Badlands.''
	   The music becomes tighter, the range impressive _ from looping
jams like 1973's ``Thundercrack'' to elegant tracks like 1982's
``Wages of Sin.''
	   The E Street Band, in various lineups, adds its distinctive
thump throughout. Disc three is more fun with Bruce and the band,
from the self-mocking ``TV Movie'' to the epic ``Frankie.''
Springsteen also provides a harrowing acoustic version of ``Born in
the U.S.A.'' that ignores its future incarnation as an arena
anthem.
	   The fourth disc _ tracks from the '90s _ lacks the sonic punch
of the E Street material, most likely because a two-man band of
Springsteen and Roy Bittan did many of the songs.
	   But there are gems there, too: the rockers ``Leavin' Train'' and
``Seven Angels,'' Springsteen's falsetto on ``Sad Eyes,'' the E
Street reunion on ``Back in Your Arms,'' the poetry of ``Brothers
Under the Bridge.''
	   Rock 'n' roll future? Who knows? Springsteen is as likely to
return to his ``Tom Joad'' troubadour persona as to jam with the
old band. But this box set makes it clear that his past speaks
quite eloquently for itself.
	   _ By Larry McShane, AP National Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Is This Desire?'' (Island) _ P.J. Harvey
	   Polly Jean Harvey describes wreckage wrought by romance on ``Is
This Desire?'' and it's not a scene for the fainthearted.
	   Harvey's first four albums won her enormous critical acclaim but
only a cult following, and ``Is This Desire?'' makes few
concessions to commercial considerations.
	   The Englishwoman's unique postmodern bedroom blues is built on
raw, stark arrangements with thunderous drums, droning synthesizers
and distorted guitars. The more melodic moments recall Sinead
O'Connor's marvelous early albums, and Harvey enhances the edgy
mood with dramatic dynamic shifts, alternating between a whisper
and a roar.
	   She rocks out on ``The Sky Lit Up'' and ``A Perfect Day Elise,''
and ``The Garden'' is reminiscent of the more accessible Suzanne
Vega. But Harvey's flirtations with the mainstream don't last long,
and inevitably her sexual angst brings the party down. On the
ironically titled ``Joy,'' she sings: ``Joy was her name/A life
unwed/30 years old/Never danced a step.''
	   Harvey's songs _ many sung in the third person _ focus on
loneliness, desperation and failed quests for fulfillment. The last
verse of ``Beautiful Leah'' sums up the sorrow and hits like a
thunderclap: ``It never leaves my mind/The last words she said/'If
I don't find it this time/then I'm better off dead.'''
	   Such bleak but moving music makes ``Is This Desire?'' perhaps
Harvey's best record yet, and that's saying a lot.
	   _ By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Nu Nation Project'' (Gospo Centric) _ Kirk Franklin
	   Kirk Franklin, one of contemporary gospel music's most
successful and controversial performers, borrows even more heavily
from the secular music world on his fourth album, ``The Nu Nation
Project,'' featuring his long-time choir, The Family.
	   Franklin knows the criticism he has attracted for fusing funk,
hip-hop and rhythm 'n' blues-style grooves with his religious
message: The album begins with Franklin ``on trial'' for his
musical sins.
	   Actually, if anything, Franklin should be taken to task for the
disc's misguided first song, ``Revolution.'' His attempt to
rock-rap gospel, or whatever he was attempting, doesn't work.
	   He gets back on track with the next song, a ``Lean on Me''-''We
Are the World''-like ode that sings in generalities about looking
above for help in times of trouble. Proceeds from the song will go
to help rebuild burned churches. While the track, featuring Bono,
R. Kelly and Mary J. Blige among others, isn't exactly riveting, it
is sweet and simple enough to enjoy.
	   The strongest songs, though, are the ones that tap the roots of
traditional gospel, such as ``Something About the Name Jesus,''
``He Loves Me'' and ``You Are.'' These singles demonstrate
Franklin's true strength as a top-rate songwriter who knows how to
blend singers and melodies to create stirring, inspirational tunes.
	   Still, Franklin does well by mixing contemporary beats with the
gospel message. On ``Praise Joint (remix)'' when the choir shouts,
``Get your praise on!'' _ altering the phrase, ``Get your groove
on,'' Franklin manages to make you want to dance while keeping in
mind what the message is all about.

	   In the spotlight: Bo Derek, she's a 10
	    &UR; The Image: a gorgeous blonde, her hair braided in cornrows,
sprints slo-mo across the beach. The scene is from the movie,
``10,'' and the beautiful blonde is actress Bo Derek.
	    &UR; Personal Stats: She was born Mary Cathleen Collins in Long
Beach, California, on Nov. 20, 1956. She was the oldest of four
children. Her father worked in sales, advertising and public
relations, which often involved promoting motorcycles, sailboats or
surfboards. He sometimes asked his beautiful daughter to model for
these promotions.
	   Miss Derek met her husband, actor-director John Derek, when she
was 16. At that time, he was married to actress Linda Evans. They
were introduced by an agent who thought the teen-ager might be the
right actress for Derek's next film.
	   She got the part _ and the director. They wed in 1974 after she
turned 18.
	    &UR; An instant sensation: Then came Blake Edwards' 1979 film,
``10,'' and her role as the object of Dudley Moore's fantasies. She
became an instant sex symbol. ``I was 21, I was unknown, not
planning to be an actress,'' she says.
	   Her husband's reputation as a Svengali stuck, despite her
protests. He was credited with masterminding her role, which
created a rage for her cornrow hairstyle and made ``She's a 10''
part of the language.
	   There was controversy when Derek directed his wife in
``Bolero,'' which ran into trouble over the extent of the sex
scenes as well as ridicule of lovemaking that reportedly provoked
audiences into fits of laughter. Miss Derek was the producer; her
husband was also the screenwriter.
	   Derek also directed his wife in ``Tarzan the Ape Man'' and
``Ghosts Can't Do It,'' both of which she produced.
	    &UR; Enduring marriage: Their marriage survived the derision that
greeted their films. After her husband's death earlier this year,
Miss Derek returned to acting. Her TV series, ``Wind on Water,''
was canceled after only a few episodes.
	    &UR; Quote: ``The strangest part about being alone now is making
decisions for myself, which I've never really done. I was 16, still
living at home, when I met John. So I've never really been on my
own, even to decide what I want for dinner, or what I'm going to do
tomorrow.''
	   Celebrity birthdays Nov. 15-21:
	   Nov. 15: Actor Ed Asner is 69. Singer Petula Clark is 66. Actor
Sam Waterston (``Law and Order'') is 58. Singer Frida of ABBA is
53. Singer Janet Lennon of The Lennon Sisters is 52. Actress

Malaysian PM reiterates contempt of currency trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Sunday reiterated his disdain of foreign currency
speculators, blaming them for much of the global financial crisis.
	   Mahathir, opening the two-day APEC Business Summit on the
sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, called on
the developed industrial powers to play a more active role in
stabilizing volatile exchange rates.
	   ``Government of powerful countries just cannot abdicate their
roles in determining the exchange-rate mechanism,'' Mahathir told
some 1,000 chiefs of the world's largest corporations. ``They owe
it to their peoples and their countries to accept the
responsibility for determining the exchange rate.''
	   Mahathir estimates that his small Southeast Asian nation has
lost dlrs 150 billion in market capitalization in the past 20
months.
	   ``Currency speculation and the rapid flow of investment capital
in and out of countries may be compatible with globalization,'' he
said. ``But we have seen how much harm they can do to the economies
of the developing countries.''

Anna Sui glams up Fashion Week
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Everyone check your attitude at the door.
Designer Anna Sui is in the house, and she's rockin'.
	   Sui brought a burst of energy to Fashion Week, which was missing
the excitement of Betsey Johnson (she showed her spring '99
collection in London); Isaac Mizrahi, who recently closed his
fashion business; and Todd Oldham, who is concentrating on his
jeanswear.
	   Bill Blass, Ralph Lauren and Geoffrey Beene delivered. So did
Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs, just back from the European shows.
	   But where was the fun?
	   Remember last spring, when Johnson cartwheeled down the runway
at the end of her show?
	   Sui rocked the house with ``Baby's on Fire'' pounding through
the tents at Bryant Park. Her show attracted rockers, street kids
and fashionistas. Spectators were dressed in always-chic black. But
they were also dressed in sleeveless T-shirts and denim, and
lavishly embroidered coats, as worn by designer Vivienne Tam, who
showed her collection in September.
	   Supermodel Naomi Campbell opened the show in ultra-short
embroidered denim shorts and blue crochet feather halter. The
shorts were cut way-up-to-there _ and then some. Karen Elson closed
it, wearing silver-studded ultra-short shorts and a beaded halter
top, her hair dyed a brilliant faux red.
	   In between, a gaggle of gorgeous supermodels strode forcefully
down the runway in embroidered jackets, ponchos and peasant shirts;
wide-legged rapper pants and tight denim jeans; a sequined bolero
jacket with beaded fringe shorts; and a purple iridescent foil
jacket and bra with black chiffon sequined pants.
	   Sui caught the glam rock fever from Todd Haynes' new film,
``Velvet Goldmine,'' which recalled the '70s British rock era. Toni
Collette, one of the stars of the film, was spotted headed
backstage after the show.
	   The following evening, London-based designer Julien MacDonald
created his own stir with designs that left nothing to the
imagination. Black light, a DJ and glow-in-the-dark jewelry helped
create the atmosphere.
	   Metallurgical was the theme. Among his designs: a tiny gold
tinsel bikini; a sleeveless top decorated with shards of wood,
paired with a micro-mini knit skirt; a dress made of neon light
tubing; another dress fashioned with gigantic sequins.
	   Could _ would _ anyone wear these clothes?
	   MacDonald, dressed in flowing black robes, said backstage that
he didn't expect anyone to wear the designs. The show, he said, was
for fun and atmosphere.
	   ``I made my money in London. I made my fun in New York,'' he
said.
	   Earlier in the week, street kids flocked to a space in Chinatown
to see the spring collection by Daryl Kerrigan, a k a Daryl K. What
they saw were frayed skirts and denim jeans; a denim shrunken
jacket and cropped pants; and a red zebra stretch bikini.
	   Music was supplied by a DJ and break dancers opened the show.
The collection included a graffiti-patterned T-shirt that spelled
out Daryl (backward).
	   As for celebrity spotting: Lauren Holly and Lara Flynn Boyle
were in the front row at various shows. Also at the tents: Puff
Daddy, singer Vanessa Williams and actresses Debi Mazar and Ashley
Judd. At Cynthia Rowley's show, Matthew Modine and dancer Paula
Abdul were in front-row seats, while singer Cyndi Lauper was
spotted backstage.

Herbie Hancock: exploring Gershwin's world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY352, AP Graphics CELEB HANCOCK &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES J. GANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Herbie Hancock got more than he expected when
Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder joined him one night at a Los
Angeles studio to record tracks for the pianist's new album.
	   The album is ``Gershwin's World,'' a tribute marking the
centennial of the birth of George Gershwin, one of America's most
popular 20th-century composers.
	   Mitchell and Wonder _ while celebrated for putting their own
stylistic imprints on their original songs _ are seldom thought of
as interpreters of older standards. But on this Gershwin tribute,
Hancock decided to cast convention aside.
	   Hancock happened to call Mitchell after she had sung a Duke
Ellington tune with an orchestra in Canada, and she was looking to
do more standards.
	   ``Actually, I was skeptical at first because I couldn't really
hear in my ear Joni's voice singing these pieces because they were
so different from the kinds of pieces I was constantly hearing her
voice on,'' Hancock recalled.
	   ``But she started singing this Duke Ellington piece on the
phone. ... and I was floored by hearing her sing this way. ... And
she told me that this is what she originally used to do before she
started her professional career. She was always listening to jazz.
... Her own music doesn't give her a chance to demonstrate much of
the lyrical quality of her voice.''
	   On ``Gershwin's World'' (Verve), released in October, Mitchell
recasts herself as a sultry jazz chanteuse on ``The Man I Love,''
with lyrical accompaniment from Hancock and Wayne Shorter on tenor
saxophone. ``Summertime'' adds Wonder's bluesy harmonica to the
accompaniment.
	   Originally, Wonder was brought in only to play harmonica because
Hancock assumed he couldn't work out the contractual details to
have him sing. But in the early morning hours, as they worked out
an arrangement for ``St. Louis Blues,'' Wonder started making
suggestions, singing fragments to illustrate his point.
	   ``It sounded so perfect. ... that we finally got the courage to
ask him about singing,'' Hancock said. ``He gave a little start and
started joking about it in a way, but we could tell he was serious
and we worked it out.
	   ``We thought we'd get a take or two if we're lucky, but Stevie
worked until 8 o'clock that morning. He really put his heart and
soul into it. He gave take after take of just excellent stuff.''
	   Such contributions make ``Gershwin's World'' stand out among the
many recorded tributes celebrating the composer's birthday. He was
born on Sept. 26, 1898.
	   ``I didn't want to just play Gershwin pieces and maybe just make
the voices more modern,'' said Hancock. ``I've been there, done
that. I felt at this point in my life I'm not so interested in
doing things that are straight because anybody could do that.''
	   While Hancock's piano is a constant thread linking the 14 tracks
from the opening percussion-driven ``Fascinating Rhythm'' to his
closing solo version of ``Embraceable You,'' only a handful feature
him with a standard jazz combo.
	   There is a mix of young jazz lions: saxophonists Kenny Garrett
and James Carter, and Hancock's peers, Shorter and Chick Corea. But
the musicians also include African percussionists, with the Orpheus
Chamber Orchestra supplying classical string arrangements, and
opera diva Kathleen Battle providing soaring wordless vocals on
Gershwin's ``Prelude in C Minor.''
	   Hancock also expanded ``Gershwin's World'' by including works by
musicians who either influenced Gershwin or were influenced by him.
Gershwin drew inspiration from blues popularizer W.C. Handy,
represented here by ``St. Louis Blues,'' and Harlem stride pianist
James P. Johnson, whose ``Blueberry Rhyme'' is turned into a
rollicking piano duo matching Corea and Hancock.
	   Maurice Ravel _ a personal friend of Gershwin _ incorporated
jazz elements into his ``Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in G,''
and in performing its second movement, Hancock takes up the
challenge of improvising on what Ravel originally wrote. In
choosing Ellington's ``Cottontail,'' Hancock included one of the
many jazz standards based upon the chord changes to Gershwin's ``I
Got Rhythm.''
	   ``There are only two basic forms in jazz,'' said Hancock, in a
telephone interview from Birmingham, Ala., during a break in his
tour with the reunited Headhunters, his seminal 1970s jazz fusion
band. ``There's the blues, which wasn't written by anyone in
particular, and there's rhythm changes, which were written by
George Gershwin.''
	   What makes Gershwin so enduring, Hancock said, is that he was
``a man of great courage and vision,'' who wrote music that stood
on top of various genres, from Tin Pan Alley to jazz and classical.
	   ``There's a depth of feeling and heart in Gershwin's music that
reaches a deeper part of your life and grabs you,'' he said.
``That's why over the years his music has sustained its
popularity.''
	   Hancock, 58, is a worthy heir to the Gershwin tradition. He was
classically trained as a youth, and at 11, performed Mozart with
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In the 1960s, he blossomed into one
of the most influential jazz pianists and composers of his
generation, both through his recordings as a leader and as a member
of Miles Davis' legendary quintet.
	   Then in the '70s, Hancock put his mark on pop music with the
Headhunters, whose mix of Sly Stone-inspired funky rhythms and
electronic sounds are being sampled by today's hip-hop generation.
The first two Headhunters albums are now available on CD as part of
Columbia/Legacy's ``Classic Fusion'' series.
	   Hancock's current contract with Polygram allows him to record
for its jazz, pop and classical labels. He also recently launched
his own record label, distributed by Verve. The first release,
``Return of the Headhunters,'' puts a '90s spin on the original
group's jazz-funk style.
	   Now, with his own signature label, Hancock hopes to expose new
talent without regard to musical genre.
	   ``What I have in mind is not to limit it to jazz. ... but to be
a vehicle for artists I stand behind and feel have a great
potential musically.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Felipe's goal in the 69th minute gave the
Brazilian club Vasco da Gama a 1-0 victory over D.C. United in the
first leg of the Interamerican Cup.
	   United, the first U.S. team ever to play in the annual two-leg
championship between the CONCACAF and South America's club
champions, couldn't capitalize on several good scoring chances in
Saturday night's game.
	   A crowd of 26,216 _ the largest at RFK Stadium this season _
turned out for United coach Bruce Arena's final home game. Arena,
recently named coach of the U.S. national team, ends his three-year
tenure with the Interamerican Cup.
	   Vasco da Gama's ``home'' leg is scheduled for Dec. 5 in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.
	   United was playing for the first time since losing to the
Chicago Fire Oct. 25 in the U.S. Major League Soccer championship
game. D.C. captured the first-ever MLS titles in 1996 and 1997.
	   The Rio de Janeiro club was playing its fourth game in 10 days
and didn't arrive in Washington until Friday afternoon after
playing Thursday night in Brazil.
	   Vasco da Gama was scheduled to leave Washington at 3 a.m. Sunday
for a 16-hour flight to Japan where they will train for the current
world club championship, the Toyota Cup.
	   After meeting European Cup winner Real Madrid, Vasco da Gama
will fly back to the United States for the Interamerican Cup second
leg.
	   Felipe, a 21-year-old rising star on the Brazilian national
team, scored Saturday's only goal on a brilliant left-footed shot
from about 25 yards (meters) out.
	   United missed a great opportunity in the first half when Roy
Lassiter couldn't muster anything on an open shot from about 10
yards (meters).

Irwin, Morgan advance to semifinals in seniors event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALM DESERT, California (AP) _ Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan moved a
step closer to a season-ending confrontation, advancing to separate
semifinal matches in the inaugural Senior Match Play Challenge.
	   Irwin, professional golf's top money winner this year with dlrs
2.86 million in earnings, will face David Graham in one semifinal
at Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert on Sunday.
	   Morgan, second to Irwin in earnings and wins this year, will
face Bob Charles in the other semifinal. The winners of the morning
semifinals will meet in the afternoon finals.
	   Irwin beat Bruce Summerhays 2 and 1 Saturday, while Morgan
advanced with a 3 and 2 win over Dana Quigley.
	   Charles, the field's oldest player at 63, rallied to beat
Bighorn resident and co-owner Jim Colbert 2 and 1, while Graham
never trailed in his 2 and 1 victory over Jay Sigel.
	   Charles and Graham are surprise semifinals, considering they
entered the 16-player, three-day event seeded 14th and 12th,
respectively.
	   Summerhays led Irwin by a hole through seven holes, then hit a
shot to just six feet from the pin on the par-3 eighth. But
Summerhays halved that hole with Irwin, and Irwin won the next
three holes to take the lead for good.
	   ``You don't expect me to bite on that, do you?'' Irwin said when
asked about the possibility of facing Morgan in the finals. ``I'm
not looking past David Graham.''
	   Morgan built a 3-up lead after nine holes against Dana Quigley,
then held off a late surge for his victory. Unlike Irwin, Morgan
admitted a final against Irwin would offer some intrigue.
	   ``If I get to the finals, it would probably be a little bit of a
grudge match, the two of us having gone back and forth this year,''
Morgan said. ``There is a little bit of pride on the line.''

U.S. military facility key issue in Japanese gubernatorial election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters on Japan's southernmost island began casting
ballots Sunday in a closely-watched gubernatorial race pitting an
incumbent opposed to the U.S. military presence in Okinawa against
a challenger who is more flexible on the issue.
	   Governor Masahide Ota, supported by Japan's largest opposition
party, hopes to win a third four-year term. Main challenger Keiichi
Inamine is the candidate of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   The central issue of the campaign involves the implementation of
a 1996 U.S.-Japan agreement to move a U.S. Marine Corps facility
from a crowded Okinawan city to a more remote location.
	   Aimed at easing the American military burden on Okinawa, the
centerpiece of the accord calls for the closure of Futenma Air
Station in five to seven years as long as a suitable replacement is
built elsewhere.
	   The government has proposed building a floating heliport off the
coast of Nago, a central Okinawan city north of the capital of
Naha. But Ota, 73, wants the facility moved to another part of
Japan or outside the country entirely.
	   The 65-year old Inamine backs a plan calling for the military
heliport to be incorporated into a new airport in northern Okinawa
which would also be open to civilian air traffic.
	   In February, a supporter of plans to build the floating heliport
narrowly won a mayoral election in Nago.
	   Two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are concentrated
on Okinawa, which accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's total
land area. Longstanding opposition to the military presence in
Japan exploded in 1995 when three U.S. servicemen raped a
12-year-old Okinawan girl.
	   The polls will close at 8:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) Sunday and the
results were not expected to be announced until late the same day
or early Monday, Kyodo News agency reported.

Newspaper: Israel working on biological weapon that targets Arabs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israel is trying to identity genes carried only by
Arabs that could be used to develop a biological weapon that would
harm Arabs but not Jews, the Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper attributed its report to unidentified Israeli
military and Western intelligence sources. It said Israeli
scientists are working to create a genetically modified bacterium
or virus that only attacks people who carry certain genes.
	   The paper said the weapon is seen as Israel's response to the
threat of chemical and biological warfare from Iraq and could be
spread by air or through the water supply.
	   The newspaper said the program is based at the biological
institute in Nes Tziyona, which it described as the main research
facility for Israel's chemical and biological weapons. According to
the report, researchers have pinpointed ``a characteristic in the
genetic profile of certain Arab communities, particularly the Iraqi
people.''
	   The idea of such research has provoked controversy in Israel
because of parallels with the genetic experiments at Auschwitz by
Nazi scientist Dr. Josef Mengele during World War II, the paper
said.
	   ``Morally, based on our history, and our tradition and our
experience, such a weapon is monstrous and should be denied,''
Israeli parliament member Dedi Zucker is quoted as saying.
	   Officials at Porton Down, Britain's biological defense facility,
said such weapons were theoretically possible, the newspaper said.

Australians warned not to travel to Indonesia as violence erupts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australians were advised Sunday not
to travel to Indonesia due to social unrest which has resulted in
the deaths of at least 14 people during the past two days of
massive anti-government protests.
	   Separately, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would
raise the issue of the turmoil in planned bilateral talks with
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``I will be very keen to get his assessment of what is happening
in Indonesia,'' Howard said before departing Sunday for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia.
	   Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued an
advisory that Australians defer all nonessential travel to
Indonesia because of the turmoil in the Southeast Asian country.
	   It also cautioned all Australian citizens in Indonesia to remain
vigilant and take safety precautions.
	   ``They should keep themselves closely informed of developments
and in particular avoid large gatherings or demonstrations, which
may have the potential to turn violent without warning,'' the
advisory said.
	   ``The situation could deteriorate,'' it added.

Albright uses APEC meetings to criticize Iraq's position

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told officials from China and other countries Sunday that
American forces are poised to attack Iraq, after rejecting its
proposal to resume weapons inspections.
	   Albright, who arrived in Malaysia late Saturday to attend a
summit meeting on Asia's economic crisis, spent the night
discussing the U.S.-Iraq standoff on the telephone with top
American and U.N. officials, said her spokesman, James P. Rubin.
	   On Sunday, she began a series of meetings with top officials at
the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to explain
the U.S. position. ``We are poised to act and we see no need for
further warnings,'' Rubin said at a news conference.
	   During the first of her bilateral meetings, Albright told her
Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, that Iraq must back down, Rubin
said. Tang agreed that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is responsible
for the current crisis, said Rubin. But he did not say whether the
Chinese would support air strikes.
	   Albright would use her meetings with APEC officials to emphasize
that Saddam's offer to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume
their inspections contained too many conditions, Rubin said.
	   An Iraqi letter, addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
linked a resumption of inspections with ``a further chance to
achieve justice by lifting sanctions'' that the world imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Rubin called the letter ``a demand we regard as unacceptable.''
	   Albright also will use her trip to Malaysia to discuss the Asian
economic crisis and to meet with the wife of former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired, then jailed and put on trial
after launching a reform movement opposing the leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamed, Rubin said.

Malaysian prime minister regrets Clinton cancellation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN COSTELLOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The prime minister of Malaysia
said Sunday he regretted U.S. President Bill Clinton's cancellation
of his trip to Kuala Lumpur for a Pacific Rim summit.
	   If Clinton had come, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said with
apparent sarcasm, the American leader could have checked for
himself the accuracy of a news report that Malaysia is beset by
instability.
	   Clinton called off the trip to Malaysia because of the weapons
showdown with Iraq. He's sending Vice President Al Gore instead.
	   ``I regret very much that he has not been able to come. If he
had come, he would have been able to verify whether the Herald
Tribune reported correctly or not,'' Mahathir told reporters.
	   A recent item in the International Herald Tribune reported on
riots and instability in this Southeast Asian nation of 22 million
people. Mahathir routinely insists that foreign news reporting is
biased against Malaysia.
	   On Saturday night, 3,000 protesters took the streets of Kuala
Lumpur, demanding Mahathir's resignation.
	   The prime minister also took aim at Clinton over the standoff
with Saddam Hussein that's keeping the president in Washington.
	   ``I'd always hoped we could settle such problems with
negotiations,'' Mahathir said. ``Iraq is not an easy country, but
lobbing bombs and grenades will not do anything to solve this
problem.''
	   Another prominent member of the Malaysian government shrugged
off Clinton's cancellation.
	   Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the host government
``feels it is better'' if Clinton were to attend the summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   ``However, if Clinton has problems at home and cannot attend, it
does not matter,'' Badawi told the official news agency Bernama.
	   On Saturday, Badawi said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright should not meddle in Malaysia's internal affairs by
meeting with the wife of the country's ousted No. 2 official, Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   The Malaysian government was already annoyed that Clinton had
decided to skip the traditional private meeting with Prime Minister
Mahathir because of concerns about the imprisoned Anwar.
	   Malaysia has sided with Japan in Tokyo's trade agreement
standoff with the United States.
	   As a result of the various disagreements, Clinton could have
faced several awkward moments with the Malaysian hosts of the APEC
summit.
	   ``Even without the presence of Clinton, the APEC summit will go
ahead as scheduled,'' Badawi said. Vice President Gore will be
meeting with the leaders of 20 other Pacific Rim countries.

	   14 November 1998
	   Excellency Peter Burleigh
	   President of the Security Council
	   Your Excellency,
	   Upon instructions from my Government, I would like to reaffirm
what I have already told you during our meeting this evening that
the letter dated 14 November 1998 from Mr. Tariq Aziz, Deputy Prime
Minister of Iraq, to the Secretary-General included an annex
containing the views and preferences of the Iraqi Government about
the substance of the comprehensive review. These views are not
linked to the clear and unconditional decision of the Iraqi
Government to resume dealing with UNSCOM and IAEA.
	   I will be grateful if you could bring this letter to the
attention of the members of the Council and distribute it as a
document of the Security Council.
	   Best regards,
	   Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon

Canadian leader reiterates support for a U.S. strike against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
reiterated Sunday that his nation would support a decision by the
United States to take military action against Iraq.
	   ``I don't know whether there will be an attack against Iraq,''
Chretien told journalists during a visit to Singapore. But if the
U.S. decides to strike, ``Canada will back them up,'' he said.
	   The U.S. was preparing for air strikes against Iraq after the
White House on Saturday rejected as unacceptable an Iraqi offer to
permit international inspections of its suspected weapons sites.
	   ``Iraq is fooling around,'' Chretien said of the eleventh-hour
proposal from Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein.
	   The proposal, addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
links any renewed probe for weapons of mass destruction on Iraqi
soil with a request to lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Canadian leader was visiting Singapore ahead of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit meeting to be held
in neighboring Malaysia.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 50 people were missing after
a ferry with an estimated 160 passengers and crew on board sank off
Indonesia's Sulawesi island, local police and news reports said
Sunday.
	   The boat, KMP Rahmat Buhari went down Friday night in Bone Bay,
about 1,530 kilometers (956 miles) northeast of the Indonesian
capital city of Jakarta.
	   The 2,000-ton vessel had been on a routine trip from Bajoe in
South Sulawesi to Kolaka in the neighboring province of Southeast
Sulawesi, said Rachman, an officer at the local sea police station.
	   Rachman said 110 people, including an Austrian tourist, were
rescued by three other nearby ferries.
	   He identified the Austrian, who has been evacuated to Kolaka, as
Mag Hauser Markys of Wattans, Austria.
	   Kompas newspaper quoted Lt. Col. Edi Permadi, chief of the local
police as saying the ferry sank in rough seas after developing
engine trouble.
	   A search was still underway early Sunday, but so far no dead
bodies has been found, Rachman said.

	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ Michel Trudeau, son of former
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was missing and presumed
drowned after an avalanche swept him and fellow skiers into a lake,
police said Saturday.
	   Trudeau, 23, was with three friends who were caught in the snow
slide in British Columbia's Kootenay Mountains on Friday.
	   The three others were picked up by helicopter Saturday after
they made their way to shore. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
said Trudeau was last seen in the water and described the chances
of finding him alive as ``very slim.''
	   ``It would appear he wasn't able to get to shore,'' said Cpl.
Randy Koch.
	   The former prime minister, who held power from 1968 to 1984
except for a nine-month gap, has two other sons, Sacha and Justin.
He and his wife, Margaret, are divorced.
	   The area where the accident occurred is popular with back
country skiers, and there have been avalanche fatalities in the
past. In January, six skiers were killed in an avalanche not far
from the site of Friday's accident.

Streets of Indonesian capital quiet after riots and protests

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Troops and armored personnel carriers
guarded the presidential palace and other key sites in the
Indonesia's capital city on Sunday in the wake of rioting and
anti-government protests that left at least 16 people dead.
	   Civilians patrolled neighborhoods, some of them closed off with
barricades of trash carts and barbed wire, amid fears of an
escalation of the mob violence that tore through parts of Jakarta
on Saturday.
	   The unrest was the worst in the capital since May, when much
heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat former President
Suharto after three decades in power.
	   There were no fresh reports of rioting early Sunday.
	   The widespread social unrest erupted after two days of deadly
clashes between security forces and students protesting for swifter
democratic change.
	   Mobs burned several cars and buildings, looted shops, and
attacked police who fired tear gas and warning shots but were
largely unable or unwilling to quell the rioters.
	   Assailants on a toll road leading to the international airport
stopped cars and robbed their drivers.
	   On Sunday, shopkeepers swept up broken glass from smashed
windows that recently had been repaired after the May riots. The
doors to shopping malls were boarded up, but some street markets
were open.
	   Warning of the possibility of more unrest, Australia urged its
nationals not to travel to Indonesia. Many foreign embassies told
their citizens to stay off the streets.
	   Students planned to resume protests Monday against President
B.J. Habibie, a onetime protege of Suharto who is promising
democratic reforms but is suspected by opponents of maneuvering to
stay in power.
	   Several times in recent days, thousands of protesters have
converged near or at Parliament, which is under heavy guard. Police
have patrolled the grounds behind barbed wire coils.
	   Student rallies turned into battles with security forces during
a meeting of the nation's highest legislative body, which agreed to
hold parliamentary elections next year and take other steps to undo
Suharto's authoritarian legacy.
	   However, the People's Consultative Assembly decided to gradually
reduce the military's role in politics, rather than ban it
altogether. The armed forces has 75 seats in the 500-member
Parliament.
	   After riot officers shot and killed students with plastic
bullets on Friday, mobs and protesters vented their fury at the
military, shouting taunts and hurling stones at military vehicles.
Three security personnel were among the dead.
	   Ignoring calls to quit, Habibie appeared on national television
Saturday to urge calm.
	   He accused protesters of wanting to overthrow his 6-month-old
government and ``endanger the unity of the nation and the people.''
	   At an emergency Cabinet meeting, Habibie ordered his military
chief, Gen. Wiranto, to restore order _ even though critics hold
him responsible for the student deaths.
	   The riots were likely to further diminish investor confidence in
the world's fourth-most populous nation, which was hit hard by
Asia's financial meltdown and is still fighting its worst economic
crisis in decades.
	   Some of the buildings burned on Saturday were in Jakarta's
Chinatown, which was badly hit by the rioting earlier this year,
when 1,200 people were killed.
	   The ethnic Chinese minority, which is prominent in business, is
often targeted during times of civil unrest in Indonesia.

APEC officials resume trade negotiations despite Clinton no-show
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to update with comments about Clinton's
cancellation, other details; changes byline

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Top officials from Pacific Rim
countries forged ahead with trade negations Sunday despite the
cancellation of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   Clinton had been scheduled to leave late Saturday for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but decided to send Vice
President Al Gore in his place so he could deal with the Iraq
crisis at home.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he regretted
Clinton would not attend the APEC summit, telling reporters he
would have liked the American president to see for himself that the
streets of the capital were calm.
	   Some 3,000 protesters held a demonstration late Saturday
demanding an end to Mahathir's 17-year rule and chanting, as they
marched toward the hotel where the U.S. delegation is staying,
``Clinton, save us from Mahathir!''
	   Protesters have been calling for Mahathir's ouster since he
fired and later jailed his one-time protege, Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir, addressing a meeting of international business leaders
attending a meeting on the sidelines of the APEC forum, took aim at
Clinton over the standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I'd always hoped we could settle such problems with
negotiations,'' Mahathir said. ``Iraq is not an easy country, but
lobbing bombs and grenades will not do anything to solve this
problem.''
	   Some other top officials said they hoped the U.S.-Iraq showdown
would not overshadow the summit.
	   ``The situation in Iraq could take ... focus away from the
attention that we have on the resolution of the economic crisis in
the region,'' said Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
``Resources could be diverted there, so it affects everybody.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived in
Malaysia late Saturday to attend the APEC summit, told officials
from China and other countries Sunday that American forces were
prepared to attack Iraq, after the United States rejected its
proposal to resume U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We are poised to act and we see no need for further
warnings,'' her spokesman, James P. Rubin, told reporters.
	   Rubin said Clinton regretted he could not attend the summit, but
that the president felt Albright's attendance would show the
importance the United States places on the forum.
	   ``It's a very clear symbol of the importance that we attach to
this kind of meeting,'' Rubin said.
	   Mahathir has had to face many setbacks surrounding the economic
summit that was supposed to showcase his leadership and the
enormous economic progress in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Clinton and several other leaders have refused the customary
courtesy calls on the host of the APEC summit, angered by the
treatment given Anwar.
	   Anwar was sacked and jailed after he led anti-government
protests. He currently is on trial on corruption and sexual
misconduct charges, which he denies and calls politically
motivated.
	   Foreign officials, including Albright, have said they plan to
meet with Anwar's wife to discuss the case.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy invited Anwar's wife to
lunch on Saturday.
	   Also Saturday, officials finishing a statement to be issued by
APEC's leaders hewed closely to a package of proposals from the
United States rather than endorsing Mahathir's calls for currency
controls.
	   The draft of a final communique for the leaders of the 21-member
APEC supported Clinton's proposals to increase social programs to
help millions of Asians plunged into poverty by the steep economic
downturn.
	   It also endorsed Clinton's call for new ways to get financial
assistance to debt-strapped corporations and banks in
crisis-affected countries.
	   Mahathir has blamed Asia's troubles on foreign currency
speculators and the policies of the International Monetary Fund. In
September, he banned trading of the Malaysian currency outside the
country and imposed controls on foreigners trying to pull money out
of Malaysia.
	   The draft APEC statement, however, praised the IMF's handling of
the financial crisis, although the statement conceded that APEC
leaders had not accurately foreseen the severity of the turmoil.
	   ``The challenge before us is to support an early and sustained
recovery of the region, to contain the risks of contagion and
prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, to be issued at the conclusion of the leaders' talks on
Wednesday.
	   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
only section of the document where serious disagreement remained
was the portion dealing with free trade.
	   Foreign and trade ministers of APEC countries hoped to wrap up
discussions in this area on Sunday with a deal slashing tariffs in
nine key industries covering dlrs 1.5 trillion of global trade. But
Japan remained adamant that it could not lower barriers in the
politically sensitive areas of fish and forestry products.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Performers danced an imaginary hunt and a crowd of
several thousand enthusiastically munched on whale meat lunches
Sunday as Japan's dwindling whaling industry rallied for an end to
the international ban on their trade.
	   The rally, supported by the industry and the Japanese
government, was held to coincide with the winding down of the
whaling season around Japan's coasts and the recent departure of
Japanese whaling ships for Antarctic waters.
	   Commercial whaling on the high seas has been banned since 1986.
But a small fleet of Japanese ships continues to kill whales and
dolphins along the nation's coasts, and hundreds of whales are
hunted at sea each year in what the government calls a research
program.
	   Japan's whaling program has often been criticized because meat
from the whales killed for research is sold on the open market,
with proceeds going to the whaling industry.
	   But Japan has stubbornly ignored such opposition. To much
fanfare, the sea-going whaling fleet got its first new ship in 26
years earlier this year, the 720-ton Yushinmaru.
	   That there is still a market in Japan for whale was clear on
Sunday.
	   Everything from smoked whale meat to whale whisker toys were
snapped up by the 3,000 or so people who crowded into Tokyo's main
sumo wrestling arena for the rally.
	   ``I don't see anything wrong with whaling,'' said Masanao Arai,
a whaling company employee who was running a whale meat stall at
the rally. ``It's like anything else _ we don't tell you not to eat
pigs. Don't tell us not to eat whales.''
	   Japanese whaling advocates say there is no scientific basis for
a continued blanket ban on commercial whaling, and cite data
suggesting there could be as many 760,000 minke whales in Antarctic
seas.
	   Annual takes of a few thousand minkes _ the relatively
small-sized species Japanese want to hunt _ would not pose a threat
to their survival, they say.
	   Environmental groups, however, counter that the history of
whaling has been marked by excesses, that stocks of marine mammals
are notoriously hard to count accurately and that whales should not
be hunted because they are intelligent.
	   Japan's official support of whaling _ the government continues
to strongly oppose the International Whaling Commission's
moratorium _ has found little sympathy abroad. But it still has
strong _ and often very emotional _ support at home.
	   ``I have a dog, and I wouldn't think of eating it,'' said Nobue
Kobayashi, a Tokyo office worker who came to the rally because a
friend gave her tickets. ``But some people eat dogs. We should have
a choice to eat whales if we want.''
